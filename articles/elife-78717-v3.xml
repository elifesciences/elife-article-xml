investigating (1) longitudinal reliability at the individual and (2) group level, (3) internal consistency and (4) response predictability across experimental phases. One hundred and twenty individuals performed a fear conditioning paradigm twice 6 months apart. Analyses of skin conductance responses, fear ratings and blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) with different data transformations and included numbers of trials were conducted. While longitudinal reliability was rather limited at the individual level, it was comparatively higher for acquisition but not extinction at the group level. Internal consistency was satisfactory. Higher responding in preceding phases predicted higher responding in subsequent experimental phases at a weak to moderate level depending on data specifications. In sum, the results suggest that while individual-level predictions are meaningful for (very) short time frames, they also call for more attention to measurement properties in the field.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>temporal stability</kwd><kwd>fear conditioning</kwd><kwd>skin conductance response</kwd><kwd>fear ratings</kwd><kwd>BOLD fMRI</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INST 211/633-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lonsdorf</surname><given-names>Tina B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LO 1980/4-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lonsdorf</surname><given-names>Tina B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LO 1980/7-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lonsdorf</surname><given-names>Tina B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reliability and predictability analyses beyond standard measures provide empirically based guidance regarding the design of fear conditioning tasks to assess individual differences and group-level inferences cross-sectionally and longitudinally.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The increasing incidence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Xiong et al., 2022</xref>) and high relapse rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Essau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Yonkers et al., 2003</xref>) of anxiety-related disorders call for a better understanding of anxiety- and stress-related processes which might contribute to improving existing treatments or developing more effective interventions. In the laboratory, these processes can be studied using fear conditioning paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dunsmoor et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fullana et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Milad and Quirk, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In differential fear conditioning protocols (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lonsdorf et al., 2017a</xref>) one stimulus is repetitively paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US; e.g., electrotactile stimulation), and as a consequence becomes a conditioned stimulus (CS+) while another stimulus, the CS−, is never paired with the US. After this acquisition training phase, CSs are presented without the US (extinction training) leading to a gradual waning of the conditioned response. Critically, the fear memory (CS+/US association) is not erased, but a competing inhibitory extinction memory (CS+/no US association) is assumed to be formed during extinction training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Milad and Quirk, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Myers and Davis, 2007</xref>). Subsequently, return of fear (RoF) can be induced by procedural manipulations such as a time delay (spontaneous recovery), a contextual change (renewal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Vervliet et al., 2013a</xref>), or a (re-)presentation of an aversive event (reinstatement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Haaker et al., 2014</xref>). Conditioned responding can be subsequently probed in an RoF test phase during which either the absence (i.e., extinction retention) or the return of conditioned responding (i.e., RoF) can be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bouton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lonsdorf et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>Findings from studies employing fear conditioning paradigms hold strong potential for translating neuroscientific findings into clinical applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Insel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fullana et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Milad and Quirk, 2012</xref>). More precisely, extinction learning is assumed to be the active component of exposure-based treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Graham and Milad, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Milad and Quirk, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Rachman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Vervliet et al., 2013b</xref>) and experimental RoF manipulations have been suggested to serve as a model of clinical relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Scharfenort et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Vervliet et al., 2013a</xref>). Important findings in the fear conditioning field include the deficient learning of the safety signal (CS−) during acquisition training, impaired extinction learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duits et al., 2015</xref>) and the tendency of fear generalization to innocuous stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper et al., 2022a</xref>) in patients suffering from anxiety-related disorders as compared to healthy controls.</p><p>To date, both clinical and experimental research using the fear conditioning paradigm have primarily focused on group-level, basic, general mechanisms such as the effect of experimental manipulations – which is important to investigate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lonsdorf and Merz, 2017b</xref>). Successful clinical translation (e.g., ‘Why do some individuals develop pathological anxiety while others do not?’) and particularly treatment outcome prediction (e.g., ‘Why do some patients benefit from treatment while others relapse?’), however, requires that both the experimental paradigm and the measures employed allow for individual-level predictions over and above prediction of group averages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fröhner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hedge et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lonsdorf and Merz, 2017b</xref>). A prerequisite for this is that the measures show stability within and reliable differences between individuals over time. Hence, tackling clinical questions regarding individual-level predictions of symptom development or treatment outcome requires a shift toward and a validation of research methods tailored to individual differences – such as a focus on measurement reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Zuo et al., 2019</xref>). This is a necessary prerequisite for the long-term goal of developing individualized intervention and prevention programs. This further relates to the pronounced heterogeneity in symptom manifestation among individuals diagnosed with the same disorders (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Galatzer-Levy and Bryant, 2013b</xref>) which cannot be captured in binary clinical diagnoses as two patients with for example a PTSD diagnosis may not share a single symptom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Galatzer-Levy and Bryant, 2013b</xref>).</p><p>Measurement reliability has only recently gained momentum in experimental cognitive research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fröhner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hedge et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Zuo et al., 2019</xref>) and can be assessed through test–retest and longitudinal reliability (i.e., test–retest reliability over longer time intervals, typically assessed through e.g., intraclass correlation coefficients, ICCs, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Importantly, longitudinal reliability (for definitions and terminology, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) also has implications for the precision with which associations of one variable (e.g., conditioned responding) with another (individual difference) variable can be measured because the correlation between those two variables cannot exceed the correlations within, that is the reliability, of these two variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Spearman, 1910</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Definitions of key terms (A) and data specifications applied across analyses (B).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="3">(A)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="5"/></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="3">Term</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="5">Definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" colspan="3"><bold>Internal consistency</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="5">In our study, internal consistency refers to the reliability of <bold>conditioned responding within experimental phases</bold> at both time points, respectively.

To illustrate the difference between absolute agreement and consistency in a short example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Koo and Li, 2016</xref>), consider an interrater reliability study with two raters: Consistency indicates the extent to which the score of one rater (<italic>y</italic>) is equal to the score of another rater (<italic>x</italic>) plus a systematic error (<italic>c</italic>) (i.e., <italic>y</italic> = <italic>x</italic> + <italic>c</italic>).

Generally (details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), individual-level longitudinal reliability of risk ratings, skin conductance responses (SCRs), and fear potentiated startle (FPS) was within the same range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cooper et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Torrents-Rodas et al., 2014</xref>) whereas it was numerically somewhat lower for the BOLD response as compared to different rating types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ridderbusch et al., 2021</xref>). Longitudinal reliability at the individual level appeared higher for acquisition training than for extinction training (SCRs: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fredrikson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Zeidan et al., 2012</xref>), but comparable to generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cooper et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Torrents-Rodas et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, it appeared higher for extinction training than for reinstatement-test (for BOLD fMRI but not ratings: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ridderbusch et al., 2021</xref>) and higher for CS+ than CS− responses (SCRs: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fredrikson et al., 1993</xref>) and CS discrimination (ratings and BOLD fMRI: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ridderbusch et al., 2021</xref>; SCRs: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Zeidan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>However, it is difficult to extract a comprehensive picture from these five studies as they differ substantially in sample size (<italic>N</italic> = 18–100), paradigm specifications, experimental phases reported, outcome measures, time intervals, and employed reliability measures (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Given that the predominance of research on group-level generic mechanisms in fear conditioning research, it is even more surprising that, to our knowledge, no study to date has investigated longitudinal reliability at the group level and only few studies have (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fredrikson et al., 1993</xref>) targeted internal consistency (i.e., the degree to which all test items capture the same construct, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). More precisely, longitudinal reliability at the group level indicates the extent to which responses averaged across the group as a whole are stable over time, which is important to establish when investigating basic, generic principles such as the impact of experimental manipulations. Even though it has to be acknowledged that the group average is not necessarily representative of any individual in the group and the same group average may arise from different and even opposite individual responses at both time points in the same group, group-level reliability is important to establish in addition to individual-level reliability. Group-level reliability is relevant not only to work focusing on the understanding of general, generic processes but also for questions about differences between two groups of individuals such as patients vs. controls (e.g., see meta-analyses of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duits et al., 2015</xref>). Of note, many fear conditioning paradigms were initially developed to study general group-level processes and to elicit robust group effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lonsdorf and Merz, 2017b</xref>). Hence, it is important to investigate both group- and individual-level reliability given the challenges of attempts to employ cognitive tasks that were originally designed to produce robust group effects in individual difference research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elliott et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hedge et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parsons, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Parsons et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>As pointed out above, individual-level reliability is a prerequisite for individual-level predictions such as treatment outcomes. Since the different experimental phases of fear conditioning paradigms serve as experimental models for the development, treatment, and relapse of anxiety- and stress-related disorders, it is also an important question whether responding across phases can be reliably predicted at the individual level. Interestingly, it is often implicitly assumed that responding in one experimental phase reliably predicts responding in a subsequent phase (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Milad et al., 2009</xref>; critically discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lonsdorf et al., 2019a</xref>) even though empirical evidence is lacking. As a result it has been suggested to routinely ‘correct for responding’ during fear acquisition training when studying performance in later experimental phases such as extinction training or retention/RoF test (critically discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lonsdorf et al., 2019a</xref>). However, empirical evidence on this cross-phases predictability (for definition and terminology, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) is scarce to date.</p><p>Evidence from experimental work on cross-phase predictability in rodents and humans is mixed. In rodents, freezing during acquisition training and 24-hrs-delayed extinction training were uncorrelated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Plendl and Wotjak, 2010</xref>) and responding during extinction training did not predict extinction retention (i.e., lever-pressing suppression: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bouton et al., 2006</xref>; or freezing behavior: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Shumake et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, in humans, extinction performance (FPS, SCRs, and US expectancy ratings) did not predict performance at 24-hrs-retention test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Prenoveau et al., 2013</xref>). Yet, a computational modeling approach suggests that the mechanism of extinction learning (i.e., the formation of a new extinction memory trace in comparison to an update of the original fear memory trace) predicts the extent of spontaneous recovery in SCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gershman and Hartley, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Also evidence from work in patient samples is mixed (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Craske et al., 2008</xref>). The extent of fear reduction within therapeutic sessions was unrelated to overall treatment outcome in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kozak et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pitman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Riley et al., 1995</xref>), while others observed an association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Foa et al., 1983</xref>). Similarly, significant correlations of fear reduction between therapeutic sessions with treatment outcome were observed for reported distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rauch et al., 2004</xref>) and heart rate, but not for SCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kozak et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lang et al., 1970</xref>) and for self-reported fear post treatment, but not at follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Foa et al., 1983</xref>). In addition, evidence that responding in different phases is related comes from pharmacological manipulations with the cognitive enhancer <sc>D</sc>-cycloserine which facilitates learning and/or consolidation. <sc>D</sc>-cycloserine promoted long-term extinction retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Rothbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Smits et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Smits et al., 2013b</xref>) only if within-session learning was achieved.</p><p>With this pre-registered study, we follow the call for a stronger appreciation and more systematic investigations of measurement reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Zuo et al., 2019</xref>). We address longitudinal reliability and internal consistency as well as predictability of cross-phase responding in SCRs, fear ratings, and the BOLD response. For this purpose, we reanalyzed data from 120 participants that underwent a differential fear conditioning paradigm twice (at time points T0 and T1, 6 months apart) – with habituation and acquisition training on day 1 and extinction, reinstatement and reinstatement-test on day 2 to allow for fear memory consolidation prior to extinction. Part of the data have been used previously in method focused work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kuhn et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lonsdorf et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lonsdorf et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sjouwerman et al., 2022</xref>) and work investigating the association of conditioned responding with brain morphological measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ehlers et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Specifically, we (1) estimated internal consistency of SCRs at both time points and (2) systematically assessed longitudinal reliability of SCRs, fear ratings and BOLD fMRI at the individual level by calculating ICCs. This was complemented by investigations of response similarity (SCR and BOLD fMRI) and the degree of overlap of activated voxels at both time points (BOLD fMRI) as additional measurements of longitudinal reliability at the individual level that allow for a more detailed picture than the coarser ICCs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for terminology and definitions). We also (3) assessed whether SCR and BOLD fMRI show longitudinal reliability at the group level. Finally, we (4) investigated if individual level responding during an experimental phase is predictive of individual-level responding during subsequent experimental phases. All hypotheses are tested across different pre-registered data specifications to account for procedural heterogeneity in the literature (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>): More precisely, we follow a pre-registered multiverse-inspired approach and include (1) responses to the CS+, CS−, US, and CS discrimination, (2) different phase operationalizations, (3) different data transformations none, log-transformed, log-transformed and range-corrected, and (4) ordinally ranked vs. non-ranked data (for justification of these choices, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We acknowledge that the specifications used here are not intended to cover all potentially meaningful combinations as in a full multiverse study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lonsdorf et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sjouwerman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Steegen et al., 2016</xref>) but can be viewed as a manyverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kuhn et al., 2022</xref>) in which we a priori pre-registered a number of meaningful combinations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>For a comprehensive overview of the different reliability measures used here and of the analyses conducted, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Satisfactory internal consistency</title><p>To assess internal consistency of SCRs, trials were split into odd and even trials (i.e., odd–even approach), averaged for each individual subject and then correlated (Pearson’s correlation coefficient).

For all analyses, we followed a multiverse-inspired approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parsons, 2020</xref>) by taking into account different data specifications.</p><p>Overall, longitudinal group-level reliability was robust for SCRs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and the BOLD response (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2B</xref>) while longitudinal individual-level reliability as assessed by ICCs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>), and individual-level BOLD activation overlap (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2A</xref>) was more limited across outcome measures and data specifications – particularly during extinction training. This is in line with previous work in fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cooper et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fredrikson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ridderbusch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Torrents-Rodas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Zeidan et al., 2012</xref>) reporting figures for longitudinal individual-level reliability comparable to ours across outcome measures (SCRs, fear ratings, BOLD fMRI) and experimental phases. Importantly, however, it remains a challenge to interpret the results as benchmarks for ICCs are derived from psychometric work on trait self-report measures and it is plausible that what is interpreted as ‘low’ and ‘high’ reliability in experimental work should be substantially lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Parsons et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our complementary analyses beyond traditional ICCs indicate that SCRs of one individual at T0 were not more similar to responses of the same individual at T1 than compared to others at T1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For BOLD fMRI, however, acquisition-related individual BOLD activation patterns at T0 were more similar to their own activation patterns at T1 than to other individuals’ activation patterns (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This was, however, not the case for extinction. Hence, this may suggest that BOLD fMRI might be more sensitive to detect similarity at individual-level responses within participants than SCRs in our data – maybe due to the dependence on spatial (i.e., voxel-by-voxel) rather than temporal (i.e., trial-by-trial) patterns.</p><p>Furthermore, we observed a few differences in longitudinal reliability at the individual level depending on data processing specifications (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parsons, 2020</xref>). For most data specifications, reliability was slightly higher for log-transformed and range-corrected SCRs (as opposed to raw and only log-transformed data) while – in contrast to what has been shown for other paradigms and outcome measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2021</xref>; see also <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://shiny.york.ac.uk/powercontours/">https://shiny.york.ac.uk/powercontours/</ext-link>) – an increasing number of trials included in the calculation of ICCs did not generally improve reliability (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">8</xref>). Together, this suggests that longitudinal reliability at the individual level is relatively stable across different data transformations and paradigm specifications (e.g., number of trials within the range used here, i.e., 1 to maximum 14) which is important information facilitating the integration of previous work using different time intervals, reliability indices, and paradigms (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cooper et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fredrikson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ridderbusch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Torrents-Rodas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Zeidan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, we observed quite robust longitudinal reliability at the group level for both SCRs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and BOLD fMRI (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2B</xref>) between both time points with substantial (i.e., up to 90%) overlap in group-level BOLD fMRI activation patterns (whole brain and ROI based) as well as substantial (i.e., up to 76%) explained variance at T1 by variance at T0 for SCRs. However, this was generally only true for acquisition but not extinction training. This pattern of higher reliability during acquisition compared to extinction training has been described in the literature (SCRs: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fredrikson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Zeidan et al., 2012</xref>) and was also evident in the similarity analyses of BOLD fMRI and the group-level reliability of SCRs. While this pattern did not emerge across all analyses, it appears to be particularly present when examining reliability of CS discrimination as it was the case for BOLD fMRI and as it also emerged in individual-level reliability analyses of CS discrimination in SCRs (internal consistency and ICCs) and fear ratings (ICCs). Since CS discrimination is typically lower during extinction as compared to acquisition training, this restriction of variance potentially resulted in a floor effect which might have lowered the internal consistency and longitudinal reliability of CS discrimination during extinction training.</p><p>Reports regarding this discrepancy between group- and individual-level longitudinal reliability were recently highlighted for a number of (classic) experimental paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fröhner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hedge et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Herting et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Plichta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schümann et al., 2020</xref>). Our results add fear conditioning and extinction as assessed by SCRs and BOLD fMRI to this list and have important implications for translational questions aiming for individual-level predictions – particularly since findings obtained at the group level are not necessarily representative for any individual within the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fisher et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In addition to these methods-focused insights, we observed significant associations between responding in different experimental phases for SCR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), fear ratings (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and BOLD fMRI (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) revealing that higher responses in previous phases were generally modestly associated with higher responses in subsequent phases in all outcome measures. However, a remarkable amount of predictions were non-significant – which was particularly true for CS discrimination in SCRs and BOLD fMRI. This may be explained by difference scores (i.e., CS+ minus CS−) being generally less reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Infantolino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lynam et al., 2006</xref>) due to a subtraction of meaningful variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Moriarity and Alloy, 2021</xref>) particularly in highly correlated predictors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Thomas and Zumbo, 2012</xref>). Especially at the end of the extinction, CS discrimination is low and hence, variance limited. Therefore, floor effects may contribute to the non-significant effects for extinction end-point performance.</p><p>Mixed findings in the literature support both the independence of conditioned responding in different experimental phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bouton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Plendl and Wotjak, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Prenoveau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Shumake et al., 2014</xref>) but also their dependence – particularly in clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Foa et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rauch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Rothbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Smits et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Smits et al., 2013b</xref>). These diverging findings in experimental and clinical studies might point toward a translational gap. However, our work may suggest that the strengths of associations between responding in different phases depended on the specific outcome measure and its specifications (e.g., responses specified as CS discrimination, CS+, or CS−). Yet another explanation – in particular for predictions spanning a 24 hrs delay in experimental phases − might be that individual differences in consolidation efficacy (e.g., how efficiently the fear and extinction memories are consolidated after performing acquisition and extinction training, respectively) may underlie differences in predictability. For example, the performance during a retention or RoF test phase is considered to be determined by the strength of the fear and extinction memory, respectively. Memory strength, however, is not only determined by the strength of the initially acquired memory but also by its consolidation (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lonsdorf et al., 2019b</xref>). Thus, as acquisition training preceded the extinction training and reinstatement-test by 24 hrs, it is highly likely that individual differences in consolidation efficacy also impact on performance at test. This has also implications for the common practice of correcting responses during one experimental phase for responding during preceding experimental phases (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lonsdorf et al., 2019b</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, together with our observation of robust internal consistency (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fredrikson et al., 1993</xref>), this pattern of findings suggests that individual-level predictions at short intervals are plausible but might be more problematic for longer time periods as suggested by the limited stability over time in our data.</p><p>Yet, we would like to point out that the values we report may in fact point toward good and not limited longitudinal individual-level reliability as our interpretation is guided by benchmarks that were not developed for experimental data but from psychometric work on trait self-report measures. We acknowledge that the upper bound of maximally observable reliability may differ between both cases of application as empirical neuroscientific research inherently comes with more noise. The problem remains that predictions in fear conditioning paradigms appear to not be meaningful for longer periods of time (~6 months). Thus, a key contribution of our work is that it highlights the need to pay more attention to measurement properties in translational research in general and fear conditioning research specifically (e.g., implement reliability calculations routinely in future studies). To date, it remains an open question what ‘good reliability’ in experimental neuroscientific work actually means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Parsons et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Yet, before discussing implications of our results in detail, some reflections on potential (methodological) reasons for (1) limited individual-level but robust group-level reliability and (2) on the role of time interval lengths deserve attention:</p><p>First, the limited longitudinal individual-level reliability might indicate that the fear conditioning paradigm employed here – which is a rather strong paradigm with 100% reinforcement rate – may be better suited for investigations of group effects and to a lesser extent for individual difference questions – potentially due to limited variance between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hedge et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parsons, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Parsons et al., 2019</xref>). However, high reliability appears to be possible in principle, as we can conclude from the robust internal consistency of SCRs that we observed. This speaks against a limited between-subject variance and a general impracticability of the paradigm for individual difference research. Hence, we call for caution and warn against concluding from our report that fear conditioning and our outcome measures (SCRs, BOLD fMRI) are unreliable at the individual level.</p><p>Second, limited individual-level but robust group-level longitudinal reliability might be (in part) due to different averaging procedures which impacts error variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kennedy et al., 2021</xref>). More precisely, compared to individual-level data, group-level data are based on highly aggregated data resulting in generally reduced error variance which increases group-level reliability.</p><p>Third, different operationalizations of the same measurement might have different reliabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kragel et al., 2021</xref>). For instance, amygdala habituation has been shown to be a more reliable measure than average amygdala activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Plichta et al., 2014</xref>) and more advanced analytical approaches such as intraindividual neural response variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Månsson et al., 2021</xref>) and multivariate imaging techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kragel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Marek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Noble et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Visser et al., 2021</xref> have been suggested to have better (longitudinal) reliability than more traditional analyses approaches. Similarly, methodological advances (e.g., techniques to adjust the functional organization of the brain across participants, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kong et al., 2021</xref>; or hyperalignment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feilong et al., 2021</xref>) in measurement quality and tools may ultimately result in better reliability estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeYoung et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Fourth, as discussed above, caution is warranted as traditional benchmarks for ‘good’ reliability were not developed for experimental work but mainly from psychometric work on trait self-report measures (see above).</p><p>Finally, longitudinal reliability refers to measurements obtained under the same conditions and hence it is both plausible and well established that higher reliability is observed at short test–retest intervals (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Noble et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Werner et al., 2022</xref>). Longer intervals are more susceptible to true changes of the measurand – for instance due to environmental influences such as seasonality, temperature, hormonal status, or life events (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Specht et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Vaidya et al., 2002</xref>). Indeed most longitudinal reliability studies in the fMRI field used shorter intervals (&lt;6 months, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elliott et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Noble et al., 2021</xref>) than our 6-month interval and hence our results should be conceptualized as longitudinal stability rather than a genuine test–retest reliability. The satisfactory internal consistency speaks against excessive noisiness inherent to our measures as a strong noisiness would also be evident in measurements within one time point and not only emerge across our retest interval. Thus, we rather suggest a true change of the measurand during our retest interval and hence a potentially stronger state than trait dependency.</p><p>What do our findings imply? Fear conditioning research has been highlighted as a particularly promising paradigm for the translation of neuroscientific findings into the clinics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Insel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fullana et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Milad and Quirk, 2012</xref>) and some of the most pressing translational questions are based on individual-level predictions such as predicting treatment success. Our results, however, suggest that measurement reliability may allow for individual-level predictions for (very) short but potentially less so for longer time intervals (such as our 6 months retest interval). Importantly, however, robust group-level reliability appears to allow for group-level predictions over longer time intervals. This applies to SCRs and BOLD fMRI in our data but note that the latter was not investigated for fear ratings. A potential solution and promising future avenue to make use of both good group-level reliability and individual-level predictions might be the use of homogenous (latent) subgroups characterized by similar response profiles (e.g., rapid, slow or no extinction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Galatzer-Levy et al., 2013a</xref>) – to exploit the fact that reliability appears to be higher for more homogenous samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gulliksen, 1950</xref>).</p><p>While general recommendations and helpful discussions on the link between reliability and number of trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2021</xref>), statistical power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parsons, 2020</xref>), maximally observable correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parsons, 2020</xref>), sample and effect size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hedge et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parsons, 2020</xref>) considerations exist, our results highlight the need for field and subdiscipline specific considerations. Our work allows for some initial recommendations and insights. First, we highlight the value of using multiple, more nuanced measures of reliability beyond traditional ICCs (i.e,. similarity, overlap, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fröhner et al., 2019</xref>) and second, the relation between number of trials and reliability in an experiment with a learning component (i.e., no increase in reliability with an increasing number of trials). Importantly, our work can also be understood as an empirically based call for action, since more work is needed to allow for clear-cut recommendations, and as a starting point to develop and refine comprehensive guidelines in the future. We also echo the cautionary note of Parsons that ‘estimates of reliability refer to the measurement obtained – in a specific sample and under particular circumstances, including the task parameters’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parsons, 2020</xref>). Hence, it is important to remember that reliability is a property of a measure that is not fixed and may vary depending on task specifications and samples. In other words, reliability is not a fixed property of the task itself, here fear conditioning.</p><p>We argue that we may need to take a (number of) step(s) back and develop paradigms and data processing pipelines explicitly tailored to individual difference research (i.e., correlation) or experimental (i.e., group level) research questions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parsons, 2020</xref>) and focus more strongly on measurement reliability in experimental work – which has major consequences on effect sizes and statistical power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elliott et al., 2020</xref>). More precisely, multiverse-type investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parsons, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Steegen et al., 2016</xref>) that systematically scrutinize the impact of several alternative and equally justifiable processing and analytical decisions in a single dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kuhn et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lonsdorf et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sjouwerman et al., 2022</xref>) – as also done here for transformations and number of trials – may be helpful to ultimately achieve this overarching aim. This could be complemented by systematically varying design specifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Harder, 2020</xref>) which are extensively heterogeneous in fear conditioning research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lonsdorf et al., 2017a</xref>).

Acquisition training was designed as delay conditioning with the US being presented 0.2 s before CS+ offset with 100% reinforcement rate (i.e., all CS+ presentations followed by the US). CSs were two light gray fractals (RGB [230, 230, 230]), 492*492 pixels presented in a pseudo-randomized order, with no more than two identical stimuli in a row, for 6–8 s (mean: 7 s). During the intertrial interval (ITI), a white fixation cross was shown for 10–16 s (mean: 13 s). Reinstatement consisted of three trials with a duration of 5 s each presented after a 10 s ITI. Reinstatement USs were delivered 4.8 s after each trial onset. The reinstatement phase was followed by a 13 s ITI before the next CS was presented during reinstatement-test.

The electrode was attached between the metacarpal bones of the index and middle finger. The US was individually calibrated in a standardized stepwise procedure controlled by the experimenter aiming at an unpleasant, but still tolerable level rated by the participants between 7 and 8 on scale from zero (=stimulus was not unpleasant at all) to 10 (=stimulus was the worst one could imagine within the study context).

For analog to digital conversion, a CED2502-SA was used. Two self-adhesive hydrogel Ag/AgCl-sensor recording SCR electrodes (diameter = 55 mm) were attached on the palm of the left hand on the distal and proximal hypothenar. A 10 Hz lowpass filter and a gain of 5Ω were applied. Data were recorded at 1000 Hz and later downsampled to 10 Hz. Subsequently, SCRs were scored semi-manually using the custom-made computer program EDA View (developed by Prof. Dr. Matthias Gamer, University of Würzburg). The program is used to quantify the SCR amplitude based on the trough-to-peak method with the trough occurring at 0.9–3.5 s after CS onset and 0.9–2.5 s after US onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boucsein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Sjouwerman and Lonsdorf, 2019</xref>).

SCRs confounded by recording artifacts due to technical reasons, such as electrode detachment or responses moving beyond the sampling window, were discarded and scored as missing values. SCRs smaller than 0.01 μS within the defined time window were defined as zero responses. Participants with zero responses to the US in more than two-thirds (i.e., more than 9 out of 14) of US acquisition trials were classified as non-responders on day 1.

After acquisition training and the reinstatement-test, subjects were also asked how uncomfortable they experienced the US itself. All ratings were given on a VAS ranging from zero (answer = none) to 100 (answer = maximum). For analyses, the rating scale was reduced to 0–25.

To this end, longitudinal reliability at the individual and group level indicates to which extent responses within the same individual and within the group as a whole are stable over time. More precisely, whereas longitudinal reliability at the individual level takes into account the individual responses of participants, which are then related across time points, reliability at the group level first averages the individual responses across the group and then relates them across time points. Reliability at the individual level inherently includes the group level, as it is calculated for the sample as whole, but the individual responses are central to the calculation.

Second, while ICCs are interpreted in terms of absolute values using cutoffs that provide information on the quantity of longitudinal reliability, within-subject similarity was compared to between-subject similarity showing if responses of one subject at T0 were more similar to themselves at T1 than to responses of all others at T1. The approach to the assessment of similarity was derived from the idea of representational similarity analysis (RSA) introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kriegeskorte et al., 2008</xref> and previously used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fröhner et al., 2019</xref> for the comparison of fMRI BOLD activation patterns between different sessions.</p><p>Here, within-subject similarity was calculated by correlating (Pearson’s correlation coefficient) (1) individual trial-by-trial SCRs and (2) the first-level response patterns of brain activation for CS discrimination (i.e., CS+ &gt; CS−) of each individual subject between T0 and T1 resulting in one value of within-subject similarity per subject (e.g., SCR acquisition trials of subject 1 at T0 were correlated with SCR acquisition trials of subject 1 at T1). Between-subject similarity was calculated by correlating trial-by-trial SCRs or the first-level response patterns of brain activation of each individual subject at T0 with those of all other individuals at T1 (e.g., SCR acquisition trials of subject 1 at T0 were correlated with SCR acquisition trials of subject 2–71 at T1). This resulted in 70 correlation coefficients for each subject. These correlation coefficients were then averaged to yield one correlation coefficient per subject as an indicator of between-subject similarity.</p><p>For comparisons of within- and between-subject similarity in SCR and BOLD fMRI, similarities were Fisher <italic>r</italic>-to-<italic>z</italic> transformed and compared using paired <italic>t</italic>-tests or Welsh tests in cases where the assumption of equal variances was not met. Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> is reported as effect size.</p><p>Note that within-subject similarities of SCRs could not be calculated for participants with a single non-zero response at the same trial (e.g., trial 1) at both time points or only zero responses to the CS+ or CS− in one particular phase. This is because arrays that include only zeros can not be correlated and correlations of 1 (e.g., resulting from non-zero responses at the same trial at both time points) result in infinite Fisher <italic>r</italic>-to-<italic>z</italic> transformed correlations. Thus, different numbers of participants had to be included in the analyses of SCRs during acquisition (<italic>N</italic><sub>CS discrimination</sub> = 65, <italic>N</italic><sub>CS</sub><italic><sub>+</sub></italic> = 62, <italic>N</italic><sub>CS−</sub> = 56, <italic>N</italic><sub>US</sub> = 71) and extinction training (<italic>N</italic><sub>CS discrimination</sub> = 45, <italic>N</italic><sub>CS</sub><italic><sub>+</sub></italic> = 40, <italic>N</italic><sub>CS</sub><italic><sub>−</sub></italic> = 32).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Overlap at the individual level</title><p>For BOLD fMRI, overlap in individual subject activation patterns across both time points was calculated as a third indicator of reliability at the individual level. Thus, overlap was determined separately for experimental phases by including data from both time points T0 and T1. To this end, activation maps from first-level contrasts (here CS+ &gt; CS or CS discrimination) were compared such that the degree of overlap of significant voxels at a liberal threshold of p<sub>uncorrected</sub> &lt; 0.01 between T0 and T1 was determined and expressed as the Dice and Jaccard coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fröhner et al., 2019</xref>). Both coefficients range from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (perfect overlap), with the Jaccard index being easily interpretable as percent overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fröhner et al., 2019</xref>). While overlap reflects the degree of voxels activated at both time points, similarity measures (see above) are based on the correlation of activated voxels between time points and can be considered a continuous approach based on CS+ &gt; CS− contrast specific beta values and not thresholded T-maps.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Longitudinal reliability at the group level</title><p>As opposed to longitudinal reliability at the individual level which indicates the stability of individual responses across time points, longitudinal reliability at the group level refers to how stable group average responding is over time. Longitudinal reliability at the group level was calculated separately for experimental phases by including data from both time points T0 and T1.</p><p>We define longitudinal reliability at the group level (1) for SCRs as the percentage of explained variance of group averaged trials at T1 by group averaged trials at T0 (i.e., <italic>R</italic> squared) and (2) for BOLD fMRI as the degree of overlap of group averaged activated voxels between both time points. Different analysis approaches were chosen as SCR and BOLD fMRI data are inherently different measures: trial-by-trial analyses in fMRI require slow-event related designs with long ITIs as well as fixed trial orders and ideally partial reinforcement rate to not confound CS and US responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Visser et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, trial-by-trial analyses were not possible given our design and thus overlap at a group level was defined as overlap at voxel rather than at trial level.</p><p>For SCRs, simple linear regressions were computed with group averaged SCR trials at T0 as independent and group averaged SCR trials at T1 as dependent variable and R squared was extracted. This was done separately for experimental phases. Although the Pearson’s correlation coefficient is often calculated to determine longitudinal reliability, <italic>R</italic> squared, which like overlap can also be expressed as a percentage, appears closest to the concept of overlap of significant voxels at T0 and T1 as applied to BOLD fMRI data.</p><p>For overlap in BOLD fMRI at the group level, the degree of overlap of significant voxels between both time points was determined for aggregated group-level activations instead of single subject-level activation patterns (see ‘Overlap at the individual level’) and expressed using the Dice and Jaccard indices as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cross-phases predictability of conditioned responding</title><p>Simple linear regressions were calculated to assess the predictability of SCRs and fear ratings across experimental phases at T0. During data analysis, inspection of the data revealed heteroscedasticity. Therefore and deviating from the pre-registration, regressions with robust standard errors were calculated by using the HC3 estimator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hayes and Cai, 2007</xref>). Two consecutive phases represent the independent and the dependent variable, respectively, with the preceding phase as the independent variable and the following phase as the dependent variable. For SCR and fear ratings, standardized betas as derived from linear regressions are reported. In simple linear regression, as implemented here, standardized betas can be also interpreted as Pearson’s correlation coefficients.</p><p>For fMRI data, we adopted the cross-phases predictability analysis of SCR and fear ratings by calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficients between patterns of voxel activation (i.e., first-level beta maps). Correlations were first calculated at the individual subject level and subsequently averaged.</p><p>Standardized betas (resulting from SCR and fear rating regressions) and correlation coefficients (resulting from BOLD fMRI correlational tests) were interpreted as demonstrating weak, moderate, or strong associations between variables with values of &lt;0.4, ≥0.4, and ≥0.7, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dancey and Reidy, 2007</xref>). Tables containing regression parameters beyond the standardized betas depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref> are presented in the Supplement (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>).</p><p>For SCR and fear rating predictions, we assessed if predictions differ in their strength or direction when they are summarized across certain data specifications (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). For BOLD fMRI, correlation coefficients were pooled across ROIs. <italic>T</italic>-tests or Welch tests in cases where the assumption of equal variances was not met were performed on individual Fisher <italic>r</italic>-to-<italic>z</italic> transformed standardized betas (SCR and fear ratings) or correlation coefficients (BOLD fMRI). We highlight that these analyses can be interpreted as an example for predictive validity (i.e., the extent to which a score on a test predicts a score on a criterion measure). As our aim here is, however, not validation, we use the term cross-phase prediction throughout. (More precisely, we believe that ‘cross-phase predictions’ in our study cannot be used interchangeably with ‘criterion or predictive validity’ since our aim was not to validate one experimental phase against the other. Predictive validity in psychometrics is defined as ‘the extent to which a score on a scale (or test) predicts scores on some criterion measure’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cronbach and Meehl, 1955</xref>). For instance, a cognitive test for job performance would have predictive validity if the observed correlation between the test score and the performance rating by the company were statistically significant. Rather, we investigated whether responses in earlier experimental phases could predict responses in later experimental phases – both of which cannot be expected to ‘measure the same thing’.)</p><p>For all statistical analyses described above, a level of p &lt; 0.05 (two-sided) was considered significant. Since we were more interested in patterns of results and less in the result of one specific test, it was not necessary to correct for multiple comparisons. Moreover, multiverse approaches, as approximated in our study, are assumed to be insensitive to multiple comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lonsdorf et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>For data analyses and visualizations as well as for the creation of the manuscript, we used R (Version 4.1.3;

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Robust group- but limited individual-level (longitudinal) reliability and insights into cross-phases response prediction of conditioned fear&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Drs. Shackman (Reviewing Editor) and Baker (Senior Editor).</p><p>The reviewers highlighted several strengths of the manuscript.</p><p>– We very much liked the paper and appreciate the potentially important implications for the field.</p><p>– This is a very comprehensive and thoughtful effort</p><p>– The approach is thorough, with a range of analysis approaches, including within- and between-subjects similarity, the individual-level overlap of fMRI results, ICCs, and cross-sectional reliability. It is important to determine these values so that researchers can discard incorrect assumptions, such as the belief that threat responses at baseline can be predictive of treatment responses in patient populations.</p><p>– The conclusions of this work are largely supported by the data and methodological approach, and this is a good benchmark for the field.</p><p>– The overall approach is excellent and represents the vanguard of open science practices (preregistration, all materials freely available, documentation of analysis deviations, multiverse analyses, etc.).</p><p>– This comprehensive approach drives home the conclusion that specific analytic choices and researcher &quot;degrees of freedom&quot; can have sometimes drastic effects on fundamental measurement properties. I think this underlines what I view as the key contribution of this manuscript: empirically highlighting the need for the fear conditioning field to pay more attention to measurement properties.</p><p>– Going beyond standard associative measures of reliability (ICCs) is an important contribution of this work, as they allow the authors to comment on nuances of individual-difference reliability that are not possible with the coarser ICCs. In turn, this facilitates researchers in making more informed decisions regarding the design of fear conditioning tasks to assess individual differences.</p><p>– The fMRI results are a particular strength, as fMRI continues to be a common fear conditioning index, yet its measurement properties in this context remain critically understudied. The choice to use standard ICCs in conjunction with similarity approaches is particularly fruitful here, as in conjunction with overlap metrics we now have a much better appraisal of the different components of reliability in fMRI data – and potential explanations for differences between behavioral and fMRI reliabilities.</p><p>– The poor reliability identified by several of these approaches is likely to be of great importance to this large, translational field.</p><p>Nevertheless, several aspects of the manuscript somewhat diminished enthusiasm, as outlined below.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their critiques with one another and the Reviewing Editor, who has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Major Revisions:</p><p>1. Terminology. In terms of aligning with the psychometric and measurement literature, and to assist in clarity, I suggest the authors consistently use established measurement terms whenever possible. For example, &quot;cross-sectional validity&quot; is more often referred to as internal consistency, and the cross-phase predictions are an example of criterion/predictive validity. As the fear conditioning field is relatively new to formal measurement theory, it would be helpful to have everyone &quot;on the same page&quot; as decades of prior measurement work.</p><p>2. Increase Accessibility for a Broad Scientific Audience. We strongly recommend a thorough rewrite of the introduction and discussion. Essentially, the paper needs to be substantially 'dumbed down' to become accessible to the broad readership it deserves. The introduction should start by explaining the rationale for choosing to use fear conditioning methods, why fear conditioning research is so important, and mention some key insights generated by this type of research. (Some of this is included and/or alluded to, but could be clarified further for readers not working with fear conditioning in humans).</p><p>3. Clarify the Study Design. In the introduction, clearly explain the study design and the kinds of the data included in the analyses, both in the text and using a diagram with a visual overview of a typical trajectory (conditioning and extinction phases) either at the individual or group level or both. Ideally include example results of all the kinds included here, SCR, ratings and fMRI data and at both individual and group level, to really give the reader a sense of what's gone into in your analyses. Relatedly: The authors should take care to clearly articulate why they chose to use using 1st point, endpoint and average to investigate cross-phase predictability in the manuscript. Also, why it makes sense to look at raw, log-transformed, ranked, non-ranked data etc.</p><p>4. Clarify the Significance of Individual Differences and Reliability</p><p>a. A bit more explanation for why individual-level measurement is important for addressing clinical individual differences would be appreciated. At present, it is described as important but the &quot;why&quot; is not really fleshed out. For example, content about heterogeneity in clinical presentations requiring individual-level metrics (as opposed to categorical diagnoses) could be useful here.</p><p>b. When explaining the importance of reliability and prediction, please try to give concrete examples. Imagine your reader is an eager but inexperienced grad student who might wish to embark upon fear conditioning research, but has no experience and needs guidance at every level. How many trials to include, what type of measures, how many participants, how large can effects be expected to be – the discussion should clarify how your analyses inform these decisions.</p><p>5. Clarify the Significance of &quot;Group-Level&quot; Reliability. The authors analyze group-level reliability and situate this as being improved in relation to individual-level reliability. I think the authors' explanation for the importance of group-level reliability is not fully fleshed out and at present, it is not clear what new information the field can take from the reported group-level reliabilities. At present there seems to be some circular logic here: group-level reliability is studied because group-level inferences are important, and they are important because they are studied. I am concerned that non-specialist readers might get the wrong impression from this and conclude that fear conditioning is only useful for group-level inference, as well as continue to perpetuate the paradox described so well in Hedge et al., 2018, and others (e.g. work from Russ Poldrack's group).</p><p>6. Internal Consistency Formula. The internal consistency (cross-sectional reliability) calculation used is not well-justified, and potentially needs additional parameters. It is not clear why the authors deviate from the internal consistency calculation described in Parson, Kruijt, and Fox et al., 2019, especially given that these procedures are used for other metrics elsewhere in the manuscript. I request that the authors either use the bias-corrected formula from Parson et al., 2019 or justify the use of the current calculation.</p><p>7. ROIs. For the fMRI analyses, the authors use an ROI approach based on prior studies of fear acquisition and extinction. The majority of the most consistently identified regions (as seen in meta-analyses, Fullana et al., 2016, 2018) are analyzed. However, it is not clear why other regions are omitted, particularly given meta-analytic evidence. Striatal regions and the thalamus are the most notable omissions. Further, a weakness is that functional ROIs in this study were based on peak coordinates from a handful of prior studies, instead of meta-analytically identified coordinates. As such, I do not think the authors present the strongest foundation for making conclusions about the reliability of fear conditioning fMRI Data. I request that the authors include additional ROIs for the canonical fear network, or justify why the particular ROIs that are currently reported were the only ones used. I also strongly suggest using meta-analytic coordinates to determine ROIs for these analyses.</p><p>8. Reliability and the Need for Nuance</p><p>a. The authors structure the manuscript around the premise that reliability is essential in conducting solid individual-differences science, which I agree with wholeheartedly. However, I think the authors rely on relatively arbitrary cut-offs for classifying reliability as good/poor/etc to an extent that is not warranted, particularly in the context of the Discussion, and it takes away from the impact of this effort. As the authors point out, these categorical cut-offs are more guidelines than strict rules, yet the manuscript is structured around the premise that individual-level reliability is problematically poor. Many cut-off recommendations are based on psychometric work on trait self-report measures that usually assume fewer determinants/sources of error than would be seen in neuroscience experiments, which in turn allows for larger ceilings for effect sizes and reliability. The current manuscript does not address this issue and what meaningful (as opposed to good) fear conditioning reliability is when moving away from the categorical cut-offs. In other words, is it possible that the authors actually observed &quot;good&quot; reliability in the context of fear conditioning work, and that this reliability is lower than other types of paradigms is just inherent to the construct being studied?</p><p>b. The framing of the manuscript could be adjusted, such that less emphasis is placed on arbitrary cut-off metrics and more about what these reliabilities mean in the context of fear conditioning paradigms. To be clear, I think the authors already address this to a degree in their Discussion, but perhaps need to go a step further and expand on the challenges of establishing reliability in this field and explicitly address why common cut-offs are perhaps not appropriate.</p><p>c. It may be more appropriate to use numbers rather than labels/benchmarks in the reporting of results in the Results section, i.e. reporting the r-value instead of &quot;poor to questionable&quot; etc.</p><p>9. Clarify Implications and Recommendations. The concrete implications of the research, and recommendations arising from it, should be clearly spelled out in the Abstract and Discussion, for the greatest utility.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78717.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Revisions:</p><p>1.

We use the term longitudinal reliability to provide an umbrella term for test-retest reliability with a long test-retest interval, which we compute through different approaches including ICCs, but also with relatively new reliability measures such as similarity and overlap. With this umbrella term we want to increase the understanding of the different measures and help the reader to keep track of them.</p><p>The term cross-sectional reliability was used to clearly discriminate this measure from longitudinal reliability. We agree, however, that it may be confusing to introduce a new term for internal consistency. In our revised manuscript, we follow the reviewers’/editors’ suggestion and use internal consistency throughout. We have also moved Table 1 to an earlier position in the manuscript as it assists in clarity by providing an overview of the different reliability types and detailed definitions as well as formulas (see also reviewer comment 11).</p><p>However, we do not fully agree with exchanging “cross-phase predictions” with “criterion or predictive validity”, because we do not want to validate one experimental phase against the other. Predictive validity in psychometrics is defined as “the extent to which a score on a scale (or test) predicts scores on some criterion measure” (cf. Cronbach and Meehl, 1955). For instance a cognitive test for job performance would have <italic>predictive validity</italic> if the observed correlation between the test score and the performance rating by the company were statistically significant.</p><p>Rather, we investigate whether responses in earlier experimental phases can predict responses in later experimental phases – both of which cannot be expected to “measure the same thing”. This is of relevance, as in the literature it is often assumed that this is true without strong empirical support due to a lack of available studies on this topic and heterogeneous findings in the literature (see e.g. Lonsdorf et al., 2017, Lonsdorf et al., 2020). We hope the reviewer and editor agree with this reasoning.</p><p>Cronbach, L.J., and Meehl, P.E. (1955). Construct validity for psychological tests.

Increase Accessibility for a Broad Scientific Audience. We strongly recommend a thorough rewrite of the introduction and discussion. Essentially, the paper needs to be substantially 'dumbed down' to become accessible to the broad readership it deserves. The introduction should start by explaining the rationale for choosing to use fear conditioning methods, why fear conditioning research is so important, and mention some key insights generated by this type of research. (Some of this is included and/or alluded to, but could be clarified further for readers not working with fear conditioning in humans).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer/editor for raising these points and have restructured our introduction as suggested as well as edited the discussion accordingly. We hope that with these edits, we have made our manuscript more accessible to a wider audience. As the changes are excessive we refrain from quotes here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Clarify the Study Design. In the introduction, clearly explain the study design and the kinds of the data included in the analyses, both in the text and using a diagram with a visual overview of a typical trajectory (conditioning and extinction phases) either at the individual or group level or both. Ideally include example results of all the kinds included here, SCR, ratings and fMRI data and at both individual and group level, to really give the reader a sense of what's gone into in your analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer/editor for pointing out that the study design and how the data went into our analyses were not sufficiently clear. We added a figure to the methods section which illustrates both the design and the calculations of our different measures. We opted for the calculations for the SCRs as an example because this is the outcome for which all calculations were performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Relatedly: The authors should take care to clearly articulate why they chose to use using 1st point, endpoint and average to investigate cross-phase predictability in the manuscript. Also, why it makes sense to look at raw, log-transformed, ranked, non-ranked data etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer/editor for the suggestion to justify the specifications of our data even more clearly. We have added some explanations and justifications to the footnotes of Table 1 which we have moved to the end of the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Clarify the Significance of Individual Differences and Reliability</p><p>a. A bit more explanation for why individual-level measurement is important for addressing clinical individual differences would be appreciated. At present, it is described as important but the &quot;why&quot; is not really fleshed out. For example, content about heterogeneity in clinical presentations requiring individual-level metrics (as opposed to categorical diagnoses) could be useful here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer/editor for highlighting that this was not sufficiently clear. We added the following paragraph to the introduction:</p><p>“Hence, tackling clinical questions regarding individual prediction of symptom development or treatment outcome requires a shift towards and a validation of research methods tailored to individual differences – such as a focus on measurement reliability (Zuo, Xu, and Milham, 2019). This is a necessary precondition when striving for the long-term goal of developing individualized intervention and prevention programs. This relates to the pronounced symptomatic heterogeneity in symptom manifestations between individuals diagnosed with the same disorders (e.g. PTSD, Galatzer-Levy and Bryant, 2013) which is not captured in binary clinical diagnoses as two patients with the diagnosis PTSD may not share a single symptom (Galatzer-Levy and Bryant, 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. When explaining the importance of reliability and prediction, please try to give concrete examples. Imagine your reader is an eager but inexperienced grad student who might wish to embark upon fear conditioning research, but has no experience and needs guidance at every level. How many trials to include, what type of measures, how many participants, how large can effects be expected to be – the discussion should clarify how your analyses inform these decisions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer/editor that we have not fully exhausted our possibilities to derive recommendations from our findings. We have added a paragraph to the discussion to make explicit what recommendations can be derived from our work and where to go from here. For many of the questions mentioned in the comment, it is very difficult to provide strong empirically-based recommendations from this single study – even though we wholeheartedly agree and share the desire for clear guidance. Our work should be seen as a starting point to develop and refine such guidelines in the future. For instance, we cannot provide any guidance on how large effect sizes can be expected as this is highly dependent on the specific research question and study sample at stake. We, however, provide recommendations wherever possible and a clear outline for future work. We also refer to our previous methods-focused work for guidance (see e.g., Lonsdorf et al., 2017).</p><p>Lonsdorf, T. B., Menz, M. M., Andreatta, M., Fullana, M.

Our work allows for some initial recommendations and insights. First, we highlight the value of using multiple, more nuanced measures of reliability beyond traditional ICCs (i.e,. similarity, overlap, Fröhner et al. (2019)) and second, the relation between number of trials and reliability in an experiment with a learning component (i.e., no increase in reliability with an increasing number of trials). Importantly, our work can also be understood as an empirically-based call for action, since more work is needed to allow for clear-cut recommendations, and as a starting point to develop and refine comprehensive guidelines in the future.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Clarify the Significance of &quot;Group-Level&quot; Reliability. The authors analyze group-level reliability and situate this as being improved in relation to individual-level reliability. I think the authors' explanation for the importance of group-level reliability is not fully fleshed out and at present, it is not clear what new information the field can take from the reported group-level reliabilities. At present there seems to be some circular logic here: group-level reliability is studied because group-level inferences are important, and they are important because they are studied. I am concerned that non-specialist readers might get the wrong impression from this and conclude that fear conditioning is only useful for group-level inference, as well as continue to perpetuate the paradox described so well in Hedge et al., 2018, and others (e.g. work from Russ Poldrack's group).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer/editor for pointing out to us that our justification for researching reliability at the group level fell short. We have made further points as to why we think this is important.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>“To date, both clinical and experimental research using the fear conditioning paradigm have primarily focused on group-level, basic, general mechanisms such as the effect of experimental manipulations – which is important to investigate (Lonsdorf and Merz, 2017).”</p><p>“More precisely, longitudinal reliability at the group level indicates the extent to which responses averaged across the group as a whole are stable over time, which is important to establish when investigating basic, generic principles such as the impact of experimental manipulations. Even though it has to be acknowledged that the group average is not necessarily representative of any individual in the group and the same group average may arise from different and even opposite individual responses at both time points in the same group, group-level reliability is important to establish in addition to individual-level reliability. Group-level reliability is relevant not only to work focusing on the understanding of general, generic processes but also for questions about differences between two groups of individuals such as patients vs. controls (e.g., see meta-analyses of Cooper et al., 2022; Duits et al., 2015). Of note, many fear conditioning paradigms were initially developed to study general group-level processes and to elicit robust group effects (Lonsdorf and Merz, 2017). Hence it is important to investigate both group- and individual-level reliability given the challenges of attempts to employ cognitive tasks that were originally designed to produce robust group effects in individual difference research (Elliott et al., 2020; Hedge et al., 2018; Parsons, 2020; Parsons, Kruijt, and Fox, 2019).”</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“First, the limited longitudinal individual-level reliability might indicate that the fear conditioning paradigm employed here – which is a rather strong paradigm with 100% reinforcement rate – may be better suited for investigations of group effects and to a lesser extent for individual difference questions – potentially due to limited variance between individuals (Hedge et al., 2018; Parsons, 2020; Parsons et al., 2019). However, high correlations seem to be possible in principle, as we can conclude from the robust internal consistency of SCRs that we observed. This speaks against a limited between-subject variance and a general impracticability of the paradigm for individual difference research. Hence we call for caution and warn against concluding from our report that fear conditioning and our outcome measures (SCRs, BOLD fMRI) are unreliable at the individual level.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Internal Consistency Formula. The internal consistency (cross-sectional reliability) calculation used is not well-justified, and potentially needs additional parameters. It is not clear why the authors deviate from the internal consistency calculation described in Parson, Kruijt, and Fox et al., 2019, especially given that these procedures are used for other metrics elsewhere in the manuscript. I request that the authors either use the bias-corrected formula from Parson et al., 2019 or justify the use of the current calculation.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much appreciate the approach of Parsons et al. (2019) of robust estimation through permutation, in which data are multiple times (Parsons et al. (2019) recommend 5000 times as a minimum) randomly split into two halves, the reliability is estimated for each split and these estimates are averaged. In our case as the fear conditioning paradigm is a learning paradigm, however, we believe this approach cannot be applied without further consideration, since not every random division of the data makes sense. If, for example, the data from the acquisition phase were divided into halves, responses from the beginning and end of this phase would be used to determine reliability. However, because it is a learning experiment, these two halves probably do not measure exactly the same construct. Therefore, we decided to use the odd-even method because we believe that adjacent trials “measure something more similar” than random splits in this specific case (i.e., learning paradigm). We have included a brief justification in the manuscript:</p><p>“We considered the odd-even approach as the most appropriate since our paradigm constitutes a learning experiment and we suggest that adjacent trials measure a more similar construct compared to other possible splits of trials such as a split into halves or a large number of random splits as implemented in the permutation-based approach recommended by Parsons et al. (2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. ROIs. For the fMRI analyses, the authors use an ROI approach based on prior studies of fear acquisition and extinction. The majority of the most consistently identified regions (as seen in meta-analyses, Fullana et al., 2016, 2018) are analyzed. However, it is not clear why other regions are omitted, particularly given meta-analytic evidence. Striatal regions and the thalamus are the most notable omissions. Further, a weakness is that functional ROIs in this study were based on peak coordinates from a handful of prior studies, instead of meta-analytically identified coordinates. As such, I do not think the authors present the strongest foundation for making conclusions about the reliability of fear conditioning fMRI Data. I request that the authors include additional ROIs for the canonical fear network, or justify why the particular ROIs that are currently reported were the only ones used. I also strongly suggest using meta-analytic coordinates to determine ROIs for these analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer/editor for pointing out that our results and arguments could be strengthened by expanding the number of included ROIs to those identified in previous meta-analyses (Fullana et al., 2016, 2018). To accommodate this suggestion, we have added the caudate nucleus, the putamen, the pallidum, the nucleus accumbens as a proxy for the ventral striatum as well as the thalamus to the list of anatomically defined ROIs. Furthermore, we have created masks for the dACC and the dlPFC based on meta-analytically identified peak coordinates. For the vmPFC, the meta-analysis only identified a non-significant cluster with negative activation for CS+ &gt; CS-, with its peak coordinates more anterior than the activation found in previous publications (see red box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> for our mask and crosshair for meta-analytic peak coordinates) (Kalisch et al., 2006, Milad et al., 2007). Since the involvement of the vmPFC in fear acquisition and especially extinction has still been shown in many publications, we wanted to include the ROI but based its location on previous studies.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78717-sa2-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Please note, that the general pattern of results for all our measures of reliability has not changed with the addition of regions of interest and the masks based on peak coordinates identified in meta-analyses.An updated detailed methodological description can be found in the methods section (see pages 64 – 65) under ‘Regions of Interest’. The excerpt is also pasted below for your convenience.</p><p>“A total of 11 regions of interest (ROIs; i.e., bilateral anterior insula, amygdala, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, nucleus accumbens [NAcc], thalamus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [dACC], dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC] and ventromedial prefrontal cortex [vmPFC]) were included in the current study. Amygdala, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, ventral striatum (i.e., nucleus accumbens) and thalamus anatomical masks were extracted from the Harvard-Oxford atlas (Desikan et al., 2006) at a maximum probability threshold of 0.5. The anterior insula was defined as the overlap between the thresholded anatomical mask from the Harvard Oxford atlas (threshold: 0.5) and a box of size 60 x 30 x 60 mm centered around MNIxyz = 0, 30, 0 based on anatomical subdivisions (Nieuwenhuys, 2012). The cortical ROI dlPFC and dACC were created by building a box of size 20 x 16 x 16 mm around peak voxels obtained in a meta-analysis (with the x coordinate set to 0 for the dACC) (left dlPFC: MNIxyz = -36, 44, 22, right dlPFC: MNIxyz = 34, 44, 32, dACC: MNIxyz = 0, 18, 42, Fullana et al., 2016). As previously reported (Lonsdorf, Haaker, and Kalisch, 2014), the cortical vmPFC was created by using a box of size 20 x 16 x 16 mm centered on peak coordinates identified in prior studies of fear learning (vmPFC: MNIxyz = 0, 40, -12, e.g., Kalisch et al. (2006), Milad et al. (2007)) with the x coordinate set to 0 to obtain masks symmetric around the midline.”</p><p>We have further adjusted Appendix 3-table 3, Figure 3, Table 2 and Figure 6 and have slightly altered the results description to reflect the updated results.</p><p>“For BOLD fMRI, both ICC-types suggest rather limited reliability for CS discrimination during acquisition (both ICC<sub>abs</sub> and ICC<sub>con</sub> = 0.17) and extinction training (both ICC<sub>abs</sub> and ICC<sub>con</sub> = 0.01). For individual ROIs (anterior insula, amygdala, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, dACC, dlPFC and vmPFC), ICCs were even lower (all ICCs ≤ 0.001; for full results see Appendix 3-table 3).”</p><p>“In contrast to what was observed for SCRs, within-subject similarity was significantly higher than between-subject similarity in the whole brain (<italic>p</italic> &lt;.001) and most of the ROIs for fear acquisition training (see Figure 3A and Appendix 4-table 1). This suggests that while absolute values for similarity might be low, individual brain activation patterns during fear acquisition training at T0 were – at large – still more similar to the same subject’s activation pattern at T1 than to any others at T1. For extinction training, however, no significant differences between within- and between-subject similarity were found for any ROI or the whole brain (all <italic>p</italic>’s &gt;.306; see Figure 3B and Appendix 4-table 1).”</p><p>“In stark contrast to the low overlap of individual-level activation (see Table 2A), the overlap at the group level was rather high with 62.00 % for the whole brain and up to 89.80 % for ROIs (i.e., dACC and dlPFC; Jaccard) for CS discrimination during acquisition training (see Table 2B). Similar to what was observed for overlap at the individual level, a much lower overlap for extinction training as compared to acquisition training was observed for the whole brain (5.70 % overlap) and all ROIs (all close to zero).”</p><p>“In short, all but one association (CS discrimnation in the NAcc) was positive, showing that higher BOLD response during acquisition was associated with higher BOLD responding during extinction training (see Figure 6). However, the standardized β coefficients are mostly below or around 0.3 except for CS+ associations in the dACC, indicating non-substantial associations for all ROIs and CS specifications that were near absent for CS discrimination. Analysis of CS+ and CS- data was included here as the analysis is based on β maps and not T-maps (as in previous analyses) where a contrast against baseline is not optimal.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Reliability and the Need for Nuance</p><p>a. The authors structure the manuscript around the premise that reliability is essential in conducting solid individual-differences science, which I agree with wholeheartedly. However, I think the authors rely on relatively arbitrary cut-offs for classifying reliability as good/poor/etc to an extent that is not warranted, particularly in the context of the Discussion, and it takes away from the impact of this effort. As the authors point out, these categorical cut-offs are more guidelines than strict rules, yet the manuscript is structured around the premise that individual-level reliability is problematically poor. Many cut-off recommendations are based on psychometric work on trait self-report measures that usually assume fewer determinants/sources of error than would be seen in neuroscience experiments, which in turn allows for larger ceilings for effect sizes and reliability. The current manuscript does not address this issue and what meaningful (as opposed to good) fear conditioning reliability is when moving away from the categorical cut-offs. In other words, is it possible that the authors actually observed &quot;good&quot; reliability in the context of fear conditioning work, and that this reliability is lower than other types of paradigms is just inherent to the construct being studied?</p><p>b. The framing of the manuscript could be adjusted, such that less emphasis is placed on arbitrary cut-off metrics and more about what these reliabilities mean in the context of fear conditioning paradigms. To be clear, I think the authors already address this to a degree in their Discussion, but perhaps need to go a step further and expand on the challenges of establishing reliability in this field and explicitly address why common cut-offs are perhaps not appropriate.</p><p>c. It may be more appropriate to use numbers rather than labels/benchmarks in the reporting of results in the Results section, i.e. reporting the r-value instead of &quot;poor to questionable&quot; etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer/editor that a focus on the categorical and admittedly arbitrary cut offs may be misleading. We have replaced these (i.e., poor, moderate, high…) with numerical values for reliability in the Results section and explicitly pointed out that these are benchmarks that were developed in a different context and should not be overinterpreted (see figure captions). Changes have been made throughout the manuscript (some examples included below) and a new paragraph was added to the discussion in which we address the points raised by the reviewer/editor:</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>“While longitudinal reliability was rather limited at the individual level, it was comparably higher for acquisition but not extinction at the group-level.”</p><p>Example from figure caption:</p><p>“Internal consistency is in the literature often interpreted using benchmarks (Kline, 2013) for unacceptable (&lt; 0.5), poor (&gt; 0.5 but &lt; 0.6), questionable (&gt; 0.6 but &lt; 0.7), acceptable (&gt; 0.7 but &lt; 0.8), good (&gt; 0.8 but &lt; 0.9) and excellent (≥0.9). Common benchmarks in the literature for ICCs are poor (&lt; 0.5), moderate (&gt; 0.5 but &lt; 0.75), good (&gt; 0.75 but &lt; 0.9) and excellent (≥0.9) (Koo and Li, 2016). These benchmarks are included here to provide a frame of reference but we point out that these benchmarks are arbitrary and most importantly derived from psychometric work on trait self-report measures and should hence not be overinterpreted in the context of responding in experimental paradigms in which more sources of potential error are at play (Parsons, 2020).”</p><p>Example from results:</p><p>“Internal consistency at T0 (see Figure 1A) and T1 (see Figure 1B) of raw SCRs to the CS+ and CS- ranged from 0.54 – 0.85 and for raw SCRs to the US from 0.91 – 0.94 for all phases. In comparison, internal consistency was lower for CS discrimination with values ranging from -0.01 – 0.60.”</p><p>Example from discussion:</p><p>“Yet, we would like to point out that the values we report may in fact point towards good and not limited longitudinal individual-level reliability as our interpretation is guided by benchmarks that were not developed for experimental data but from psychometric work on trait self-report measures. We acknowledge that the upper bound of maximally overvarable reliability may differ between both use cases as more sources of error are at play in experimental neuroscientific work. The problem remains that predictions in fear conditioning paradigms do not seem feasible for a longer period of time (~ 6 months) given the measures we used here. Thus, a key contribution of our work is that it empirically highlights the need to pay more attention to measurement properties in translational research in general and fear conditioning research specifically (e.g., implement reliability calculations routinely in future studies). To date, it remains an open question what “good reliability” in experimental neuroscientific work actually means (Parsons et al., 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.
