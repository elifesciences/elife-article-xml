However, despite the enormous success of vaccination, we still do not fully understand how the body maintains long-term immunological memory, and this gap in our knowledge is hindering attempts to develop ‘next-generation vaccines’ and efforts to deploy immune cells called T cells against cancer.</p><p>The immune system contains many different types of cells. Some of these cells can recognize pathogens without ever having encountered them. However, other immune cells – including T cells – ‘learn on the job’: on first encountering a pathogen, these cells respond relatively slowly, but later form a 'memory' to respond more efficiently. To better understand how long-term immunological memory is maintained, we need to learn more about the dynamics of memory T cells. In particular, it will be necessary to understand the relative contribution of the following processes: the recruitment of new T cells (which are known as naive T cells) into the pool of memory T cells; the renewal of memory T cells by cell division; and the survival of individual memory T cells. However, quantifying these processes is challenging.</p><p>Previous research using cancer patient data indicated that memory T cells have a relatively short lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Michie et al., 1992</xref>). Then, almost 20 years ago, DNA-labeling techniques led to a breakthrough in the study of T-cell dynamics by allowing researchers to track how rapidly T cells divide and die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Hellerstein et al., 1999</xref>). These methods were later used to confirm that memory T cells live for six months or less in healthy humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Westera et al., 2013</xref>), whereas naive T cells can live for up to nine years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Vrisekoop et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, a long life is not a key characteristic of memory T cells. Instead, immunological memory, which can last for a lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Crotty and Ahmed, 2004</xref>), is maintained by relatively short-lived cells. However, it remains unclear to what extent the pool of memory T cells is maintained by the division of existing memory T cells or through the recruitment of naive T cells to the pool. The latter process is thought to play only a minor role because naive T cells are highly variable, and the chance of a given naive T cell entering the pool of memory T cells is thus extremely low.</p><p>Now, in eLife, immunologists from the University of Glasgow, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the Royal Free Hospital – Graeme Gossel, Thea Hogan, Daniel Cownden, Benedict Seddon and Andrew Yates – report how they have used two independent approaches to study how T-cell memory is maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Gossel et al., 2017</xref>). In a technique called ‘temporal fate mapping’, Gossel et al. used the cancer drug busulfan to kill hematopoietic stem cells (that is, stem cells that go on to become blood cells like T cells) in the bone marrow of mice, while leaving their peripheral T-cell pools intact. They then transplanted bone marrow cells from donor mice, which mature into T cells that differ only in one protein marker (CD45) expressed on their surface. Thus, in these mice, the researchers were able to distinguish newly formed T cells from the original T cells, and to track which cells were being replaced and measure their dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The dynamics of memory T cells.</title><p>Gossel et al. used two experimental approaches to study the dynamics of memory T cells in mice. (<bold>A</bold>) To quantify the influx of naive T cells into the pool of existing memory T cells, they used the drug busulfan to selectively kill hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the bone marrow of CD45.1+ mice (red arrow), and then added new cells derived from bone marrow of CD45.2+ mice (green arrow). Naive T cells (light blue bubble) replaced around 10% of central memory T cells (CM) and about 6% of effector memory T cells (EM) per week (blue arrows). About half of the resident memory T-cell population was never replaced. (<bold>B</bold>) In a second experiment, the DNA of memory T cells was labeled with the marker BrdU to measure how rapidly cells in different memory T-cell subpopulations divide and die. By measuring the marker Ki67 (purple arrow), they could classify CM and EM cells into recently divided (Ki67+) and not recently divided (Ki67-) cells. Both the CM and the EM pools contained cells with fast and slow dynamics: the short-lived cells lived around three days and six days, respectively, while the long-lived cells lived for around six weeks in both subpopulations. (<bold>C</bold>) In the future, it might be useful to combine these two approaches to compare the cell division and death of recently recruited (CD45.2+) and pre-existing memory T cells (CD45.1+).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-26754-fig1-v1"/><permissions><copyright-statement>© 2007, Seans Potato Business, Wikimedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2007</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Seans Potato Business, Wikimedia Commons</copyright-holder><license><license-p>Mouse used in Figure 1 parts A-C is reproduced with permission from Seans Potato Business.</license-p></license></permissions></fig></p><p>Even though the mice did not have any infections to activate naive T cells, there appeared to be a constant large influx of naive T cells into the pool of memory T cells. The memory T-cell pool has different subpopulations, including central memory T cells and effector memory T cells, which can be distinguished by the different protein markers found on their surface. Gossel et al. discovered that naive T cells replaced around 10% of the central memory T cells every week. For effector memory T cells this figure was around 6% per week in young adults and 1% per week in older mice. Importantly, they showed that by neglecting this large flux from the naive T-cell pool into the memory pool, previous studies may have significantly overestimated the lifespan of memory T cells.</p><p>Despite this rapid replacement of memory T cells by new naive T cells, around 50% of the pool of memory T cells that had formed before the mice were eight weeks old was never replaced by new naive T cells. Thus, although a substantial fraction of the memory T-cell pool is replaced at high rates throughout life, an equally large proportion is kept from an early age. The question still remains whether these ‘original’ T cells simply have a long lifespan or are maintained through cell division.</p><p>To better understand the dynamics of the different T-cell sub-populations, Gossel et al. labeled the DNA of cells undergoing cell division and measured the protein Ki67, which cells naturally express during division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The Ki67 marker was then used as a ‘time stamp’ that tagged cells that had recently divided, while DNA-labeling was used to trace the dynamics of both ‘stamped’ and ‘non-stamped’ cells. Gossel et al. show for the first time that both the central memory and the effector memory T-cell pool are composed of T-cell subsets with intrinsically different dynamics. In both pools around half of the cells live for just a few days while the other half, on average, live for around six weeks.</p><p>This study beautifully combines detailed quantitative experiments with mathematical models, and thereby reveals important insights into the long-term maintenance of memory T cells. However, the work also raises many questions. For example, it has recently been shown that the pool of memory T cells of laboratory mice resembles that of human babies more than that of human adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beura et al., 2016</xref>). If new naive T cells replace up to 10% of the memory T-cell pool per week even in clean laboratory environments, one may wonder how much they would replace in humans, who are continuously exposed to pathogens.</p><p>It is also still not clear what is driving these cells into the memory T-cell pool and if chronic latent infections continuously recruit new naive T cells into the memory pool. Nevertheless, a substantial fraction of the memory T-cell pool appears to be resistant and cannot be replaced by new cells from the naive T-cell pool. Future research should address what makes these T cells resistant and whether they cannot be replaced even during infections. Last but not least, one may wonder, what is the benefit of combining a pool of memory T cells that is never replaced with one that is quickly and continuously replaced?</p></body><back><fn-group
