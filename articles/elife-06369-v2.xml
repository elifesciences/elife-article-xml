damaging reactive oxygen species derived from the chloroplast. Many animal lineages, including primates, have become ascorbate auxotrophs due to the loss of the terminal enzyme in their biosynthetic pathway, <sc>l</sc>-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO). The alternative pathways found in land plants and <italic>Euglena</italic> use a different terminal enzyme, <sc>l</sc>-galactonolactone dehydrogenase (GLDH). The evolutionary processes leading to these differing pathways and their contribution to the cellular roles of ascorbate remain unclear. Here we present molecular and biochemical evidence demonstrating that GULO was functionally replaced with GLDH in photosynthetic eukaryote lineages following plastid acquisition. GULO has therefore been lost repeatedly throughout eukaryote evolution. The formation of the alternative biosynthetic pathways in photosynthetic eukaryotes uncoupled ascorbate synthesis from hydrogen peroxide production and likely contributed to the rise of ascorbate as a major photoprotective antioxidant.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06369.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06369.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06369.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals, plants, algae and other eukaryotic organisms all need vitamin C to enable many of their enzymes to work properly. Vitamin C also protects plant and algal cells from damage by molecules called reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be produced when these cells harvest energy from sunlight in a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs inside structures called chloroplasts, and has evolved on multiple occasions in eukaryotes when non-photosynthetic organisms acquired chloroplasts from other algae and then had to develop improved defences against ROS.</p><p>There are several steps involved in the production of vitamin C. In many animals, an enzyme called GULO carries out the final step by converting a molecule known as an aldonolactone into vitamin C; this reaction also produces ROS as a waste product. The GULO enzyme is missing in humans, primates and some other groups of animals, so these organisms must get all the vitamin C they need from their diet.</p><p>Plants and algae use a different enzyme—called GLDH—to make vitamin C from aldonolactone. GLDH is very similar to GULO, but it does not produce ROS as a waste product. It is not clear how the different pathways have evolved, or why some animals have lost the ability to make their own vitamin C.</p><p>Here, Wheeler et al. used genetics and biochemistry to investigate the evolutionary origins of vitamin C production in a variety of eukaryotic organisms. This investigation revealed that although GULO is missing from the insects and several other groups of animals, it is present in the sponges and many other eukaryotes. This suggests that GULO evolved in early eukaryotic organisms and has since been lost by the different groups of animals. On the other hand, GLDH is only found in plants and the other eukaryotes that can photosynthesize.</p><p>Wheeler et al.'s findings suggest that GULO has been lost and replaced by GLDH in all plants and algae following their acquisition of chloroplasts. GDLH allows plants and algae to make vitamin C without also producing ROS, which could explain why vitamin C has been able to take on an extra role in these organisms. The results allow us to better understand the functions of vitamin C in photosynthetic organisms and the processes associated with the acquisition of chloroplasts during evolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06369.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06369.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>vitamin C</kwd><kwd>ascorbate</kwd><kwd><italic>Porphyra</italic></kwd><kwd>L-gulonolactone oxidase</kwd><kwd><italic>Galdieria</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/G021678</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smirnoff</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000270</institution-id><institution>Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NE/J021008/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wheeler</surname><given-names>Glen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000737</institution-id><institution>University of Exeter</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Science Strategy Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smirnoff</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genomic evidence suggests that L-gulonolactone oxidase-the terminal enzyme in vitamin C synthesis, which has been repeatedly lost throughout animal evolution-was lost in plants and other photosynthetic eukaryotes following plastid acquisition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ascorbate (vitamin C) plays an essential role in eukaryotes as an enzyme co-factor in hydroxylation reactions, contributing to diverse processes such as the synthesis of collagen and the demethylation of histones and nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mandl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blaschke et al., 2013</xref>). Ascorbate also plays an antioxidant role in eukaryotes to help protect against reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from metabolic activity. The majority of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) generated in some organelles is likely reduced by other antioxidant systems, such as the peroxiredoxins and glutathione peroxidases in the mitochondria, and catalases in the peroxisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mhamdi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sies, 2014</xref>). However, ascorbate plays an important role in protecting photosynthetic cells against ROS derived from the chloroplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smirnoff, 2011</xref>). Ascorbate peroxidase (APX), which is found in both the cytosol and the chloroplast of photosynthetic eukaryotes, is central to this photoprotective role. Thylakoid- and stroma-localised APX removes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced by photosystem I through the activity of the ascorbate-glutathione cycle and this process may account for 10% of photosynthetic electron transport flow. Ascorbate also plays a critical role in preventing lipid peroxidation in the thylakoid membranes and acts as a co-factor for violaxanthin de-epoxidase in the xanthophyll cycle. In addition, ascorbate in the thylakoid lumen may prevent photoinhibition in high light by directly donating electrons to the photosynthetic electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smirnoff, 2011</xref>). These roles have been demonstrated in a range of ascorbate deficient plants that display sensitivity to high light and to oxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smirnoff, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Photosynthetic eukaryotes arose following the endosymbiotic acquisition of a cyanobacterial ancestor by a non-photosynthetic eukaryote in the Archaeplastida (Plantae) lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Keeling, 2010</xref>). Several other eukaryote lineages, including the diatoms, haptophytes and euglenids, subsequently gained plastids through a secondary endosymbiosis with either a red or green alga. These plastid endosymbioses were accompanied by lateral gene transfer on a massive scale from the symbiont to the host nuclear genome (known as endosymbiotic gene transfer or EGT), giving rise to the complex physiologies of photosynthetic eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Timmis et al., 2004</xref>). The plastids in the major photosynthetic eukaryote lineages are all ultimately derived from the primary endosymbiosis. Whilst acquisition of a photosynthetic endosymbiont may have been beneficial to the host cell in many ways, the plastid is also a major source of potentially damaging ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dorrell and Howe, 2012</xref>). There is evidence for extensive leakage of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> out of plastids via aquaporins, particularly at high light intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mubarakshina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Naydov et al., 2012</xref>). Plastid acquisition is therefore associated with a greatly increased requirement for cellular antioxidant systems to prevent photodamage. Cyanobacteria do not possess APX or any of the known enzymes for ascorbate biosynthesis and minimise photo-oxidative stress using alternative mechanisms, such as peroxiredoxins, catalases and glutathione peroxidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zámocký et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gest et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that ascorbate was most likely recruited to its photoprotective role after the acquisition of the plastid in ancestral Archaeplastida (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gest et al., 2013</xref>), although the evolutionary origins of ascorbate biosynthesis are unclear.</p><p>There is no clear evidence for ascorbate biosynthesis in prokaryotes (see ‘Materials and methods’), suggesting that the ability to synthesise ascorbate evolved in eukaryotes. The three eukaryote lineages in which ascorbate biosynthesis has been examined extensively (animals, plants and <italic>Euglena</italic>) all exhibit different biosynthetic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These pathways may have arisen due to convergent evolution, or may represent modifications of an ancestral pathway. An understanding of these evolutionary relationships will provide insight into the cellular roles of ascorbate in eukaryotes, particularly in relation to plastid acquisition in the photosynthetic lineages.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06369.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Major ascorbate biosynthetic pathways in eukaryotes.</title><p>The scheme depicts the three major ascorbate biosynthetic pathways found in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shigeoka et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wheeler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Linster and Van Schaftingen, 2007</xref>). The plant pathway (also known as the Smirnoff-Wheeler or <sc>D</sc>-mannose/<sc>l</sc>-galactose pathway) involves no inversion of the carbon chain (i.e., C1 of <sc>D</sc>-glucose becomes C1 of <sc>l</sc>-ascorbate), whereas the euglenid and animal pathways involve inversion of the carbon chain in the conversion from uronic acid to aldonolactone (i.e., C1 of <sc>D</sc>-glucose becomes C6 of <sc>l</sc>-ascorbate).

Many animal lineages have lost the ability to synthesise ascorbate, including haplorhine primates, guinea pigs, teleost fish, some bats and passerine birds. In all of the animal ascorbate auxotrophs that have been examined, the gene encoding GULO is lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nishikimi et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cui et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drouin et al., 2011</xref>). GULO uses molecular O<sub>2</sub> as its electron acceptor, resulting in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, which may have contributed to selective pressure to lose this enzyme in some animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bánhegyi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mandl et al., 2009</xref>). The inability of many invertebrates to synthesise ascorbate led to early speculation that ascorbate synthesis may have evolved later in metazoan evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chatterjee, 1973</xref>). However, whilst the loss of <italic>GULO</italic> in vertebrate lineages has been extensively examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yang, 2013</xref>), little is known about its distribution in invertebrates or the non-metazoan members of the holozoa. This information is required to identify the selective pressures underlying the evolution of ascorbate auxotrophy in animals.</p><p>Two alternative routes to ascorbate biosynthesis have been identified in photosynthetic eukaryotes, which both employ <sc>l</sc>-galactonolactone dehydrogenase (GLDH) as the terminal enzyme instead of GULO. A pathway via <sc>D</sc>-galacturonic acid and <sc>l</sc>-galactonolactone (<sc>l</sc>-GalL) was identified in <italic>Euglena</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shigeoka et al., 1979</xref>). This pathway is analogous to the animal pathway and also appears to be functional in some stramenopile algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Helsper et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grün and Loewus, 1984</xref>). In contrast, ascorbate biosynthesis in land plants was found to occur via a different route using <sc>D</sc>-mannose and <sc>l</sc>-galactose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wheeler et al., 1998</xref>). Green algae also use the ‘plant pathway’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Running et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Urzica et al., 2012</xref>), but evidence is lacking for the nature of ascorbate biosynthesis in many other evolutionarily important lineages, most notably the rhodophytes (red algae).</p><p>This paper focuses on the distribution of the three major pathways of ascorbate biosynthesis described above. Alternative routes of ascorbate biosynthesis have been described in trypanosomes and also in the fungi, which synthesise a range of ascorbate analogues (see ‘Materials and methods’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Loewus, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Logan et al., 2007</xref>). There is some evidence for the operation of alternative routes to ascorbate in land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wolucka and Van Montagu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lorence et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badejo et al., 2012</xref>), although molecular genetic evidence from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> indicates that the <sc>D</sc>-mannose/<sc>l</sc>-galactose pathway is the primary route of ascorbate biosynthesis (see ‘Materials and methods’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conklin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dowdle et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The three major pathways of ascorbate biosynthesis therefore all utilise different routes to synthesise an aldonolactone precursor (<sc>l</sc>-gulonolactone, <sc>l</sc>-GulL or <sc>l</sc>-galactonolactone, <sc>l</sc>-GalL), which is converted to ascorbate by either GULO (animal pathway) or GLDH (plant and euglenid pathways) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shigeoka et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wheeler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Loewus, 1999</xref>). GULO and GLDH exhibit significant sequence similarity and are both members of the vanillyl alcohol oxidase (VAO) family of flavoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Leferink et al., 2008</xref>). These similar enzymes exhibit important biochemical differences. GULO can oxidise <sc>l</sc>-GulL and <sc>l</sc>-GalL, whereas GLDH is highly specific for <sc>l</sc>-GalL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Smirnoff, 2001</xref>). GULO localises to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas GLDH is associated with complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schertl et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, GLDH does not generate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2,</sub> as it uses cytochrome <italic>c</italic> rather than O<sub>2</sub> as an electron acceptor.</p><p>Despite the importance of ascorbate in eukaryote physiology, it is not known how the different pathways of ascorbate biosynthesis arose in animals, plants and algae or relate to its differing cellular roles.

The biosynthetic pathway of ascorbate in plants, which supplies the vast majority of ascorbate in the human diet, remained elusive for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wheeler et al., 1998</xref>) and the major role of ascorbate in DNA demethylation emerged only very recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blaschke et al., 2013</xref>). In order to better understand the cellular roles of ascorbate, we have examined the distribution of the three major pathways of ascorbate biosynthesis in eukaryotes. We identify that the Opisthonkonts (animals and fungi), the Amoebozoa and the non-photosynthetic representatives of the Excavata and CCTH (Hacrobia) use <italic>GULO</italic> for ascorbate biosynthesis. In contrast, the photosynthetic organisms in the Archaeplastida, CCTH (Hacrobia), SAR and the photosynthetic members of the Excavata (euglenids) use <italic>GLDH</italic>. In these photosynthetic organisms, the combination of molecular and biochemical evidence suggests that the non-inversion pathway via L-galactose (plant pathway) is restricted to Archaeplastida, whereas the inversion pathway via <sc>D</sc>-galacturonate (euglenid pathway) is used by photosynthetic eukaryotes that acquired plastids via secondary endosymbiosis. The important exceptions to these trends are: firstly, that <italic>GLDH</italic> is found in several non-photosynthetic organisms, notably in some choanoflagellates (Opisthokonts) and stramenopiles and secondly, that <italic>GULO</italic> is found in several basally derived members of the Archaeplastida.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The evolutionary origins of GULO and GLDH</title><p>The processes underlying the distribution of the different terminal enzymes are therefore central to our understanding of the evolution of ascorbate biosynthesis. The mutually exclusive distribution of two highly conserved and functionally similar genes in eukaryotes may be explained by either of two evolutionary scenarios: an ancient gene duplication in the last common eukaryote ancestor (ancient paralogy) followed by differential loss of either gene, or lateral gene transfer of a novel gene followed by functional replacement of the ancestral gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keeling and Inagaki, 2004</xref>).

This requires that these two functionally similar enzymes co-existed in multiple lineages throughout eukaryote evolution without significant functional divergence. The distribution of <italic>GULO</italic> and <italic>GLDH</italic> in the Archaeplastida and in the choanoflagellates suggests that these enzymes may have coexisted for a time in these lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, there are no clear examples of extant eukaryotes that possess both enzymes, which would be expected if they have co-existed extensively throughout eukaryote evolution. The ancient paralogy model also requires extensive loss of both <italic>GULO</italic> and <italic>GLDH</italic>. There is clear evidence for multiple independent losses of <italic>GULO</italic> in animals and indications that GULO activity may be deleterious under certain conditions, providing a potential selective pressure for gene loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bánhegyi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hiller et al., 2012</xref>). Similar evidence for the loss of <italic>GLDH</italic> in eukaryotes is lacking. In addition, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants that lack <italic>GLDH</italic> cannot correctly assemble mitochondrial complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pineau et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that loss of <italic>GLDH</italic> is likely to have many wider impacts on metabolism.</p><p>The broad distribution of <italic>GULO</italic> supports an ancient evolutionary origin for this gene. It is present in all of the eukaryote supergroups, including basally-derived lineages within the CCTH (Hacrobia) and Archaeplastida and also in the Apusomonads. Although <italic>GLDH</italic> is also present in most of the eukaryote supergroups (except the Amoebozoa), its distribution is primarily restricted to lineages that have acquired a plastid or to isolated lineages (e.g., choanoflagellates). Whilst we cannot discount an ancient origin for <italic>GLDH</italic> in the last common eukaryote ancestor, its distribution may also be reasonably explained by the lateral gene transfer model.</p><p>In the lateral gene transfer scenario, either <italic>GULO</italic> or <italic>GLDH</italic> could represent a novel gene that arose in a specific lineage and was then acquired by other eukaryotes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) or endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT). However, the distribution of <italic>GULO</italic> cannot be reasonably explained by lateral gene transfer, as this requires HGT on a massive scale specifically into non-photosynthetic eukaryotes. In contrast, the distribution of <italic>GLDH</italic> can be largely explained by EGT during plastid acquisition. <italic>GLDH</italic> may have arisen specifically in ancestral Archaeplastida after the divergence of the glaucophytes and functionally replaced the ancestral gene (<italic>GULO</italic>). <italic>GLDH</italic> could then have been transferred to the other photosynthetic lineages via EGT, resulting in the replacement of <italic>GULO</italic> in lineages that acquired their plastids via secondary endosymbiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The presence of <italic>GLDH</italic> in some non-photosynthetic eukaryotes may be explained by the evolutionary acquisition of a plastid that was subsequently lost. For example, there is some evidence to support plastid loss in non-photosynthetic stramenopiles, although the number and timing of plastid acquisition events via secondary endosymbiosis remains a subject of significant debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Keeling, 2010</xref>). The choanoflagellates have not acquired a plastid at any stage, but there is evidence for large scale horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from algae into this lineage, including the HGT of APX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nedelcu et al., 2008</xref>). Choanoflagellates may therefore have acquired <italic>GLDH</italic> via HGT along with these other algal genes. EGT of <italic>GLDH</italic> is a more parsimonious scenario than ancient paralogy, as it requires fewer independent loss events. However, the poor resolution of the phylogenies within the <italic>GLDH</italic> clade means that direct evidence for either EGT or HGT between lineages is lacking.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06369.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A proposed evolutionary model of ascorbate biosynthesis.</title><p>The scheme illustrates the proposed events in the EGT evolutionary model of eukaryote ascorbate biosynthesis.

However, the EGT scenario provides a clear rationale to explain why photosynthetic eukaryotes with primary plastids exhibit a different pathway from those with secondary plastids. Our biochemical evidence suggests that ancestral Archaeplastida developed a non-inversion pathway via <sc>l</sc>-galactose that employed the broad specificity of GULO to oxidise <sc>l</sc>-GalL. The development of <italic>GLDH</italic> in ancestral Archaeplastida would have led to the eventual replacement of <italic>GULO</italic> in all red and green algal lineages, except <italic>Galdieria</italic> and <italic>Chlorokybus</italic>, resulting in the non-inversion plant-type pathway found in extant Archaeplastida. In the photosynthetic eukaryotes with secondary plastids, it is likely that the host initially synthesised ascorbate via an animal-type pathway (involving inversion of chain and GULO) and that the red or green algal symbiont used a plant-type pathway (involving non-inversion of the carbon chain and GLDH). However, neither pathway appears to operate in photosynthetic eukaryotes with secondary plastids, which instead use a euglenid-type pathway. We propose that EGT of <italic>GLDH</italic> from the symbiont could have resulted in functional replacement of <italic>GULO</italic> in the animal-type pathway of the host, leading to a hybrid biosynthetic pathway that employed <sc>D</sc>-galacturonate rather than <sc>D</sc>-glucuronate as an intermediate in order to provide <sc>l</sc>-GalL as a substrate for GLDH. The hybrid pathway therefore involves inversion of the carbon chain of <sc>D</sc>-glucose and GLDH. The generation of a hybrid pathway suggests that photosynthetic eukaryotes with secondary plastids only acquired <italic>GLDH</italic> by EGT rather than the entire plant pathway.</p><p>In conclusion, the distribution of <italic>GULO</italic> and <italic>GLDH</italic> in eukaryotes may be explained by either of two evolutionary models; ancient paralogy followed by differential gene loss or EGT of <italic>GLDH</italic> followed by <italic>GULO</italic> loss. We favour the EGT scenario as the most parsimonious and the most consistent with the biochemical evidence, but we cannot rule out either scenario based on the current evidence. Therefore our evolutionary analyses do not allow us to definitively identify the origin of <italic>GLDH</italic>. However, they do enable clear conclusions to be made on the loss of <italic>GULO</italic>. Both evolutionary models support <italic>GULO</italic> as an ancestral gene in the last common eukaryote ancestor, indicating that <italic>GULO</italic> has been lost in almost all photosynthetic eukaryotes. Therefore, we can conclude that photosynthetic eukaryotes encountered strong selective pressure to replace the function of <italic>GULO</italic> in ascorbate biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Selective pressures underlying evolution of ascorbate biosynthesis</title><p>The critical role of ascorbate in photoprotection has been demonstrated in a diversity of photosynthetic eukaryotes, including land plants, green algae, diatoms and euglenids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lavaud and Kroth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ishikawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mellado et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Urzica et al., 2012</xref>). Our analyses indicate that many photosynthetic eukaryotes possessed GULO prior to plastid acquisition, whereas almost all extant photosynthetic lineages use GLDH to synthesise ascorbate. The selective pressure to replace GULO in ascorbate biosynthesis following plastid acquisition could therefore be linked to the photoprotective role of ascorbate. One intriguing possibility is that the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by GULO may have limited the ability of the host cell to protect itself against ROS derived from the chloroplast.</p><p>Ancestral eukaryotes developed multiple antioxidant mechanisms to protect themselves from ROS derived from organelles such as the peroxisome and the mitochondria. However, the acquisition of a photosynthetic cyanobacterial endosymbiont in the Archaeplastida would have resulted in a greatly increased requirement for cellular antioxidants to protect the host cell from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> secreted by the plastid. Ascorbate, synthesised in the host cell but not in the cyanobacterial endosymbiont, appears to have been recruited to this role after the divergence of the glaucophytes. The recruitment of ascorbate as a major cellular antioxidant in photosynthetic eukaryotes may have led to an increased requirement for ascorbate biosynthesis. However, ascorbate biosynthesis via GULO results in the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the ER lumen. In mammalian cells, this results in a damaging depletion and oxidation of the glutathione pool when ascorbate synthesis is increased by feeding <sc>l</sc>-GulL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bánhegyi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Puskás et al., 1998</xref>). Ancestral photosynthetic eukaryotes may have been unable to balance their increasing requirements for ascorbate biosynthesis with maintenance of the redox status within the ER, providing selective pressure to uncouple ascorbate biosynthesis from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production.</p><p>This hypothesis is consistent with the presence of <italic>GULO</italic> rather than <italic>GLDH</italic> in the glaucophytes. As glaucophytes do not appear to use ascorbate for photoprotection, ascorbate biosynthesis would not have been subjected to the same selective pressures as other photosynthetic eukaryotes. This rationale may also apply to the retention of <italic>GULO</italic> in <italic>Galdieria</italic>, which is likely to have both possessed both <italic>GULO</italic> and <italic>GLDH</italic>. <italic>Galdieria</italic> is photosynthetic and expresses a functional APX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sano et al., 2001</xref>), but it is very sensitive to even moderate light intensities and grows primarily in an endolithic environment utilising heterotrophic carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Oesterhelt et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, photo-oxidative stress in this environment may be minimal, reducing the selective pressure in <italic>Galdieria</italic> to replace <italic>GULO</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Evolution of ascorbate auxotrophy in animals</title><p>The evolution of vitamin auxotrophy underpins many important nutritional and ecological interactions between organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Helliwell et al., 2013</xref>). The selective pressures resulting in <italic>GULO</italic> loss in animals represent a combination of the costs of ascorbate synthesis (including detoxification of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> derived from GULO), the physiological requirements for ascorbate and the ecological factors that determine the supply of dietary ascorbate throughout their life cycle. The development of the photoprotective role of ascorbate in photosynthetic eukaryotes would have significantly altered its availability to many heterotrophic organisms. The leaves of land plants have particularly high cellular concentrations of ascorbate relative to other photosynthetic eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gest et al., 2013</xref>), which may result from their inability to remove intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <italic>via</italic> diffusion to an aquatic medium.

This information allows us to assess which terminal enzyme contributed to the production of dietary ascorbate. In nearly all cases the major source of dietary ascorbate is most likely to have been derived from GLDH. Phylogenetic analyses suggest GULO has been lost on multiple independent occasions throughout the Chiroptera (bats). Although ancestral bats may have been primarily insectivores, various sources of dietary ascorbate may have contributed to GULO loss. The passerine birds that are unable to synthesise ascorbate are primarily herbivores or insectivores. However, some members of the <italic>Lanius</italic> genus (shrikes) feed also on small vertebrates, in addition to insects. Most teleost fish are believed to be ascorbate auxotrophs due to loss of GULO. As zooplankton (primarily crustacea) are also ascorbate auxtrophs, phytoplankton are likely to be the ultimate source of dietary ascorbate. Reports suggest the ability of crustacea to synthesise ascorbate is either absent or very weak, although the taxonomic sampling and currently available genomic resources are limited. Most, but not all, phytophagous insects have a dietary requirement for ascorbate, and we did not find GULO in any insect genomes. Note also that some species of insect (e.g., cockroaches) may obtain ascorbate from eukaryote endosymbionts, which may allow them to survive on ascorbate-poor diets.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>The pseudogenisation of <italic>GULO</italic> in primates, bats and guinea pigs is one of the best known examples of evolutionary gene loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drouin et al., 2011</xref>).

However, there is some evidence to suggest that some classes of eukaryotes may use alternative routes to ascorbate or use multiple routes. These pathways are reviewed comprehensively elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Loewus, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Smirnoff, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Linster et al., 2007</xref>) but the implications for our findings are highlighted below.</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Land plants</title><p>Ascorbate in land plants is synthesised predominately via a non-inversion pathway through GDP-<sc>D</sc>-mannose and <sc>l</sc>-galactose in which carbon atom 1 (C1) of the precursor hexose remains as C1 in ascorbate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Loewus and Jang, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Loewus, 1999</xref>). Genetic evidence from a range of ascorbate-deficient <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants indicates that the <sc>D</sc>-mannose/<sc>l</sc>-galactose pathway is the primary route of ascorbate biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conklin et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dowdle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smirnoff, 2011</xref>). For example, <italic>Arabidopsis vtc2 vtc5</italic> double mutants lacking GDP-<sc>l</sc>-Gal phosphorylase activity are not viable unless supplemented with ascorbate, suggesting no other route can supply sufficient ascorbate to rescue this defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dowdle et al., 2007</xref>). However, a number of other routes to ascorbate in plants have been proposed. Plants can potentially use <sc>D</sc>-galacturonate as an ascorbate precursor, and this alternative route may contribute to ascorbate synthesis in certain tissue types, such as fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Isherwood and Mapson, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badejo et al., 2012</xref>). GDP-<sc>l</sc>-gulose, formed during the activity of GDP-mannose epimerase in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wolucka and Van Montagu, 2003</xref>), could provide <sc>l</sc>-GulL, which could contribute to ascorbate synthesis via the GULO-like enzymes found in land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maruta et al., 2010</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GULO-like genes in tobacco cell lines increased cellular ascorbate concentration in the presence of exogenous <sc>l</sc>-GulL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maruta et al., 2010</xref>). Oxidation of <italic>myo</italic>-inositol is another potential source of <sc>l</sc>-GulL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lorence et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lisko et al., 2013</xref>). However, more definitive biochemical and genetic evidence for these alternative pathways is required in order to assess whether these pathways contribute significantly to ascorbate biosynthesis in plants. The evidence for the alternative pathways is largely based on increased ascorbate production after ectopic expression of genes or addition of exogenous substrates. This approach leaves open the possibility that these pathways are not active in wild type plants. The critical experiments, in which the proposed enzymes are mutated or knocked out, have not been reported.</p><p>Our evolutionary analyses indicate that <italic>GULO</italic> and <italic>GLDH</italic> co-existed in ancestral Archaeplastida, suggesting that multiple pathways of ascorbate biosynthesis were operational in these organisms. Whilst the ‘plant pathway’ via GLDH is clearly the primary biosynthetic route in extant land plants, the presence of minor alternative pathways such as those listed above may reflect this ancestry of shared pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Prasinophytes</title><p>The genomes of the prasinophyte algae <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> and <italic>Micromonas</italic> are unusual amongst the Viridiplantae in that they lack <sc>l</sc>-galactose dehydrogenase and GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Urzica et al., 2012</xref>). However, it is likely that these prasinophytes can generate GDP-<sc>D</sc>-mannose, either through an unidentified alternative enzyme activity (as proposed in brown algae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Michel et al., 2010</xref>]) or through the transferase activity of VTC2. Furthermore, we identified <sc>l</sc>-fucose (6-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-galactose) dehydrogenase in all <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> and <italic>Micromonas</italic> genomes. <sc>l</sc>-fucose dehydrogenase also exhibits activity with <sc>l</sc>-galactose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schachter et al., 1969</xref>) and it therefore may functionally replace <sc>l</sc>-galactose dehydrogenase in these prasinophytes. Analysis of the Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome dataset revealed that <sc>l</sc>-fucose dehydrogenase is present in many other prasinophytes including members of the Prasinococcales, Pycnococcaceae and the Pyramimonadaceae. The only prasinophyte identified with <sc>l</sc>-galactose dehydrogenase was <italic>Nephroselmis pyriformis</italic> (Nephroselmidophyceae).

Yeasts synthesise <sc>D</sc>-erythroascorbate from <sc>D</sc>-arabinose via <sc>D</sc>-AraL and these final steps are therefore analogous to the <sc>D</sc>-mannose/<sc>l</sc>-galactose pathway.

While the presence of this enzyme suggests some prokaryotes have the capacity for ascorbate synthesis, specific evidence for in vivo ascorbate biosynthesis is lacking. There is a single report indicating that some cyanobacteria contain very low concentrations of ascorbate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tel-Or et al., 1986</xref>), although the analytical method used (2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine) may not be sufficiently specific for ascorbate at these concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roe, 1961</xref>). Prokaryotes lack ascorbate peroxidase and it is likely that early reports of ascorbate peroxidase activity in cyanobacteria were due to the activity of other forms of peroxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernroitner et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-6"><title>Chromerids</title><p>The chromerids are photosynthetic relatives of the apicomplexa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Janouskovec et al., 2010</xref>) and are the only organisms in our analyses that have acquired a plastid via secondary endosymbiosis and retained <italic>GULO</italic>. <italic>C. velia</italic> utilises the xanthophyll cycle for non-photochemical quenching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kotabová et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that ascorbate performs a photoprotective role in chromerids by acting as a co-factor for violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE).

Apicomplexans lack complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Danne et al., 2013</xref>), which may have influenced their ability to acquire and/or utilise GLDH, as GLDH is incorporated into complex I in land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schertl et al., 2012</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor), Joerg Bohlmann (Reviewing editor), and two reviewers. The external reviewers are recognized experts with complementary expertise in the areas of molecular evolution and metabolism.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers were very positive about this paper and supported its publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, pending editorial revisions. This is a very strong paper on a very interesting topic, which provides fundamental new insights into the evolution of ascorbate metabolism. The paper presents a comprehensive cross kingdom analysis of the various pathways for ascorbate biosynthesis. It has clearly been diligently researched and is presented in a convincing manner, combining literature knowledge, the vast availability of gene sequences and select biochemical analysis.</p><p>1) The authors convincingly address questions 1, 2 and 4 which they set out in the Introduction at a high level.

It provides considerable new insight and additionally will likely spur future research aimed at a comprehensive analysis of this important pathway. The paper is very well prepared and presented, and has been a pleasure to read.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06369.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors convincingly address questions 1, 2 and 4 which they set out in the Introduction at a high level.

This issue can be solved with editorial revisions, i.e. some rewriting</italic>.</p><p>The EGT scenario of GLDH acquisition proposed in the manuscript provides a potential explanation for the distribution of the different pathways in photosynthetic eukaryotes. The Archaeplastida synthesise ascorbate via GLDH with no inversion of the carbon chain of <sc>D</sc>-glucose. EGT of GLDH into photosynthetic eukaryotes with secondary plastids would have enabled them to replace GULO in the animal pathway, resulting in a hybrid biosynthetic pathway in which ascorbate is synthesised via GLDH but with inversion of the carbon chain of <sc>D</sc>-glucose (i.e. the pathway first identified in <italic>Euglena</italic>). This provides an explanation for the observation that photosynthetic eukaryotes with primary plastids operate a plant-type pathway whilst those with secondary plastids operate euglenid-type pathway. We have amended the Results (in the subsection headed “Distribution of ascorbate-dependent antioxidant systems”) and the Discussion (in the subsection headed “Selective pressures underlying evolution of ascorbate biosynthesis”) to clarify this issue.</p><p><italic>2) Similarly, although the authors’ statements concerning ascorbate in</italic> Cyanophora <italic>are actually very careful and accurate, this paragraph should be slightly rephrased for clarity as it may be misunderstood as an overstatement of the results</italic>.</p><p>We have carefully rephrased this paragraph (in the subsection headed “Distribution of ascorbate-dependent antioxidant systems”) to make it clear that our findings relate to the role of ascorbate in <italic>Cyanophora</italic> and that the role of ascorbate in cyanobacteria has been examined by previous researchers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
