immunotherapies. One of the early hallmarks of cancer is DNA hypomethylation in genomic repeat regions that can result in the expression of normally silenced endogenous ‘viral’ elements. Such epigenetic changes have the potential to augment anti-tumor immune responses as well as reduce tumor cell fitness through the generation of aberrant nucleic acid species (NAS) and consequent activation of NAS-sensing pathways. Therefore, tumor evolution should favor additional selective events that suppress NAS generation, possibly yielding specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. Here, we show that the lysine demethylase 5 (KDM5) family of epigenetic regulatory enzymes suppresses R-loop formation in genomic repeat regions specifically in cancer cells. We find that KDM5 inhibition in luminal breast cancer cells results in R-loop-mediated DNA damage, reduced cell fitness, and an increase in ISG and AP signatures as well as cell surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, mediated by RNA:DNA hybrid activation of the CGAS/STING pathway. KDM5 inhibition does not result in DNA damage or activation of the CGAS/STING pathway in normal breast epithelial cells, suggesting that KDM5 inhibitors may enable a wide therapeutic window in this setting, compared to STING agonists or type I interferons. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between epigenetic regulation of genomic repeats, R-loop formation, innate immunity, and cell fitness in the context of cancer evolution and therapeutic vulnerability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oncology</kwd><kwd>therapeutics</kwd><kwd>histone demethyalse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>KDM5 inhibition/disruption selectively induces R-loop-mediated DNA damage and innate immune activation in breast cancer cells, while sparing normal cells, unveiling a tumor-specific therapeutic vulnerability with broad translational potential.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer treatments have evolved along three main paradigms: cytotoxic chemotherapy, rationally targeted agents, and immune-based therapies. Still, innate and acquired drug resistance remains key limitations to improving outcomes in advanced cancer patients. With immune-based therapies, it is well documented that responses depend on an appropriate tumor microenvironment (TME). In recent years, it has been shown that tumor-intrinsic expression of endogenous, virus-like elements can affect both tumor cell viability and the TME by mimicking viral infection and activating pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as TMEM173/STING and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) – a process coined ‘viral mimicry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roulois et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiappinelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jansz and Faulkner, 2021</xref>). It is conceivable that suppression of the expression of these repeat elements and ‘viral mimicry’ may also mediate drug resistance to other therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guler et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Throughout evolution, the human genome has been modified by waves of viral insertions, and a large fraction of the human genome is consequently composed of repetitive elements and retrotransposons, including interspersed long-terminal repeat (LTR)-based endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), non-LTR-based short- and long-interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs and LINEs), as well as centromeric, telomeric, and satellite repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lander et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wells and Feschotte, 2020</xref>). HERV, LINE, and SINE elements are mostly silenced in healthy human somatic cells but can be deregulated in cancer cells due to DNA hypomethylation in regions containing such elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehrlich, 2009</xref>). Notably, aberrant expression of these elements is increasingly recognized as playing important roles, not only in cancer evolution and drug resistance but also in the development of other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burns, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Mechanistically, it has been shown that expression of HERVs, LINEs, and SINEs can cause cells to appear virally infected to the immune system (termed ‘viral mimicry’), in part through the formation of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that are detected by MDA5, thereby triggering a type I interferon (IFN-I) response that can decrease tumor cell fitness and increase immunogenicity. Consequently, during tumor evolution such a response may need to be blunted by the acquisition of mutations in genes that promote IFN-I signaling, or by the possible deployment of viral restriction factors or compensatory epigenetic repressive mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vashi and Bakhoum, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheon et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, the latter two non-mutational mechanisms may serendipitously present unique tumor-specific therapeutic opportunities. For example, it has been shown that the A-to-I-editing viral restriction factor ADAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nishikura, 2016</xref>) destabilizes inverted repeat SINE elements (IR-Alus) and prevents their detection by MDA5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mehdipour et al., 2020</xref>). As a result, tumors that harbor increased expression of SINE elements (and consequently ISGs) are highly sensitive to ADAR loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gannon et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, ADAR disruption has also been shown to lead to both intrinsic anti-tumor activity and enhanced immunotherapy response in preclinical mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ishizuka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubrot et al., 2022</xref>). Previous studies have also demonstrated that regulators of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roulois et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiappinelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2024</xref>), as well as inhibitors of other epigenetic regulators such as histone methyltransferases (HMTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shen et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuellar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deblois et al., 2020</xref>) and histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shen et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leadem et al., 2018</xref>), can induce ‘viral mimicry’ by reactivating repeat elements and increasing ISG signatures beyond a threshold level of tolerance, thereby affecting cell survival.</p><p>Notably, suppression of repeat transcription may also be responsible for the low levels of MHC class I on the surface of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dhatchinamoorthy et al., 2021</xref>). Reduced surface MHC I on tumor cells will decrease their intrinsic immunity but also limit responsiveness to therapies such as adoptive T cell therapies. In addition, peptides derived from the repeat genome have also been shown to be presented by tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saffern and Samstein, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Griffin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonté et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kong et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In addition to dsRNA activation of MDA5, viral mimicry can also be mediated through the CGAS/STING pathway, which is initiated by the sensing of DNA or RNA:DNA hybrid species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mankan et al., 2014</xref>). Agonists of the STING pathway are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. The lysine demethylase 5 family (KDM5A-D), which removes histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) di- and tri-methyl modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pavlenko et al., 2022</xref>), has been suggested to blunt ‘viral mimicry’ through the repression of STING expression or modification of signaling components downstream of STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shen et al., 2021b</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that disruption of KDM5 activates ‘viral mimicry’ in luminal breast cancer cell lines that are responsive to STING agonists. We also show that KDM5 inhibition specifically promotes ‘viral mimicry’ in tumor cells and not in normal primary breast epithelial cells.</p><p>Mechanistically, we demonstrate that inhibition of KDM5 and the resulting increase in H3K4 tri-methylation in repeat regions leads to an increase in R-loop formation. R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures that naturally form during cellular processes such as transcription, replication, and DNA repair when a nascent RNA transcript hybridizes to its DNA template, leaving a loop of single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crossley et al., 2019</xref>). Although R-loops are crucial intermediates in normal cellular processes, if not properly regulated, they can also compromise genomic stability, induce DNA damage, and trigger inflammatory responses through upregulation of IFN signaling. As such, dysregulation of R-loops and the cGAS/STING pathway has been implicated in both cancer and autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mackay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cristini et al., 2022</xref>). As an example, it has recently been demonstrated that disruption of the RNA:DNA helicase senataxin (SETX), which can resolve R-loops, in cancer cells results in accumulation of R-loop-derived cytoplasmic RNA:DNA hybrids that can activate an innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crossley et al., 2023</xref>). Increases in transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) and subsequent R-loop formation have also been linked to DNA damage and heightened sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Petropoulos et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laspata et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kemiha et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we show that KDM5 disruption not only stimulates STING-mediated ISG and AP signatures as well as MHC class I presentation but also induces a DNA damage response that is independent of the cGAS/STING-type I IFN axis. In summary, our studies suggest that KDM5 inhibitors hold promise as stand-alone cancer therapies or in combination with immune or DNA-damaging cancer therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Luminal breast cancer cell lines display features of ‘cold’ tumors, but “viral mimicry” can be induced through the STING, MAVS, and IFN-I pathways</title><p>Immune-directed therapies can produce significant clinical benefit for some, but not all, cancer patients.

However, de-repression of LINE, SINEs, HERVs, and other repeat elements also promotes ‘viral mimicry’: generation of cytoplasmic NAS and activation of PRRs and IFN-I signaling pathways. Therefore, during tumor evolution, various mechanisms can be engaged to counter the negative effects of ‘viral mimicry’ and create an equilibrium that favors the tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kermi et al., 2022</xref>). To better understand the ‘viral mimicry’ state in luminal breast cancer cells, we first examined a panel of cell lines for their ability to respond to PRR agonists or to IFN-I stimulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> for a simplified schematic of normal PRR signaling). Using MHC class I surface levels as well as activation of an integrated interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) reporter as read-outs, these studies demonstrate that all tested luminal breast tumor cell lines respond to IFNβ (a type I IFN) to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, upper panels and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, left panel, as well as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>, left panel, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>, upper panel).

Collectively, these data show that most of the luminal breast tumor cell lines in this panel have intact signaling pathways downstream of PRRs, suggesting that PRR agonists could be used to increase the ISG and AP signatures and decrease cell viability in luminal breast cancer cells. However, like type I IFNs, PRR agonists are likely to indiscriminately induce such phenotypes in both tumor and normal epithelial cells, thereby limiting the therapeutic window for such agents. This is exemplified by an increase in MHC class I surface expression on both tumor cells and normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) in response to STING or RIGI/MDA5 agonists as well as to type I IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>).</p><p>Next, we evaluated factors shown to be involved in upstream suppression of STING or MAVS signaling in human tumor cell lines or in suppression of tumor immune responses in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubrot et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref> for summary).

The HCC1428 luminal breast cancer cell line was chosen as a model for most of these studies because it responds well to STING and MDA5 agonists as well as to IFN-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f and g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c–e</xref>). Consistent with the effects of MDA5 agonists, CRISPR-mediated disruption of ADAR1 (both p110 and p150 subunits) in HCC1428 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>) results in an increase in both ISRE-reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, upper panel) and surface presentation of MHC class I molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, lower panel). Similar results were also observed in T47D and MCF7 luminal breast cancer lines (data not shown). Likewise, the KDM5-specific inhibitor C48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liang et al., 2017</xref>) increases ISRE reporter expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, upper panel) as well as ISG and AP signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) in HCC1428 cells.

Briefly, luminal MCF7 breast cancer cells engineered to over-express the NY-ESO1 antigen were cultured with Jurkat cells expressing a NY-ESO1-specific TCR and a luciferase reporter under control of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) promoter that is activated upon TCR activation. Using this system, we demonstrated that disruption of ADAR in MCF7:NY-ESO1 cells results in robust activation of the NFAT reporter in co-cultured Jurkat:NY-ESO1 TCR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>).

Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that PRR and IFN-I signaling can be augmented in luminal breast cancer cells by direct agonists or by the disruption or inhibition of factors that may repress these pathways upstream.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The effect of KDM5 inhibition on cell fitness is not mediated through activation of cGAS/STING or type I IFN signaling</title><p>In addition to increasing the immunogenicity of tumor cells, ‘viral mimicry’ can also reduce cell fitness. This relationship is well-documented in the MDA5/MAVS dsRNA-sensing pathway. In brief, MDA5/MAVS activation by dsRNA induces IFN-I signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway, resulting in ISG induction. This includes an increase in Protein Kinase R (PKR), which binds dsRNA and signals through eIF2α to attenuate global translation and drive apoptosis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1l</xref> for schematic). Consistent with this mechanism of action, treatment with ruxolitinib, a Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor that blocks the IFN-I response, rescues the effects of ADAR1 disruption not only on ISG induction, MHC class I presentation, but also overall tumor cell fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k–l</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1m</xref>). This direct relationship between ADAR1, dsRNA levels, IFN signaling, and cell fitness is further illustrated by the observation that cancer cell dependencies on ADAR, as reported in DepMap, correlate with baseline ISG and AP signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1n</xref> for summary; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gannon et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, ruxolitinib treatment does not reverse KDM5 inhibitor-mediated loss of cell fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2o</xref>) despite blunting induction of ISG/AP signatures and activation of the NFAT reporter in the MCF7:NYESO1/Jurkat co-culture system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2m and n</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1o and p</xref>).

This method combines antibody-targeted cleavage by Tn5 transposase with parallel DNA sequencing to evaluate regions in the genome that a target is bound. Since KDM5 inhibition induces global changes in H3K4me3, we added equal numbers of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> spike-in nuclei to both DMSO and C48-treated samples to enable downstream normalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref> for experimental set-up as well as materials and methods for more detail). Antibodies against H3K4me3 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> spike-in were used to pull down human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> DNA, respectively, and libraries were generated for next-generation sequencing. Consistent with a global increase in H3K4me3, C48-treated samples consistently harbor less <italic>Drosophila</italic> reads compared to DMSO-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>); therefore, H3K4me3 peaks would be undercounted in C48-treated samples without spike-in normalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d and e</xref> as examples). After peak counts were normalized to spike-in reads, differential peak calling was performed. As expected, we observe an increase in H3K4me3 in promoter regions upon C48 treatment in HCC1428 cells compared to DMSO controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>, yellow bar). Genes that display increased H3K4me3 include ISGs; the modification of the genes may be directly mediated by KDM5, or they may be indirectly affected due to IFN pathway stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f</xref>). Additionally, we observe an increase in H3K4me3 in intergenic and intronic regions, which often harbor insertions of repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elbarbary et al., 2016</xref>), in C48-treated HCC1428 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>, blue and orange bars). Given that R-loop generation has been described in telomeric, centromeric, and other repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gong and Liu, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), we expanded the analysis of H3K4 trimethylation to repeat regions. This analysis reveals increased H3K4me3 reads mapping to both sub-telomeric and centromeric regions following C48 treatment of HCC1428 and other luminal breast cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h and i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1g</xref>). In this context, it is noteworthy that KDM5 has been identified as a telomere-associated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujita et al., 2013</xref>). The C48-mediated increases of H3K4me3 in sub-telomeric repeats occur in both tumor cells and normal HMECs, suggesting that repeats derived from these regions likely do not contribute to the ‘viral mimicry” phenotypes observed (data not shown).</p><p>In addition to the observed C48-mediated increases of H3K4me3 in telomeric repeats, after subdividing the genome into annotated repetitive regions and non-repeat regions, we also detect a significant increase in H3K4me3 reads mapping to repeat regions in HCC1428 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>) and other breast tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1h</xref>). The results of the H3K4 me3-CUT-and-Tag experiments are consistent with those derived from the analysis of H3K4me3 reads from chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIPseq) experiments (data not shown). We subsequently separated the analysis by repeat classes present in the human genome and observed that SINE elements exhibit the highest coverage of H3K4me3 in C48-treated HCC1428 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1i</xref>, pink bar) and are significantly increased in comparison to untreated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>, pink). We also identify increases in H3K4me3 in other genomic repeats such as LINE and LTR elements in HCC1428 cells treated with C48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>, yellow and dark blue respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4l</xref>) and in other C48-treated luminal breast cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1h</xref> and data not shown). Further distillation of repeat classes into SINE, LINE, and LTR subfamilies reveals that KDM5 inhibition results in increased H3K4me3 mainly in the AluY subfamily, as well as LINE1/LINE2 subfamilies and a few LTR subfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1j and k</xref>).</p><p>To investigate a possible relationship between genomic regions that harbor increased H3K4me3 upon KDM5 inhibition and R-loop prevalence, we next performed CUT-and-Tag experiments using an antibody (S9.6) that detects RNA:DNA hybrids in the genome. As in the H3K4me3-CUT-and-Tag experiments, <italic>Drosophila</italic> ‘spike-ins’ were added and used for normalization of the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref> for experimental outline and ‘Materials and methods’ for more detail). Similar to what was observed for H3K4me3, KDM5 inhibition increases S9.6 reads mapping to telomeric and centromeric repeats in HCC1428 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1l</xref>). Since we also observed H3K4me3 increases mapping to other repeat classes following KDM5 inhibitor exposure, we expanded the S9.6 CUT-and-Tag analysis to the rest of the repeat genome. This analysis shows that repeats that harbor KDM5 inhibitor-mediated increases in both H3K4me3 and S9.6 reads traverse multiple repeat classes, including SINEs, LINEs, and LTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4m</xref>). Repeats that do not display increases in H3K4me3 also do not show a significant increase in S9.6 reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1o</xref>). Formation of R-loops can be linked to increased transcription in repeat regions; therefore, we separated repeat elements further into three groups: those that harbor increases in H3K4me3, those that have increased mRNA expression (as measured by RNA sequencing), and those that display both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1m</xref>). While repeats in all three groups display increases in S9.6 reads upon C48 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1n and o</xref>), this increase is greatest in repeats that harbor increases in both H3K4me3 and transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1n</xref>, middle panel). Together, these analyses demonstrate that KDM5 inhibition and subsequent increases in H3K4me3 and transcription most strongly correlate with an increased prevalence of R-loops in genomic repeats in tumor cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Collectively, we show that the KDM5 demethylases regulate ‘viral mimicry” and DNA damage in luminal breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, KDM5 inhibition increases R-loop prevalence in repetitive genomic regions, triggering activation of the cGAS/STING pathway and consequent upregulation of ISGs and MHC class I surface expression. Such increases may result in combinatorial effects with immunotherapy drugs. KDM5 inhibitors also reduce cell fitness, not mediated through induction of IFN-I signaling, but rather because of a DNA damage response generated as a consequence of increased R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> for model). As mentioned above, R-loops can form during transcription and have the potential to impede replication fork progression, leading to replication stress. This interference can result in DNA damage, necessitating repair mechanisms to maintain genomic integrity. Conversely, replication stress itself might induce conditions conducive to R-loop formation, suggesting a bidirectional relationship. The study of chromatin dynamics and its impact on DNA damage and repair mechanisms has garnered significant attention in recent years. Several studies have implicated KDM5 demethylases in DDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gaillard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumbhar et al., 2021</xref>), and a recent study revealed a potential role for KDM5 in maintaining the delicate balance between transcriptional regulation and replication to preserve DNA integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Collectively, such observations suggest that KDM5 inhibitors, or other factors whose disruption or inhibition results in tumor-specific increases in R-loops, could also pair well with PARP inhibitors and other DNA damage-promoting drugs.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The KDM5 family of epigenetic regulatory enzymes reduces R-loop formation in genomic repeat regions in luminal breast cancer cells.</title><p>Genetic disruption or chemical inhibition of KDM5 causes R-loop-mediated DNA damage in luminal breast cancer cells. R-loop generated RNA:DNA hybrids also result in the activation of the cGAS/STING pathway, increasing ISG and AP signatures, as well as cell surface MHCI, which may enhance interactions with the TME. Importantly, KDM5 inhibition does not result in DNA damage or activation of the cGAS/STING pathway in normal breast epithelial cells, suggesting that KDM5 inhibitors present a wider therapeutic window in this setting than STING agonists or type I interferons.

Our data also show that KDM5 disruption or inhibition can activate T cells in a co-culture system. Important for possible combinations with TME enhancers, preliminary data suggest that there are no major negative effects of KDM5 inhibitors on primary T cells or macrophages; in fact, KDM5 inhibition may induce a more anti-tumorigenic phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and data not shown). The STING-independent KDM5 inhibitor effect on cell fitness in luminal breast cancer cells and previous observations that KDM5 disruption affects the survival of drug-tolerant persister cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vinogradova et al., 2016</xref>) suggest that there could be combinatorial potential, not only with agents that affect the TME, but also with other standard-of-care agents. Future studies will also have to explore the relevance of these findings in other cancer subtypes. For example, preliminary studies suggest that hematologic cancer cells that are sensitive to KDM5 inhibitors also display markers of IFN-I signaling activation (data not shown). Collectively, these findings expand on KDM5 inhibitors or degraders as promising candidates for single-agent cancer therapy, with further potential to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies as well as DNA damaging agents.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>HCC1428, SKBR3, and MCF7 were purchased from ATCC (CRL-2327, HTB-30, and HTB-22, respectively).

They found that a STING agonist can reactivate these pathways in breast cancer cells, but it also does so in normal cells, suggesting that this is not a good way to create a therapeutic window. Depletion of ADAR and inhibition of KDM5 also activate ISG and AP genes. The activation of ISG and AP genes is dependent on cGAS/STING and the JAK kinase. Interestingly, although both ADAR depletion and KDM5 inhibition activate ISG and AP genes, their effects on cell fitness are different. Furthermore, KDM5 inhibitor selectively activates ISG and AP genes in tumor cells but not normal cells, arguing that it may create a larger therapeutic window than the STING agonist. These results also suggest that KDM5 inhibition may activate ISG and AP genes in a way different from ADAR loss, and this process may affect tumor cell fitness independently of the activation of ISG and AP genes.</p><p>The authors further showed that KDM5 inhibition increases R-loops and DNA damage in tumor cells, and XPF, a nuclease that cuts R-loops, is required for the activation of ISG and AP genes. Using H3K4me3 CUT&amp;RUN, they found that KMD5 inhibition results in increased H3K4me3 not only at genes, but also at repetitive elements including SINE, LINE, LTR, telomeres, and centromeres. Using S9.6 CUT&amp;TAG, they confirmed that R-loops are increased at SINE, LINE, and LTR repeated with increased H3K4me3. Together, the results of this study suggest that KMD5 inhibition leads to H3K4me3 and R-loop accumulation in repetitive elements, which induces DNA damage and cGAS/STING activation and subsequently activates AP genes. This provides an exciting approach to stimulate the anti-tumor immunity against breast tumors.</p><p>KDM5 inhibition activates interferon and antigen presentation genes through

original reviews</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their careful and positive assessment of our manuscript. Maybe our findings are best summarized in the model below, showing that KDM5 inhibition/loss mediates a viral mimicry and DNA damage response through the generation of R-loops in genomic repeats. This is a different mechanism from the more well studied double-stranded RNA-induced “viral mimicry” response. Our studies also suggest that KDM5 inhibition may have a larger therapeutic window than STING agonists, since KDM5 inhibition seemingly does not induce “viral mimicry” in normal breast epithelial cells.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Model of viral mimicry activation.</title><p>De-repression of repetitive elements may trigger dsRNA formation, which activates the RIG-1/MDA5 pathway, as well as PKR. Alternatively, derepression of these elements may induce transcription replication conflicts (TRCs), resulting in R-loop formation. R-loops can lead to DNA damage, and/or activate the cGAS/STING pathway. Both the MAVS pathway and the cGAS/STING pathway converge to activate type I interferon (IFN) responses, resulting in decreased cell fitness and/or increased immunogenicity.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-106249-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We do agree with the assessment that the study would be strengthened by in vivo studies. However, there are 4 different isoforms of KDM5 (3 in females), and existing KDM5specific inhibitors do not have adequate PK/PD properties for in vivo studies. We would also like to note that most mouse studies have not been proven to accurately predict immunotherapy responses in patients. Future studies in ex vivo tumor models would strengthen the clinical relevance of these studies. In the interim, we have added some normal macrophage studies in Figure S5 and an example of studies in normal T-cells below. Such studies will also be important to ensure that future KDM5 inhibitors do not have adverse effects on the immune system. Here, we observe that KDM5 inhibition appears to have neutral or slightly reduced T cell viability with KDM5 inhibition (Author response image 2a). However, KDM5 inhibition also results in increased CD107a expression in T-cells, indicative of a more cytotoxic phenotype (Author response image 2b). These studies suggest that KDM5 inhibitors do not have significant adverse effects on T cells or macrophages (figure S5) in the normal immune environment.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>KDM5 inhibition does not have significant adverse effects on T-cells.</title><p>a) Fold change proliferation of T-cells from 2 different human donors (left and right panels on graph) activated with 0.25ug/ml CD3 and treated with the indicated concentrations of C48 or a positive control (CBLB) compared to vehicle controls. b.

Again, there are several KDM5 isoforms and looking at repeat expression in these larger data sets is complex. We have added some data correlating KDM5 expression with ISG signatures in Figure S3j-l as well as in the graph below (Author response image 3). The correlation with ISG and AP signatures is modest, but strongest for KDM5B and C in breast cancer data sets, consistent with our disruption data for these 2 isoforms. As mentioned above, we do agree that future studies of KDM5s along with a broader analysis of other epigenetic modifying enzymes over repeats in various cancer types will shed light on the role of histone modifying enzymes in suppressing “viral mimicry” in tumors.</p><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Correlation between gene expression and IFN gene set GSVA scores in breast cancer cell lines.</title><p>a) Pearson correlation score between gene expression and IFN signature (ISG) gene set variation analysis (GSVA) scores in breast cancer cell lines as reported in DepMap.

We have added data (Figure S2f) showing that this rescue is stronger in MCF7 cells. It is possible that the MDA5/MAVS pathway may also contribute to activation of the Type I interferon response. However, we have data that MAVS plays a minor (if any) role in this context, as MAVS KO minimally decreases C48-induced ISRE-GFP activity and HLA-A, B, C surface expression in HCC1428 cells (added Figure S2g).</p><p>Furthermore, there is no significant increase in dsRNA observed (using J2 antibody as a readout in immunofluorescence experiments) with C48 treatment as compared to 5’-azacytidine treatment or ADAR K/O (data not included). However, we have not performed MAVS/PKR K/O experiments to completely rule out the involvement of the dsRNA sensing pathways.</p><p>(4) These experiments were performed in the operetta imaging system, rather than confocal imaging, and therefore we do not have such images. Quantification of RNaseH1-GFP in the whole cell is reported in the figure, as RNaseH1-GFP signal is increased in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm with C48 treatment. This is not unexpected, as our data suggest that R-loop formation occurs in repetitive regions of the genome that are de-repressed by KDM5 inhibition in the nucleus, and the RNA/DNA hybrids, generated from R-loops, may activate cGAS/STING pathway in the cytoplasm.</p><p>(5) Disruption of siXPF and siXPG is relatively toxic in itself. Complete knockouts in breast cancer cells were not viable and we partially knocked down XPF using siRNA instead. We do agree that these kinds of rescue studies need to be expanded upon in future studies, but they served as further proof of the conclusions presented here.</p><p>(6) We have provided all the data in Geo and alternative representations can be made.</p><p>(7) Unfortunately, CUT-and-Tag experiments were not performed in cells expressing siXPF and therefore we cannot provide this data. However, XPF has been previously shown to be responsible for excising R-loops from the genome, rendering them detectable by cGAS/STING in the cytoplasm (Crossley et al, 2022, referenced in the current MS). Therefore, while we demonstrate that XPF knockdown attenuates type I IFN pathway activation upon KDM5 inhibition, it may not necessarily reduce R-loop formation in retroelements; it may just prevent their excision and downstream cGAS/STING activation. We do agree that CUT-and-Tag experiments in cells treated with siXPF versus siControl will have to be performed in the future to test this hypothesis.</p><p><bold>Responses to Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) We have modified the text as well as the figure legend to state that this is a simplistic representation of the pathway in normal cells. As stated in the introduction, these pathways can be modified in tumors. The data presented suggest that the dsRNA pathway can be activated in all breast cancer cell lines tested, whereas more variation is observed in the activation of the STING pathway.</p><p>(2) The ADAR guides target ADAR 110 and p150 but not ADAR2. This has been clarified in the text.</p><p>(3) The guides have been renamed in the figure as the reviewer suggests.</p><p>(4) It has been shown by others that KDM5 can occupy the STING promoter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30080846/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30080846/</ext-link>); which supports the reviewer’s suggestion that STING upregulation in HMECs may be due to increased H3K4me3 at the STING gene. However, we argue that STING upregulation is not sufficient to activate “viral mimicry” due to the absence of “tumor-specific R-loops” (due to an increase in TRC in tumor cells) in normal cells. It is interesting to note that the S9.6 signal in subtelomeric regions is increased in HMECS similar to what is observed in tumor cells. However, the S9.6 signal over other repeats is not (Author response image 4), suggesting that C48-induced increases over non-telomeric repeats are tumor specific. This suggests that the tumor-specific increases in R-loop formation, which lead to “viral mimicry” activation, are not driven by those formed in subtelomeric regions. Future studies will have to expand on these findings.</p><fig id="sa3fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Percent of S9.6 reads that align to repetitive genome in HMEC cells.</title><p>(a) % of total aligned S9.6 reads that map to subtelomeric region in HMEC cells treated with DMSO or 2.5 μM C48.

Mean fluorescence intensity in the whole cell (this includes both nuclear and cytoplasmic signals) was quantified together and normalized to the number of DAPI-stained nuclei per well. As mentioned above all quantified in the Operetta imaging system.</p><p>(6) We have added some data that shows that increases in H3K4me3 is observed in and around ISGs upon KDM5 inhibition (Figure S4f). However, without time course experiments it is difficult to assess whether these are direct effects of the KDM5 inhibitor or indirect effects from activation of Type I IFN (similarly to what has previously been reported with 5’-azacytidine induction of “viral mimicry”, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26317465/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26317465/</ext-link>).</p><p>(7) We have previously included data showing that S9.6 reads in repeats that do not display C48-mediated increases in H3K4me3 also do not increase with C48 treatment (this is now Figure S4o). In addition, we have added some data showing that repeats with increased H3K4me3 and repeats with increased transcription upon C48 treatment also have increased S9.6 reads. Repeats that display both increases in H3K4me3 and mRNA expression have even greater increases in S9.6 signal compared to repeats that have increases in either one (Figure S4m-n). Taken together, this data suggest that KDM5 inhibition increases H3K4me3 in repeats, thereby allowing for their transcription, which can increase the probability of Transcription replication conflicts (TRC) and R-loop formation at such loci.</p><p>(8) As mentioned earlier in this response, while we observe increased S9.6 reads in subtelomeric regions of HCC1428 cells upon KDM5 inhibition, we also observe this in normal HMEC cells. Since KDM5 inhibition does not induce viral mimicry in HMEC cells, this suggests that R-loops formed in subtelomeric regions do not dictate the response observed with C48 treatment in breast cancer cells.</p><p>We hope that these answers to the reviewers comments as well as the additional data provided strengthens our findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
