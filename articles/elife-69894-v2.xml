However, it is not clear whether systemic factors beyond the local niche are required for these essential processes in vivo. Thrombopoietin (THPO) is a key cytokine promoting hematopoietic rebound after myeloablation and its transcripts are expressed by multiple cellular sources. The upregulation of bone marrow-derived THPO has been proposed to be crucial for hematopoietic recovery and HSC regeneration after stress. Nonetheless, the cellular source of THPO in myeloablative stress has never been investigated genetically. We assessed the functional sources of THPO following two common myeloablative perturbations: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) administration and irradiation. Using a <italic>Thpo</italic> translational reporter, we found that the liver but not the bone marrow is the major source of THPO protein after myeloablation. Mice with conditional <italic>Thpo</italic> deletion from osteoblasts and/or bone marrow stromal cells showed normal recovery of HSCs and hematopoiesis after myeloablation. In contrast, mice with conditional <italic>Thpo</italic> deletion from hepatocytes showed significant defects in HSC regeneration and hematopoietic rebound after myeloablation. Thus, systemic THPO from the liver is necessary for HSC regeneration and hematopoietic recovery in myeloablative stress conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hematopoietic stem cell</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>thrombopoietin</kwd><kwd>myeloablation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL132074</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL153487</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL155868</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012636</institution-id><institution>New York State Stem Cell Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Training grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Longfei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F30HL137323</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Decker</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001447</institution-id><institution>Rita Allen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006984</institution-id><institution>Irma T.

They reside in the bone marrow niche where Leptin Receptor<sup>+</sup> (LepR<sup>+</sup>) perivascular stromal cells and endothelial cells are key components. These stromal cells are the major sources of factors that promote HSC maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding and Morrison, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Following myeloablative stress, the bone marrow niche supports HSC regeneration, which is essential for the recovery of hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hooper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kopp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Several signaling pathways, including Notch, EGF/EGFR, pleiotrophin, Dkk1, angiogenin, and SCF/c-KIT, are essential for the regeneration of HSCs and hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Butler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goncalves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Himburg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Himburg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kimura et al., 2011</xref>). Many of the secreted cytokines activating these pathways arise from the local bone marrow niche and regulate HSC regeneration and hematopoietic recovery in a paracrine fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Himburg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poulos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is not clear whether systemic signals that originate outside the bone marrow also promote HSC regeneration and hematopoietic recovery after stress.</p><p>Thrombopoietin (THPO) is critical for bone marrow HSC maintenance and hematopoietic recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Decker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mouthon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yoshihara et al., 2007</xref>). It was first identified as the ligand to the MPL receptor and a driver of megakaryopoiesis and platelet production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Sauvage et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaushansky et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lok et al., 1994</xref>). Later results show that the THPO/MPL signaling is also required for the maintenance of HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kimura et al., 1998</xref>). Circulating levels of THPO are inversely related to platelet counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">de Graaf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaushansky, 2005</xref>), consistent with a ‘receptor sink’ model where HSCs are stimulated to proliferate and self-renew by free systemic THPO ligand, which is gradually soaked up by the expanding population of MPL-expressing progenies until equilibrium is reached. In line with this model, deletion of the MPL receptor from megakaryocyte-lineage cells does not lead to a loss of megakaryocytes or platelets, instead, leads to an expansion of HSCs with accompanying megakaryocytosis and thrombocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ng et al., 2014</xref>). By conditionally deleting <italic>Thpo</italic> from the bone marrow or liver, we have recently showed that steady-state HSC maintenance depends on hepatocyte-derived THPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Decker et al., 2018</xref>), further highlighting the importance of systemic THPO on HSCs.</p><p>The THPO/MPL signaling also plays a crucial role in hematopoietic stress response, particularly after myeloablation. The characteristic hematopoietic progenitor rebound at around 10 days following administration of the antimetabolite drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is dependent on MPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li and Slayton, 2013</xref>). After irradiation, the THPO/MPL signaling is similarly essential for hematopoietic recovery and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Laval et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">de Laval et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mouthon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, THPO mimetic drugs, such as romiplostim and eltrombopag, have been shown to improve recovery after ablative challenge, and have also been used clinically to support hematopoiesis in diseases such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura and aplastic anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Desmond et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodeghiero and Ruggeri, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamaguchi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The regulation of THPO production has been extensively investigated, but the in vivo source of THPO for HSC regeneration and hematopoietic recovery after myeloablation is not clear. Previous studies have found that bone marrow cell populations such as stromal cells and osteoblasts may upregulate THPO in hematopoietic stress conditions, whereas the liver produces <italic>Thpo</italic> transcripts at a constant level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sungaran et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yoshihara et al., 2007</xref>). However, other investigators have found no significant changes in bone marrow <italic>Thpo</italic> transcript levels after 5-FU-mediated myeloablative treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li and Slayton, 2013</xref>). Because <italic>Thpo</italic> expression is under heavy translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghilardi et al., 1998</xref>), it is not clear what cells produce THPO protein for HSC regeneration and hematopoietic recovery after myeloablation. Furthermore, although upregulation of THPO may be a key mechanism of the bone marrow response to hematopoietic stress, the role of local THPO from bone marrow niche or systemic THPO from the liver for HSC and hematopoietic recovery has not been functionally investigated in vivo. Nonetheless, most studies proposed that local THPO derived from the bone marrow niche is critical for HSC and hematopoietic recovery after myeloablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaushansky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yoshihara et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we genetically dissected the in vivo source of THPO for HSC regeneration and hematopoietic recovery following myeloablative stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Myeloablation induced by 5-FU drives THPO-dependent hematopoietic recovery and HSC expansion</title><p>5-FU is a commonly used chemotherapy agent that leads to myeloablation. To test whether THPO is required for hematopoietic recovery after 5-FU treatment, we administrated 5-FU to <italic>Thpo</italic> knockout (<italic>Thpo<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Decker et al., 2018</xref>) and wild-type control mice at 150 mg/kg via a single intraperitoneal injection. Because <italic>Thpo<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice have hematopoietic phenotypes compared with wild-type controls without any treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Decker et al., 2018</xref>), we also normalized hematopoietic parameters with baseline mice of the same genotype without any treatment. Ten days after the 5-FU administration, treated wild-type mice showed normal leukocyte and neutrophil counts, normal reticulocyte frequency, but significantly increased platelet counts, while treated <italic>Thpo<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice had no platelet expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-H</xref>). When normalized to baseline levels, <italic>Thpo<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice had a significant reduction of leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts as well as reticulocyte frequency compared with wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-H</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Thpo</italic> is required for hematopoietic recovery.

The frequencies of bone marrow and spleen HSCs (Lineage<sup>-</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> c-kit<sup>+</sup> CD150<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>-</sup>, LSKCD150<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>-</sup>) were increased by more than 12 fold in 5-FU-treated wild-type mice compared with baseline controls, while 5-FU-treated <italic>Thpo<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice showed no change from the baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1M-P</xref>).

These data confirm that hematopoietic recovery, expansion of HSCs, and hematopoietic progenitors following chemoablation mediated by 5-FU are THPO-dependent.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Hepatic but not bone marrow THPO is required for HSC and hematopoietic recovery after 5-FU-mediated myeloablation</title><p>To identify the source of THPO, we investigated <italic>Thpo</italic> expression following 5-FU treatment.

To address whether hepatic THPO is required for hematopoietic recovery and HSC regeneration after 5-FU-mediated stress, we treated adult <italic>Thpo<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice with replication incompetent hepatotropic AAV8-TBG-cre viral vector (AAV) concurrently with 5-FU injection.

Although the response of spleen HSC frequency to 5-FU was not significantly impacted by AAV treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>), the responses of bone marrow HSC frequency and the total number of HSCs were significantly decreased in AAV-treated mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–J</xref>), indicating a compromised HSC recovery after 5-FU treatment. Of note, we observed a significant increase of the responses of spleen cellularity to 5-FU by AAV treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>), indicating possible enhanced extramedullary hematopoiesis. Consistent with reduced HSC regeneration, bone marrow cells from these AAV-treated mice after 5-FU administration showed a significant reduction in reconstituting irradiated recipient mice compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). The responses of bone marrow and spleen LSK frequencies to 5-FU were largely normal in AAV-treated mice compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J-M</xref>), suggesting that the effects of acutely disrupted THPO signaling are most pronounced on HSCs, rather than restricted hematopoietic progenitors.

Although we did not exhaustively investigate all models of ablative conditioning, it appears that the bone marrow is not a functional source of THPO in hematopoietic recovery from acute myeloablative stress. However, our data do not rule out the possibility that bone marrow may serve as a source of THPO in certain specific stress conditions, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sungaran et al., 1997</xref>). Future investigation into additional stress conditions is needed. We found that hepatocytes are an important source of THPO for stress hematopoiesis. Although several other studies have investigated the role of THPO on hematopoietic recovery after stress, the source of THPO and its impact on HSCs (rather than hematopoietic progenitors) have not been determined. By examining HSCs and hematopoietic progenitors, we show that HSCs are more sensitive to acute THPO perturbation than hematopoietic progenitors (LSKs), suggesting the major role of THPO in myeloablation is to promote HSC regeneration, at least under the conditions we studied. To our knowledge, THPO is the first systemic factor required for HSC regeneration and hematopoietic recovery identified to date. The presence of a stem cell hormone, like THPO, raises the possibility of other endocrine regulators of HSC regeneration and hematopoietic recovery.</p><p>Numerous connections between hepatic and hematopoietic pathophysiology have long been appreciated. Aplastic anemia is a known sequela of pediatric liver failure, and thrombocytopenia is a well-characterized feature of hepatic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hadzić et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peck-Radosavljevic, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tung et al., 2000</xref>). While mechanisms such as metabolic toxicity and splenic sequestration may play a role in mediating these effects, it seems likely that disruption of the THPO signaling is also involved. Indeed, several recent clinical studies have shown that newly developed THPO agonists can reduce the need for platelet transfusions in patients with chronic liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peck-Radosavljevic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu and Cai, 2019</xref>). While early trials of THPO mimetics in primary and acquired aplastic anemia have been promising, to our knowledge, no group has specifically studied their use in liver failure-associated aplastic anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Desmond et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gill et al., 2017</xref>). Given that hepatic <italic>Thpo</italic> mRNA and serum THPO levels are significantly downregulated in liver failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wolber et al., 1999</xref>), further studies are warranted. Our data suggest that cancer patients with underlying liver disease may have greater sensitivity to myeloablative conditioning and supplementing THPO mimetics may help alleviate the adverse effects associated with myeloablative conditioning in these patients. On the other hand, THPO may also have effects on cells beyond the hematopoietic system. For example, a recent report suggests that in hepatocellular carcinoma, THPO may facilitate tumor progression by promoting VEGF signaling in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vizio et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, strategies aimed at manipulating the THPO pathway need careful evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

AAV8-TBG-cre was administered to mice via retro-orbital venous sinus injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Complete blood count</title><p>Peripheral blood was collected to EDTA tubes (Microvette CB300, Sarstedt) to prevent clogging. Blood samples were then run on a complete blood count analyzer (Genesis, Oxford Science).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Bone marrow cells were isolated by flushing the long bones or by crushing the long bones, pelvis, and vertebrae with mortar and pestle in Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free HBSS with 2% heat-inactivated bovine serum. Spleen cells were obtained by crushing the spleens between two glass slides. The cells were passed through a 25 G needle several times and filtered with a 70 μm nylon mesh. The following antibodies were used to perform HSC staining: lineage markers (anti-CD2 [RM2-5], anti-CD3 [17A2], anti-CD5 [53–7.3], anti-CD8a [53–6.7], anti-B220 [6B2], anti-Gr-1 [8C5], anti-Ter119), anti-Sca-1 (E13-161.7), anti-c-kit (2B8), anti-CD48 (HM48-1), anti-CD150 (TC15-12F12.2).</p><p>For flow cytometric sorting of bone marrow stromal cells, bone marrow plugs were flushed as described above, then digested with collagenase IV (200 U/mL) and DNase1 (200 U/mL) at 37°C for 20 min. Samples were then stained with anti-CD45 (30 F-11) and anti-Ter119 antibodies and sorted on a flow cytometer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>Cells were lysed in Trizol. Total RNA was extracted according to manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) or ProtoScript II (NEB). Quantitative real-time PCR was run using SYBR green on a CFX Connect system (Biorad). β-Actin (<italic>Actb</italic>) was used to normalize the RNA content of samples.

The bones were then embedded in 8% gelatin, immediately snap-frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>, and stored at –80°C. Bones were sectioned using a CryoJane system (Instrumedics). For liver, cardiac perfusion with formalin was performed immediately after mouse sacrifice, and perfused liver tissue was dehydrated in a 30% sucrose solution overnight at 4°C. Liver tissue was then placed in PELCO Cryo-Embedding compound (Ted Pella, Inc), frozen on dry ice, and stored at –80°C. Liver tissue was sectioned and directly transferred onto microscope slides. Both bone and liver sections were dried overnight at room temperature and stored at –80°C. Sections were rehydrated in PBS for 5 min, stained with DAPI for 15 min, then mounted with Vectashield Hardset Antifade Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories). An rabbit anti-HNF4α antibody (AbCam, ab201460) was used to stain hepatocytes. Images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse Ti confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments) or a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Long-term competitive reconstitution assay</title><p>Adult recipient mice were lethally irradiated by a Cesium 137 Irradiator (JL Shepherd and Associates) at 300 rad/min with two doses of 550 rad (total 1100 rad) delivered at least 2 hr apart. Cells were transplanted by retro-orbital venous sinus injection of anesthetized mice. Donor bone marrow cells were transplanted along with recipient bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice. For irradiation-induced myeloablation, the competing recipient bone marrow cells were from mice that were irradiated similarly as the donor mice. Mice were maintained on antibiotic water (Baytril 0.17 g/L) for 14 days, then switched to regular water. Recipient mice were periodically bled to assess the level of donor-derived blood lineages, including myeloid, B, and T cells for at least 16 weeks. Blood was subjected to ammonium chloride potassium red cell lysis before antibody staining. Antibodies including anti-CD45.2 (104), anti-CD45.1 (A20), anti-CD3 (17A2), anti-B220 (6B2), anti-Gr-1 (8C5), and anti-Mac-1 (M1/70) were used to stain cells. Mice with presence of donor-derived myeloid, B, and T cells for 16 weeks were considered as long-term multilineage reconstituted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All analyses were done using GraphPad Prism 7.0. In any comparison between a pooled control cohort and multiple experimental conditions, we used one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s test. In any comparison between control and mutant in multiple experimental conditions, we used two-way ANOVA with Turkey’s test. For surviving curve comparison, we used Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. For transplantation experiments, we used Fisher’s exact test. For all other comparisons, we used unpaired t-test. In all figures, error bars represent standard error of mean.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>none</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All mice were housed in specific pathogen-free, Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)- approved facilities at the Columbia University Medical Center.

These mice can respond in the absence of intact Thpo/Mpl signaling. These data are contradictory to what is shown here. What could be the explanation for that?</p><p>14) The major difference between using Cre-deleter mice in contrast to the AAV mediated application is that in the latter case Thpo is deleted in an adult mouse while in the other case, mice have develop under the condition that no Thpo is supplied from the bone marrow niche (osteoblasts or mesenchymal cells, accordingly). This questions whether these two scenarios can be safely compared. Similar to this, the inhibition of Thpo/Mpl signaling by a dominant-negative Mpl receptor in the adult mouse causes severe and lethal aplasia (Wicke et al., Mol Ther 2010), while the germ line knockout of Mpl or Thpo is in general well tolerated in the mouse and HSC defects get only more obvious after transplantation (Alexander et al., Blood 1996; Kimura et al., PNAS 1998; deSauvage et al., J Ex Med 1996; Yoshihara et al., CSC 2007, Qian et al., CSC 2007). What was the rational to use the AAV8 Cre delivery in contrast to using a deleter mouse with liver-specific Cre expression?</p><p>15) The spread in the data after AAV application to mice may be caused by differences in the transduction efficiencies in the liver. How efficient was the deletion in the liver after AAV application?</p><p>16) In the transplantation experiment, the donor mice were treated with AAV-Cre. To address the role of hepatic Thpo in the recovery after transplantation, it would be of interest to delete Thpo in the recipients.</p><p>17) The transplantation of irradiated BM cells should in general not lead to a successful engraftment of these cells. What is the aim of this experiment?</p><p>18) What is the threshold of donor contribution that is judged as positive engraftment?</p><p>19) As mentioned above, the study shows that, similarly to what occurs in bone marrow HSC maintenance in steady-state conditions, hepatic TPO appears to be a major functional trigger for hematopoietic recovery and HSC regeneration after myelosuppression caused by radio-chemotherapy injury.</p><p>To avoid misleading conclusions and thus contribute to clinical medicine more precisely, the experimental design of the study must relate to a tumor context, since radio-chemotherapies play an established role in the treatment of cancer patients. The genetically modified animal models must have pathophysiological characteristics as comparable as possible to those that occur in humans (for animal-to-human extrapolation).</p><p>We thus recommend that the reported experiments be flanked by others run upon a murine tumor model.</p><p>20) Since it has been shown that TPO is an important and nonredundant regulator of VEGF-A production in HSCs, and that is activates a VEGF-A internal autocrine loop, participating in the favorable TPO effects on HSC self-renewal and expansion (Kirito K et al., Blood. 2005; 105:4258) it would be interesting to investigate the contribution of this mechanism to the efficacy of hepatic TPO in hematopoietic recovery in stress conditions in genetically altered mouse models. This would be of interest in particular because VEGF-A, notoriously elevated in a tumor context, could also be counted among the endocrine factors which, together with TPO, contribute to bone marrow recovery, as suggested in the discussion.</p><p>21) In the discussion, in the light of their data, the authors assume that cancer patients with underlying liver disease, such as HCC, may have enhanced sensitivity to myeloablative conditioning because of liver-failure-related hepatic downregulated TPO levels. Since TPO mimetic drugs, such as romiplostim and eltrombopag, have been shown to improve recovery after ablative challenge, the authors suggest that these agents could help alleviate the adverse effects associated with myeloablative conditioning in such patients.</p><p>However, it has recently been reported that, in the HCC context (Vizio B et al., Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 1818), the increased hepatic TPO level appears to be a novel triggering signal to promote tumor progression. Therefore, curative strategies aimed at manipulating THPOR in HCC patients should be evaluated with extreme care.</p><p>The possibility of tumor conditioning should be pointed out, and recent literature in this connection included in the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69894.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors only assessed the transcriptional regulation of TPO after 5FU in the bone marrow.

We initially hypothesized that THPO from the local bone marrow niche is for HSC regeneration after myeloablation, but this does not turn out to be true. Because only 5-FU and irradiation conditions were tested, we can not completely rule out the possibility that locally produced THPO plays roles for HSC regeneration in other stress conditions.

Inflammation or bleeding is not considered as myeloablation. However, as the reviewer pointed out, inflammation and bleeding are also interesting conditions to look at. This is something we plan to work on in the future and out of the scope of the current study. Please note that, regardless what the results of these future experiments may be, they will not change the main conclusion of the current manuscript, which focuses on the major acute myeloablation conditions. The impact of liver-derived THPO on reticulocytes depends on the treatment condition. Under the steady-state condition, deletion of <italic>Thpo</italic> from the liver did not lead to a significant alteration of reticulocyte frequencies (Figure 2-figure supplement 1 H, I and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 G, H). Under 5-FU treatment, deletion of <italic>Thpo</italic> from the liver led to a trend in reduction of reticulocyte frequency compared with controls (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 H, I). Under irradiation condition, deletion of <italic>Thpo</italic> from the liver did not lead to a significant difference of reticulocyte frequencies (Figure 4—figure supplement 1 G, H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) What it the rational to move some of the data to the supplements, while others are kept in the main figures? e.g Figure 1 showing no effects in the deleted mice throughout the figure, in Figure 2 the leukocytes, neutrophiles counts etc. moved to S3?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We organized the data based on myeloablative conditions (5-FU vs irradiation) and where <italic>Thpo</italic> is deleted (local bone marrow vs the liver) in the original version of the manuscript. Because deletion of <italic>Thpo</italic> from the liver leads to phenotypes in the hematopoietic system under the steady-state condition, we need to show normalized phenotypes, such as in Figure 2A. As a result, the data from mice with <italic>Thpo</italic> deleted from the liver are more complicated. Thus we moved the data showing no differences to Supplementary Figures in the original version of the manuscript. We agree with the reviewer that the data in the figures can be better organized to be consistent throughout. We modified the figures by moving all peripheral blood data in Figures 2 and 4 into Supplementary Figures in the revised manscript, as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) AAV stands for adeno-associated viral vector, not adenovirus and also not adeno-associated virus, as the AAV used in the study is replication incompetent and should be addressed as vector.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the confusion.

Mice with <italic>Thpo</italic> deleted from the bone marrow did not have any phenotypes under the steady-state condition. A direct comparison among these mice under 5-FU or irradiation conditions would be appropriate (e.g. Figure 1). However, mice with <italic>Thpo</italic> deleted from the hepatocytes (AAV-treated mice) have hematopoietic phenotypes under the steady-state condition. We need to normalize the data under 5-FU and irradiation conditions to the baseline (mice with same genotype under the steady-state condition). It would be inappropriate and confusing to directly compare the data from the mice with <italic>Thpo</italic> deleted from the bone marrow with those with <italic>Thpo</italic> deleted from the liver (AAV-treated mice). Therefore, we separated the data of mice with <italic>Thpo</italic> deleted from the bone marrow from the data of mice with <italic>Thpo</italic> deleted from the liver (AAV-treated mice) into different figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The response in platelet counts after 5-FU administration in Mpl-/- mice has been studied (Levin et al., Blood 2001).

We thus analyzed mice at day 10 after 5-FU administration. Note that Levin et al., (Blood 2001 98:1019) show that at day 10 after 5-FU treatment, <italic>Mpl</italic>-/- mice have significant defects in platelet recovery (see Figure 1A therein). At day 20-25, <italic>Mpl</italic>-/- mice can catch up and have relatively normal platelet counts compared to controls. Subsequently, their platelet levels decrease again. It appears that <italic>Mpl</italic>-/- mice can transiently produce platelet in respond to 5-FU through THPO-independent mechanisms, although the peak response is much lower and later than wild-type mice. Nonetheless, their day 10 data are consistent with ours in that efficient platelet rebound at this stage is <italic>Thpo/Mpl</italic>-dependent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The major difference between using Cre-deleter mice in contrast to the AAV mediated application is that in the latter case Thpo is deleted in an adult mouse while in the other case, mice have develop under the condition that no Thpo is supplied from the bone marrow niche (osteoblasts or mesenchymal cells, accordingly).

Wicke et al., (Mol Ther 2010 18:343) used an <italic>Mpl</italic> overexpression model but not a dominant-negative <italic>Mpl</italic> model in adult mice. The adult inducible <italic>Thpo</italic> knockout mice have similar phenotypes in the hematopoietic system to the germline <italic>Thpo</italic> knockout mice (Science 2018 360:106), suggesting the adaptation to <italic>Thpo</italic> depletion during development is unlikely. However, this important point needs some consideration. No THPO protein (as can be detected by our reporter mice) is generated in the bone marrow. And mice with <italic>Thpo</italic> deleted from the bone marrow niche have no phenotypes, either under the steady-state condition or after myeloablation. It is thus unlikely that HSCs and the hematopoietic system adapt to <italic>Thpo</italic> deletion in these knockout mice. The most plausible explanation for the lack of phenotype is that bone marrow-derived THPO (if any) is not required for HSC regeneration after myeloablation. We have used mouse models with Cre specifically expressed in the hepatocytes (<italic>Alb-cre</italic>) to delete <italic>Thpo</italic>. <italic>Alb-cre; Thpo</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice have a severe depletion of HSCs (virtually complete depletion) under the steady-state condition (Science 2018 360:106). It is thus technically difficult to normalize the parameters in myeloablation conditions to the baseline levels which have nearly no HSCs in these mice. In addition, <italic>Alb-cre; Thpo</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice do not survive the myeloablation well. Thus, we used acute inducible <italic>Thpo</italic> deletion model with AAV8-TBG-cre.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) The spread in the data after AAV application to mice may be caused by differences in the transduction efficiencies in the liver. How efficient was the deletion in the liver after AAV application?</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the deletion efficiency in the liver after the AAV application. Over 99% <italic>Thpo</italic> transcripts were depleted. The new data have been added to Figure 2-figure supplement 1 A in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) In the transplantation experiment, the donor mice were treated with AAV-Cre.

The purpose of the transplantation experiments is to show that there is a reduction of HSC function in mice with <italic>Thpo</italic> deleted from the hepatocytes by AAV treatment, independent of the surface marker profiles assayed by flow cytometry. Our data suggest that there is a reduction of HSC function in AAV-treated mice after myeloablation compared with controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) The transplantation of irradiated BM cells should in general not lead to a successful engraftment of these cells. What is the aim of this experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>See response to question # 16. The purpose of the transplantation experiments is to confirm functional HSC reduction. We have transplanted a large number of bone marrow cells (1 million together with 1 million irradiated competitor cells) and observed significant differences between AAV- and PBS-treated mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) What is the threshold of donor contribution that is judged as positive engraftment?</p></disp-quote><p>We set up the threshold based on background staining in recipient-type mice without transplantation in multilineage (myeloid, B and T cells, typically &lt;0.5%). Mice with longterm multilineage reconstitution were regarded as positive engraftment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) As mentioned above, the study shows that, similarly to what occurs in bone marrow HSC maintenance in steady-state conditions, hepatic TPO appears to be a major functional trigger for hematopoietic recovery and HSC regeneration after myelosuppression caused by radio-chemotherapy injury.</p><p>To avoid misleading conclusions and thus contribute to clinical medicine more precisely, the experimental design of the study must relate to a tumor context, since radio-chemotherapies play an established role in the treatment of cancer patients. The genetically modified animal models must have pathophysiological characteristics as comparable as possible to those that occur in humans (for animal-to-human extrapolation).</p><p>We thus recommend that the reported experiments be flanked by others run upon a murine tumor model.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer can see, our study here focuses on the identification of the cellular source of THPO for HSC regeneration and hematopoietic recovery after myeloablation. Through analyzing conditional knockout mice under two major clinically relevant myeloablative conditions (5-FU and irradiation), we showed that THPO from hepatocytes was important for HSC regeneration after myeloablation. Myeloablation is typically associated with chemo- or radio-therapy. Therefore, we believe that our findings are clinically relevant. Introducing a tumor to our experimental system may make the interpretation of the results complicated as the tumor (depending on the tumor type) may directly or indirectly contribute to the regulation of HSC regeneration. In addition, performing careful in vivo experiments on a murine tumor model using our <italic>Thpo</italic> conditional knockout mice as suggested by the reviewer requires extensive time and efforts. Although this is something worth investigating in the future, importantly, regardless what the results of these <italic>Thpo</italic> conditional knockout mice on a murine tumor model will be, they will not change our major conclusion in the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) Since it has been shown that TPO is an important and nonredundant regulator of VEGF-A production in HSCs, and that is activates a VEGF-A internal autocrine loop, participating in the favorable TPO effects on HSC self-renewal and expansion (Kirito K et al., Blood. 2005; 105:4258) it would be interesting to investigate the contribution of this mechanism to the efficacy of hepatic TPO in hematopoietic recovery in stress conditions in genetically altered mouse models. This would be of interest in particular because VEGF-A, notoriously elevated in a tumor context, could also be counted among the endocrine factors which, together with TPO, contribute to bone marrow recovery, as suggested in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this interesting point regarding how THPO may promote HSC self-renewal and expansion. Kirito K et al., (Blood 2005 105:4258) show that THPO promotes VEGF-A expression in hematopoietic progenitors (Sca1+cKit+Gr1-). The authors further show that inhibition of the VEGF signaling with SU5416 (a VEGFR inhibitor) reduces the survival and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors in response to THPO in vitro. Consistent with an earlier report (Nature 2002 417:954), the authors conclude that THPO promotes VEGF production in hematopoietic progenitors/HSCs probably through an intracellular autocrine loop. That is, the effects of VEGF are HSC-intrinsic and do not seem to depend on its secretion outside of the cell, but rather rely on its intracellular roles, since treating HSCs with cell permeable VEGFR inhibitors, but not soluble VEGFR-IgG chimeric protein, leads to their death and compromised reconstitution (Nature 2002 417:954). The focus of our current study is to elucidate the cellular source of THPO for HSC regeneration after myeloablation. The VEGF link is interesting, but it appears to be a downstream event after HSCs receive THPO signaling and probably should not be counted as an endocrine factor, particularly given that VEGF seems to act as an intracellular signal. Investigating the role of VEGF in vivo requires careful and long-term mouse genetic experiments. However, no matter what the results of these experiments may be, these studies will not impact our conclusions here. Nonetheless, we have performed qPCR to measure <italic>Vegfa</italic> levels in HSCs after <italic>Thpo</italic> was conditionally deleted from hepatocytes. We found no significant differences of <italic>Vegfa</italic> expression in HSCs from the conditional knockout mice compared with controls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). This result is somewhat surprising. The cell purity could be a major factor as Kirito K et al., (Blood 2005 105:4258) examined Sca1+cKit+Gr1- hematopoietic progenitors while we used LSKCD150+CD48- HSCs.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Deletion of <italic>Thpo</italic> from hepatocytes does not lead to changes in <italic>Vegfa</italic> expression in HSCs.</title><p>qPCR analysis showing that LSKCD150+CD48- HSCs from AAV-treated <italic>Thpo</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice had similar <italic>Vegfa</italic> expression levels as PBS-treated controls. n = 3 mice for each condition.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69894-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) In the discussion, in the light of their data, the authors assume that cancer patients with underlying liver disease, such as HCC, may have enhanced sensitivity to myeloablative conditioning because of liver-failure-related hepatic downregulated TPO levels. Since TPO mimetic drugs, such as romiplostim and eltrombopag, have been shown to improve recovery after ablative challenge, the authors suggest that these agents could help alleviate the adverse effects associated with myeloablative conditioning in such patients.</p><p>However, it has recently been reported that, in the HCC context (Vizio B et al., Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 1818), the increased hepatic TPO level appears to be a novel triggering signal to promote tumor progression. Therefore, curative strategies aimed at manipulating THPOR in HCC patients should be evaluated with extreme care.</p><p>The possibility of tumor conditioning should be pointed out, and recent literature in this connection included in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this potential issue. By no means do we suggest that promoting the THPO pathway will be universally beneficial. We have cited the paper and added discussion that strategies aimed at promoting the THPO pathway for myeloablation need careful evaluation as THPO could promote some other aspect of the pathology.</p></body></sub-article></article>
