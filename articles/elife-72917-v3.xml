Of this family, Schwann cells express <italic>Hdac4</italic>, <italic>5</italic>, and <italic>7</italic> but not <italic>Hdac9</italic>. Here, we show that a transcription factor regulated genetic compensatory mechanism within this family of proteins, blocks negative regulators of myelination ensuring peripheral nerve developmental myelination and remyelination after injury. Thus, when <italic>Hdac4</italic> and <italic>5</italic> are knocked-out from Schwann cells in mice, a JUN-dependent mechanism induces the compensatory overexpression of <italic>Hdac7</italic> permitting, although with a delay, the formation of the myelin sheath. When <italic>Hdac4</italic>, <italic>5</italic>, and <italic>7</italic> are simultaneously removed, the myocyte-specific enhancer-factor d (MEF2D) binds to the promoter and induces the de novo expression of <italic>Hdac9</italic>, and although several melanocytic lineage genes are misexpressed and Remak bundle structure is disrupted, myelination proceeds after a long delay. Thus, our data unveil a finely tuned compensatory mechanism within the class IIa <italic>Hdac</italic> family, coordinated by distinct transcription factors, that guarantees the ability of Schwann cells to myelinate during development and remyelinate after nerve injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myelin</kwd><kwd>Schwann cells</kwd><kwd>class II HDACs</kwd><kwd>gene compensation</kwd><kwd>nerve development</kwd><kwd>nerve regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2016-75864R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cabedo</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2019-109762RB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cabedo</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ISABIAL</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UGP18-257</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cabedo</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ISABIAL</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UGP-2019-128</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cabedo</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Conselleria de Cultura, Educación y Ciencia, Generalitat Valenciana</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PROMETEO 2018/114</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gallar</surname><given-names>Juana</given-names></name><name><surname>Cabedo</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Conselleria de Cultura, Educación y Ciencia, Generalitat Valenciana</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ACIF/2 017/169</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frutos-Rincón</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003176</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FPU16/00283</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Velasco</surname><given-names>Enrique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>206634/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arthur-Farraj</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Myelin generation during development and nerve regeneration is guaranteed by responsive backup circuits that coordinate class IIa HDACs to repress the expression of negative regulators of myelination and permit Schwann cell differentiation in response to cAMP.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the postnatal development of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), immature Schwann cells ensheath large caliber axons of sensory and motor neurons and differentiate, forming myelin, a highly specialized plasma membrane that increases nerve impulse velocity by allowing saltatory conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jessen and Mirsky, 2005</xref>). Immature Schwann cells downregulate the transcription factor <italic>Jun</italic> (which negatively regulates myelination) and upregulate the expression of transcriptional regulators of myelination such as <italic>Krox-20</italic> and <italic>Yy1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fazal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Monk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Parkinson et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Jun</italic> is strongly reexpressed after nerve injury enabling trans-differentiation of Schwann cells into a repair phenotype that promotes axon regeneration and functional nerve repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>). After axon regeneration Schwann cells reestablish contact with them and downregulate <italic>Jun</italic>. This allows reexpression of <italic>Krox-20</italic> and the consequent reactivation of a gene expression program aimed at remyelination of axons and reestablishment of nerve function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stassart and Woodhoo, 2021</xref>). Activation of Gpr126, a G-protein-coupled receptor that increases intracellular levels of cAMP, is required for Schwann cell myelination and remyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Monk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Monk et al., 2011</xref>). We have recently shown that the prodifferentiating activity of cAMP is in part mediated by its ability to shuttle HDAC4 into the nucleus of Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomis-Coloma et al., 2018</xref>). Nuclear HDAC4 recruits the complex NcoR1/HDAC3 and deacetylates histone three on the promoter of <italic>Jun</italic>, repressing its expression. At the same time HDAC4 promotes <italic>Krox-20</italic> expression and activation of the myelination program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Velasco-Aviles et al., 2018</xref>). In vivo, <italic>Hdac5</italic> is able to partially compensate for the loss of <italic>Hdac4</italic> expression in Schwann cells and only the removal of both <italic>Hdac4</italic> and <italic>Hdac5</italic> from Schwann cells leads to an obvious myelination delay. Surprisingly by postnatal day 8, myelination in <italic>Hdac4/5</italic> double knockout mice proceeds at the same pace as in wild-type nerves, suggesting that there is an additional compensatory mechanism permitting nerve myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomis-Coloma et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we show that the in vivo elimination of <italic>Hdac4</italic> and <italic>Hdac5</italic> from Schwann cells induces the overexpression of <italic>Hdac7</italic> through a mechanism mediated by the transcription factor JUN. Notably, the removal of <italic>Hdac7</italic> from Schwann cells in the absence of <italic>Hdac4</italic> and <italic>Hdac5</italic> produces a much longer delay in myelin development. This demonstrates that overexpressed <italic>Hdac7</italic> can partially compensate for the absence of both <italic>Hdac4</italic> and <italic>Hdac5</italic> in myelinating Schwann cells. Interestingly, nonmyelin-forming Schwann cells in these triple knock-outs (KOs) misexpress melanocytic lineage genes and fail to properly segregate small caliber axons in the Remak bundles. We show that genetic compensation also plays a pivotal role during remyelination after nerve injury. Thus, and akin to what happens during development, remyelination is delayed when <italic>Hdac4</italic> and <italic>Hdac5</italic> are removed from Schwann cells. This delay is longer when <italic>Hdac7</italic> is also removed, which has a profound impact on nerve impulse conduction during nerve regeneration. Importantly, remyelination in the <italic>Hdac4/5/7</italic> triple KO also catches up, supporting the idea that an additional mechanism compensates for the absence of class IIa <italic>Hdacs</italic>. Strikingly, <italic>Hdac9</italic>, the only class IIa <italic>Hdac</italic> that is not normally expressed by Schwann cells, is de novo expressed in the nerves of the <italic>Hdac4/5/7</italic> triple KO mice, induced by the transcription factor MEF2D. These genetic compensatory mechanisms, centering around transcription factors, allow Schwann cells to retain a class IIa <italic>Hdac</italic> gene dosage high enough to permit eventual myelination during development and remyelination after injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Upregulation of <italic>Hdac7</italic> permits developmental myelination in the absence of <italic>Hdac4</italic> and <italic>Hdac5</italic></title><p>We have previously shown that <italic>Hdac4</italic> and <italic>Hdac5</italic> redundantly contribute to activate the myelin transcriptional program in Schwann cells in vivo. However, although during postnatal development <italic>Jun</italic> levels remain high in the PNS of the <italic>Hdac4/5</italic> double conditional knock out mice (<italic>Mpz-Cre<sup>+/−</sup>; Hdac4<sup>flx/flx</sup>;Hdac5<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, hereafter called dKO), myelination proceeds normally after P8 and adult nerves are morphologically and functionally indistinguishable from those of wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomis-Coloma et al., 2018</xref>). In muscle development class IIa Hdacs can compensate for each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Potthoff et al., 2007b</xref>). In addition to <italic>Hdac4</italic> and <italic>Hdac5</italic>, Schwann cells also express <italic>Hdac7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomis-Coloma et al., 2018</xref>). To test if it can functionally compensate for the absence of <italic>Hdac4</italic> and <italic>Hdac5</italic>, we measured the expression levels of <italic>Hdac7</italic> in the nerves of dKO. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the expression of <italic>Hdac7</italic> was substantially induced in the sciatic nerve of the dKO mice at P60 (325.1 ± 48.1%; p = 0.0034, <italic>n</italic> = 4), while <italic>Hdac9</italic> expression remained residual. This is specific for the dKO, as minor or no changes at all were found in the single KOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Hdac7</italic> overexpression can be detected early during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results suggest that the simultaneous elimination of <italic>Hdac4</italic> and <italic>Hdac5</italic> from Schwann cells activates a mechanism aimed to compensate for the drop in the gene dose of <italic>class IIa Hdacs</italic> that upregulates threefold the expression of <italic>Hdac7</italic>. To test whether <italic>Hdac7</italic> can functionally compensate to allow myelination in the absence of <italic>Hdac4/5</italic>, we generated a <italic>Hdac4/5/7</italic> triple Schwann cell-specific conditional KO (genotype <italic>Mpz-Cre<sup>+/−</sup>; Hdac4<sup>flx/flx</sup>;Hdac5<sup>−/−</sup>; Hdac7<sup>flx/flx</sup></italic>, hereafter called tKO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D—F</xref>). To study myelin development in these mice we evaluated a number of morphological parameters of sciatic nerves at P2, P8, and P21 using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. We also quantified the mRNA and protein levels for a number of negative and positive regulators of myelination. We previously separately analyzed Schwann cell gene expression in sciatic nerves of <italic>Hdac4</italic> conditional KO mice (genotype <italic>Mpz-Cre<sup>+/−</sup>; Hdac4<sup>flx/flx</sup></italic>, referred to as cKO4) mice and global <italic>Hdac5</italic> KO mice (referred to as KO5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomis-Coloma et al., 2018</xref>). As additional controls, here we also performed a detailed morphological analysis of developing nerves in cKO4, KO5, dKO, and <italic>Hdac7</italic> Schwann cell-specific conditional KO mice (<italic>Mpz-Cre<sup>+/−</sup>; Hdac7<sup>flx/flx</sup></italic> referred to as cKO7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>). As is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>, morphological quantification showed that within the single mutants, only cKO4 showed a subtle, but consistent, delay in myelin development. In line with our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomis-Coloma et al., 2018</xref>), the simultaneous elimination of <italic>Hdac4</italic> and <italic>Hdac5</italic> from Schwann cells produced a greater decrease in the percentage of myelinated axons at P2 that was almost normalized by P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Strikingly, the simultaneous elimination of <italic>Hdac4</italic>, <italic>5</italic>, and <italic>7</italic> from Schwann cells produced a much more pronounced delay in myelin development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–J</xref>). Interestingly, expression of the negative regulators of myelination (including <italic>Jun</italic>) was notably increased from P2 to P21, which can explain the delay in the expression of myelin genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–M</xref>) and in morphological parameters of myelin development in the tKO mice. Thus, our data demonstrate that <italic>Hdac7</italic> upregulation can compensate for the absence of <italic>Hdac4</italic> and <italic>Hdac5</italic> allowing myelination to proceed, although with some delay. Interestingly, and although the coordinated removal of <italic>Hdac4</italic>, <italic>Hdac5</italic>, and <italic>Hdac7</italic> produces a long delay in myelination, myelin is finally formed and adult tKO nerves show almost normal myelination parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Myelin development is notably delayed in the tKO mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A 325.1 ± 48.1% (p = 0.0034) increase in the amount of mRNA for <italic>Hdac7</italic> was found in the dKO nerves.

In this case, the percentage of myelinated axons at 10 days after crush (10 dpi) was notably decreased (15.5 ± 2.3% in the dKO versus 60.4 ± 4.8% in the control; p ≤ 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, K</xref>). Total axon counts were similar between genotypes suggesting that this difference was not due to an axon regeneration defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). At 20 dpi the difference between both genotypes was reduced and normalized at 30 dpi. A notable increase in the number of unmyelinated axons with a diameter &gt;1.5 μm in a 1:1 relationship with the Schwann cells was found at 10 and 20 dpi that almost normalized at 30 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>g</italic> ratio was increased at 10 and 20 dpi but showed no difference between control and dKO nerves at 30 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Quantifying gene expression at 10 dpi demonstrated that mRNA for <italic>Jun</italic> remains higher in the dKO injured nerves, as does <italic>Gdnf</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>).

This is in contrast to the controls which showed myelin profiles in 73 ± 3.1% of axons (p ≤ 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>). At 20 dpi, the tKO still had only 19.2 ± 5.5% of the axons myelinated, whereas almost all large caliber axons were myelinated in the control (98.1 ± 0.2%; p = 0.0001). Moreover, at 30 dpi only 60.3 ± 6.1% of the axons were myelinated (<italic>P</italic> = 0,0031) in the tKO mice. At 60 dpi, myelination was only slightly delayed in the tKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>). Differences in <italic>g</italic> ratios followed the same pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). In the same line, we found a notable increase in the number of unmyelinated axons &gt;1.5 μm at 10 dpi, that decreases slowly but progressively up to 60 dpi, when it approaches a similar number to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Interestingly, most of these unmyelinated axons are in a 1:1 relationship with Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), suggesting that the delay is in the transition from the promyelinating to the myelinating Schwann cell stage. We also found a notable increase in the number of Schwann cells per nerve section that was maintained after 60 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>), and an increase in the nerve area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The increased number of Schwann cells is probably consequence of over-proliferation, as suggested by Ki67 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). We also observed a decrease in the number of axons &gt;1.5 μm at 20 and 30 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), probably because the smaller diameter of the unmyelinated axons. Finally, the delay in remyelination was substantiated by Western blot. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>, JUN protein is clearly more abundant in the nerves of the tKO than in either control littermates or wild-types, both at 10 and 21 dpi. Conversely, the amount of MPZ protein is lower at 10 and 21 dpi. KROX-20 is also lower at 10 dpi in the tKO, but levels had recovered by 21 dpi.</p><p>To gain insight into the functional consequences of the remyelination delay in the tKO we performed nerve impulse conduction studies of the sciatic nerves after crush injury (see Material and methods). In uninjured nerves, we found no differences in voltage amplitude or nerve conduction velocity (NCV) between tKO and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>) (curiously we observed a smaller amplitude and slower NCV for all genotypes when compared with wild-type nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), probably due to the absence of <italic>Hdac5</italic> in neurons). By contrast, at 40 dpi, whereas six of nine sciatic nerves of control mice showed a response when electrically stimulated at 8 V, only one of eight tKO responded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, F</xref>). The same distribution was found at 10 V. At 15 V, eight of nine control mice responded while only four of eight tKO responded. In the same line, the amplitude of the A-fiber component of the compound action potential (CAP) was decreased for 8, 10, and 15 V stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Regarding the component corresponding to C fibers, amplitude was also decreased for 8 and 10 V stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).

However, we have consistently found extremely low or undetectable levels of the mRNA for this protein in the C57BL/6 mouse sciatic nerves and cultured rat Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomis-Coloma et al., 2018</xref>), a result that has been recently confirmed in the Sciatic Nerve ATlas (SNAT, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.snat.ethz.ch">https://www.snat.ethz.ch</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerber et al., 2021</xref>).

However, it has been also predicted that redundancies are evolutionarily unstable and have only a transient lifetime. Despite of this, numerous examples exist of gene redundancies that have been conserved throughout dilated evolutionary periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kafri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peng, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Fluctuations in gene expression (noise) are a well-known phenomenon that has been described from bacteria to mammalian cells, and may have dramatic effects on fitness if they persist long enough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raser, 2010</xref>). It has been suggested that some gene redundancies have been evolutionarily selected because they can reduce the harmful effects of gene expression noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kafri et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the deleterious effect of the eventual decrease in the expression of a noisy gene pivotal for a determined biological process (such as differentiation) can theoretically be buffered by the expression of a redundant gene controlled by a different promoter.</p><p>Redundancies have been shown to be particularly relevant during development. One example is the couple <italic>Myod/Myf-5</italic>, which are master regulators of skeletal muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sabourin and Rudnicki, 2000</xref>). Similar to what happens with other redundant couples, <italic>Myf-5</italic> expression has a linear response that strictly dependents on the <italic>Myod</italic> gene expression dosage, and can likely contribute to reduce gene expression noise allowing skeletal muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kafri et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that slow oxidative fiber gene expression in skeletal muscles depends on gene redundancy between class IIa <italic>Hdacs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Potthoff et al., 2007c</xref>). Here, we show that the activation of the myelin gene expression program by Schwann cells is also ensured by <italic>class IIa Hdacs</italic> gene redundancy. Although the physiological role of genetic compensation within this family of proteins remains unknown, it is tempting to speculate that it could avoid potential fluctuations in class IIa <italic>Hdac</italic> gene dose ensuring Schwann cell differentiation and the proper myelination of the PNS.</p><p>But how is gene compensation regulated? Despite being documented many times in different organisms, our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms that control this process still remains limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El-Brolosy and Stainier, 2017</xref>). Thus, genetic compensation of class I <italic>Hdacs</italic> has been previously described during myelin development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jacob et al., 2011</xref>), although the mechanisms regulating this process have not been investigated.

Interestingly, <italic>Hdac9</italic> is also induced in the nerves dKO;Jun_cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>), probably as a response to the drop of class IIa <italic>Hdacs</italic> in Schwann cells that cannot overexpress <italic>Hdac7</italic> because of the absence of <italic>Jun</italic>.</p><p>To investigate the mechanisms that activate the expression of <italic>Hdac9</italic> in the tKO nerves we focused our attention in the MEF2 family of transcription factors, as they regulate <italic>Hdac9</italic> expression in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Giorgio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haberland et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, we found MEF2D overexpressed and bound to the <italic>HDCA9</italic> promoter in the tKO nerves.</p><p>It has been shown that MEF2 transcriptional activity is blocked by class IIa HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haberland et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, other class IIa HDACs can theoretically block the expression of <italic>Hdac9</italic> in control nerves. However, in the tKO, no class IIa <italic>Hdac</italic> is expressed in Schwann cells and a free of repression MEF2D might be able to induce <italic>Hdac9</italic> gene expression. Supporting this view, we found much more H3K9Ac associated with the <italic>Hdac9</italic> promoter in the tKO nerves.</p><p>Taken together, our data suggest that, the overexpressed and unrepressed promoter-bound MEF2D transcription factor, induces the de novo expression of <italic>Hdac9</italic> in the Schwann cells of the tKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>Although adult tKO nerves have morphologically normal myelin, RNA-seq analysis showed 1270 genes differently expressed, the most robustly changed genes being upregulated. This suggests a predominantly gene repressive function for class IIa HADC<italic>s</italic> in Schwann cells, as is the case for other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parra, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parra and Verdin, 2010</xref>). The most robustly upregulated gene in these mice was <italic>Tyrp1</italic>, a gene involved in the stabilization of tyrosinase and the synthesis of melanin. Strikingly, we did not find expression of the tyrosinase gene in these nerves, suggesting a different role for <italic>Tyrp1</italic>. In fact, our data show that <italic>Tyrp1</italic> mRNA is not translated into protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). It has been shown that <italic>Tyrp1</italic> mRNA indirectly promotes melanoma cell proliferation by sequestering miR-16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gautron et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilot et al., 2017</xref>). Whether <italic>Tyrp1</italic> mRNA is also responsible for the increased cell proliferation of Schwann cells in the tKO nerve is something that needs to be clarified in the future.</p><p>It has been previously shown that a subgroup of melanocytes are formed from Schwann cell precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adameyko et al., 2009</xref>). Because <italic>Mpz-Cre</italic> is already expressed by SCPs, our data points toward a role for class IIa HDACs in the repression of genes of the melanocytic lineage in these cells. Interestingly, it has been previously suggested that axonal derived signals repress SCP from going into the melanocytic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graham, 2009</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that these signals are not properly interpreted by tKO Schwann cells, precluding them to repress several melanocytic lineage genes. Notably, we found that melanocyte lineage genes are still expressed by the Remak Schwann cells of the adult tKO nerves. This misexpression could be in the origin of the alterations in the segregation of small size axons at the Remak bundles, a defect that remains during the whole life of the animal.</p><p>We also show that class IIa <italic>Hdacs</italic> removal delays remyelination after a nerve crush injury. Importantly, tKO Schwann cells are efficiently reprogramed into the repair phenotype and myelin clearance is even more efficient than in control nerves, ruling out a problem in debris removal as the cause of remyelination delay. Although we do not know why myelin clearance is accelerated, it is worthy to mention that no increased autophagy markers neither macrophage numbers could be found in the tKO nerves. If myelin clearance is accelerated because changes in the rate axon degeneration or in ovoid formation is something that needs to be clarified in future experiments.</p><p>Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of the injured tKO nerves showed that the number of differentially expressed genes increases after crush, and is maximum at 20 dpi. Many genes are robustly upregulated, particularly at 1 and 20 dpi, supporting further the idea that the main role of class IIa HDACs in Schwann cells is to repress gene expression. This agrees with the role of this family of deacetylases in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parra and Verdin, 2010</xref>) where they work mainly as corepressors of transcription factors such as MEF2 and RUNX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bialek et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Potthoff et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vega et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, among the upregulated genes in the tKO injured nerves we found <italic>Jun</italic>, <italic>Runx2</italic>, <italic>Gdnf</italic>, <italic>Ngfr</italic>, and <italic>Sox2</italic>, all expressed by nonmyelinating and repair Schwann cells. We also found <italic>Pou3f1</italic> overexpressed in the tKO nerves. It has been shown that <italic>Pou3f1</italic> overexpression delays PNS myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryu et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, <italic>Pou3f1</italic> misexpression may also contribute to the delayed myelination of the tKO nerve both during development and after injury.</p><p>In a simplistic model, the failure of class IIa HDACs to downregulate <italic>Jun</italic> could indirectly induce the expression of other negative regulators of myelination controlled by this transcription factor. However, class IIa HDACs could also directly repress the expression of other negative regulators of myelination. To explore this idea, we performed a genome-wide mapping of genes that are direct targets of HDAC4. Importantly, we confirmed our previous results showing that HDAC4 binds to the promoters of <italic>Jun</italic>, <italic>Runx</italic>2, and <italic>Gdnf</italic> in Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomis-Coloma et al., 2018</xref>). We found that HDAC4 also binds to the promoters of many other genes including other negative regulators of myelination such as <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Id2</italic>, and <italic>Hey2</italic>. Interestingly, HDAC4 also binds to the promoter of <italic>Pou3f1</italic>. Thus, the direct repressive effect of class IIa HDACs is not circumscribed to <italic>Jun</italic> but is much wider, supporting the view that they work as a cAMP-regulated blocking hub for repressors of myelination.</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that HDAC4 is also bound to the promoter of <italic>Mbp</italic> and <italic>Hmgcr</italic>, two genes that are actively expressed during myelination. HDACs are usually bound to repressed genes and replaced by histone acetyl transferases (HATs) upon gene activation. However, it has been shown that class I HDACs are also bound, together with HAT, to the promoter regions of actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, the histones associated with these promoters are heavily acetylated, what makes these authors to propose that one function of HDACs is to remove the acetyl groups added by HATs in active genes to reset chromatin modification after gene activation. Although class IIa HDACs have no deacetylase activity, they recruit class I HDACs by forming a complex with NCOR1 and SMRT. Thus, the possibility exists that class IIa and class I HADCs have a similar role when bound to the promoter of highly active genes in myelinating Schwann cells.</p><p>In summary, the data presented in this manuscript unveil responsive backup circuits mediated by the transcription factors JUN and MEF2D, that coordinate genetic compensatory mechanisms within class IIa <italic>Hdacs</italic>, aimed at repressing the expression of negative regulators of myelination to ensure differentiation of Schwann cells in response to cAMP, and the generation of the myelin sheath during development and after nerve injury.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal studies</title><p>All animal work was conducted according to European Union guidelines and with protocols approved by the Comité de Bioética y Bioseguridad del Instituto de Neurociencias de Alicante, Universidad Miguel Hernández de Elche and Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://in.umh-csic.es/">http://in.umh-csic.es/</ext-link>).

To study the repair Schwann cell phenotype activation and myelin clearance, we performed a nerve cut to avoid nerve regeneration inside the distal stump. In this case, the sciatic nerve was exposed and cut at the sciatic notch using scissors. The wound was closed using veterinary autoclips (AutoClip System). The nerve distal to the cut or crush was excised for analysis at various time points after euthanasia. Contralateral uninjured sciatic nerves were used as controls.

The uniquely mapped reads were obtained with SAMtools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.htslib.org/">http://www.htslib.org/</ext-link>) filtering by mapping quality ≥30. MACS2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/macs3-project/MACS">https://github.com/macs3-project/MACS</ext-link>, version 1.11; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_013291">SCR_013291</ext-link>) was used for peak calling and the results were filtered by −log<sub>10</sub> FDR &gt; 3. To enable a more informative functional interpretation of experimental data, we identified genes close to or having ChIP-Seq tags on their sequence. ChIPseeker (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ChIPseeker.html">http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ChIPseeker.html</ext-link>) was used for this step. Rattus norvegicus (Rnor_6.0) was selected as annotation database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/TxDb.Rnorvegicus.UCSC.rn6.refGene.html">https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/TxDb.Rnorvegicus.UCSC.rn6.refGene.html</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>In vivo recording of CAP from mouse sciatic nerves</title><p>Mice were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 40 mg/kg ketamine and 30 mg/kg xylazine. The whole length of the right sciatic nerve was then exposed from its proximal projection into the L4 spinal cord to its distal branches innervating gastrocnemius muscles: tibial, sural, and common peroneal. Extracellular recording of CAPs was carried out by placing the proximal part of the sciatic nerve on an Ag/AgCl recording electrode with respect to a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl) placed inside the contralateral paw of the animal. For electrical stimulation, another electrode was placed in the distal part of the sciatic nerve just before its trifurcation. To avoid nerve desiccation and the consequent axonal death, the nerve was continuously lubricated with paraffin oil (Panreac). To selectively activate Aβ-, Aδ-, and C-fibers, we recorded CAPs evoked by graded electrical stimulations (5, 8, 10, and 15 V intensity, 0.03-ms pulse duration, Grass Instruments S88, A-M Systems) using both normal and inverse polarity. CAPs were amplified (×1000) and filtered (high pass 0.1 Hz, low pass 10 kHz) with an AC amplifier (DAM 50, World Precision Instruments) and digitalized and stored at 25 kHz in a computer using a CED micro-1401 interface and Spike2 v.7.01 software (both from Cambridge Electronic Design). In the CAPs, different waveform components corresponding to A- (β and δ) and C-fiber activation were easily distinguished by latency. The amplitude of the different components and the mean NCV were measured. The amplitude of each component was measured from the maximum negative to the maximum positive deflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sdrulla et al., 2015</xref>). For NCV measurement, we divided the distance between the stimulating and recording electrodes by the latency to the CAP component with the biggest amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vleggeert-Lankamp et al., 2004</xref>). The distance between the stimulating and recording electrodes was measured for each experiment using an 8/0 suture thread.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistics</title><p>Values are given as means ± standard error (SE).

system, the authors unravel how transcription factors can functionally substitute each other in the development of single/double/ and triple mutant mice. Functional redundancy and compensation is seen in many developmental systems, but has rarely been studied at that level of detail.

We sincerely apologize for the delays in handling this manuscript. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers (#2 and #3), and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. As you can see, there was strong support for your paper. However, numerous constructive suggestions have been made how the manuscripts could be improved, none of which should be considered a major criticisms. Please see for details below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The present manuscript provides new insight into the role of class II HDACs in peripheral nerve development and in repair. The data are in general of high quality, however there are several aspects that need to be addressed in order to improve the manuscript and to justify the central hypothesis of the authors:</p><p>Briefly</p><p>– The authors should carefully rewrite the manuscript, as the description of the single vs dKo vs triple KO is sometimes difficult to follow. This applies also to the timepoints that were analysed and, importantly, to the experimental techniques used in the nerve injury part. The injury type and analyzed time points are not very clear and structured or explained. Why do they use sometimes crush and sometimes cut?</p><p>– Some figures lack scale bars or the description of the scale bar. E.g. for the EM picture of the Remak fibers, the scale bar is not defined, so that axon size cannot be assessed.</p><p>– While it is clear that HDAC4/5/7 tKO impacts myelination and genetic regulation of SC development including Remak bundle architecture, the results do not quite justify the clear hypothesis of compensatory mechanisms. Remak bundle morphology should be addressed and discussed in the single mutants, cKO4 and cKO7 specifically. Discussion should also include HDAC9 expression in single mutants.</p><p>– Discussion of a physiological relevance of compensatory mechanisms between HDACs, i.e. why should loss of function of one/two/three HDACs occur in nature that would require compensation?</p><p>– Myelin clearance is not shown directly, but only indirectly by quantifying the number of still intact myelin profiles. Quantification of degeneration profiles and data on autophagy and/or macrophages would justify statements on myelin clearance.</p><p>– ChIPseq analysis was only performed for HDAC4, which shows convincing results, however only specific for HDAC4, thus, it is speculative to draw conclusions for all three HDACs.</p><p>– Is HDAC7 expression reduced in c-Jun cKO after injury?</p><p>– In general, the reviewer would recommend a more careful usage of the term &quot;de novo&quot; and &quot;ectopic&quot;, with regard to the data presented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors should consider reorganising the result section, clearly separating developmental and regenerative experiments. It would further be helpful for the reader to parse the text into clear paragraphs. Especially the result section would benefit from this.</p><p>It should be made clear how WB signals are normalised. Signals should be normalised to calnexin/GAPDH before comparisons are made between genotypes.</p><p>The lettering of some figures is too small. For example, in Figure 2 G (but also elsewhere) the gene names in the volcano plot are unreadable.</p><p>Discuss all Figure elements in the text. For example, Figure 2 C and D are not presented in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72917.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The present manuscript provides new insight into the role of class II HDACs in peripheral nerve development and in repair.

In the revised manuscript we have now rewritten the text to clarify the description of the different genotypes and phenotypes, as well as the analyzed time points. We have also included more information on the technique used for nerve injury. As we explained before, for most of the experiments we used the crush model of injury, that allow us to study the regeneration and remyelination of the nerve. We have used a cut model of injury only for the studies on myelin clearance and the activation of the Schwann cell repair phenotype.

On this basis, in the revised manuscript we suggest and discuss more extensively that genetic compensation could avoid fluctuations in class IIa HDAC activity in Schwann cells allowing differentiation and the proper myelination of the peripheral nervous system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Myelin clearance is not shown directly, but only indirectly by quantifying the number of still intact myelin profiles. Quantification of degeneration profiles and data on autophagy and/or macrophages would justify statements on myelin clearance.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained before we have quantified both the number of intact myelin profiles and the expression of myelin protein zero (MPZ). To get further insight we have now also quantified autophagy by measuring LC3bI-II by WB and found no changes in the tKO. Also, no changes in other autophagy markers were found by RTqPCR. Thus, the consistently increased myelin clearance found in these mice is not caused by accelerated autophagy/ myelinophagy. These new data have been included in the revised manuscript. As indicated before we have also quantified the number of macrophages in the distal stumps at 4d after cut and found no changes between tKO and control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– ChIPseq analysis was only performed for HDAC4, which shows convincing results, however only specific for HDAC4, thus, it is speculative to draw conclusions for all three HDACs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now revised the text to avoid unnecessary generalizations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is HDAC7 expression reduced in c-Jun cKO after injury?</p></disp-quote><p>As explained before to confirm the role of c-Jun in HDAC7 overexpression in the dKO nerves, we have generated the <italic>dKO; c-Jun cKO</italic> genotype and measured HDAC7 gene expression in the nerves of these mice. As is shown in Figure 8G of the revised manuscript, the absence of c-Jun in Schwann cells totally prevents the compensatory overexpression of HDAC7. Interestingly we have also found an increase in the expression of HDAC9 in these mice, probably to compensate their incapacity to upregulate HDAC7 (Figure 8G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In general, the reviewer would recommend a more careful usage of the term &quot;de novo&quot; and &quot;ectopic&quot;, with regard to the data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We have restricted the use of these terms only where it is justified in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors should consider reorganising the result section, clearly separating developmental and regenerative experiments. It would further be helpful for the reader to parse the text into clear paragraphs. Especially the result section would benefit from this.</p></disp-quote><p>We now have tried to distinguish more clearly development and regenerative experiments in the revised version of the manuscript. However, we would like to point out that we follow, as much as possible, the timeline of the experiments we performed during the last years to obtain the necessary data for writing the manuscript. This, in our opinion, helps to make sense of the presented experiments and gives coherence to our approach. Unfortunately, it also makes very difficult to completely segregate the results of development from those of regeneration. For example, we weren’t aware of HDAC9 upregulation until we performed the RNAseq experiments of the regeneration of adult nerves. Then we had to come back to development to know when HDAC9 started to be upregulated. We apologize for these limitations and hope the reviewer will find enough the changes we have introduced in the revised version to clarify the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It should be made clear how WB signals are normalised.

Only the WB of <italic>Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</italic> has been normalized uniquely to Calnexin because GAPDH is seen as double band in the iris. We apologize for not being clear enough. We have now put this information in the Material and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The lettering of some figures is too small.
