metabolic disorders in later life; and dysregulation of lipid metabolism is critical in such outcomes. However, there is limited knowledge about lipid metabolism and factors causing lipid dysregulation in early life that could result in adverse health outcomes in later life. We studied the effect of antenatal factors such as gestational age, birth weight, and mode of birth on lipid metabolism at birth; changes in the circulating lipidome in the first 4 years of life and the effect of breastfeeding in the first year of life. From this study, we aim to generate a framework for deeper understanding into factors effecting lipid metabolism in early life, to provide early interventions for those at risk of developing metabolic disorders including cardiovascular diseases.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed comprehensive lipid profiling of 1074 mother-child dyads in the Barwon Infant Study (BIS), a population-based pre-birth cohort and measured 776 distinct lipid features across 39 lipid classes using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). We measured lipids in 1032 maternal serum samples at 28 weeks’ gestation, 893 cord serum samples at birth, 793, 735, and 511 plasma samples at 6, 12 months, and 4 years, respectively. Cord serum was enriched with long chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), and corresponding cholesteryl esters relative to the maternal serum. We performed regression analyses to investigate the associations of cord serum lipid species with antenatal factors: gestational age, birth weight, mode of birth and duration of labour.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>The lipidome differed between mother and newborn and changed markedly with increasing child’s age. Alkenylphosphatidylethanolamine species containing LC-PUFAs increased with child’s age, whereas the corresponding lysophospholipids and triglycerides decreased. Majority of the cord serum lipids were strongly associated with gestational age and birth weight, with most lipids showing opposing associations. Each mode of birth showed an independent association with cord serum lipids. Breastfeeding had a significant impact on the plasma lipidome in the first year of life, with up to 17-fold increases in a few species of alkyldiaclylglycerols at 6 months of age.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study sheds light on lipid metabolism in infancy and early childhood and provide a framework to define the relationship between lipid metabolism and health outcomes in early childhood.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This work was supported by the A*STAR-NHMRC joint call funding (1711624031).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>newborn</kwd><kwd>infants</kwd><kwd>early childhood</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A*STAR-NHMRC joint call funding (1711624031).</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meikle</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Wenk</surname><given-names>Markus R</given-names></name><name><surname>Karnani</surname><given-names>Neerja</given-names></name><name><surname>Collier</surname><given-names>Fiona</given-names></name><name><surname>Saffery</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name><name><surname>Vuillermin</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Ponsonby</surname><given-names>Anne-Louise</given-names></name><name><surname>Burgner</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Plasma lipidomic profiling in pregnancy, infancy and early childhood provides a framework to define the relationship between lipid metabolism and health outcomes in early childhood.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The developmental origins of health and disease paradigm suggests that prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal heritable and environmental influences result in long-term developmental, physiological, and metabolic changes in major tissues and organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker, 1999</xref>). These metabolic perturbations can contribute to later life disease risk, including cardiovascular diseases and related cardiometabolic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barouki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barker, 2007</xref>). Alterations to lipid metabolism are a key driver of metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castro Cabezas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meikle and Summers, 2017</xref>). The lipid profile in blood (the lipidome) provides an integrative measure of genetic and environmental exposures on circulating lipid metabolism and quantification of the lipidome offers a rapid and effective approach to identify biomarkers potentially predictive of several diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Large population-based studies from our group and others have established specific lipids to be associated with cardiometabolic disorders including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huynh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huynh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lamichhane et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to adult data, little is known about lipid metabolism in early life. Understanding the key determinants of early life lipid metabolism will inform the development of risk-stratification and early interventions.</p><p>The Barwon Infant Study (BIS) is a longitudinal Australian birth cohort with antenatal recruitment and repeated in-depth data and sample collection that is designed to facilitate a detailed mechanistic investigation of disease development within an epidemiological framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vuillermin et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we applied a comprehensive lipidomic approach to understand the lipid metabolism during pregnancy and throughout the first 4 years of life. We utilised targeted ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) to measure 776 distinct individual lipid species across 39 distinct lipid classes (ceramide and deoxyceramide have been grouped together). This aimed to increase understanding of the lipid metabolism in newborns and infants in the first year of life, specially focusing on the association of cord serum lipids with antenatal factors: gestational age, birth weight, mode of birth, and duration of labour. We also aimed to investigate the relationship between breastfeeding and plasma lipids at 6 and 12 months of age. We provide a baseline characterisation of circulating lipids in the mother and newborn and changes in plasma lipids from birth to 4 years. In summary, the results from this study provide a framework for future studies to understand lipid metabolism in early life and provide early interventions for lipid dysregulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Research design and the cohort</title><p>The BIS is a pre-birth cohort (n = 1074 mother-infant pairs, 72% Anglo-European) from the Barwon region of south-eastern Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vuillermin et al., 2015</xref>). Women were recruited prior to 28 weeks of pregnancy. Infants born prior to 32 weeks, who developed a serious illness in the first week of life, or who had significant congenital or genetic abnormalities, were excluded. Participants were reviewed at birth and at 1, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 48 months. Maternal serum samples were collected at 28 weeks’ gestation. Child serum or plasma samples were collected at birth, 6 months, 12 months, and 4 years. Data on maternal age, birth order, prenatal weight, and antenatal comorbidities were collected from questionnaires and hospital records, and by standardised clinical examination. Cord blood was collected at birth in a serum clotting tube, samples were centrifuged within 2 hr of collection, and the serum was separated and stored at –80°C. Maternal pre-pregnancy body-mass index (BMI) was calculated from self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and directly measured maternal height at the first study visit (28–32 weeks’ gestation). Birth anthropometric measures (birth weight, length, and head circumference) were collected within the first 2 days of life. Anthropometric measurements were also obtained at birth, 6 months, 12 months, and 4 years. BMI at each time point was calculated by weight (kilograms)/height (metres)<sup>2</sup>.

To increase throughput, we used a dual column setup to equilibrate the second column while the first is running a sample. The sample analytical gradient was as follows: starting with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min at 15% B and increasing to 50% B over 2.5 min, then to 57% over 0.1 min, to 70% over 6.4 min, to 93% over 0.1 min, to 96% over 1.9 min, and finally to 100% over 0.1 min. The solvent was then held at 100% B for 0.9 min (total 12.0 min). Equilibration was started as follows: solvent was decreased from 100% B to 15% B over 0.2 min and held for an additional 0.8 min for a total run time of 12.9 min per sample. The next sample is injected, and the columns are switched.</p><p>The following mass spectrometer conditions were used: gas temperature, 150°C, gas flow rate 17 L/min, nebuliser 20 psi, sheath gas temperature 200°C, capillary voltage 3500 V, and sheath gas flow 10 L/min. Isolation widths for Q1 and Q3 were set to ‘unit’ resolution (0.7 amu).</p><p>Plasma quality control (PQC) samples consisting of a pooled set of plasma samples taken from six healthy individuals and extracted alongside the study samples were incorporated into the analysis at 1 PQC per 20 plasma samples. Technical QC samples (TQC) consisted of PQC extracts which were pooled, then split into individual vials to provide a measure of technical variation from the mass spectrometer only. These were included at a ratio of 1 TQC per 20 plasma samples. TQCs were monitored for changes in peak area, width, and retention time to determine the performance of the UHPLC-MS/MS analysis and were subsequently used to account for differential responses across the analytical batches. To align the results to any future datasets, the NIST 1950 SRM sample (Sigma) was included as a reference plasma sample, at a rate of 1 per 40 samples.</p><p>Relative quantification of lipid species was determined by comparison to the relevant internal standard. Lipid class total concentrations were calculated as the sum of individual lipid species concentrations, except in the case of triacylglycerol (TG) and alkyldiacylglycerol (TG(O)) species, where we measured both neutral loss (NL) and single ion monitoring (SIM) peaks, and subsequently used the abundant but less structurally resolved (SIM) species concentrations for summation purposes when examining lipid class totals. Any lipid differences based on the matrix must be kept in mind as serum samples were used during gestation, and at birth vs. plasma samples at other time points. Several studies have reported matrix-associated differences in species of lysophospholipids, diacylglycerols, free long chain fatty acids, and oxidised fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishikawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sangkuhl et al., 2011</xref>). However, these differences are unlikely to reflect biological processes in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lagarde et al., 2010</xref>). These differences could be reflected in change in lipid levels observed at birth and 6 months, but not affect the association with outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-3"><title>Data processing</title><p>Lipidomic analysis was performed across 11 batches of ~500 samples with quality control samples analysed every 20 samples. The chromatographic peaks were integrated using the Mass Hunter (B.07.00, Agilent Technologies) software and assigned to specific lipid species based on MRM (precursor/product) ion pairs and retention time. Upon completion of quantification, lipidome data for 777 lipid features in 4007 samples was available across 11 batches. Zero values (values beneath the mass spectrometer’s detection threshold) were replaced by 1/10th the minimum value for the concerned lipids in the corresponding sample types. We then aligned the lipid concentrations across different batches by median centring the PQC samples, and additionally scaled all batch-wise standard deviations for biological samples (on the log scale) to the mean standard deviation. We visually assessed lipids for large-scale technical variations (such as groups of outlier measurements, effects of drift or lipid hydrolysis over batch run duration), and re-quantified affected lipids where possible, and excluding them or selectively setting some values to missing where not. Missing values were then imputed using a k-nearest neighbour approach in the samples space. We used two different approaches for outlier sample detection. On one hand, lipid concentrations were log-transformed, and Z-scored, and absolute Z-scores were summed for each sample as a measure of their extremeness. Samples showing sums above the 95th percentile were flagged as potential outliers. On the other hand, the Z-scores were used in a principal components analysis (PCA), and the seven first principal components were retained as explaining the most variance. In the space defined by these components, each sample’s distance to the origin was calculated as a measure of the sample’s extremeness. Samples with a distance greater than the 95th percentile were flagged as potential outliers. Samples flagged by both approaches were declared outliers are removed from further analysis. Further inspection revealed that 16 samples were ‘missed injections’ on the mass spectrometer, 27 cord serum samples were contaminated by maternal blood, these which were excluded, leaving 3964 samples in total. Ultimately, we retained 776 lipid measures across all batches. SIM-based lipid measures were not included in lipid species-level analyses, leaving 733 species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were carried out in R (3.5.0 or 4.0.3).

We observed that gestational age influences lipids at 6 months and not at 12 months and hence adjusted for gestational age at the 6-month time point. The effective sample size varied slightly with each time point and between models due to missing samples or missing values for some covariates.

Cluster 2 consisted of 149 lipid species of which phospholipids such as the odd chain phosphatidylcholine PC(31:0) and branched-chain and LC-PUFA containing phosphatidylethanolamine species: PE(15-MHDA_20:4) and PE(15-MHDA_22:6) decreased at 6 months, increased at 12 months, and decreased at 4 years. These PE species were also positively associated with birth weight in cord serum. Lysophospholipids containing 18:1 and 18:2 fatty acids, increased at 6 months, decreased at 12 months and increased as the child reached 4 years. In adults, these lysophospholipids are generally associated with higher BMI.

Cluster 4 consisted of 41 lipid species. The pattern was similar to cluster 2, with species of LC-PUFA containing phosphatidylethanolamine species increasing from birth to 6 months and decreasing at 12 months and 4 years.

Cluster 8 consisted of 33 lipid species, with species of lysophospholipids, cholesteryl esters, and fatty acids showing a consistent decrease across all time points. Cluster 9 consisted of 98 lipid species and showed a similar profile to cluster 1. Ceramide and sphingomyelin species containing 23:0 and 24:0 long chain fatty acids increased across all the time points.

Of particular note, species of alkyl- and alkenylphospholipids (plasmalogens) and alkyldiacylglycerides (TG-O) were markedly elevated in breastfed infants.

The lipidome was different between mother and child and changed markedly with child’s age. We identified that gestational age and birth weight were associated with cord serum lipids. Most of the lipid associations with gestational age were in the opposing direction to the associations with birth weight. Mode of birth was also associated with the cord serum lipidome, and the profile differed from that observed for gestational age and birth weight. There were marked changes in the ontogeny of the plasma lipidome from birth to 4 years of age: LC-PUFA and cholesteryl esters containing LC-PUFAs were enriched in cord serum relative to the maternal serum. LC-PUFA containing lipid species altered between birth and 4 years with an enrichment in alkenylphosphatidylethanolamine species and a reduction in lysophospholipids and triglycerides. Concentrations of free LC-PUFAs decreased at 4 years, but the corresponding cholesteryl esters increased. Alkenylphosphatidylethanolamine species and alkyldiacylglycerol species were significantly elevated in breastfed infants at 6 and 12 months.</p><p>There has been a 30% increase in the incidence of late preterm births since 1980s, which now account for 75% of all preterm births. There is increasing epidemiological evidence suggesting infants born late preterm (34–36 weeks) and early term (37–38 weeks) are at higher risk of a host of adverse health outcomes including respiratory disorders, increased and prolonged hospitalisations, and developmental delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crump et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Consortium on Safe Labor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Talge et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, the studies on association of gestational age with future health risk have been inconclusive. For example, Power et al. examined the associations between gestational age and blood pressure, HbA1c, clinical lipids, and BMI at 44–45 years of age in the 1958 British birth cohort. They identified that gestational age was inversely associated with blood pressure but there was no clear evidence of an association between gestational age and BMI or total cholesterol among men or between gestational age and HbA1c or LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides in either sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooper et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In our study, we found di- and triacylglycerols were positively associated with gestational age, which reflect an evolutionary adaptation in preparation for the metabolic stress of labour, a period of high energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghaemi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McCloskey et al., 2018a</xref>). A concomitant increase in branched-chain fatty acids and corresponding phospholipids, a downstream product of the mitochondrial catabolism of branched-chain amino acids along with elevated levels of acylcarnitines, both suggest increased mitochondrial activity in babies with greater gestational age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bjørndal et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Gestational age and birth weight showed overall inverse lipidomic profiles that were largely independent of each other. In infants with higher birth weight, the observed lower level of triglyceride levels could reflect better packaging within the adipose tissue vs. free availability in the circulation for energy mobilisation.</p><p>The decrease in cholesteryl esters and dehydrocholesterols suggest a decrease in cholesterol synthesis with increasing gestational age. This may relate to increased use of FFAs for energy production and so less for cholesteryl ester production but might also relate to a downregulation of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway as the dehydrocholesterol is a precursor to cholesterol.</p><p>There were significant associations with multiple sphingolipid species, but overall these were very small, showing only 2–3% difference for a 10-day difference in gestational age. Thus while these lipids are known to associate with cardiometabolic outcomes in adults, the differences at birth cannot yet be ascribed to specific outcomes or risk. Further analyses will be required to define these relationships.</p><p>The lipid profile associated with gestational age resembles the lipid profile associated with BMI in adults. For example, in adults, acylcarnitines, di and triacylglycerols are positively associated with BMI and body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beyene et al., 2020</xref>) like that seen in babies with higher gestational age. One possible explanation is that these lipid classes are involved in energy mobilisation and hence more abundant in circulation thereby acting as a source of FFAs which are required for various biological pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamosh, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hellmuth et al., 2017</xref>).

Elevated levels of di- and triacylglycerols and acylcarnitine in assisted VB, unscheduled CS and prolonged labour indicate that stress in utero and during birth increases energy mobilisation for high energy expenditure in these modes of birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poznyak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jung and Choi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McCloskey et al., 2018b</xref>). However, a decrease in circulating FFAs and triacylglycerols in scheduled CS may also be a result of mothers often being prohibited from consuming food and drink before the procedure leading to a fasting state and so decreased availability of FFAs for transfer across the placenta. Additionally, mode of birth also affects the neonate’s gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reyman et al., 2019</xref>). Newborns delivered vaginally show a higher diversity of bacteria than those born by CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reyman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Francino, 2018</xref>). The specific lipidome signature associated with each mode of birth may reflect the differences in the gut microbiome, although whether this could manifest at the time of delivery is uncertain. Considering data suggesting an increased risk of metabolic disorders later in life associated with mode of birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2013</xref>), it is important to understand differences in lipid metabolism by birth mode.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Lipid differences in mother and newborn cord serum</title><p>Compared to the mother, we observed elevated levels of LC-PUFAs in cord serum which are critical for in utero brain development as well as the rapid brain development in the first year of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Innis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koletzko et al., 2001</xref>). The elevated levels of di- and triacylglycerols, and phospholipids observed in the maternal circulation most likely act as a source of fatty acids for the foetus. Lipoprotein lipase and endothelial lipase in the syncytiotrophoblast hydrolyse circulating maternal triacylglycerols and phospholipids respectively to provide the pool of fatty acids for the foetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gil-Sánchez et al., 2012</xref>). FFAs in the syncytiotrophoblast basal membrane are transferred to foetal circulation directly through facilitated diffusion or using fatty acid carriers (FAT/CD36) and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPpm, FATP4). In the foetal circulation, these fatty acids then bind to a fetoprotein and are transported to the liver, where they are re-esterified into complex lipids and transported into circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larqué et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shafrir and Khassis, 1982</xref>).</p><p>LC-PUFA containing phosphatidylcholine species were also elevated in maternal serum.

Elevated levels of LC-PUFAs, cholesteryl esters, and lysophospholipids seen in the cord serum started to diminish as the child reached 6 months of age. However, at 12 months and 4 years of age, we observed an increase in odd chain, essential fatty acids and LC-PUFA containing phospholipids, which could be acting as a source of PUFA. Recent studies have shown LC-PUFA deficiency in several childhood disorders such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders, obesity, and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Innis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koletzko et al., 2001</xref>). A balanced intake of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids is essential for homeostasis and normal development throughout the life cycle. A diet rich in omega-6 LC-PUFAs can shift the metabolism to an atherogenic/diabetic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simopoulos, 2002</xref>). On the other hand, the beneficial effects of omega-3 LC-PUFAs also depend on complex interaction between different nutrients, and polymorphism in genes involved in omega-3 fatty acid metabolism.</p><p>Clustering the lipids across all the time points revealed clear signatures of breastfeeding in clusters 2, 7, and 9 with lipid species of alkenylphosphatidylethanolamine and alkyldiacylglyerols showed remarkable increase at 6 months. Since the lipid clusters are designed as change in lipids over time, it is not possible to find how they are correlated with a particular outcome at one time point, rather we plan to investigate the association of these lipid clusters with growth trajectories, thereby enabling us to capture the lipid trajectories over time (manuscript in preparation).</p><p>Understanding changes in the lipidome early on in life provides a window of opportunity for early intervention and decrease the risk of future metabolic disorders.</p><p>It is well established that breast milk is rich in PUFAs. LC-PUFAs, especially arachidonic acid (20:4, n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5, n-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, n-3), have been shown to be critical for brain development and function in early life. While the actual mechanisms of how breastfeeding is associated with neurodevelopment remain unknown, LC-PUFAs in breast milk have been postulated to account for the effect of breastfeeding and improved cognition. We observed elevated levels of multiple lipid species containing these LC-PUFAs in breastfed infants at both 6 and 12 months. In addition, we observed a marked enrichment of alkenylphosphatidylethanolamine and alkyldiacylglycerol species in breastfed, relative to formula-fed, infants. Dysregulation of lipid metabolism is recognised as a primary driver of obesity and more recently of inflammation and immune regulation. Lipids make up 3% of the total breast milk composition. A small but important component of these lipids are alkylglycerols (AKGs), a class of ether lipids that constitute about 1% of total milk lipids. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2019</xref> recently reported that AKGs maintain beige adipose tissue (BeAT) in infants and delay the transformation of BeAT into white adipose tissue in mice, thereby protecting against obesity. They further report that breast milk AKGs are metabolised by adipose tissue macrophages to form platelet-activating factor, which ultimately activates IL-6/STAT3 signaling in adipocytes and triggers BeAT development in the infant. This study suggests that lack of AKG intake in infancy leads to premature loss of BeAT and increased fat accumulation and points to a role in immune cells in this process. Alkylglycerols can also be metabolised into alkyl- and alkenylphospholipids. Our group and others have identified that these classes of phospholipids are critical for human health and are depleted in obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meikle and Summers, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Breast milk represents the most abundant source of alkylglycerols in the human diet. While we see up to 17-fold increase in alkyldiacylglcyerols and alkenylphosphatidylethanolamine species at 6 and 12 months in breastfed infants, we did not observe any associations of breastfeeding at 12 months with 4 years circulating lipids. However, early modulation of these lipids might have long-term health effects, which is still to be understood.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Effect of infant sex on lipids</title><p>There is evidence of sex differences in the lipidome from late gestation onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kelishadi et al., 2007</xref>).

However, at age 4 years, SM (d18:2/14:0) was significantly associated with sex and was lower in boys relative to girls (10.42% lower in boys, p = 5.53 E<sup>–04</sup>). In adults, the differential activity of the fatty acid desaturase (FADS3) is responsible for the elevated levels of SM (d18:2/14:0) in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beyene et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karsai et al., 2020</xref>).

We are currently investigating these results in another large birth cohort, based in Singapore – the GUSTO cohort to investigate whether similar changes are evident in a population of Asian ethnicity. In this study, plasma lipidomics was performed on serum (maternal and newborn time points) and plasma (6, 12 months, and 4 years).

Children within this study are continuing to be followed and future outcome data will build on these initial early life findings.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Funding acquisition, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con21"><p>Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con22"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con23"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The original study was granted by the Barwon Health Human Research and Ethics Committee (HREC 10/24).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Supplemetary data for the analyses.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72779-supp1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72779-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Due to the consent obtained during recruitment process, it is not possible to make all data publicly available.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Hossein Ardehali as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Y M Dennis Lo as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Liang Wei Wang (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper has been discussed extensively among the reviewers. The Reviewers found the paper interesting and identified significant merit in the work. However, several major weaknesses were also identified that reduced enthusiasm and prevented the publication of the work in the present form. The main shortcomings of the work are mainly the lack of deep analysis of the data and also presentation of the results. It is important for the author to include the following studies in the revised version:</p><p>1) Better definition of the significance of the findings, as requested by Reviewers #1 and #3.</p><p>2) Better analysis of the data that employ other methods besides linear regression analysis to assess high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk clusters of lipid species.</p><p>3) Discussion on how various complications e.g., breech births, meconium aspiration, might associate with gestational lipid signatures, with immediate implications for triage and emergency planning;</p><p>4) Inclusion of discussion on how milk as a source of lipids can influence the ontogeny of the child's lipidome;</p><p>5) Limiting the paper and the results to lipid data only during labor, delivery and the first year of life.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a well written paper and a large amount of data are provided. I have the following comments:</p><p>1. Figures 2-4 are very difficult to understand. What do each point in the blot represent? What does the line around the data points represent? It is important the authors provide more explanation for readers who do not have familiarity with these plots.</p><p>2. There are a number of lipids that may have toxic effects on certain cells. For example ceramide has been shown to have cardiotoxic effects in adults. The authors show that ceramide levels change, but do not discuss what the biological significance of these findings are. In general, although the paper provides a large amount of data, it lacks a clear explanation for what these changes mean. The authors need to go beyond simply showing their lipidomic data and provide more physiological relevance to their findings.</p><p>3. Additional environmental variables and their link to changes in childhood serum lipids need to be studied and included in the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an important and well-written manuscript. While the work is largely descriptive, the authors provide important information on the natural biological variation of the circulating lipidome from gestation to up to 4 years of age, along with corresponding data on their mothers. However, there are major concerns:</p><p>1. The authors show with regression analyses that certain lipid species are increased/decreased in response birth and year 4 BMI and weight. However, it is highly unlikely these individual lipid species are acting in isolation. It is more likely that there are various high-risk, moderate-risk, and low-risk &quot;clusters&quot; of lipid species that change over time with respect to each other which are associated with birth weight and ultimately year 4 BMI. Linear regression is not sufficient to resolve such clusters, and time-series principal component analysis should be used (eg, PMID 32504647)</p><p>2. The significance of the work would be significantly strengthened if the authors performed machine learning analysis of the dynamic lipidome to identify particular species associated with birth weight and year 4 BMI to complement traditional statistical approaches.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Cohort description:</p><p>The description of the cohort can be further improved. Although the study cohort's demographic details have been published in reference 12, those numbers are woefully outdated. It is not clear how the new subjects recruited in the past 6 years have altered the demographic structure of the cohort. Additionally, more pertinent details about the cohort in relation to metabolism should be presented in Supplementary Table 1 e.g., caloric and fat intake during pregnancy, breast milk lipid content.</p><p>What is the reason for excluding the 1-, 9- and 24-month time points?</p><p>Language:</p><p>The language of the manuscript can be changed to improve clarity and ease of reading.</p><p>– The authors use American and British English words interchangeably e.g., &quot;fetal&quot; and &quot;foetal&quot;. I suggest standardization.</p><p>– For example, &quot;postnatal age&quot; can be substituted with &quot;child's age&quot;.</p><p>– In the Statistical Analysis section, it is not clear who &quot;participant&quot; refers to in paragraph 2.</p><p>– The manuscript title is somewhat misleading – sera, not plasma, were collected at the gestational and birth time points. Hence, the title should read &quot;blood lipid metabolism&quot;, instead of &quot;plasma lipid metabolism&quot;. Consequently, the Methods section should include a line on this difference in sample type for avoidance of doubt.</p><p>– The authors noted a similarity between the β coefficients of lipid species associated with BMI at 4 years and pre-pregnancy BMI in mothers (Supplementary Figure 6b). However, the authors should qualify this as a very weak correlation.</p><p>– On page 20, the authors say that the lipid profiles of 4-year-old children associated with BMI closely resembled that of adults. It is not clear whether this said adult cohort is the one referred to by reference 8. Even so, the data stated in support of the authors' claims are found in Supplementary Figures5 and 6 and, Supplementary Tables 13-16. However, none of these data actually provide substantive support, since a PCA is the best first step to establishing that fact. On a related note, it will also be quite interesting to find out how the lipidome differs between healthy non-pregnant females in reference 8's cohort and healthy pregnant women in this study.</p><p>– On page 22, the authors order assisted VB, non-assisted VB, unscheduled CS and a 4th CS. I believe the word, &quot;schedule&quot;, is missing here. In the same paragraph, the authors say that [the] &quot;mode of birth also effects the neonate's gut microbiota&quot;. Here, &quot;affects&quot; should be used in place of &quot;effects&quot;.</p><p>– On page 23, paragraph 2, there is a missing &quot;as&quot; in line 5. On page 24, the word, &quot;the&quot;, is missing in paragraph 2 line 13 and paragraph 3 line 1.</p><p>– On page 25, the authors assert that FADS3 &quot;starts exhibiting this differential activity at four years&quot;. This should be rephrased as &quot;by four years&quot; since the activity difference could have happened any time between the prior time point and 4 years of age.</p><p>Presentation:</p><p>The presentation of figures needs to be improved. For example, in the Results section, Figures1b and 1c are referenced after Figure 1d in paragraph 2.</p><p>In Figure 1b, cord sera are represented as a distinct cluster to other child-derived samples. How do the authors know that this represents a real biological difference that is not due to a difference in sample processing? Figure 1c should be re-plotted with PC3 to achieve better separation.</p><p>Page 11 presumably refers to Figure 2. But no textual reference is actually made.</p><p>Figures2 to 4 should have category labels on the y-axis to aid reading. Lipid species are classified by molecular similarity. However, it will be much more intuitive and useful to categorize them according to pathway relatedness or molecular function. If possible, dendrograms should also be drawn to indicate molecular relatedness.</p><p>Supplementary Figure 2 is very ambiguous – it is not clear to me how certain lipid species have been highlighted/cherry-picked. The authors should define clear cut-offs.</p><p>Figure legends can be improved for clarity. For example, for p-values, 10-15 should be used, rather than E-15. Red diamonds are said to represent lipid classes – but what does this mean exactly? Is it the mean or median value of all species within the class? In Supplementary Figure 5, the legend title says, &quot;Association of infant BMI with lipid species&quot;. However, panel d relates to 4-year-old children i.e., toddlers, rather than infants; the correct word to use is &quot;child&quot;.</p><p>Other Suggestions and Points Requiring Clarification:</p><p>The authors note the interesting observation that acylcarnitine, DAGs and TAGs were more abundant with longer duration of labor, alluding to a role for fueling the strenuous activity of labor. How does one know that the increased levels of these lipid species are due to the physiology of labor per se (on page 22, the authors write, &quot;stress in utero and during birth increases energy mobilization for high energy expenditure in these modes of birth&quot;), rather than a result of mothers often being prohibited from consuming food and drink (essentially an enforced state of fasting) during labor?</p><p>A few clinical issues related to breastfeeding and child lipidomic changes could have been but were also not addressed by the authors using the present dataset. For example, it would be important to know whether the mode of feeding – exclusive breastfeeding or mixed feeding – influences the development of the child's lipidome. Other questions that can be answered as well include: (a) delineating the influences of different types of formula milk (cow versus goat, for example) on the child's lipidome at different time points, (b) definition of particular breast milk lipid signatures that correlate to higher infant/toddler BMI, and (c) determination of breast milk lipid content and compositions for GDM and healthy mothers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72779.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper has been discussed extensively among the reviewers.

This is partly due to the long follow up times required for such studies in order to investigate clinical outcomes in later life. Additionally, in depth lipidomic profiling data of infants and young children are scarse.

The dataset does not include further classification of unscheduled cesarean births. While it may be informative to have such information and evaluate lipid signatures associated with such complications, we suspect that the low numbers of such cases within a cohort would be underpowered for such analyses. Additionally, they are all, to varying degrees, stress-inducing for the foetus and if they are associated with any changes, they could probably show a similar profile.</p><p>We have now included this explanation in the Results section (page 17, line 6 -11)</p><p>“In this study, we compared four different birth modes: assisted vaginal birth (assisted VB, n = 214) (including both forceps- and vacuum-assisted birth), scheduled cesarean (CS, n = 178) and unscheduled cesarean (unscheduled CS, n = 155), with unassisted vaginal birth (VB, n = 525) as reference.

We investigated the association of breastfeeding with plasma lipids at 6 months and 12 months. Of the 776 lipid species 664 lipid species (90%) were significantly associated with breastfeeding at 6 months, and 438 (of 773, 65%) were significantly associated at 12 months (Supplementary tables 13 and 14). Of particular note, species of alkyl and alkenylphospholipids (plasmalogens) and alkyldiacylglycerides (TG-O) were markedly elevated in breastfed infants. At a class level these elevations were of the order of 2-4 fold, while individual species of alkydiacylglycerols: TG(O-54:2) [NL-17:1], TG(O-54:2) [NL-18:1], TG(O-52:1) [NL-18:1] were elevated 17 – 19 fold at 6 months. However, at 12 months, this effect size was only 2-4 fold, given the introduction of a wide variety of foods along with breast milk (Figure 6). In addition to the dramatic increase in these ether lipid species, we also observed an increase in many species containing odd- and branched-chain fatty acids such as phosphatidylcholine PC(33:0), sphingomyelin SM(d19:1/24:1) and others.

There are a number of lipids that may have toxic effects on certain cells. For example ceramide has been shown to have cardiotoxic effects in adults.

While there are large population studies that have established dysregulation of lipid metabolism to be associated with metabolic syndrome, very little is known about the lipid metabolism in early life and the in-utero and ante-natal factors affecting lipid metabolism in infants and how its manifested in later life. This is partly, due to the long follow up times required for such studies and most of them have containing sufficient variation in gestational age have begun to reach adulthood allowing other potential outcomes to be investigated.

While the work is largely descriptive, the authors provide important information on the natural biological variation of the circulating lipidome from gestation to up to 4 years of age, along with corresponding data on their mothers. However, there are major concerns:</p><p>1. The authors show with regression analyses that certain lipid species are increased/decreased in response birth and year 4 BMI and weight. However, it is highly unlikely these individual lipid species are acting in isolation. It is more likely that there are various high-risk, moderate-risk, and low-risk &quot;clusters&quot; of lipid species that change over time with respect to each other which are associated with birth weight and ultimately year 4 BMI. Linear regression is not sufficient to resolve such clusters, and time-series principal component analysis should be used (eg, PMID 32504647)</p></disp-quote><p>Upon the recommendation from the editors, we have now excluded the analyses of association of lipids with BMI. Based on reviewer 2’s comments, we performed time-series clustering to capture the changes of all the lipid species across all the time points.

The significance of the work would be significantly strengthened if the authors performed machine learning analysis of the dynamic lipidome to identify particular species associated with birth weight and year 4 BMI to complement traditional statistical approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors agree that analysis of the dynamic lipidome is required. We also recognise the limitations of the use of BMI as a measure for obesity in children. A child’s weight status is different from adult BMI categories. Children’s body composition varies as they age and varies between boys and girls. Therefore, BMI levels among children and teens need to be expressed relative to other children of the same age and sex. Hence, growth trajectories developed using BMI are widely used to track child’s growth 9 (Wickramasinghe, V.P., et al., <italic>Validity of BMI as a measure of obesity in Australian white Caucasian and Australian Sri Lankan children.</italic> Annals of Human Biology, 2005.; Himes, J.H., <italic>Challenges of accurately measuring and using BMI and other indicators of obesity in children.</italic> Pediatrics, 2009)</p><p>We are currently performing analyses of growth trajectories and will then be able to apply machine learning approaches to identify changes to the lipidome associated with adverse growth trajectories.
