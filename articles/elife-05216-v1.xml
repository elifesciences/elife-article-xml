vertebrate eye development through major morphological transformations. The overall basal surface, facing the developing lens, is increasing, while, at the same time, the space basally occupied by individual cells is decreasing. This cannot be explained by the classical view of eye development. Using zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) as a model, we show that the lens-averted epithelium functions as a reservoir that contributes to the growing neuroretina through epithelial flow around the distal rims of the optic cup. We propose that this flow couples morphogenesis and retinal determination. Our 4D data indicate that future stem cells flow from their origin in the lens-averted domain of the optic vesicle to their destination in the ciliary marginal zone. BMP-mediated inhibition of the flow results in ectopic neuroretina in the RPE domain. Ultimately the ventral fissure fails to close resulting in coloboma.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05216.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05216.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05216.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The eye is our most important organ for sensing and recognizing our environment. In humans and other vertebrates, the eye forms from an outgrowth of the brain as the embryo develops. This outgrowth is called the optic vesicle and it is rapidly transformed into a cup-shaped structure known as the optic cup. Defects in this process prevent the optic cup from closing completely, which leads to a severe condition called Coloboma—one of the most frequent causes of blindness in children.</p><p>The optic cup has two distinct layers: the inside layer—known as the neuroretina—contains light sensitive cells and is surrounded by the other layer called the pigmented epithelium. It is thought that the neural retina is made from cells from the side of the optic vesicle that faces the lens, and the pigmented epithelium is formed by cells from the other side of the vesicle. This is a plausible explanation and is well accepted, but it cannot explain how the neuroretina can become five times larger as the cup forms.</p><p>Heermann et al. addressed this problem by using four-dimensional in vivo microscopy to follow individual cells as the optic cup forms in living zebrafish embryos. The experiments show that the neuroretina is made of cells from both sides of the optic vesicle. Cells from the back of the optic vesicle (furthest away from the lens) join the rest of the cells by moving around the outside rim of the cup.</p><p>Further experiments found that a signaling molecule called BMP—which is crucial to the normal development of the eye—controls the flow of cells around the developing optic cup. This factor needs to be carefully controlled during the development of the eye; when BMP activity was artificially increased, the flow of cells stopped, resulting in neuroretinal tissue developing in the wrong place (in the outer layer of the optic cup).</p><p>The experiments also reveal that the stem cells in the retina—which divide to produce new cells throughout the life of the zebrafish—originate from two distinct areas in the optic vesicle.</p><p>Heermann et al.'s findings challenge the textbook model of eye development by revealing that cells from both sides of the optic vesicle contribute to the neuroretina and that retinal stem cells originate from a specific place in the developing eye. A future challenge will be to understand how the movement of the cells into the neuroretina is coordinated to make a perfectly shaped eye.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05216.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05216.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>optic vesicle</kwd><kwd>optic cup</kwd><kwd>BMP antagonist</kwd><kwd>neuroretinal flow</kwd><kwd>optic fissure</kwd><kwd>coloboma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG/ Molecular mechanisms regulating optic fissure closure</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krieglstein</surname><given-names>Kerstin</given-names></name><name><surname>Wittbrodt</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Grant (AdG), LS3, ERC-2011-ADG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wittbrodt</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The lens-averted domains of the optic vesicle are reservoirs of neuroretinal cells that flow into the developing optic cup in a process that is critically influenced by BMP signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Main Text</title><p>The bi-layered optic vesicles of vertebrates are formed through a bilateral evagination of the late prosencephalon. In teleosts, this process is driven by a migration of single cells that undergo a subsequent intercalation into the epithelium of the expanding optic vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rembold et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">England et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sinn and Wittbrodt, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ivanovitch et al., 2013</xref>). The oval optic vesicle develops into a hemispheric bi-layered optic cup through a process that involves major morphological transformations. A long-held view of this process proposes that the lens-averted epithelium of the optic vesicle differentiates into the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), while the epithelium facing the lens gives rise to the neuroretina, which subsequently bends around the developing lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chow and Lang, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuhrmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Walls, 1942</xref>). This neuroepithelial bending is driven by a basal constriction of lens-facing retinal progenitor cells (RPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martinez-Morales et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogdanović et al., 2012</xref>), which ultimately reduces the space occupied by an individual RPC at the basal surface. However, we observed that this is accompanied by a 4.7-fold increase in the overall basal optic cup surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). To identify the cellular origin of this massive increase, we performed in vivo time-lapse microscopy in zebrafish at the corresponding stages, starting at 16.5 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–L</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), in a transgenic line expressing a membrane-coupled GFP in retinal stem and progenitor cells (Rx2::GFPcaax).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05216.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Neuroretinal surface increases during optic cup formation by epithelial flow.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme showing the orientation of the pictures presented in <bold>B</bold>–<bold>L</bold>.

The majority of the lens-averted epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,G</xref>, between arrowheads) serves as a neuro-epithelial reservoir, which eventually is fully integrated into the lens-facing neuro-epithelium (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This occurs through a sheet-like flow of lens-averted cells into the forming optic cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,H</xref>). This epithelial flow is independent of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) as demonstrated by aphidicolin treatment. The process is highly reminiscent of gastrulation movements and explains the marked increase of the lens-facing basal neuroretinal surface area. Notably, a small domain of the lens-averted epithelium exhibits a different morphology and behavior. As optic cup formation proceeds, this region flattens, enlarges, exhibits the morphological characteristics of RPE, and eventually ceases expressing RX2, a marker for retinal stem and early progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, asterisks, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>, in between arrows).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video2" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-05216-media2-v1.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05216.005</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>(related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) Aphidicolin treated embryo.

This new perspective on optic cup formation raises the question of how the elongated oval optic vesicle is transformed into the hemispheric optic cup. We addressed this by 4D imaging of optic cup formation using a nuclear label (H2BGFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We found, concomitant with lens formation, a prominent epithelial flow around the temporal perimeter of the forming optic cup. An involution of cells from the domain of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) into the domain of the neuroretina had been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2000</xref>). Such reorganization of the lens-averted and the lens-facing epithelia, affecting the temporal optic cup, has been subsequently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Picker et al., 2009</xref>) and confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>).

A key step in the formation of the ventral neuroretina is the formation of the optic fissure at the ventral pole of the optic vesicle. Lens-averted epithelium flows through this fissure into the forming optic cup to constitute the ventral neuroepithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Taken together, we present a model of optic cup formation, driven by gastrulation-like epithelial flow from the lens-averted into the lens-facing epithelium of the forming optic cup. The epithelium flows in two domains around the temporal and nasal rim, respectively and through the optic fissure of the forming optic cup. Overall, this has far-reaching implications for different aspects of eye development. One is the establishment of the retinal stem cell niche in the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Centanin et al., 2011</xref>), the distal rim of the optic cup/retina.</p><p>To address whether the CMZ domain originates from a mixed population of progenitor cells that have been ‘set aside’, or from a predefined coherent domain, we analyzed the transition from optic vesicle to optic cup in 3D over time (4D) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). By tracking individual cells, we identified the origin of the distal retinal domain, the future CMZ, as two distinct domains (nasal and temporal) within the lens-averted epithelium at the optic vesicle stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). Based on tracking information, we noticed distinct phases during the flow from the lens-averted domain towards the CMZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Although cells show high motility in an early phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, 1), the directed flow is established only in a later phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, 2), in which cells ultimately flow to the rim of the forming optic cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video4" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-05216-media4-v1.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05216.010</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>(related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) (control) Optic vesicle to optic cup transition visualized by H2BGFP RNA into rx2::GFPcaax (orientation as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) (imaging starts at 16.5 hpf, framerate 1/10 min).</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05216.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05216.010</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video5" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-05216-media5-v1.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05216.011</object-id><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>(related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) (control) Optic vesicle to optic cup transition visualized by H2BGFP RNA into rx2::GFPcaax (orientation as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), data as in <xref ref-type="other" rid="video4">video 4</xref> with tracked cells (maximum projection) to the presumptive CMZ.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05216.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05216.011</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>As indicated above, the dorsal pole of the optic vesicle remains static (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, the presumptive dorsal CMZ domain either originates from the lens-facing neuroretina or, alternatively, is established secondarily at a later time point, like the ventral CMZ in the region of the optic fissure. The identification of lens-averted domains as the source of the future nasal and temporal CMZ is consistent with the hypothesis of a distinct origin of retinal stem cells. Our data support a scenario in which the entire optic vesicle is initially composed of stem cells that at the lens-facing side respond to a signal to take a progenitor fate.</p><p>We propose a tight coupling of morphogenesis with cell determination by inductive signals derived from the surface ectoderm to explain the successive spreading of retinal differentiation from the center to the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sinn and Wittbrodt, 2013</xref>). Accordingly, lens-averted stem cells might retain their stem cell fate because they are exposed to that signal at the latest point in time. An alternative hypothesis is that stemness might require an active process at the interface to the RPE; it is also possible that both scenarios are involved. Both scenarios are consistent with the expression pattern of <italic>rx2</italic>, which is initially found in the entire optic vesicle and subsequently is confined to the CMZ. Strikingly, rx2-positive cells of the CMZ represent multipotent retinal stem cells (Reinhardt, Centanin et al., submitted).</p><p>We demonstrated that cell motility and thus tissue fluidity are a prerequisite for neuroretinal flow. These characteristics are likely maintained through signaling, raising the question of which system might be involved. A likely candidate might be BMP, which has been linked to mobility in other tissues during development. In heart jogging, for example, BMP has an ‘antimotogenic’ effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Veerkamp et al., 2013</xref>).

After initiation of neuroretinal differentiation in control embryos, the undifferentiated domains are restricted to the un-fused optic fissure margins and the forming CMZ. Both can be visualized by the expression of <italic>Rx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). The impairment of neuroretinal flow, however, resulted in a mis-organization of the optic fissure. Here, the undifferentiated <italic>Rx2</italic>-expressing domain was found at the ultimate tip of the lens-averted neuroretinal domain, which failed to flow into the optic cup and persisted in the prospective RPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). As a result, the temporal optic fissure margin, in particular, failed to extend into the optic fissure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>). This also holds true, but to a lesser extent, to the nasal optic fissure margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). As a result, the two fissure margins cannot converge resulting in a persisting optic fissure, a coloboma. Macroscopically, the pan-ocular expression of BMP4 results in phenotypes including a ‘Plattauge’ (flat-eye) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), in which the ventral part of the eye is strongly affected and a milder phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), in which the ventral retina develops, but with a persisting optic fissure.</p><p>It was previously shown that exposing the developing eye to high levels of ectopically applied BMP can cause dorsalization, concomitant with a loss of ventral cell identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behesti et al., 2006</xref>). This is likely the cause for coloboma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behesti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koshiba-Takeuchi et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sasagawa et al., 2002</xref>). Our data based on stable BMP4 expression (rx2::BMP4) in the entire optic vesicle, however, conclusively show that early BMP4 exposure arrests neuroepithelial flow, resulting in a morphologically affected ventral retina. The ventral expression of vax2 in optic cups of rx2::BMP4 embryos indicates the maintenance of ventral retinal fates and argues against early transdifferentiation/dorsalization induced by BMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Remarkably, the remaining lens-averted domain of those embryos, which was ectopically localized and was not integrated into the optic cup, eventually differentiated into neuroretina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), as indicated by the expression of vsx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vitorino et al., 2009</xref>) and vsx2 (formerly Chx10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vitorino et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, a localization of neuroretina within the RPE domain might be mistaken for an RPE to neuroretina trans-differentiation, as proposed for other phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azuma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sakaguchi et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bankhead et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Even in amniotes, the histological analyses of consecutive stages of optic cup development are best interpreted as epithelial flow that also enlarges the retinal surface. This can even be appreciated during in vitro optic cup formation using mammalian embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eiraku et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data clearly show that during optic vesicle to optic cup transformation, the lens-averted part of the optic vesicle is largely integrated into the lens-facing optic cup by flowing around the distal rim of the optic cup including the forming optic fissure. Our data have far-reaching implications on the generation of the retinal stem cell niche of teleosts, as the last cells flowing into the optic cup will eventually constitute the CMZ. We identify a part of the lens-averted epithelium as the primary source of the RPE. The arrest of neuroepithelial flow by the ‘antimotogenic’ effect of BMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Veerkamp et al., 2013</xref>) results in coloboma and thus highlights the importance of the flow through the fissure for the establishment of the ventral optic cup.</p><p>It is unlikely that the bending of the neuroretina provides the motor for the epithelial flow; in the opo mutant no ectopic neuroretina can be found, indicating that the flow persists, even in the absence of optic cup bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogdanović et al., 2012</xref>). Consequently, forces established outside the neuroretina are likely to drive the flow. One tissue potentially involved is the mono-layered-forming RPE. We speculate that this tissue contributes to the flow by changing its shape from a columnar to a flat epithelium, massively enlarging its surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). This remains an interesting point, in particular given that epithelial flow is maintained even if cell proliferation is inhibited in both neuroretina and RPE.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transgenic zebrafish and Injections</title><p>BMP4 was cloned via directional Gateway from zebrafish cDNA into a pEntr D-TOPO (Invitrogen, Germany) vector with the following primers: forw: 5′ CACCGTCTAGGGATCCCTTGTTCTTTTTGCAGCCGCCACCATGATTCCTGGTAATCGAATGCTG 3′, rev: 5′ TTAGCGGCA GCCACACCCCTCGACCAC 3′.</p><p>The expression construct was assembled via a Gateway reaction using Tol2 destination vector containing a cmlc: GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kwan et al., 2007</xref>), a 5′Entry vector containing an rx2 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martinez-Morales et al., 2009</xref>), the vector containing the BMP4 and a 3′Entry vector containing a pA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kwan et al., 2007</xref>).

Only tracks with a significant length were used for the visualizations. Centered on the track cells are represented as spheres. Partially results are presented in a side view where the dorso-ventral axis originally represented as the z-axis has now become the y-axis. A factor of 10.5703 is introduced in order to adjust the data of the former z-axis to the other two axes. The color coding is done by choosing colors from an 8 bit lookup table and applying them from the dorsal to the ventral side based on the end of the track. Partially tracking results are presented as tailed spheres. The spheres are based on the tracking data using an average over the last three timepoints. The image is stretched in the z-axis using a factor of 10.5703, to adjust the scale to the x and y axes. Tails are created using a lookup table with 16 different shades per color. The respective shade is defined by the distance and difference in time between the recent position and the position on the tail.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We want to thank Karin Schumacher for generously providing space for finishing the work on this manuscript, Lea Schertel for excellent technical assistance, members of the Wittbrodt lab for material (P Haas and A Schmidt for the rx2: GFP construct and zebrafish line, B Höckendorf and M Stemmer for H2BGFP mRNA, B Höckendorf for FIJI related input) and constructive stimulating feedback, B Roman for the BRE: GFP zebrafish, William Harris for the vsx2: RFP zebrafish line and Lucia Poggi for making the vsx1: GFP zebrafish line available.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Tanya Whitfield, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While all three reviewers find the study interesting, there are some substantive reservations over the manuscript in its current form. A major criticism is the lack of citation and acknowledgement of previous literature. A number of papers have been suggested by the reviewers, all of which should be considered, cited and discussed carefully. In addition, the conclusions and interpretation of the findings should be adjusted to take full account of these earlier studies.</p><p>In addition, some further experimental work should be done to strengthen the manuscript. A fuller description, at multiple embryonic stages, of the BRE:GFP expression domains in the eye, and correlation with expression of both P–Smads and BMP inhibitors (fsta, bambi), is required. A later stage in situ showing vax2 expression following BMP overexpression should also be shown. If additional data (such as the origin of the stem cell compartment, or tracing the patch of lens-averted epithelium that forms the RPE) can be extracted from the existing movies (or generated with new ones), this information would be extremely valuable and would enhance the significance and novelty of the findings.</p><p>A number of other suggestions have been suggested by the reviewers to improve the manuscript, including adding more detail to the Experimental Procedures section and clarifying the data provided in the Table. It will be essential to provide accurate embryo staging and labeling throughout.</p><p>The full reviews are appended below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting report documenting the cell movements that contribute to formation of the zebrafish neuroretina. The authors demonstrate that much of the retina derives from lens-averted epithelium, which moves round and into the lens-adjacent layer in directed movements of the cell sheet akin to gastrulation. These movements continue in the absence of cell proliferation, and account for the apparently paradoxical increase in surface area of the neuroretina, despite the decrease in apical surface area of individual cells in this tissue. It is proposed that a small patch of the lens-averted epithelium gives rise to the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE).</p><p>Some of the imaging is spectacular and supports the conclusions of the paper well. However, there are also a number of deficits that should be addressed. These are listed below.</p><p>General points:</p><p>The authors place great importance on the retinal stem cell niche, but have no markers to show this population. Can they be visualised in some way?</p><p>They also place importance on the role of the developing RPE in driving the cell movements, but the cell movements of this layer are not described well at all, and the small patch of cells that is proposed to become the RPE is not identified or followed in any of the figures or movies. It will be important to show this to confirm the assertion that only a small patch of the lens-averted epithelium develops into the RPE.</p><p>Numbers and quantitation: more detail is needed throughout, e.g. for the phenotypes of 'variable expressivity' (eleventh paragraph) resulting from pan-ocular expression of BMP4.</p><p>Figures:</p><p>Scale bars are needed on the figures, especially on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, where the surface area is estimated from linear dimensions drawn onto sections. The scale is needed to ensure the data shown in the figure panels match up with the values listed in the Table.</p><p>Stages/hours post fertilization should also be listed in the legend or directly on the panels for all figures.</p><p>Figure 1–figure supplement 1 should show a control (H2BGFP without aphidicolin). If this is provided by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, there should be a reference to this figure in the legend to Figure 1–figure supplement 1, so that a comparison can be made.

It further shows that the inhibition of BMP is required for this process to occur efficiently. The study has interesting implications to understand the origin of optic cup domains. In addition, it provides a new interpretation for phenotypes that up to now had been interpreted as transdifferentiation of RPE into retina, and highlight the power of live imaging to provide an accurate interpretation of phenotypic outcomes. I consider the work a valuable contribution to our current knowledge on eye morphogenesis and patterning. However, I have important concerns with the way the significance of previous works analyzing this same process has been minimised by the authors, and with the interpretation of some of their observations.</p><p>The finding of optic vesicle cells ingressing into the future retinal layer from the prospective RPE layer is not new. It has been extensively described by Picker et al., PLoS Biology, 2009 and Kwan et al., Development, 2012. I disagree with the way the authors seem to remove significance from those papers, and I consider they should be appropriately cited. In particular, Picker et al. clearly and extensively showed that prior to optic cup formation, the optic vesicle is mostly formed by future retinal cells, and that the lens-averted layer of the primordium constitutes the origin of the temporal retinal domain.</p><p>This does not mean that I do not consider the current work valuable. The authors do provide a detailed analysis of the consequences this morphogenetic process has to understand the origin of different optic cup domains (in particular the CMZ and the RPE), and dissect part of the molecular mechanisms controlling it.</p><p>The authors state that follistatin is expressed in the temporal domain, yet their in-situ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) clearly shows expression in the prospective dorsal portion of the optic vesicle. At early stages, the optic vesicle in zebrafish has not acquired its final disposition and temporal is located along the ventral portion of the optic vesicle. Follistatin expression is stronger at the distal-most region of the optic vesicle, both dorsal and ventral, which corresponds to prospective dorsal (see Veien et al., Development, 2008). Indeed, this would be more consistent with previous reports showing a requirement of differential BMP signalling along the dorso-ventral, and not the naso-temporal, axis.</p><p>In the same line with my first comment, I find the authors should be more rigorous with their citation of previous work. In the first sentence of their manuscript and based on a previous report from the authors from 2006, they state that optic vesicle evagination occurs by single cell migration. However, since then there have been additional papers analyzing dynamically this process and showing results that support alternative explanations for the active behaviours of eye field cells.

Yet the authors describe the dorsal region as having notably less flow. Is this the prospective nasal region? Clarification, and placing these results in the context of previously characterized movements would be useful.</p><p>2) The authors show BRE reporter expression in the dorsal domain at optic cup stage. At least one other BMP inhibitor, bambi, is already known to be expressed in the prospective dorsal domain (first temporal, then dorsal) throughout optic cup development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">French et al., 2009</xref>). The coincidence of BMP inhibitor expression and BRE reporter expression suggests a potential negative feedback loop, though BMP signaling is not completely abolished in the dorsal domain, based on phospho-Smad staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">French et al., 2009</xref>) and BRE reporter expression. Therefore, fsta expression (and expression of other BMP inhibitors) may not mark a zone of repressed BMP signaling, as the authors have proposed.</p><p>3) The authors argue that BMP overexpression driven by rx2 does not lead to fate changes in the eye, by demonstrating unchanged expression of vax2. However, the embryo appears to be ∼18 somite stage (this is a guess given the lack of staging)? This reviewer was under the impression that the rx2 promoter does not begin to induce transcription until ∼14 somite stage, therefore, it is unclear if vax2 expression would be altered in such a short time. A later in situ (prim–5) would be a better control, especially given strong induction of the BRE and later phenotypes. Any clarification on promoter activity and timing would be welcome.</p><p>4) The authors argue that there is no BMP activity in the early optic vesicle by using the BRE reporter line. Is it clear that this line reports all BMP activity? There is evidence that BMP signaling is active in the early optic vesicle: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">French et al., 2009</xref>, demonstrate strong phospho-Smad staining in the optic vesicle temporal region (which gives rise to the dorsal domain) at 6 and 10 somite stages.</p><p>5) Cell movement from lens-averted to lens-facing domain has previously been analyzed via live imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Picker et al., 2009</xref>), cell tracking and volume measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>).

In addition, the conclusions and interpretation of the findings should be adjusted to take full account of these earlier studies.</italic></p><p><italic>In addition, some further experimental work should be done to strengthen the manuscript. A fuller description, at multiple embryonic stages, of the BRE:GFP expression domains in the eye, and correlation with expression of both P–Smads and BMP inhibitors (fsta, bambi), is required.

If additional data (such as the origin of the stem cell compartment, or tracing the patch of lens-averted epithelium that forms the RPE) can be extracted from the existing movies (or generated with new ones), this information would be extremely valuable and would enhance the significance and novelty of the findings.</italic></p><p><italic>A number of other suggestions have been suggested by the reviewers to improve the manuscript, including adding more detail to the Experimental Procedures section and clarifying the data provided in the Table. It will be essential to provide accurate embryo staging and labeling throughout.</italic></p><p><italic>The full reviews are appended below.</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>This is an interesting report documenting the cell movements that contribute to formation of the zebrafish neuroretina. The authors demonstrate that much of the retina derives from lens-averted epithelium, which moves round and into the lens-adjacent layer in directed movements of the cell sheet akin to gastrulation. These movements continue in the absence of cell proliferation, and account for the apparently paradoxical increase in surface area of the neuroretina, despite the decrease in apical surface area of individual cells in this tissue. It is proposed that a small patch of the lens-averted epithelium gives rise to the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE).</italic></p><p><italic>Some of the imaging is spectacular and supports the conclusions of the paper well. However, there are also a number of deficits that should be addressed. These are listed below.</italic></p><p><italic>General points:</italic></p><p><italic>The authors place great importance on the retinal stem cell niche, but have no markers to show this population. Can they be visualised in some way?</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting aspect that we have elaborated further in the revised manuscript. The retina specific homeobox transcriptions factor Rx2 in fact represents a marker for retinal stem cells at the relevant stages of the manuscript (see attached manuscript by Reinhardt, Centanin et al., submitted elsewhere). It is initially expressed in all cells of the evaginated optic vesicle (likely stem cells) and as development proceeds is limited to the CMZ. At later stages (once the retinal cell types enter terminal differentiation after the completion of optic cup formation) its expression is additionally found in Müller Glia cells and photoreceptors. The stem cells of the neuroretina and the Retinal Pigmented Epithelium (RPE) are located within the CMZ. Using an inducible CRE based lineage analysis we show in the accompanying manuscript that Rx2 cells of the CMZ represent stem cells. An individual Rx2 positive cell is multipotent and gives rise to all retinal cell types (Reinhardt, Centanin et al., submitted). This is now explicitly stated in the revised version of the manuscript where we refer to rx2 as retinal stem cell marker. The submitted manuscript of Reinhardt, Centanin et al. has been attached.</p><p><italic>They also place importance on the role of the developing RPE in driving the cell movements, but the cell movements of this layer are not described well at all, and the small patch of cells that is proposed to become the RPE is not identified or followed in any of the figures or movies. It will be important to show this to confirm the assertion that only a small patch of the lens-averted epithelium develops into the RPE.</italic></p><p>This is an important point, and we thank the referee for this comment. In the revised version of the manuscript we now put emphasis on the developing RPE. We use two features to identify early RPE: The absence of Rx2 expression as well as the specific flat morphology of the RPE cells (and nuclei). Using those criteria we follow the edge of the RPE, best visualized in <xref ref-type="other" rid="video3">Movie 3</xref>. We show the developing RPE in between the arrows, which mark the border of RPE. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J-L</xref> is highlighting the change in cell shape the RPE precursors undergo, concomitant with their loss of Rx2 expression (between asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>We have taken care to clearly state these important points in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Numbers and quantitation: more detail is needed throughout, e.g. for the phenotypes of 'variable expressivity' (eleventh paragraph) resulting from pan-ocular expression of BMP4.</italic></p><p>The referee is right. Our statements were misleading and the variability was due to genetic variability in the analyzed lines. We had initially mentioned the variable expressivity to indicate a graded activity of BMP4, which however was apparently not fully explained.</p><p>In order to avoid that confusion we now only focus on one phenotypic class and have removed the misleading term from the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Figures:</italic></p><p><italic>Scale bars are needed on the figures, especially on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B and C</italic></xref>, where the surface area is estimated from linear dimensions drawn onto sections.

We show the eyes of control and rx2::BMP4 embryos from different angles (lateral and ventral). The expression of vax2 in the ventral part of the retina persists even under conditions of BMP expression in the entire optic vesicle. This indicates that the observed morphological alterations observed under those conditions are not due to a miss-patterning of the ventral retina but can rather be attributed to the antimotogenic effect of BMP4.

The coincidence of BMP inhibitor expression and BRE reporter expression suggests a potential negative feedback loop, though BMP signaling is not completely abolished in the dorsal domain, based on phospho-Smad staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">French et al., 2009</xref>) and BRE reporter expression. Therefore, fsta expression (and expression of other BMP inhibitors) may not mark a zone of repressed BMP signaling, as the authors have proposed.</italic></p><p>We are thankful for this comment. We included the BMP antagonist bambi into our analyses and noted the strikingly overlapping patterns of BMP signaling activity and bambi expression (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The referee is right in stating that bambi is not totally antagonizing BMP signaling but rather is modulating it or may be even modulated by it. With bambi alone it would be hard to explain the modulation of BMP signaling to facilitate the neuroretinal flow. However, fsta shows a different expression pattern (please see the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), able to explain the facilitation of the flow nicely.</p><p><italic>3) The authors argue that BMP overexpression driven by rx2 does not lead to fate changes in the eye, by demonstrating unchanged expression of vax2. However, the embryo appears to be ∼18 somite stage (this is a guess given the lack of staging)? This reviewer was under the impression that the rx2 promoter does not begin to induce transcription until ∼14 somite stage, therefore, it is unclear if vax2 expression would be altered in such a short time. A later in situ (prim–5) would be a better control, especially given strong induction of the BRE and later phenotypes. Any clarification on promoter activity and timing would be welcome.</italic></p><p>In situ hybridizations with a vax2 probe have been added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6–figure supplement 4</xref>). This figure shows the staining of control vs. rx2::BMP4 embryos at a later developmental stage (28 hpf). Although the vax2 domain is smaller in the rx2::BMP4 embryos, compared to the controls, it is not absent. Hence, the reason for the arrested flow (16.5–21.5) is unlikely an early mis-differentiation of the ventral domain.</p><p><italic>4) The authors argue that there is no BMP activity in the early optic vesicle by using the BRE reporter line. Is it clear that this line reports all BMP activity? There is evidence that BMP signaling is active in the early optic vesicle: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">French et al., 2009</xref>, demonstrate strong phospho-Smad staining in the optic vesicle temporal region (which gives rise to the dorsal domain) at 6 and 10 somite stages.</italic></p><p>We agree with the referee and included next to the analysis of BRE::GFP anti-pSmad 1/5/8 immunohistochemical stainings, both at different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Notably the BMP signaling reporter shows a delay of activity, which can be explained by its nature as a transcriptional reporter. This suggests that BMP signaling still is active. This is in favour of a modulative action of the BMP antagonists rather than a total block. We thank the referees for this comment.</p><p><italic>5) Cell movement from lens-averted to lens-facing domain has previously been analyzed via live imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Picker et al., 2009</xref>), cell tracking and volume measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>). A novel finding would be when such flow ceases, thereby defining the definitive stem cell compartment; this was never demonstrated previously. The authors' movies are likely to contain that information, as the last embryo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref> appears older than prim–5, based on lens morphology.</italic></p><p>We agree with the referee that Picker et al., as well as Kwan et al., described flow over the distal rim of the developing optic cup. It was not our intention not to acknowledge these findings. We extended the paragraph discussing this point in the revised version of the manuscript. In addition we added a reference to an additional manuscript speculating about such a flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2000</xref>) even before Picker and Kwan.</p><p>The flow in the temporal domain was then shown by Picker et al. and confirmed by Kwan et al. The nasal flow was not demonstrated and the flow with respect to the origin of the optic fissure was not addressed before. The aspect of the dorsal pole, showing no flow, was also neither described nor addressed before.</p><p>Regarding the forming stem cell compartment (CMZ), this was part of our analyses. We describe the origin of the cells, which eventually reside in the CMZ domain, by tracking them backwards in 4D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video5">Movie 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) Embryo ages (somite stages or hours post fertilization) are lacking throughout the manuscript, making it difficult to place these movements in context of other known events.</italic></p><p>The developmental stages of embryos have been added to the figure legends.</p></body></sub-article></article>
