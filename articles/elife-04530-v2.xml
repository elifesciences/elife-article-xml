Less clear is whether intergenic lncRNAs commonly regulate transcription by modulating chromatin at genomically distant loci. Here, we report both genomically local and distal RNA-dependent roles of <italic>Dali</italic>, a conserved central nervous system expressed intergenic lncRNA. <italic>Dali</italic> is transcribed downstream of the <italic>Pou3f3</italic> transcription factor gene and its depletion disrupts the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. Locally, <italic>Dali</italic> transcript regulates transcription of the <italic>Pou3f3</italic> locus. Distally, it preferentially targets active promoters and regulates expression of neural differentiation genes, in part through physical association with the POU3F3 protein. <italic>Dali</italic> interacts with the DNMT1 DNA methyltransferase in mouse and human and regulates DNA methylation status of CpG island-associated promoters in <italic>trans</italic>. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that a single intergenic lncRNA controls the activity and methylation of genomically distal regulatory elements to modulate large-scale transcriptional programmes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04530.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04530.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04530.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Traditionally genes are considered to contain all the instructions necessary to build proteins. For these instructions to be followed they need to be ‘transcribed’ into molecules called messenger RNA, which are then ‘translated’ to form the protein. Messenger RNAs are not the only type of RNA molecule made in a cell; long non-coding RNAs (or lncRNAs), for example, are transcribed but never translated into proteins. Instead, some lncRNAs control the expression of nearby genes and some alter how the DNA is packaged within the cell.</p><p>Several lncRNAs have been found to control their neighbouring genes, but it is unclear how many of these molecules can also regulate genes that are much further away, even on other chromosomes. One lncRNA called <italic>Dali</italic> is made in cells of the nervous system of mammals. In the genome, the gene for <italic>Dali</italic> is situated next to a gene called <italic>Pou3f3,</italic> which encodes a protein that contributes to the growth and development of nerves and the kidneys.</p><p>Chalei et al. have now shown that artificially reducing the amount of the <italic>Dali</italic> lncRNA restricts the development of mouse cells called N2A cells, which are commonly used to study the development of nerve cells. Reducing <italic>Dali</italic> lncRNA levels in these cells caused <italic>Pou3f3</italic> messenger RNA levels to also decrease, which demonstrates that <italic>Dali</italic> is a lncRNA that controls its neighbouring gene. The levels of many other genes were also changed when <italic>Dali</italic> levels were reduced, including many genes that are needed to grow working nerve cells.</p><p>Chalei et al. also showed that the <italic>Dali</italic> lncRNA binds to 1427 different regions of the genome of N2A cells, most often near to the start of active genes; <italic>Dali</italic> could be carried to these sites by the POU3F3 protein. The DNA sequences with which the <italic>Dali</italic> lncRNA binds were all different. Chalei et al. found that <italic>Dali</italic> also binds to an enzyme, called DNMT1, that chemically modifies DNA to change how it is packaged into a cell, and they predict that this enzyme helps <italic>Dali</italic> to find its binding sites. Furthermore, when <italic>Dali</italic> lncRNA levels were artificially reduced, the chemical modifications that affect the packaging of DNA in the cell—and hence the expression of genes encoded by this DNA—were changed for several genes. Some of these genes were located far away from the gene that encodes <italic>Dali</italic>, indicating that this lncRNA can regulate the packaging and expression of distant genes.</p><p>Many genes that are regulated by <italic>Dali</italic> are also regulated by the POU3F3 protein; this suggests that the lncRNA might work together with this protein to affect the expression of some genes. Further work is now needed to uncover how many other lncRNAs act away from their sites of synthesis, and how many also form complexes with DNA-binding and DNA-modifying proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04530.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04530.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>lncRNA</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>DNMT1</kwd><kwd>Pou3f3</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>DALIR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>249869, DARCGENs</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chalei</surname><given-names>Vladislava</given-names></name><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>Lesheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Keith W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sansom</surname><given-names>Stephen N</given-names></name><name><surname>Ponting</surname><given-names>Chris P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Darwin Trust of Edinburgh</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postgraduate Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chalei</surname><given-names>Vladislava</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission (EC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Human Brain Project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montiel</surname><given-names>Juan F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dali regulates transcription of the Pou3f3 locus locally and binds and regulates active promoters in trans by modulating DNA methylation status.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A growing number of nuclear localised long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA, ≥ 200 nt) are known to regulate gene transcription and chromatin organisation (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vance and Ponting, 2014</xref>)). Many of these transcripts appear to act near to their site of synthesis to regulate the expression of genes locally on the same chromosome (<italic>cis</italic>-acting). <italic>Cis</italic>-acting lncRNA regulatory mechanisms have been described in detail for a number of enhancer associated nuclear lncRNAs, as well as lncRNAs involved in the processes of genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Melo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Monnier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mousavi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Santoro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vallot et al., 2013</xref>). Some <italic>cis</italic>-acting lncRNAs bind to DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) proteins and regulate genomic DNA methylation levels specifically at their sites of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mohammad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Ruscio et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p><italic>Trans</italic>-acting lncRNAs that regulate gene expression across multiple chromosomes and on either allele have been documented less frequently. The ability of such lncRNAs to exert widespread effects on gene expression <italic>in trans</italic> is poorly understood, in large part because direct transcriptional targets for only very few of these transcripts have thus far been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vance et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, it is not clear whether these transcripts commonly act directly, or within ribonucleoprotein complexes, and how they might modify their target genes’ regulatory landscape such as by regulating their DNA methylation profiles.</p><p>Many thousand mammalian intergenic lncRNAs have now been identified. Not all lncRNA transcript models will be functional, however. Single exon models, in particular, can be artefacts arising from genomic DNA contaminating sequencing libraries, and transcripts that are expressed at average levels lower than one copy per cell are less likely to confer function. Highly and broadly expressed, and bona fide monoexonic intergenic lncRNAs, such as <italic>Neat1</italic> and <italic>Malat1</italic>/<italic>Neat2</italic>, however, appear not to have essential roles because their knockout mouse models are viable and fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eissmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Transcript sequences and levels are thus not reliable predictors of mechanism. Instead, the significant temporal and spatial co-expression of genomically adjacent intergenic lncRNA and transcription factor genes might suggest that such lncRNAs commonly modulate transcriptional programmes that are initiated by these transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ponjavic et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, several intergenic lncRNAs have well-documented <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berghoff et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Spatiotemporal co-expression of intergenic lncRNA and transcription factor genes is most pronounced during the development of the mouse central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ponjavic et al., 2009</xref>). To investigate the mechanistic basis of this physical linkage we chose to study a 3.5-kb, CNS-expressed, monoexonic, intergenic lncRNA termed <italic>Dali</italic> (DNMT1-Associated Long Intergenic), owing to its conservation of sequence and transcription across therian mammals and its genomic proximity to a transcription factor gene, <italic>Pou3f3</italic> (also known as <italic>Brn1</italic> or <italic>Oct8</italic>), which encodes a class III POU family transcription factor. <italic>Dali</italic> is transcribed in the sense orientation, relative to <italic>Pou3f3</italic>, from a locus 50 kb downstream of <italic>Pou3f3</italic> within the flank of an extended genomic region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that is characterised by near pervasive transcription in neuronal lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramos et al., 2013</xref>). Sauvageau et al. recently generated mouse knockout models for two of these intergenic lncRNA loci, <italic>linc-Brn1a,</italic> and <italic>linc-Brn1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Genomic deletion of the <italic>linc-Brn1b</italic> locus resulted in significant (∼50%) down-regulation of the upstream <italic>Pou3f3</italic> gene, and <italic>linc-Brn1b</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice exhibited abnormalities of cortical lamination and barrel cortex organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sauvageau et al., 2013</xref>). These abnormalities may derive from loss of the <italic>linc-Brn1b</italic> RNA transcript, or from the deletion of DNA functional elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bassett et al., 2014</xref>). The <italic>Dali</italic> locus is more distally located and does not overlap previously described lncRNA loci or regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04530.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conservation and expression within the <italic>Dali</italic> and <italic>Pou3f3</italic> loci.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of the mouse <italic>Pou3f3</italic> genomic region showing coding and non-coding transcripts, enhancer elements from Vista Enhancer Browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54a">Visel et al., 2007</xref>), CpG islands, and published genomic deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sauvageau et al., 2013</xref>).

This is in large part because the direct transcriptional targets of only a small number of such transcripts (for example, <italic>Paupar</italic> (mouse), <italic>HOTAIR</italic>, <italic>NEAT1</italic>, <italic>TERC</italic>, <italic>RMST</italic> (all human), and <italic>rox2</italic> (<italic>Drosophila</italic>)) have been identified thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vance et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, it has been unclear how these transcripts are targeted to distal functional elements and whether thereafter they alter chromatin structure in situ.</p><p>In this study we found evidence that the intergenic lncRNA <italic>Dali</italic> acts both locally to regulate the expression of its nearest protein-coding gene, <italic>Pou3f3</italic>, and distally to regulate both <italic>Pou3f3</italic>-dependent and -independent target genes in an RNA-dependent manner. 8.8% (150) of all genes whose expression altered following <italic>Dali</italic> depletion were associated with <italic>Dali</italic> binding sites within 1 Mb (although 30% of peaks reside within 5 kb of a TSS, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and, therefore, are likely to represent direct regulatory targets. This proportion lies within the range of functional sites observed for transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cusanovich et al., 2014</xref>). Our results are consistent with a model in which mouse or human <italic>Dali</italic> is recruited to chromatin indirectly via RNA-protein interactions with both sequence-specific transcription factor proteins, such as POU3F3 which is encoded by its neighbouring gene, or non-sequence specific DNA binding cofactors including DNMT1, which in turn may interact with sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. In this model, <italic>Pou3f3</italic>-dependent target genes are regulated by <italic>Dali</italic> both indirectly, via its transcriptional regulatory effect on the <italic>Pou3f3</italic> gene, and directly via its physical interaction with the POU3F3 protein and their co-occupancy at regulatory regions of target genes.</p><p>Our data show that both human and mouse <italic>Dali</italic> associate with DNMT1 and that depletion of <italic>Dali</italic> levels increases CpG methylation at <italic>Dali</italic> bound and regulated promoters <italic>in trans</italic>. Whilst a growing body of literature has implicated lncRNAs, such as <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> and <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mohammad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Ruscio et al., 2013</xref>), in modulating CpG methylation in a DNMT1-dependent manner at their sites of synthesis, our findings represent the first evidence that an intergenic lncRNA can regulate DNA methylation <italic>in trans</italic> at distal genomic locations away from its site of transcription.</p><p>Our findings suggest that <italic>Dali</italic> inhibits DNA methylation at a subset of bound and regulated regions, presumably deposited by the DNMT1 DNA methyltransferase, to which it binds. DNMT1 binds structured RNA with higher affinity than its DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Ruscio et al., 2013</xref>). It is thus possible that <italic>Dali</italic> competes for binding to DNMT1 with either protein co-factors such as UHRF1, which loads and orients the enzyme on the DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inomata et al., 2008</xref>), or its DNA substrate. Targeting of DNMT1 to specific loci is believed to be mediated by DNMT1-interacting transcription factors. 58 transcriptional factors have been reported as DNMT1 interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hervouet et al., 2010</xref>), of which 9 have enriched sequence motifs in <italic>Dali</italic> CHART-Seq peaks. We thus propose a model in which such transcription factors promote the sequence-specificity of <italic>Dali</italic>-modulated DNA methylation changes. The genomic co-localisation of DNMT1 and transcription factors using ChIP remains unknown owing to the poor performance of the available anti-DNMT1 antibodies in this application.</p><p>We have shown that <italic>Dali</italic> regulates genes involved in neural development and function and its depletion disrupts terminal stages of neuronal differentiation, more particularly neurite outgrowth development. <italic>Dali</italic> RNA binds to and up-regulates the promoters or promoter-proximal regions of key pro-differentiation factors, such as <italic>E2f2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Persengiev et al., 2001</xref>), <italic>Fam5b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Terashima et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>Sparc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhoopathi et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>Dkk1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cajanek et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watanabe et al., 2005</xref>), as well as binding and negatively regulating genes such as <italic>Kif2c</italic> and <italic>Kif11</italic> which are known to block neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Laketa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Myers and Baas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nadar et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Dali</italic> works as a pro-differentiation factor in neural development by regulating the balance between proliferation and differentiation, as well as processes associated with terminal neuronal differentiation.</p><p><italic>Cis</italic>- or <italic>trans</italic>-acting modes of action have been proposed for a growing number of lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fatica and Bozzoni, 2014</xref>). <italic>Dali</italic> is unusual in acting in a transcript-dependent manner to perform both local and distal gene regulatory roles like another such lncRNA, <italic>Paupar</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vance et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Dali</italic> is transcribed in the vicinity of a neuronal transcription factor <italic>Pou3f3</italic>. Both <italic>Dali</italic> and <italic>Paupar</italic> lncRNAs are CNS-expressed and evolutionarily constrained transcripts that are co-expressed with their neighbouring transcription factor genes both spatially and temporally. Moreover, both lncRNAs interact directly with the protein product of their neighbouring genes, POU3F3 and PAX6, respectively, to regulate a large set of targets <italic>in trans</italic>. These observations, together with the preferential genomic location of intergenic lncRNA loci adjacent to transcription factor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ponjavic et al., 2009</xref>) imply that lncRNAs may commonly interact with the product of genomically adjacent transcription factor genes to act <italic>in trans</italic> on distal genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>We used the Whitehead Institute siRNA selection program to design shRNAs that target multiple regions of <italic>Dali</italic> or <italic>Pou3f3</italic>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Your work focuses on the functional roles of the lncRNA <italic>Dali</italic> and its regulation not only of its neighboring transcription factor gene Pou3f3, but importantly also at distal sites through the methylation of these sites. The topic of the functional roles of lncRNAs is of keen interest and most importantly the mechanism of how these roles are achieved is of critical importance. Thus, this manuscript is both timely and important. However, there are several issues that the authors should make clearer for the readers in order for an audience to understand the messages being communicated and to provide a clear and supportable set of conclusions. These issues are:</p><p>1) Several places in the manuscript the authors' interpretation of their data results in a set of specific conclusions about mechanisms or cause and effect relationships that are not the only explanation or conclusion. Importantly, there is no acknowledgement of other interpretations or explanations of why other interpretations cannot be concluded. For example, while the suggestion of recruitment of <italic>Dali</italic> via a complex of DNA binding proteins that include CTCF is an interesting hypothesis, this collection of data can be interpreted by alternative mechanisms such as the coincident binding of CTCF (due to CTCF genome-wide and abundant binding).</p><p>2) What was the basis of choosing 10 <italic>Dali</italic> binding sites? What changes, if any occur, at the other 5 sites? Given that half of the results obtained are consistent with the model of <italic>Dali</italic> or <italic>Dali:Pou3f3</italic> complex acting in trans to reduce DNMT1 methylation, there appears to be the likelihood that the mechanism may minimally involve a more complex set of interactions. This should be acknowledged.</p><p>3) “…we performed Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis (COBRA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiong and Laird, 1997</xref>) in parallel at 10 different CpG islands and demonstrated that five of these regions (corresponding to 4 genes) exhibited altered restriction profiles indicative of altered DNA methylation status after Dali depletion […] These results are consistent with <italic>Dali</italic> (or a <italic>Dali:</italic>POU3F3 complex, see below) acting in trans to reduce DNMT1-mediated CpG methylation at a subset of bound and regulated gene promoters away from its site of transcription”: this is speculation since the effect on the use of the 5' most CpG site could be achieved through a secondary effect of the <italic>Dali</italic> KD.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> (heat map); are these the results of all 3 KDs or only1?

This specific example now states that <italic>Dali</italic> and CTCF “might independently bind adjacent sequence, or compete for binding to the same region”.</p><p><italic>2) What was the basis of choosing 10</italic> Dali <italic>binding sites? What changes, if any occur, at the other 5 sites? Given that half of the results obtained are consistent with the model of</italic> Dali <italic>or</italic> Dali:Pou3f3 <italic>complex acting in trans to reduce DNMT1 methylation, there appears to be the likelihood that the mechanism may minimally involve a more complex set of interactions. This should be acknowledged.</italic></p><p>We selected these 10 <italic>Dali</italic> binding sites to maximise the likelihood of detecting DNA methylation changes using COBRA. We ensured that each region contained several COBRA-compatible restriction enzyme sites and could be efficiently amplified from bisulfite-converted template.</p><p>We also now indicate that the failure to detect changes at all regions tested could reflect either that the DNA methylation status of the remaining regions did not change upon <italic>Dali</italic> depletion or that those changes that occurred were undetected due to technical limitations of the COBRA assay.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that <italic>Dali</italic> mediated DNA methylation changes in <italic>trans</italic> may minimally involve a more complex set of interactions that are in addition to <italic>Dali</italic>, POU3F3 and DNMT1. This is acknowledged in the revised manuscript as suggested. We now state: “Although other unidentified factors are also likely to play a role, our results are consistent with <italic>Dali</italic> (or a <italic>Dali</italic>:POU3F3 complex) acting in <italic>trans</italic>, as part of a multi-subunit ribonucleoprotein complex, to reduce DNMT1-mediated CpG methylation at a subset of bound and regulated gene promoters away from its site of transcription.”</p><p><italic>3) “…we performed Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis (COBRA) (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57"><italic>Xiong and Laird, 1997</italic></xref><italic>) in parallel at 10 different CpG islands and demonstrated that five of these regions (corresponding to 4 genes) exhibited altered restriction profiles indicative of altered DNA methylation status after Dali depletion […] These results are consistent with</italic> Dali <italic>(or a</italic> Dali<italic>:POU3F3 complex, see below) acting in trans to reduce DNMT1-mediated CpG methylation at a subset of bound and regulated gene promoters away from its site of transcription”: this is speculation since the effect on the use of the 5' most CpG site could be achieved through a secondary effect of the</italic> Dali <italic>KD.</italic></p><p>Thank you. We now have added: “The preferential use of the 5́’ most CpG site could reflect a secondary effect of <italic>Dali</italic> knockdown. Nevertheless, the observation that this site is bound by <italic>Dali</italic> transcript suggests that <italic>Dali</italic> may function by promoting the preferential use of a distantly located (and more rarely used) alternative promoter potentially through its effect on promoter-associated CpG island methylation.”</p><p><italic>4)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref> <italic>(heat map); are these the results of all 3 KDs or only1?
