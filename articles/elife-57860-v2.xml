joint between the dentary and squamosal bones. In eutherian mammals, this joint forms in the embryo, supporting feeding and vocalisation from birth. In contrast, marsupials and monotremes exhibit extreme altriciality and are born before the bones of the novel mammalian jaw joint form. These mammals need to rely on other mechanisms to allow them to feed. Here, we show that this vital function is carried out by the earlier developing, cartilaginous incus of the middle ear, abutting the cranial base to form a cranio-mandibular articulation. The nature of this articulation varies between monotremes and marsupials, with juvenile monotremes retaining a double articulation, similar to that of the fossil mammaliaform <italic>Morganucodon</italic>, while marsupials use a versican-rich matrix to stabilise the jaw against the cranial base. These findings provide novel insight into the evolution of mammals and the changing relationship between the jaw and ear.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The defining feature of all mammals is how the jaw works. Fish, reptiles and other animals with backbones have a lower jaw made of many bones fused together, one of which connects to the upper jaw. The lower jaw in mammals, however, is made of a single bone that connects with the upper jaw using a completely unique jaw joint. This new joint emerged as the ancestors of all mammals split from the reptiles around 200 million years ago. The bones that formed the original jaw joint ended up in the middle ear in mammals and switched to a role in hearing.</p><p>Nowadays, there are three types of mammals: the placentals, marsupials and monotremes (the egg laying mammals). In mice, humans and other placental mammals, the skeleton of the adult jaw joint forms in the embryo before birth. However, marsupials (such as kangaroos and opossums) and monotremes (platypuses and echidnas) are born at a much earlier embryonic stage, before the adult jaw joint has formed. It is therefore unclear how newborn marsupials and monotremes are able to move their jaws to feed on milk from their mother.</p><p>Anthwal et al. compared how the jaw develops in mice, opossums, platypuses and echidnas before and after the adult jaw joint becomes functional. The experiments showed that young echidnas, platypuses and opossums use their middle ear bones to articulate the lower jaw with the head before the adult jaw joint forms. In young opossums, the ear bones form a cushion to support the jaw. In juvenile platypuses a double joint is evident, with the ear bones forming a joint at the same time as the newly formed adult jaw joint, similar to the situation observed in fossils of mammal ancestors. The experiments also indicated that mice and other placental mammals may potentially use their ear bones to support the jaw before birth.</p><p>These findings shed light on why the ear and jaw have such a close connection in mammals. In humans, the ear and jaw bones are still connected by ligaments, explaining why trauma to the jaw joint can cause dislocation of the ear bones. Similarly, defects in the development of the jaw can impact the ear, such as in Treacher Collins Syndrome, where in some cases the jaw joint fails to form and the ear bones appear to try and take this role. Understanding how the ear and jaw evolved will help us understand why they look like they do and why a defect in one can have knock-on consequences for the other.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>monotremes</kwd><kwd>Marsupials</kwd><kwd>mammals</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>jaw joint</kwd><kwd>middle ear</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102889/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tucker</surname><given-names>Abigail S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Linkage Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnston</surname><given-names>Stephen D</given-names></name><name><surname>Renfree</surname><given-names>Marilyn B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The incus of the middle ear plays a role in supporting the lower jaw prior to the formation of the mammalian jaw joint allowing early feeding in monotremes and marsupials.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In non-mammalian vertebrates, the jaw joint is formed between the quadrate (or palatoquadrate) of the upper jaw and the articular part of Meckel’s cartilage, a rod of cartilage that runs through the lower jaw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This is known as the primary jaw joint. In mammals, this function is carried out by a new joint between the dentary and squamosal bones, known as the temporomandibular joint or TMJ in humans, and is referred to as the secondary jaw joint. In mammals, the bones of the original primary jaw joint have been incorporated into the ear and play a role in hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anthwal et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to forming a joint with the articular as part of the primary jaw joint, the amniote quadrate also articulates with the cranial base. During the evolutionary transition that gave rise to mammals, the connection between the quadrate and the cranial base simplified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo and Crompton, 1994</xref>). The robust quadrate of reptiles moved from being attached to up to five separate skeletal elements, able to bear the mechanical force of feeding, to become the diminutive mammalian incus, suspended by a ligament from a single cranial base bone, the petrosal, in an air-filled cavity allowing sound transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kemp, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 2004</xref>). At the same time, Meckel’s cartilage lost its permanent nature, separating the incus and neighbouring malleus from the rest of the jaw in adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anthwal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Urban et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of cranial-mandibular jaw articulation showing the roles of the quadrate/incus and articular/malleus in the hearing and jaw joint modules in (<bold>A</bold>) reptile gecko, (<bold>B</bold>) mammal opossum, (<bold>C</bold>) mammal-like reptile Morganucodon.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57860-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Early mammal-like reptiles had a permanent Meckel’s cartilage and joints between the quadrate and articular (Q-A), and posteriorly between the quadrate and cranial base – similar to extant reptiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In mammaliaforms, such as <italic>Morganucodon</italic>, both a primary Q-A and a secondary dentary squamosal joint were present, in addition to a joint between the quadrate (incus) and the paraoccipital process of the petrosal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This petrosal and incus joint precedes detachment of the middle ear from Meckel’s cartilage in mammal evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo and Crompton, 1994</xref>). A connection between the future middle ear bones and the cranial base is therefore a feature of fossil mammaliaforms. In extant mammals, the proposed homologue of the paraoccipital process is the crista parotica, which forms as a cartilaginous spur off the petrosal and is derived from neural crest cells, distinct to the rest of the petrosal and otic capsule, which are mesodermally derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">O'Gorman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>). Modern mammals have separated the middle ear from the jaw in adults, and the ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) are now suspended by ligaments from the cranial base to allow free vibration during sound transmission from the ear drum to the inner ear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Paleontological evidence indicates that the evolution of the definitive mammalian middle ear (DMME) occurred at least twice, once in the lineage that gave rise to monotremes and once in the therian (marsupial and eutherian) mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rich et al., 2005</xref>), while new developmental data suggests that the two groups of therian mammals may have each independently acquired the DMME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Urban et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we refer to eutherian mammals rather than placental mammals, as marsupials have a yolk-sac placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Renfree, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Marsupials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allin, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Filan, 1991</xref>) and monotremes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griffiths, 1978</xref>), exhibit extreme altriciality, greater than is seen in any eutherian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Werneburg et al., 2016</xref>). This has profound consequences for early feeding as the bones that form the mammalian jaw joint, the dentary and squamosal, have not fully ossified by the time of birth/hatching. The dentary-squamosal joint forms prior to birth in eutherian mammals, and begins to function in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Habib et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jahan et al., 2014</xref>). In the mouse, gestation is approximately 20 days, with breakdown of Meckel’s cartilage, to separate the lower jaw from the ear bones, following during early postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anthwal et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the opossum <italic>Monodelphis</italic> has a short gestation of just 13 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keyte and Smith, 2008</xref>), and is born before development of the dentary-squamosal articulation, which forms between 14 and 20 days after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Filan, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maier, 1987</xref>). Monotremes hatch out of the egg after 10 days post-oviposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griffiths, 1978</xref>). The formation of the dentary-squamosal joint in monotremes has recently been followed and shown to form from 10 days after hatching in the platypus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Anthwal and Tucker, 2020</xref>). Breakdown of Meckel’s cartilage in both marsupials and monotremes occurs relatively late postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Urban et al., 2017</xref>), with a robust Meckel’s still evident in nest young platypuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zeller, 1993</xref>). There is, therefore, a significant gap between birth and the advent of a functional mammalian jaw joint in both marsupials and monotremes.</p><p>The feeding strategies of new-born mammals vary in extant members of each group of mammals. Compared to eutherian mammals, marsupials rely on placental support for a relatively short period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Renfree, 2010</xref>) and consequently receive the nutrition required for their development via a lengthy and sophisticated lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tyndale-Biscoe and Janssens, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tyndale-Biscoe and Renfree, 1987</xref>). During their early postnatal life marsupials attach to the mother’s teat and use the comparatively early developed tongue musculature to suck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith, 1994</xref>). In the grey short-tailed opossum, <italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic>, pups are born after 13 days of embryonic development, which is followed by around 14 days permanently attached to the mother’s teat, after which they detach intermittently from the mother but continue to suckle. Weaning occurs around postnatal day 60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keyte and Smith, 2008</xref>). In contrast to therian mammals, young monotremes do not obtain milk in quite the same way as therian mammals due to the absence of teats in the mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griffiths, 1978</xref>). Instead young monotremes suck up milk vigorously from the flattened but protuberant nipple-like areola on the mother’s abdomen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griffiths, 1978</xref>). In the case of echidnas, these areolae are within the pouch.</p><p>Given the lack of a jaw joint at birth, it has been proposed that marsupials and monotremes use the connection between the middle ear bones and cranial base to permit feeding prior to the formation of the articulation between the dentary and squamosal and cavitation of the middle ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crompton and Parker, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maier, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sánchez-Villagra et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zeller, 1993</xref>). To investigate this idea further, we have analysed the articulations that link the lower jaw to the cranial base (cranio-mandibular joints) in monotremes (platypus <italic>Ornithorhyncus anatinus</italic> and short-beaked echidna <italic>Tachyglossus aculeatus</italic>) as they develop from hatching, and compare them to a marsupial (grey short-tailed opossum, <italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic>), and a eutherian (mouse, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>), with additional comparison to the gecko, guinea pig and bat. We show that in early post-hatching life the monotreme incus and cranial base fuse, and later form an articulation, creating a double cranio-mandibular articulation, similar to the jaw anatomy of fossil mammal-like reptiles. This close association of the incus and cranial base is also observed at embryonic stages in eutherians and is reflected in mouse cell lineage studies. In contrast, opossums at birth utilise a cushion of extra-cellular matrix-rich mesenchyme in between the incus and petrosal to provide an articulation point. Marsupials and monotremes, therefore, have different strategies for coping with an early birth. Our research suggests that the incus retains a transient lower jaw support role across extant mammals but at different stages of pre and postnatal development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The primary jaw joint (malleus-incus) does not provide a site of articulation in marsupials and monotremes at birth</title><p>It has been suggested that the joint between the malleus and incus might act as the jaw joint early on in marsupial postnatal development, thereby recapitulating the reptilian function of these bones in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Müller, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crompton and Parker, 1978</xref>). Alternatively, it has been suggested that the actual articulation point in marsupials is between the incus and the cranial base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maier, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sánchez-Villagra et al., 2002</xref>). Less information is available regarding monotreme development, however, the incus has been described as being in cartilaginous connection with the cranial base during early post hatching development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Watson, 1916</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zeller, 1993</xref>). The development of the malleus and incus, and incus and cranial base, was therefore investigated across the three groups of mammals, with the gecko as an outgroup.</p><p>In the ocelot gecko (<italic>Paroedura picta</italic>), the quadrate and articular (the homologous elements to the incus and malleus respectively in non-mammal amniotes) form a clear synovial joint in the embryo at mid-gestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), the malleus and incus are initially formed from a single cartilaginous condensation that separates, by the formation of a joint, at Embryonic (E) day 15.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin and Tucker, 2006</xref>). At birth, therefore, the incus and malleus are evident as distinct cartilages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In <italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic>, the malleus and incus are still connected at birth at the dorsal end by a ridge of cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Filan, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We observed a similar connection between the malleus and incus in the echidna (<italic>Tachyglossus aculeatus</italic>) just after birth. Like the opossum, the middle ear ossicles were fused dorsally, indicating that they function as a unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These findings demonstrate that, like opossums, monotremes do not use the primary jaw joint as the craniomandibular articulation before the development of the dentary-squamosal joint.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Timing of the development of the quadrate-articular/malleus incus, and cranio-incudo joints.</title><p>Histological sections stained with alcian blue and picrosirius red.

The opisthotic/otoccipital is architecturally equivalent to the petrosal of mammals. In mice, the crus breve (short process) of the incus nestled in a fossa created by the crista parotica of the petrosal, but was separated by a region of mesenchymal cells, highlighting the lack of a clear articulation point between the two elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The incus at birth, therefore only articulated with the adjacent middle ear bones, the malleus and stapes. Similar to the mouse, the crus breve in neonatal opossums, fitted into a fossa created by the crista parotica, but abutted the petrosal on the inferior aspect of the crista parotica (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The incus and petrosal were therefore positioned much closer than in the mouse.</p><p>The relationship between the incus and crista parotica in the two monotreme species was significantly different from the therian mammals. In both platypus (<italic>Ornithorhynchus anatinus</italic>) and echidna (<italic>Tachyglossus aculeatus</italic>), the incus appeared to be fused with the crista parotica at birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>), agreeing with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Watson, 1916</xref>.

Due to the scarcity of available specimens very little is known about monotreme ear and jaw development. In adult platypuses, the incus appears in contact with the crista parotica, forming a fibrous articulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zeller, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo and Crompton, 1994</xref>).

Strikingly, by 80 days, when the dentary-squamosal joint would have started to become functional, the incus and crista parotica were no longer fused, with the two distinct cartilages abutting each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). At this stage, in contrast to the other stages investigated, the ear ossicles and petrosal had begun to ossify. However, the regions forming the malleus-incus joint, and the incus-petrosal articulation remained cartilaginous. A cartilaginous articular surface between the incus and petrosal was maintained at 120 days, a period when the young would have started to leave the burrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holland and Jackson, 2002</xref>).

Since the connection between these elements is lost later in post-hatching development, IF for beta-catenin was carried-out. Nuclear localised beta-catenin is a readout of canonical Wnt signalling, and is known to negatively regulate chondrocytes differentiation and promote joint formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hartmann and Tabin, 2001</xref>). Few beta-catenin positive cells were observed within the cartilage of the middle ear and petrosal at 0 days, though beta-catenin was strongly expressed in the neuro-epithelium of the inner ear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

At this stage Sox9 (green) was expressed in the petrosal and incus and suspensory ligaments, overlapping with the red fluorescent Protein (RFP) marking the Sox9 lineage cells.

Since tissue processing and wax embedding removes endogenous fluorescence, the membrane RFP that is expressed in the non-mesodermal tissue of <italic>Mesp1Cre;mTmG</italic> mice was not detectable in these slides. Consequently, all red signal was Sox9 immunofluorescence staining. Sox9 protein was expressed continuously between the incus and the petrosal.

Although this latter paper found no evidence of a joint they did show the mesenchyme between the crista parotica and incus as being condensed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Filan, 1991</xref>). We therefore investigated the extra cellular matrix (ECM) components of the mesenchyme surrounding the opossum incus in more detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It was noted that mesenchyme surrounding the crus breve and superior portion of the body of the incus had a more intense staining with alcian blue compared to those regions around the inferior border of the incus and the other ossicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,G</xref>). This pattern was observed throughout ossicle development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). In order to further characterise the differences in the ECM in the different regions of the middle ear mesenchyme, immunohistochemistry for versican was carried out. Versican is a large proteoglycan with side chains of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as hyaluronic acid (HA). Proteoglycan complexes act to attract water, and are held in place by collagen fibres to stiffen the matrix in hyaline cartilage, and act to lubricate articular cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). Versican is required during the initial condensation of mesenchyme but is absent from mature cartilage, where aggrecan is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamiya et al., 2006</xref>). Versican expression is maintained in the joint region during limb cartilage development, acting to inhibit maturation of the mesenchyme to form cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choocheep et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Snow et al., 2005</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Specialist mesenchyme supports incus-petrosal connection in juvenile opossums.</title><p>(<bold>A-F</bold>) Mesenchyme surrounding the crus breve of the incus is rich in the proteoglycan Versican (Vcan) at postnatal day (P)5 (<bold>A,D</bold>) and P10 (<bold>B,E</bold>).

The high level of versican around the crus breve therefore suggests a role for the ECM in providing a buffering function in this region. Cell density of the mesenchyme was measured in regions with strong alcian blue/versican staining and compared against the cell density of regions with low alcian blue/versican staining. Unpaired two-tailed t-test demonstrated that the regions with high alcian blue had a significantly higher (p=0.0152) cell density than those regions with lower alcian staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p><p>Versican is processed by ADAMTS family members for clearing and remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nandadasa et al., 2014</xref>).

Interestingly when we analysed the cleaved form of versican, using antibodies against DPEAAE, the expression was largely reciprocal to that of uncleaved versican, with lower levels specifically around the crus breve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This suggests that versican around the incus is protected from cleavage allowing it to maintain its structural role. The lack of cleaved versican around the crus breve, suggests the lack of a signalling role in this region, in agreement with the low level of expression of CD44, a cell surface receptor and binding partner of versican-hyaluronan complexes. CD44 was not associated with the mesenchyme around the crus breve, but was instead restricted to the perichondrium of the cartilaginous elements and periosteum of the skeletal elements of the ear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ear ossicles as transient jaw support in mammals</title><p>The incus of adult mammals plays a key role in hearing.

Together these data indicate that the relationship of the incus to the cranial base is not a derived feature of monotremes, and that the common mammal-like reptile ancestors of both monotremes and therian mammals may have formed an articulation between the quadrate/incus and petrosal through fusion of the elements followed by joint formation though Wnt and Gdf5 signalling.</p><p>The current study indicates that the first pharyngeal arch-derived incus forms a continuous field of chondrocytes with the second arch-derived crista parotica, which in turn is fused with the mesoderm-derived body of the petrosal. The borders between these developmentally distinct populations are, therefore, not always reflected by the mature anatomy.</p><p>For young monotremes and marsupials, the middle ear must function as part of the mandible postnatally until the dentary-squamosal bones have formed. This is similar, but not identical to the situation in cynodont ancestors of mammals. In these animals, the quadrate/incus articulated with a number of cranial elements, including the quadratojugal, to stabilise the jaw articulation. These connections and many elements like the quadratojugal have been lost in extant mammals in order to free the incus and increase its mobility during sound transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo and Crompton, 1994</xref>). The mechanical requirements for feeding placed upon the middle ears in monotremes and marsupials during early life have resulted in the fusion of the incus and petrosal in monotremes, and the elongated contact supported by a proteoglycan matrix in marsupials. These adaptations allow for stabilisation of the middle ear before the development of the dentary-squamosal joint and separation of the middle ear from the mandible, but do not compromise the effectiveness of the middle ear in later life. The changing connections between the middle ear ossicles and the cranial base in the different groups are highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The opossum has a specialised anatomy to brace the middle ear against the cranium during sucking</title><p>The crus breve of the incus is elongated in the developing opossum compared with other species analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In order to feed by suckling in the absence of a dentary-squamosal joint we propose that this anatomy allows for an increased surface contact with the cranial base during postnatal development, which, in combination with the proteoglycan-rich surrounding mesenchyme, acts to stabilise the mandible against the rest of the head. It is noted that many adult marsupials have a relatively elongated crus breve of the incus compared to eutherian species, for example the bare-tailed woolly opossum <italic>Caluromys philander,</italic> and the grey short-tailed opossum, <italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sánchez-Villagra et al., 2002</xref>).

This may be a consequence of the developmental requirement for an elongated short process to facilitate feeding before the development of the mature mammalian jaw articulation.</p><p>In the majority of adult marsupials, including <italic>Monodelphis</italic>, the incus is suspended from the cranial base by suspensory ligaments, and the crus breve extends into a fossa. One interesting exception is the marsupial mole, in which the crus breve has a connective tissue attachment to a lamella on the petrosal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Archer, 1976</xref>). This results in the middle ear ossicles being affixed to the cranial base, an adaptation to a fossorial niche found in other mammals such as in true moles. In light of the current study, the absence of an incudal fossa in the marsupial mole may be interpreted as a retention of the juvenile petrosal morphology (paedomorphy).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Consequence of ECM in opossum middle ear</title><p>In adult non-mammalian amniotes the homologue of the incus - the quadrate - and cranial base are strongly attached by fibrous syndesmoses or cartilaginous synchondroses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Payne et al., 2011</xref>), and we show that a synovial joint appears to form in geckos during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the neonatal opossum neither type of connection is observed. In neonatal marsupials Sánchez-Villagra and colleagues describe the connection between the incus and petrosal as being an ‘immature syndesmosis’, which acts as a ‘supportive strut’ during sucking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sánchez-Villagra et al., 2002</xref>). In the current study, we demonstrate a specialised condensed mesenchyme surrounds the incus of opossum postnatal juveniles. We show that this condensed mesenchyme is rich in the proteoglycan versican (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast expression studies in human foetuses demonstrate that versican is restricted to the perichondrium of Meckel’s cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shibata et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shibata et al., 2013</xref>), with high hyaluronic acid levels within the joints but not surrounding the incus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Takanashi et al., 2013</xref>). This concentration of versican around the crus breve therefore may be a feature of <italic>Monodelphis</italic>, and perhaps marsupials in general.</p><p>The versican-rich mesenchyme may act to either stabilise the incus by increasing the tension of the surrounding mesenchyme during feeding, ‘lubricate’ the articulation between the incus and cranial base by increasing the hydration of the ECM, or both. In keeping with this role, versican is dynamically expressed at the pubic symphysis during pregnancy in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosa et al., 2012</xref>), during which time the mouse pubic symphysis forms a fibrous joint or syndesmosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ortega et al., 2003</xref>). Significantly, there is little cleaved versican (DPEAAE) around the crus breve of the incus, suggesting a mechanical, rather than a signalling role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1. A</xref>). Overall it is likely that this mesenchyme is supporting the incus, rather than enabling mobilisation, with the high level of uncleaved versican acting to increase fibroviscocity while also elevating hydration of the ECM. In this way, the mesenchyme around the incus acts as a cushion during the mechanical stress of suckling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A double jaw articulation during monotreme development</title><p>Meckel’s cartilage persists to at least 50 days post-hatching in the platypus. At this timepoint, juvenile monotremes have two connections between the lower and upper jaw. The first connection is through the middle ear, which in juveniles remains attached to the mandible and articulates with the cranial base via the incus. The second is the later developing novel mammalian jaw joint. Only much later in the life of the young does it appear that the connection between the middle ear and mandible is lost, and the malleus and incus act as a DMME. The connection of the incus to the cranial base appears to be maintained in the adult echidna and platypus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo and Crompton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitkin and Johnstone, 1972</xref>). This would be expected to impact on the movement of the incus, and therefore the efficiency of hearing, reflected in the poor hearing reported for monotremes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitkin and Johnstone, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gates et al., 1974</xref>).</p><p>This novel finding of a double cranial articulation in the juvenile has significant implications for the evolution of the middle ear and jaw joint in mammals. Fossil evidence indicates that mammalian ancestors had a persistent connection between the middle ear ossicles and the jaw, as evidenced by the presence of an ossified Meckel’s element, or a dentary groove and post dentary trough, supporting a persistent Meckel’s cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Urban et al., 2017</xref>). For these animals, the connection of the middle ear with the jaw took one of two forms, in each case the mammalian secondary jaw joint was present. The first was a more basal mandibular middle ear where the incus and malleus were firmly attached to the cranial base and dentary respectively. More derived fossils had a partial, or transitional mammalian middle ear (PMME or TMME), where the middle ear was medially inflected away from the dentary, presumably allowing for improved vibration, but the malleus was still connected to the jaw, via Meckel’s cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luo, 2011</xref>). In these fossils with a PMME, little is understood of the rear of the ossicular chain, where the incus meets the petrosal, due to the poor and rare preservation of middle ear ossicles in the fossil record, a consequence of their small size. For example, only recently has a multituberculate with a complete incus been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Our data suggest that even in these transitional mammals with a PMME, the incus would have still articulated with the cranial base via the crista parotica, at least at some point during the animal’s life history.</p><p>The DMME appears to have evolved independently in monotremes and therian mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rich et al., 2005</xref>). Due to the absence of evidence we do not know if the incus articulation in animals with a PMME varied in a lineage specific manner, with the therian lineage resembling juvenile marsupials, and monotremaformes resembling juvenile platypuses and echidna, or if both lineages had similar articulations. The data from transgenic reporter mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), along with data from humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodríguez-Vázquez et al., 2018</xref>) and non-model therians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggests that the monotreme-type fusion and articulation of the incus with the cranial base may have been common in mammal like-reptiles. As such, the developing monotreme, with a double jaw articulation and a fused or articulated incus and petrosal, provides an exciting model for the study of the developmental basis of mammalian evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic>)</td><td>short-tailed opossum</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anthwal et al., 2017</xref>.

Next the mean cell number in each field was calculated in the remaining 8 proteoglycan-rich (alcian blue stained) regions and 10 proteoglycan weak (weak alcian blue stain) regions, and compared by unpaired two-tailed students t-test in Prism statistical analysis software (Graphpad), with p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thanks to Karen Sears (UCLA) for the bat microCT scan.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Min Zhu as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew Gillis (Reviewer #2); Jin Meng (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The transformation of mandibles from mammal-like reptiles to crown mammals features the repurposing of morphological structures, as evidenced by integrated molecular, developmental and fossil data. Extensive studies focus on the recurrent origins of the definitive mammalian middle ear, coupled with the shift from the primary jaw joint (quadrate/incus-articular/malleus) to the second jaw joint (squamosal-dentary). Only a few studies deal with the connection between the incus and the basicranium. The study by Anthwal et al. presents their observation on the early stage of the cranio-incudo joint development in monotremes and marsupials; then, by comparing their data with some fossil forms to reach the interpretation/conclusion on the general significance about mammalian jaw evolution.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript comprises important novel anatomical data from juvenile monotremes and marsupials, presents reasonable interpretations, and will provide a unique insight into the evolution of mammals. We have the following suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors provide a very thorough description of the comparative anatomy of the Q-A and dentary-squamosal joint in reptiles, mammal-like reptiles and mammals. While this might be very familiar to those with an anatomical background, we fear it might be a bit difficult to follow for many in <italic>eLife</italic>'s broad readership. We recommend the authors add an anatomical schematic to the Introduction, to illustrate the key skeletal articulations and homologies.</p><p>2) In the Discussion, the authors might also consider adding a schematic summary of their data, illustrating how the cranio-incudo joint can be observed at the different stages of development in the three mammalian lineages, perhaps including in this schematic an indication of the relevant functional correlates (feeding, etc.)? This would really help to tie the story together.</p><p>3) The consistency of term usages throughout the main-text. The craniomandibular (jaw) articulation is conventionally used for the joints between the quadrate and articular (Q-A) and between the squamosal and dentary (temporo-mandibular articulation). Here the authors present the third joint between the quadrate/incus and petrosal, which is well termed in the title (cranio-incudo joint). In the Abstract, the authors suggest the cranio-incudo joint is a subset of the cranio-mandibular articulation (also in the subsection “A double jaw articulation during monotreme development”). As shown in the text, the cranio-incudo joint in juvenile monotremes is just the fusion of two elements. In this case, the joint or the connection might be a proper term. The clarification or consistent usage of these terms will be helpful to the readers.</p><p>4) Results section: The authors provide very nice and detailed anatomical descriptions of the embryonic and post-natal conditions in mouse, opossum and echidna/platypus. It would be most helpful for the readers if the authors could open each of the anatomical subsection with a statement of what is currently known (i.e. what is known/speculated to be the case from existing data), what they are aiming to test/verify, and end each subsection with a clear statement of the new findings. Even if these subsections are mainly descriptive, they could still be framed more explicitly as using appropriate taxon sampling and a comparative approach to test a hypothesis of ancestral conditions, function, etc. This would also help to build the story incrementally, in a way that would make it easier for the reader to follow.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57860.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors provide a very thorough description of the comparative anatomy of the Q-A and dentary-squamosal joint in reptiles, mammal-like reptiles and mammals.

We have tried to make all the suggested changes in the text and figures.</p><p>In particular we have made the paper clearer for a non-expert reader, adding in new introductory paragraphs, and clarifying knowledge from previous papers to provide a better setting for our study.</p><p>As part of this we have added the two suggested schematic figures, to introduce the system (Figure 1) and to highlight our conclusions (Figure 7).</p><p>We have clarified the language, to make sure it is clear what we are referring to when discussing the different joints and skeletal elements.</p><p>Typos in figures etc have been corrected and the legends made more standardised.</p><p>We agree that the title did not really sum up the findings of the paper and so have suggested a new title. We hope this highlights the findings of the paper, which concentrates on the potential role of the incus as a jaw support across mammals.</p><p>We have continued to use eutherian rather than placental, as placental suggests that marsupials do not have a placenta during development. This has been explained in the text as we appreciate that placental is more widely used.</p></body></sub-article></article>
