protein to move bioorganic acids across bacterial or archaeal cell membranes. Recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of TRAP transporters provide a broad framework to understand how they work, but the mechanistic details of transport are not yet defined. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the <italic>Haemophilus influenzae N</italic>-acetylneuraminate TRAP transporter (<italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM) at 2.99 Å resolution (extending to 2.2 Å at the core), revealing new features. The improved resolution (the previous <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM structure is 4.7 Å resolution) permits accurate assignment of two Na<sup>+</sup> sites and the architecture of the substrate-binding site, consistent with mutagenic and functional data. Moreover, rather than a monomer, the <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM structure is a homodimer. We observe lipids at the dimer interface, as well as a lipid trapped within the fusion that links the SiaQ and SiaM subunits. We show that the affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) for the complex between the soluble <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP protein and <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM is in the micromolar range and that a related SiaP can bind <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM. This work provides key data that enhances our understanding of the ‘elevator-with-an-operator’ mechanism of TRAP transporters.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sialic acid</kwd><kwd>Neu5Ac</kwd><kwd>protein–protein interaction</kwd><kwd>membrane transport proteins</kwd><kwd>transport mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001023</institution-id><institution>Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering Ltd.</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postgraduate Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Currie</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009193</institution-id><institution>Marsden Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UOC1506</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dobson</surname><given-names>Renwick CJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003524</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UOCX1706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dobson</surname><given-names>Renwick CJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019601</institution-id><institution>Biomolecular Interaction Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dobson</surname><given-names>Renwick CJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structure of the dimeric <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> TRAP transporter (SiaQM) reveals two Na<sup>+</sup> sites, the substrate-binding site and lipid-binding sites, and weak but promiscuous binding of SiaP to SiaQM.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Secondary-active transporters are found in all domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ren and Paulsen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reizer et al., 1994</xref>). They catalyse the movement of molecules across membranes, exploiting the free energy associated with electrochemical ion gradients to drive transport (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bosshart and Fotiadis, 2019</xref> for recent reviews on the topic). In bacteria, secondary-active transporters are used for both the export of toxic compounds and for the import of nutrients needed for cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henriquez et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The import of carbohydrates across the plasma membrane is a key process for bacteria, particularly those pathogenic bacteria that adopt a scavenging lifestyle within their host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vimr, 2013</xref>). For <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, the ability to uptake host-derived sialic acids is important for pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apicella, 2012</xref>). Sialic acids are a diverse family of nine-carbon carbohydrates, and in humans, sialic acids are highly abundant in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts where they coat glycoconjugates as terminal sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vimr, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen and Varki, 2010</xref>). The most common sialic acid found in humans is <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminate (Neu5Ac) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vimr, 2013</xref>). To gain a growth advantage in these environments, bacteria such as <italic>H. influenzae</italic> evolved the ability to utilise host-derived sialic acid as a nutrient source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The sialic acid catabolic pathway provides an alternative source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy, and has been identified in 452 bacterial species, most of which are mammalian pathogens or commensals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McDonald et al., 2016</xref>). Alongside degradation, and perhaps more importantly, <italic>H. influenzae</italic> uses sialic acids to coat its lipopolysaccharide surface, and this sialylation in turn provides camouflage and protection from the human immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Severi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>H. influenzae</italic> lacks the de novo sialic acid biosynthetic pathway, so sialic acids must be scavenged and transported into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vimr et al., 2000</xref>). Engineered <italic>H. influenzae</italic> strains that are unable to transport sialic acids into the cell have decreased virulence in animal models—evidence that the sialic acid transport pathway is a viable therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jenkins et al., 2010</xref>) and others have already developed inhibitors of sialic acid transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bozzola et al., 2022</xref>). The sole sialic acid transporter in <italic>H. influenzae</italic> belongs to the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter family.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>An overview of Neu5Ac metabolism in <italic>H. influenzae</italic>.</title><p>(1) <italic>H. influenzae</italic> is sialidase negative and relies on environmental sialidases to hydrolyse and release terminal Neu5Ac from human glycoconjugates. (2) Outer membrane porins facilitate diffusion of Neu5Ac into the periplasm. (3) A mutarotase, NanM, catalyses the formation of β-Neu5Ac from α-Neu5Ac to prepare for active transport across the inner membrane. (4) Neu5Ac is captured by the high-affinity substrate-binding protein, SiaP. SiaP delivers Neu5Ac to the SiaQM TRAP transporter, which uses a Na<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradient to drive transport. <italic>H. influenzae</italic> cannot synthesise Neu5Ac and relies solely on SiaPQM for obtaining environmental Neu5Ac. (5) Cytoplasmic processing of Neu5Ac by an anomerase, YhcH, generates the unfavourable open chain form in preparation for use by the first enzyme of the Neu5Ac degradation pathway, NanA. (6) Neu5Ac is sequentially degraded into cell wall constituents or fructose-6-phosphate, which can enter glycolysis.

Analogous to ABC importers, the P-subunit is secreted into the periplasm to capture host-derived substrates with high affinity and specificity.

Indeed, we observe density for lipids in this region (best seen in the slightly higher resolution antiparallel dimer) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Notably, these densities are adjacent to tryptophan residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>), known for their role in anchoring membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Jesus and Allen, 2013</xref>), and one of the positions is where we also observe clear lipid density in the <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM structure in a nanodisc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davies et al., 2023</xref>). The discovery of these annular lipids is surprising given that the protein was first extracted and extensively purified in L-MNG detergent, followed by exchange into A8-35 amphipol for cryo-EM studies. There are some weaker densities around the periphery of the protein that likely correspond to amphipol, but we can confidently identify densities for phospholipids given their distinctive hairpin shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). That lipids have remained bound in this area through the isolation and purification supports that these are strong interactions, which thereby anchor the scaffold domain in the membrane. The lipids at this interface may also have a role in strengthening dimerisation, as seen in other secondary-active transporters such as NhaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Landreh et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The architecture of the fusion helix leaves a pocket between the lateral part of the helix and the main bundle of the transporter. A closer inspection of the map density shows that a distinct hairpin-shaped phospholipid density is positioned in this pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). This enclosed pocket appears to tightly fit only one phospholipid, which is presumably trapped here during protein folding. Several residues from the scaffold portion are well-poised to interact with a lipid headgroup, including H100, R104, K178, and W227 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Analysis of the electrostatic surface of the pocket shows a significant amount of positive charge. We suggest that this site likely binds a negatively charged phospholipid and have modelled phosphatidylglycerol into the density. The predicted interacting residues are not well conserved amongst fused TRAP transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>), which is possibly a reflection of varying bacterial membrane compositions.</p><p>This site and the presence of a lipid were not identified in the recent structure of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM in a nanodisc (containing only the zwitterionic lipid DMPC)—instead, amino acids are modelled to fill the hydrophobic pocket. This is notable, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peter et al., 2022</xref> hypothesised that W227 is important for the SiaP:SiaQM interaction, and show that mutation of this residue to an arginine significantly affects bacterial growth in an in vivo growth assay. The resolution of our structures allows us to unambiguously model this residue facing away from the surface and engaged in an interaction with the trapped phospholipid, further supporting our identification of tryptophan residues in anchoring roles in the scaffold of TRAP transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davies et al., 2023</xref>). This finding is important in the context of the transport mechanism used by <italic>Hi</italic>SiaPQM. As the identified phospholipid is intercalated between scaffolding helices and is very close to the putative SiaP:SiaQM interface, it is feasible that this site is physiologically significant and may influence the stability of the transporter or even the conformational dynamics of the entire system. The fusion helix and concomitant lipid molecule may provide a more structurally rigid scaffold than a Q-M heterodimer, such as <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM, although how this impacts the elevator transition requires further testing. While this binding pocket is likely found in a number of fused TRAPs (based on sequence predictions, e.g., <italic>Fn</italic>SiaQM and <italic>Aa</italic>SiaQM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>), it is not clear whether they also bind lipids here without experimental data.

Since Neu5Ac has a single negative charge at neutral pH, electrogenic transport means two or more Na<sup>+</sup> ions are transported for every Neu5Ac imported. Varying external [Na<sup>+</sup>] at a fixed substrate concentration resulted in a Hill coefficient of 2.9 (95% C.I. = 2.2–3.9), implying that at least two Na<sup>+</sup> ions are co-transported during each transport cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

With the same experimental setup used for <italic>Pp</italic>SiaPQM (5 μM Neu5Ac, 50 μM SiaP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davies et al., 2023</xref>), the accumulation of [<sup>3</sup>H]-Neu5Ac by the fused <italic>Hi</italic>SiaPQM is approximately tenfold greater. Although this difference may reflect the reconstitution efficiency of each proteoliposome preparation, it is possible that it has evolved as a result of the origins of each transporter system—<italic>P. profundum</italic> is a deep-sea bacterium and as such the transporter is required to be functional at low temperatures and high pressures. In contrast, <italic>H. influenzae</italic> is mesophilic, found in the human respiratory tract and therefore more likely to show native-like rates in ambient experimental conditions. A similar pattern has been reported for the elevator transporter Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, where transporters from hyperthermophilic species are slow, and mesophilic versions are faster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huysmans et al., 2021</xref>). These organisms also vary substantially in membrane lipid composition, which is currently too difficult to test in this experimental setup.</p><p>Next, we examined the <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM Na<sup>+</sup>-binding sites in our cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). The higher resolution antiparallel dimer structure shows density for Na<sup>+</sup> ions at both Na1 and Na2 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>), confirming the sites we identified and tested in <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davies et al., 2023</xref>), and also the aforementioned stoichiometry of Na<sup>+</sup> ions transported determined in the <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM proteoliposome assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mulligan et al., 2009</xref>). The Na1 and Na2 sites across all four monomers are highly similar, although subtly different to those reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The resolution of the structures allows for the unambiguous assignment of side-chain positions at these binding sites and enables mechanistically important residues to be distinguished.</p><p>At the Na1 site, coordination is achieved by the backbone carbonyls of S298, G337, V340, and P342 in a tetrahedral pattern, with a valence = 1, as determined by CheckMyMetal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown, 2009</xref>). The backbone carbonyl of S295 is also positioned for coordination but is slightly further away at 2.9/3.0 Å. In contrast, the equivalent carbonyl in <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM (S103) is closely associated with the Na<sup>+</sup> ion to form a trigonal bipyramidal coordination pattern. Na2 coordination is achieved by the backbone carbonyls of G517, G558 and M564, and the side-chain hydroxyl of T561, which together coordinate the Na<sup>+</sup> ion in a tetrahedral pattern with a valence = 1.2/1.3. In contrast to the Na2 site of <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM, the backbone carbonyl of T561 is positioned further away at 4.2 Å distance and does not directly coordinate the Na<sup>+</sup> ion in our structure. In the <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM structure, the equivalent residue (T369) coordinates the Na<sup>+</sup> ion with both the side chain and main chain of T561 to form a square planar coordination pattern. S298, P342, G517, and G558 are highly conserved in TRAP transporters; S295, G337, and T561 sometimes vary as other small residues and V340 and M564 often vary as other hydrophobic side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). S298 did not show an effect on growth when mutated to alanine previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peter et al., 2022</xref>) and therefore may not be considered mechanistically important, but our structure shows that it coordinates Na1 through the backbone carbonyl, masking the effect of the side-chain mutation.</p><p>Our structures have a large cytoplasm-facing solvent-accessible cavity housing the putative binding site for Neu5Ac that is flanked by the Na1 and Na2 Na<sup>+</sup> ion sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), similar to <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM. The dataset was collected without Neu5Ac and not surprisingly, there is no ligand density in the binding sites. The putative Neu5Ac binding site is lined with residues S300, A301, L302, P338, S343, I344, A345, I348, D521, A522, L523, Q526, T552, M555, M556, I559, and M566 of the transport domain which form a largely hydrophobic binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>).

Our structure shows that neither are involved in Na<sup>+</sup> binding and although D521 does line the substrate-binding pocket and introduces some charge to the site, D304 faces away from the substrate-binding site and instead coordinates the residues that bind the Na<sup>+</sup> ion at the Na1 site.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>On the formation of the tripartite complex</title><p>The observation that <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM can form a dimer has implications for the mechanism of transport, and as yet the affinity for the SiaP:SiaQM complex has not been directly established.

This residue is strictly conserved in sialic acid TRAP transporters but is not conserved across the TRAP transporter family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). Our structure shows that the equivalent residue in <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM (R484) adopts a similar solvent-accessible conformation and participates in an ionic interaction with D480, which in turn is interacting with K236 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Together these residues form a salt bridge network between two helices of the scaffold of the transporter.

It is clear that this region is important for SiaP recognition (also shown by the adjacent positioning of SiaP to this region in the complex model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) and may be further involved in modulating the conformational changes in SiaQM.

The high-resolution structure of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM has identified well-defined lipids associated with tryptophan residues of the Q-subunits that form the dimer interface and a newly described single lipid in the binding pocket formed by the fusion helix. Both of these areas are likely important for anchoring the scaffold domain and allowing transport. As the single phospholipid is bound within the protein, it may also have a physiological role in P-subunit-binding dynamics as a mechanism of regulation depending on lipid type.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title><italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM can exist as a monomer or a dimer</title><p>We demonstrate that <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM can adopt both a monomeric and a dimeric configuration depending on the relative concentration of L-MNG detergent, with high concentrations favouring the monomer. This behaviour is characteristic of a self-association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The formation of a stable dimeric species is also found in our amphipol structure, other detergents, and nanodiscs.</p><p>The parallel dimer is consistent with other elevator transporters, although the interface between the monomers is reduced. Notably, a related TAXI-TRAP transporter also appears to form a self-association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roden et al., 2023</xref>) and the dicarboxylate transporter, VcINDY from <italic>V. cholerae,</italic> adopts a stable homodimeric configuration in crystal and solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mulligan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mancusso et al., 2012</xref>). VcINDY uses an elevator mechanism and cross-linking the dimer interface does not perturb transport, implying a lack of coupling between the monomers and an absence of large conformational changes at the interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mulligan et al., 2016</xref>). The dimerisation of VcINDY is used to stabilise the transport domains and allow the elevators to move up and down against the bound interface. Even with a small interface, a dimeric <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM assembly may further stabilise the scaffold of the two monomeric units.</p><p>The antiparallel dimer is hard to rationalise from a physiological standpoint. Although not unprecedented in vivo with small bacterial multidrug transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lloris-Garcerá et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fluman et al., 2017</xref>), an antiparallel structure makes little biological sense in the case of the TRAP transporter. In the antiparallel structure, the inverted monomer displays the cytoplasmic face towards the periplasm and will not bind SiaP, which is required for transport. This structure could result from removing the protein from its native environment, where it is constrained by the cell membrane, and in the absence of the constraints of the membrane can rotate around the interface when solubilised by detergents.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The affinity of SiaP for SiaQM is weak</title><p>For the SiaPQM TRAP transporter, the role of SiaP is to capture Neu5Ac with high affinity and deliver it to SiaQM before leaving to bind more Neu5Ac. As a result, a high-affinity SiaPQM complex that has a slow SiaP off-rate is likely not desired. Neither is a low-affinity SiaPQM complex that has a slow SiaP on-rate, as SiaQM relies on binding SiaP for transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> observed in our experiments may be representative of a system with a fast off-rate (and potentially a fast on-rate) for SiaP. The resulting <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> is not of high affinity, but the transport cycle is optimised as SiaP quickly binds SiaQM, delivers Neu5Ac, and then leaves without getting ‘stuck’ to the transporter. The fast off-rate would reflect the conformational coupling of SiaP to SiaQM as the open state of SiaP that occurs after delivering Neu5Ac has been shown to bind SiaQM less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peter et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The determined <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> may also reflect the experimental conditions. If the transporter is often in the conformation we observe to be stabilised in the structures, then the residues on the periplasmic surface of SiaQM may not be accessible or correctly positioned for binding with the partner residues on SiaP. In addition to the effects of detergent, the experimental conditions do not provide a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient, which may have significant consequences on the positioning of SiaQM for interaction with SiaP. Under similar conditions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peter et al., 2022</xref> estimated a comparable <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of ˃1 µM, further indicating that the interaction affinity is low.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have determined the oligomeric state of detergent-solubilised <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM and the structure of amphipol-solubilised <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM to near atomic resolution. In both membrane mimetics, we have observed a monomer–dimer self-association. The cryo-EM structure reveals the position of the extra transmembrane helix and shows that it is made of two sections with a positively charged periplasmic surface. This suggests that the extra helix may be involved in the interaction with SiaP, which has a predominantly negatively charged surface where it would likely bind the transporter. Furthermore, this work yields novel insights for drug design, as our structure can guide the design of inhibitors that block the SiaPQM interaction or use the system as a Trojan horse. In bacteria that rely solely on SiaPQM for obtaining Neu5Ac, such as <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, these inhibitors may have utility as antibacterial agents.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> Rd KW20)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SiaP; SiaQM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">UniProt</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">P44542, P44543</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BL21 (DE3); TOP10</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemically competent cells</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Xpress IgG (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:2500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-mouse IgG (rabbit)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:15000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pET22b(+)<break/>(plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenScript</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Provides pelB leader sequence</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pBAD/HisA<break/>(plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">cNW11</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Now Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Covalent nanodisc protein</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning of the substrate-binding protein, SiaP, and the membrane-bound protein, SiaQM</title><p>The gene encoding SiaP from <italic>H. influenzae</italic> Rd KW20 was synthesised and cloned into the pET22b(+) vector to include a pelB leader sequence (GenScript).

transporters that utilize periplasmic binding proteins to deliver their substrates. This paper contributes a new 3 Å structure of the Haemophilus influenzae TRAP transporter. The structure joins two other recent cryo-EM structures of TRAP transporters, including a lower resolution structure of the same H. influenzae protein (overall 4.7 Å), and a ~3 Å structure of a homologue from P. profundum. In addition to reporting a higher resolution cryo-EM structure, the authors also recapitulate protein activity in a reconstituted system, investigate protein oligomerization using analytic ultracentrifugation, and evaluate interactions and function in &quot;mix and match&quot; configurations with periplasmic subunits from other homologues.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strength of the paper is that the better resolution cryo-EM data permits sidechain assignment, the identification of bound lipids, and the identification of sodium ions. It is important to get this structure out there, since the resolution passes an important threshold for model building accuracy. The current structure nicely explains a lot of prior mutagenesis data on the H. influenzae TRAP. This is also the first structure of a TRAP protein to be solved without a fiducial, although the overall structure is not very different than those solved with fiducials.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The experiments examining the monomer/dimer equilibrium appear somewhat preliminary. The biological or mechanistic importance of oligomerization is not established, so these experiments are inherently of limited scope. Moreover, cryo-EM datasets exhibit both parallel and antiparallel dimers, the latter of which are clearly not biologically relevant. It is probably impossible to distinguish these in the AUC experiments, which makes interpretation of these experiments more difficult.</p><p>Similarly, the importance of the lipid binding sites observed in cryo-EM aren't experimentally established (for example by mutating the binding site) and it is thus unknown whether they are important for function (as the authors acknowledge).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92307.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the membrane component of the sialic acid-specific TRAP transporter, SiaQM (HiSiaQM), from H. influenzae, is structurally characterized. TRAP transporters are substrate binding protein (SBP)-dependent secondary-active transporters, and HiSiaQM is the most comprehensively studied member of this family. While all previous work on fused TRAP transporter membrane proteins suggests that they are monomeric (including the previous structural characterization of HiSiaQM by a different group), a surprising finding from this work is the observation that HiSiaQM can form higher oligomers, consistent with it being a dimer. These higher oligomeric states were initially observed after extraction of the protein with LMNG detergent, but were also observed in DDM detergent, amphipol and nanodiscs using analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). Structural characterization of dimeric HiSiaQM revealed 2 arrangements, a parallel and antiparallel arrangements, the latter of which is unlikely to be physiologically relevant.</p><p>The higher resolution of this new structure of HiSiaQM (2.2-2.7 Å compared to 4.7 Å for the previous structure) facilitated the assignment of bound lipids at the dimer interface and a lipid molecule embedded in each of the protomers; allowed for a clearer refinement of the Na+ and putative substrate binding sites, which differ slightly from the previous structure; and produced better modelled side chains for the residues involved in the SBP:HiSiaQM interaction. The authors developed a useful AUC-based assay to determine the affinity for this interaction revealing an affinity of 65 µM. Finally, the authors make the very interesting observation that a sialic acid specific SBP from a different TRAP transporter can utilize HiSiaQM for transport, contrary to previous observations, revealing for the first time that TRAP membrane components can recognize multiple SBPs.</p><p>Overall, this is a well written and presented manuscript detailing some interesting new observations about this interesting protein family. One of the main findings, that the protein can form a dimer, is supported by data, but the physiological relevance of this is questionable, and the possibility that this is artefactual has not been ruled out. Conclusions regarding the mechanistic importance of the lipid bindings sites is not currently supported by the data.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The main strength of this work is the increased resolution of HiSiaQM, which allows for much more precise assignment of side chains and their orientation. This will be of importance for subsequent mechanistic studies on the contributions of these residues to Na+ and sialic acid binding and conformational changes.</p><p>The observation of the lipids, especially the lipid embedded near the fusion helix, is an intriguing observation, which lays the groundwork for future work to understand the lipid-dependence of these transporters.</p><p>The development of the AUC-based approach to measure SBP affinity for the membrane component will likely prove be useful to future studies.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One of the main results from this work is the observation that HiSiaQM can form a dimer. Two arrangements were observed, parallel and antiparallel, the latter of which is almost certainly physiologically irrelevant as it would preclude essential interactions with the extracytoplasmic substrate binding protein. As acknowledged by the author, this non-physiological arrangement is likely a consequence of protein preparation (overexpression, extraction, purification, etc.). However, if one dismisses the antiparallel arrangement as non-relevant and an artefact of protein preparation, it is difficult for the parallel arrangement to maintain its credibility, as it was also processed in the same way. This is especially true when one considers that there is only 100 Å2 buried surface area in the parallel arrangement that does not involve any sidechains; it is difficult to envisage this as a specific interaction, e.g. compared to related proteins that have ~2000 Å2 buried surface area. Unless this dimerization is observed in a bacterial membrane at physiological protein concentrations, it is difficult to rule out the possibility that the observed dimerization is merely an artefact caused by the expression, purification and concentration of the protein.</p><p>The manuscript contains some excellent structural analysis of this protein, whose higher resolution reveals some new and interesting insight. However, a weakness of the current work is a lack of validation of these observations using other approaches. For example, lipid interactions are observed in the structure that the authors claim is mechanistically important. However, without disrupting these interactions to look at the effect on transport, this conclusion is not supported. Similarly, the authors use their structure to predict residues that are important for the SBP:membrane protein interaction, and they develop an AUC-based binding assay to study this interaction, but they do not test their predictions using this approach.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92307.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript reports new molecular characterization of the Haemophilus influenza tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter of N-acetylneuraminate (Neu5Ac). This membrane transporter is important for the virulence of the pathogen. H. influenza lacks Neu5Ac biosynthetic pathway, and utilizes the TRAP transporter to import it. Neu5Ac is used as a nutrient source but also as a protection from human immune response. The transporter is composed of two fused membrane subunits, HiSiaQM, and one soluble, periplasmic subunit HiSiaP. HiSiaP, by binding to the substrate Neu5Ac, changes its conformation, allowing its binding to HiSiaQM, followed by Neu5Ac and Na+ transport to the cytoplasm. The combination of structural, biophysical and biochemical approaches provides a solid basis for describing the functioning of the Haemophilus influenza Neu5Ac TRAP transporter, which is essential for the pathogen virulence.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The paper describes the electron microscopy structure of HiSiaQM, thanks to its solubilization in L-MNG followed by exchange to amphipol or nanodisc. In these conditions, HiSiaQM consists in a mixture of monomers and dimers, as characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation. The cryo-EM analysis shows two types of dimers: one in an antiparallel configuration, which is artifactual, and a parallel one, which may be physiologically relevant. Cryo-EM on the dimers allows high resolution (≈ 3 Å) structure determination. The structure is the first one of a fused SiaQM, and is the first obtained without megabody. The work highlights structural elements (fusion helix, lipids) that could modulate transport. The authors checked the functionality of the purified HiSiaQM, which, after reconstitution in liposome, displays a significantly larger Neu5Ac transport activity compared to the non-fused PpSiaQM homolog. The work identifies Na+ binding sites, and the putative Neu5Ac binding site. From analytical ultracentrifugation using fluorescently labelled HiSiaP, the authors show that HiSiaP is able to interact with HiSiaQM monomer and dimer, with a low but physiologically relevant affinity. HiSiaP interaction with HiSiaQM was modelled using AlphaFold2, and discussed in view of published activity on mutants, and new transport activity assays using SiaQM and SiaP from different organisms. In conclusion, the combination of structural, biophysical and biochemical approaches provides a solid basis for describing the functioning of this TRAP fused transporter.</p><p>Weakness: This work evidences in vitro a HiSiaQM dimer, whose in vivo relevance is not ascertained. However, the authors are very careful, they do not to over-interpret their data, and their conclusions regarding the transporter structure and function are valid irrespective of its state of association.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id

reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Congratulations on the very nice structure! In my opinion, which you can feel free to take or leave, this would work better as a short report focused on the improvement of the structure relative to the current published model. To my mind, while the functional and dimerization studies are supportive of the cryo-EM studies (specifically, the purified protein is functional, and does tend to dimerize in various membrane mimetics), these experiments don't provide a lot of new mechanistic insight on their own. The dimerization, in particular, could be developed further.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for the comments. We have chosen to stick with the current article format. That the protein is dimeric is exciting in our view and we are working to further define the functional significance of this formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Ln 48. Abstract. &quot;highlighting feature of the complex interface&quot; sounds a bit vague. I was wondering if the authors considered including more specific findings here.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This sentence has been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 149 and elsewhere. The authors refer to the previously published structure of HiSiaQM as &quot;low resolution&quot;. It may just be me and likely not the intention of the authors, but this comes across as an attempt to diminish the validity of this previous work from another group, which is not necessary. I would recommend rewording these parts slightly, even if it is just to say &quot;lower resolution&quot; instead of &quot;low resolution&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: It was not our intention to diminish the excellent work published by another group, we have changed “low resolution” to “lower resolution” throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 160. The authors state that the inward-open conformation is likely &quot;the resting state of the transporter&quot;. I think this statement should be modified slightly to acknowledge that this is only true under these conditions, i.e. in the absence of the bilayer, membrane potential and chemical gradients.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have edited this as follows “That we observe the inward-open conformation without either a bound P-subunit or fiducial marker, suggests that this is the resting state of the transporter under experimental conditions (in the absence of a membrane bilayer, membrane potential and chemical gradients).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 202. I'm not convinced that the use of the word &quot;probable&quot; is appropriate here; &quot;possible&quot; would likely fit better in the absence of compelling evidence that this dimer forms in a bacterial cell membrane with physiological levels of HiSiaQM expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have changed “probable” to “possible”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show an SEC trace for DDM solubilised protein, which is a single peak, whereas the LMNG extracted protein has 2 distinctly different elution profiles depending on the LMNG concentration. Was the same phenomenon observed when varying the DDM concentration?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We observed significantly more aggregation with DDM than L-MNG, so it was infrequently used and considerably less well characterised. In one purification, moderately higher DDM shifted the elution peak to be slightly later but retained a similar profile. Overall, we did not observe the same phenomenon of distinctly different elution profiles with DDM, but we have limited data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 245. The two positions cited as important for the elevator-type mechanism are the fusion helix and the dimer interface. However, there is no evidence that the dimer interface observed in this work has any relevance to the transport mechanism. To make this statement, the interface would need to be disrupted and the effects on transport evaluated.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This has been edited as follows. “Evident in our cryo-EM maps are well-defined phospholipid densities associated with areas of HiSiaQM that may be important for the function of an elevator-type mechanism (Figure 4), but require further testing.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 257. The authors state that the lipids form &quot;specific and strong interactions&quot; with the protein, but without knowing the identity of the lipids present, it is difficult to say anything about the specificity of this interaction. I think the authors could consider rewording this.Response: We have edited this by removing the term “specific” and describing the lipidinteractions only as strong interactions.</p><p>Ln 270. The authors identify a lipid-binding site and residues that likely interact with the headgroup. It would be interesting if the authors could speculate on the purpose of this lipid binding site and how it could affect transport. The residues are not conserved, which the authors suggest reflects the variety of lipid compositions in different bacteria. Are the authors suggesting that this lipid binding site is a general feature for all fused TRAP transporters and that the identity of the lipid changes depending on the species?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Yes, we speculate that the lipid binding site may be a general feature for fused TRAP transporters. We have added speculation about this binding site, specifically that “the fusion helix and concomitant lipid molecule may provide a more structurally rigid scaffold than a Q-M heterodimer, i.e., PpSiaQM, although how this impacts the elevator transition requires further testing” at Line 283.</p><p>Though we believe that a binding pocket is likely found in a number of fused TRAPs (based on sequence and Alphafold predictions, e.g., FnSiaQM and AaSiaQM), we have now acknowledged that some fusions may not necessarily bind a lipid molecule here, by stating “While this binding pocket is likely found in a number of fused TRAPs (based on sequence predictions, e.g., FnSiaQM and AaSiaQM in Supplementary Figure 8), it is not clear whether they also bind lipids here without experimental data” at Line 290.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 306. The authors state that the HiSiaPQM has a 10-fold higher transport activity than PpSiaPQM. Unless the transport assays were performed in parallel (to mitigate small changes in experimental set-up) and the reconstitution efficiency for each proteoliposome preparation was carefully analysed, it is very difficult for this to be a meaningful comparison. Even if the amount of protein incorporated into the proteoliposomes is quantified (e.g. by evaluating protein band intensity when the proteoliposomes are analysed using SDS-PAGE), this does not account for an inactive protein that was incorporated, nor the proportion of the protein that was incorporated in the inside-out orientation, which would be functionally silent in these assays. I'm not suggesting these assays actually need to be performed, but I think the text should be modified to reflect what can actually be compared.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree with the reviewer that a meaningful comparison is difficult to make without a careful analysis of the reconstitution efficiency and have modified the text to reflect this. We have altered the paragraph beginning at Line 319 to the following: “The fused HiSiaPQM system appears to have a higher transport activity than the non-fused PpSiaPQM system. With the same experimental setup used for PpSiaPQM (5 μM Neu5Ac, 50 μM SiaP) (33), the accumulation of [3H]-Neu5Ac by the fused HiSiaPQM is ~10-fold greater. Although this difference may reflect the reconstitution efficiency of each proteoliposome preparation, it is possible that it has evolved as a result of the origins of each transporter system—P. profundum is a deep-sea bacterium and as such the transporter is required to be functional at low temperatures and high pressures… ”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 335. &quot;S298A did not show an effect on growth when mutated to alanine previously.&quot; Suggest changing &quot;S298A&quot; here to &quot;S298&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This has been changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 340. In addition to PpSiaQM, the large cavity was also presumably observed in the lower resolution structure of HiSiaQM?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The cavity is detectable in the lower resolution structure (7qe5), though very poorly defined by the density. Furthermore, the AlphaFold model fitted to this density has positioned sidechains inside the cavity, which we consider very likely to be an error (in comparison to our structures, VcINDY and our estimates of the volume required to house sialic acid). The cavity is generally much better defined by the structures we have referenced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 345. Reference missing after &quot;previously reported&quot;? Response: This has been added.Measuring the affinity for the P-to-QM interaction is very useful, but it would have enhanced the study if some of the residues identified as important for this interaction (detailed on p.13) had been tested for their contributions to binding using this approach.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We do aim to perform this assay with these mutants in the future, but are also developing parallel assays to further test this interaction in different membrane mimetics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 436. As stated previously, it is more accurate to say that &quot;this is the most stable conformation&quot; under these conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have edited this to say “The ‘elevator down’ (inward-facing) conformation is preferred in experimental conditions”. We have also changed the last sentence of this paragraph to say “However, the dimeric structures we have presented have no other proteins bound, yet exist stably in the elevator down state, suggesting this is the most stable conformation in experimental conditions, where there is no membrane bilayer, membrane potential, or chemical gradient present.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 438. &quot;Lipids associated with HiSiaQM are structurally and mechanistically important.&quot; This conclusion is not supported by the data presented; there is no evidence that the bound lipids influence the mechanism at all. The lipids observed are certainly interestingly placed and one could speculate about their relevance, but this statement of fact is not supported. Therefore, their importance to the mechanism needs to be tested or this conclusion needs to be substantially softened.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have softened this statement by changing it to “Lipids have strong interactions with HiSiaQM and are likely to be important for the transport mechanism.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The fact that HiSiaQM samples consist of a mixture of compact monomer and dimer is clear, from Fig. S5 and S6. However, the analysis displayed in Fig 3 and Fig S4 would require more explanation. To my understanding, it requires the values of the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients. It could be good to provide the experimental values of D, and explain a little more about the method in the material and method section.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Yes, the analysis requires the experimental diffusion coefficients. These have been added to the Figure 3 and S4 legends and more detail has been added to the method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, I am puzzled when reading, in the legend of Fig 3, considerations that peak 2 could not correspond to a monomer or trimer: do these sentences correspond to other mathematical solutions, or is a given frictional ratio considered, or do they refer to Fig. S5 analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We can see where this confusion could arise from. These sentences do not correspond to a given frictional ratio or the Fig. S5 analysis (this is a separate, complementary analysis). For peak 2 not existing as a monomer is strictly a physical justification – with pure protein and an observed peak smaller than peak 2, a monomer is not possible for peak 2. For peak 2 not existing as a trimer is a mathematical solution using the s and D coefficients. The solutions identify that an unreasonably low amount of detergent would be bound to a trimer (32 molecules for L-MNG or 0 for DDM) to exist at those s and D values so we have ruled the trimer out. Reassuringly, the complementary analysis in Fig. S5/S6 agrees with the monomer-dimer outputs from the s and D analysis. We have adjusted the text in the legends of Fig. 3 and S4 to better convey these points.</p></body></sub-article></article>
