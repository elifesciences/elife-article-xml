simple movements, such as button pressing. However, little is known about how beta oscillations change and interact in more complex situations involving rapid changes of movement in various contexts. To close this knowledge gap, we combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) and local field potential recordings from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in Parkinson’s disease patients to study beta dynamics during initiation, stopping, and rapid reversal of rotational movements. The action prompts were manipulated to be predictable vs. unpredictable. We observed movement-related beta suppression at motor sequence start, and a beta rebound after motor sequence stop in STN power, motor cortical power, and STN-cortex coherence. Despite involving a brief stop of movement, no clear rebound was observed during reversals of turning direction. At the cortical level, beta power decreased bilaterally following reversals, but more so in the hemisphere ipsilateral to movement, due to a floor effect on the contralateral side. In the STN, power modulations varied across patients, with patients displaying brief increases or decreases of high-beta power. Importantly, cue predictability affected these modulations. Event-related increases of STN-cortex beta coherence were generally stronger in the unpredictable than in the predictable condition. In summary, this study reveals the influence of movement context on beta oscillations in basal ganglia-cortex loops when humans change ongoing movements according to external cues. We find that movement scenarios requiring higher levels of caution involve enhanced modulations of subthalamo-cortical beta synchronization. Furthermore, our results confirm that beta oscillations reflect the start and end of motor sequences better than movement changes within a sequence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Parkinson's</kwd><kwd>subthalamic nucleus</kwd><kwd>deep brain stimulation</kwd><kwd>beta oscillations</kwd><kwd>motor control</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Brunhilde Moll Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schnitzler</surname><given-names>Alfons</given-names></name><name><surname>Hirschmann</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Beta synchrony between motor cortex and the subthalamic nucleus is intensified when instructional cues within a continuous motor sequence become less predictable, calling for more cautious behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Beta oscillations within cortical sensorimotor areas and the basal ganglia have been proposed to play a role in movement initiation, termination, and inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jurkiewicz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wessel, 2020</xref>). Altered beta band activity has been strongly linked to motor impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD), demonstrating its relevance to proper motor performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cassidy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tinkhauser et al., 2017</xref>). The beta rhythm is often interpreted as reflecting the status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engel and Fries, 2010</xref>), that is, active maintenance or stabilization of current motor or cognitive output to attenuate alternatives and distractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Espenhahn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fischer et al., 2019</xref>). The basal ganglia keep cortex under inhibitory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnevie and Zaghloul, 2019</xref>) which, similarly to releasing a break in a car, must be removed to change the current motor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alegre et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Starting and stopping of movement have mostly been studied with variations of the Stop Signal Task and the Go/No-Go Task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alegre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aron and Poldrack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ray et al., 2012</xref>) that require participants to perform simple, ballistic movements and inhibit them occasionally. Shortly before and during movement, beta oscillations are suppressed (beta suppression), reflecting a task-related active state of the motor network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jurkiewicz et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, beta power transiently increases above baseline levels after movement termination (beta rebound) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fonken et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ray et al., 2012</xref>), indicating inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Salmelin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schmidt and Berke, 2017</xref>) and motor adaptation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Struber et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). Whether these modulations are causally involved in motor control is still under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pfurtscheller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Toledo et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Response inhibition has been associated with increased beta power or reduced suppression thereof in prefrontal cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Swann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wagner et al., 2018</xref>), and in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastin et al., 2014</xref>), with some studies reporting correlations with inhibitory success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Besides playing a critical role in stopping movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mosher et al., 2021</xref>), the STN seems to be involved in delaying or pausing movement until sufficient evidence in favor of a motor program has accumulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ray et al., 2012</xref>). Recent evidence demonstrated that the STN is recruited by the prefrontal cortex via the hyperdirect pathway to implement its pausing function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lofredi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oswal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wessel et al., 2019</xref>). However, the role of cortico-subcortical beta synchronization in coordinating movements that are already ongoing remains elusive.</p><p>Communication between STN and cortex might become particularly important in tasks involving cognitive factors, such as anticipation. STN beta power has been found to index task complexity and behavioral control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oswal et al., 2013</xref>), proactive inhibition and planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benis et al., 2014</xref>), non-motor decision making, and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zavala et al., 2017</xref>), and cue evaluation with respect to behavioral goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oswal et al., 2012</xref>). Yet, the extent to which modulation of beta oscillations in basal-ganglia cortex networks depends on expectation remains unknown.</p><p>In the present study, we address these research gaps with a paradigm that involves a rotational movement performed in a continuous fashion with occasional rapid changes in movement direction (reversals), as well as movement initiations and terminations. Accounting for the relevance of basal ganglia-cortical loops in motor control, we recorded cortical and STN oscillatory activity simultaneously in PD patients who had undergone implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes the day before. Patients performed the rotational movements according to visual instructions which were manipulated such that their identity and time of appearance was either predictable or unpredictable. With this design, we aimed (1) to investigate the dynamics of STN and STN-cortex beta synchronization during movement reversal compared to those of starting and stopping and (2) to assess the effect of the temporal predictability of movement instructions on the coordination of beta synchronization for starting, stopping, and reversing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavior</title><p>Patients turned a wheel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) with their index finger at their preferred speed and were prompted by visual cues to start, reverse, or stop rotational movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) while we simultaneously measured MEG and STN local field potentials (LFPs). We considered an average of 60.1 (SD = 14.8) predictable start trials, 59.3 (SD = 17.8) unpredictable start trials, 59.9 (SD = 14.2) predictable reversal trials, 58.6 (SD = 15.5) unpredictable reversal trials, 61.3 (SD = 15.3) predictable stop trials and 60.2 (SD = 17.4) unpredictable stop trials per patient for analysis. To assess whether the predictability of movement prompts had an effect on behavior, we analyzed its effect on movement speed and reaction times. Angular speed changes in start, reversal, and stop trials were similar in the predictable and the unpredictable condition when the data was aligned to action onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>cond</sub>(1,16) = 0.037, <italic>p</italic><sub>cond</sub> = 0.850, <italic>ηp<sup>2</sup></italic>=0.002; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for the complete results of the ANOVA).

STN-M1 and STN-MSMC beta coherence decreased at movement initiation and increased after movement termination, while gamma coherence increased at movement start, corresponding to similar power changes in STN and motor cortex. A pre-movement suppression of beta coherence has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cassidy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Talakoub et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Wijk et al., 2017</xref>).

Though the present paradigm did not involve any conflict as such, the context of unpredictable movement instructions possibly engaged similar cognitive processes in response to surprise/uncertainty.</p><p>With respect to power, we observed reduced beta suppression in the unpredictable condition at movement start, consistent with the effect on coherence, likely demonstrating a lower level of motor preparation.

In contrast, the STN exhibited increases of high beta power in some patients, compatible with post-processing of the brief pause of movement occurring during reversals. On an observational level, the spectral patterns of these increases did not entirely match the individual stop-related beta pattern, lacking the low-beta component of the beta rebound. Thus, STN low-beta oscillations might not re-emerge when stopping briefly within a movement sequence, corroborating a dissociation of low- and high-beta oscillations, as proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chandrasekaran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oswal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patai et al., 2022</xref>). Given that the beta rebound has been reported to slow reaction times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muralidharan and Aron, 2021</xref>) and to reduce corticospinal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wessel et al., 2016</xref>), and that beta power must decrease for movement to start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heinrichs-Graham and Wilson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khanna and Carmena, 2017</xref>), it is likely that at least the low-beta portion of the beta rebound needs to be avoided during changes of ongoing action because it would slow down re-acceleration otherwise.</p><p>In agreement with the current findings, previous research assessing STN- and cortical beta activity reported no beta rebound around the time a movement changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alegre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">London et al., 2021</xref>), except for one study, which did report a cortical beta rebound between two successive movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muralidharan and Aron, 2021</xref>). It should be noted, however, that the pauses were ~1–2 s long. In our study, the beta rebound occurred only at the end of the movement sequence, when patients were already in the process of stopping and movement had already slowed. This picture emerged irrespective of whether power dynamics were analyzed in a movement- or cue-aligned fashion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). A causal role of the beta rebound in stopping is, therefore, implausible. More likely, the rebound serves as a post-movement feedback signal reflecting task-dependent contextual information used to either confirm or update motor plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alegre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao and Hu, 2016</xref>).

Conversely, another study using visual stop signals reported decreased STN gamma power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alegre et al., 2013</xref>). We are unaware of studies that have assessed gamma power changes when stopping a continuous movement in response to visual cues and, therefore, provide first evidence for a decrease in this scenario, although we cannot rule out that focusing on different DBS contacts or using auditory stop signals and shorter event-locked analysis windows might produce different results.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>Invasive measurements of STN activity are only possible in patients who are undergoing or have undergone brain surgery.

Additionally, several of our findings match observations made in other patient populations and in healthy participants, who exhibit the same beta power dynamics at movement start and stop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alegre et al., 2004</xref>) that we observed here. Notably, our finding of enhanced cortical involvement in face of uncertainty aligns well with established theories of cognitive processing, given the cortex' prominent role in managing higher cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altamura et al., 2010</xref>). Yet, transferring our approach and task to patients with different disorders, e.g., obsessive compulsive disorder, or examining young and healthy participants solely at the cortical level, could contribute to elucidating whether the synchronization dynamics reported here are indeed independent of PD and age. Additionally, future research could capitalize on sensing-capable devices to circumvent the necessity to record brain activity peri-operatively, allowing for larger sample sizes and to circumvent the stun effect, an immediate improvement in motor symptoms arising as a consequence of electrode implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mann et al., 2009</xref>). Lastly, given the present study’s focus on understanding movement-related rhythms, particularly in the beta range, future research could further explore the role of gamma oscillations in continuous movement and their relation to action potentials in motor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fischer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Igarashi et al., 2013</xref>), which form the basis of movement encoding in the brain.</p><p>Due to the diversity of modulations across patients, we cannot provide a general description of how the STN responds to reversals. The variability may result from the fact that the exact recording site varied across patients, although all recording contacts were located in the dorsolateral STN. Furthermore, stop processes, mediated by the hyperdirect and the indirect pathway as well as cortico-striatal go processes, may emerge in the basal ganglia close in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muralidharan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schmidt and Berke, 2017</xref>), potentially overlapping.

We found that stopping briefly in the course of changing movement direction and terminating a movement sequence have distinct oscillatory profiles. Moreover, movement scenarios that do not permit movement preparation and require higher levels of caution appear to involve enhanced levels of subthalamo-cortical beta synchronization, highlighting that long-range beta coherence plays an important role in coordinating movements in response to unpredictable events.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patients</title><p>23 PD patients with a mean age of 66.13 y (±7.72 y) participated in the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

id="s4-2"><title>Recordings</title><p>Measurements took place the day after the implantation of DBS electrodes. Externalization of leads allowed us to measure LFPs from the STN in combination with MEG. For LFP recordings, we used a mastoid reference and re-referenced the signals using a bipolar montage post-measurement. MEG signals were acquired simultaneously, using a 306-channel whole-head MEG system (VectorView, MEGIN). Muscle and ocular activity were monitored via electromyography (EMG) and vertical and horizontal electrooculography (EOG), respectively. EMG surface electrodes were placed on patients’ right and left forearms, referenced to the muscle tendons at the wrist. We first recorded 5 min of resting-state data, followed by the motor task, which lasted for about 32 min in total. During the task, patients were required to turn a wheel clockwise or counterclockwise, according to visual instructions presented on a screen in front of them.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Patients were seated in the MEG scanner in a magnetically shielded room with a turning device (‘wheel,’ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) placed on a table in front of them. The wheel (diameter = 14 cm, height = 6.5 cm) could be turned into both directions and had indentations, allowing comfortable placement of one index finger for turning. An MEG-compatible plastic fiber optic position sensor system (MR430 Series ZapFREE Fiber Optic Absolute Encoder System, MICRONER Inc, Camarillo, CA, USA) was used to measure wheel turning. The absolute angular position was continuously measured and updated at a frequency of 1.2 kHz. Given its design, the sensing system did not introduce any magnetic interference.</p><p>Movement prompts were presented on a screen. The visual stimuli consisted of two curved arrows pointing either clockwise or counterclockwise, respectively, and a stop sign with white font on a red background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Patients were instructed to turn the wheel with their index finger following the direction of the arrows and to stop when a stop cue appeared. We did not impose requirements on turning speed or body side, so that patients could use their less affected hand and adjust the speed to their individual motor capabilities.</p><p>The experiment was conducted in two distinct blocks, where stimuli differed in their order and timing of presentation. In the predictable condition, trials consisted of a blue arrow cueing the patients to start turning clockwise, followed by a cue to change the turning direction after 4 s, and a stop cue after another 4 s. Each trial was followed by a pause lasting for 4 s. The condition was termed <italic>predictable</italic>, as the fixed timing and the fixed order of cues allowed patients to easily predict and prepare what they had to do next and when. In the unpredictable condition, the start cue was either clockwise or counterclockwise and was followed by 0, 1, or 2 reversals before the stop cue appeared. Each alternative occurred equally often (go, stop: 33%; go, reverse, stop: 33%; go, reverse, reverse, stop: 33%; clockwise and counterclockwise start directions were balanced). Additionally, the intervals between the visual stimuli were unpredictable (ranging between 4–7 s), with 50% of all inter-stimulus intervals kept at 4 s, as in the predictable condition. Hence, patients could not foresee the sequence and the timing of instructions, calling for a more cautious/attentive monitoring of cues.</p><p>We recorded two blocks per condition, with 36 trials each, in a pseudo-randomized fashion. To enhance compliance, we split each block in half, allowing for a short break, and also offered breaks between blocks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Materials availability statement</title><p>The code used for analyses is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/luciewinkler/Subthalamo-Cortical-Synchronization">https://github.com/luciewinkler/Subthalamo-Cortical-Synchronization</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirschmann and Winkler, 2025</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using MATLAB R2019b (The Mathworks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) and the toolbox FieldTrip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>).

We applied a high-pass finite impulse response filter with a cut-off frequency of 1 Hz to remove low-frequency drifts and screened the data for remaining artifacts.</p><p>We used custom MATLAB scripts for semi-automated detection of movement start, reversal, and stop in the wheel data. This was achieved by applying an event-specific combination of amplitude and duration thresholds to the first temporal derivative of the rotation angle measurements. To ensure that events were correctly marked, all events were visually inspected and manually corrected if needed. Then, we epoched MEG and LFP data with respect to the behavioral events. Trials were centered around movement events of interest, i.e., start, stop, and reversal of movement, and encompassed 4 s. Movement-aligned angular speed was calculated within those time windows and averaged over trials. Reaction times to cues were defined as the time from cue presentation until movement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>LFP Channel Selection</title><p>The positions of DBS electrodes were localized with the MATLAB toolbox Lead-DBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neudorfer et al., 2023</xref>) using the patients’ pre-operative T1- and T2-weighted MRIs (Magnetom Trio MRI scanner, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and postoperative CT scans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In order to select one LFP channel for each patient and hemisphere, we identified the bipolar LFP channel with the strongest beta suppression and beta rebound, as previous research has demonstrated the presence of these modulations in the dorsolateral motor STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wessel et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the source of subthalamic beta oscillations has been localized to the dorsal STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tamir et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Regions of interest</title><p>Similarly, we selected cortical regions of interest (ROIs) by localizing the strongest event-related modulations of beta power/beta coherence. For source localization, we first co-registered the pre-operative T1-weighted MRI scans to the MEG coordinate system. Using the segmented MRIs, we prepared forward models based on single-shell realistic head models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nolte, 2003</xref>). Beamformer grids, specifying the position of sources, covered the entire brain and were aligned to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Subsequently, we applied <italic>Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources (DICS)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gross et al., 2001</xref>) to beta-band LFP-MEG cross-spectral densities pooled across predictability conditions. Next, we computed contrasts between post-event (0–2 s) and pre-event (−2–0 s) beta power/coherence and averaged the absolute changes across patients and events (movement start, reversal, and stop). This served to identify the regions with the strongest change in general, irrespective of sign, event, and predictability condition.</p><p>The strongest beta power modulations localized to the hand knob area of primary motor cortex (M1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) and the strongest changes in STN-cortex beta coherence to medial sensorimotor cortex (MSMC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Thus, we focused our analysis on bilateral STN, M1, and MSMC. For time-frequency analysis, we represented each cortical ROI by the grid point of strongest modulation and its six nearest neighbors and extracted a time-series for each grid point, using a linearly constrained minimum variance spatial filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Van Veen and Buckley, 1988</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Time-frequency analyses</title><p>While our main focus was the beta band, we also included other frequencies in our time-frequency analyses to get a more complete picture of power and coherence changes. Specifically, we considered the frequency ranges 5–45 Hz and 55–90 Hz, omitting the 50 Hz line noise artifact, and the time range from –1.6–1.6 s with respect to the movement event. Fourier spectra were computed using a multi-taper approach (four Slepian tapers for the low frequency range and seven Slepian tapers for the high frequency range), a window size of 800 ms and a step size of 50 ms. Using the Fourier coefficients, we computed power and STN-cortex across-trial coherence for each time-frequency bin.</p><p>For illustration, we applied baseline correction, using the mean of the pre-event time window (−1.6–0 s) as baseline. In case of power, we expressed changes with respect to baseline in decibel. In case of coherence, we subtracted the baseline values. Time-frequency spectra of cortical sources were averaged over neighboring grid points belonging to the same ROI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Granger causality analysis</title><p>We computed beta and gamma band non-parametric Granger causality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dhamala et al., 2008</xref>) between cortical ROIs and the STN for the post-event time windows (0–2 s with respect to start, reversal, and stop). Because estimates of Granger causality are often biased, we compared the original data to time-reversed data to suppress non-causal interactions. True directional influence is reflected by a higher causality measure in the original data than in its time-reversed version, resulting in a positive difference between the two, the opposite being the case for a signal that is ‘Granger-caused’ by the other. Directionality is thus reflected by the sign of the estimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haufe et al., 2013</xref>). Because rmANCOVA results indicated no significant effects for predictability and movement type, and post-hoc tests did not show significant differences between hemispheres, we averaged Granger causality estimates over movement types, hemispheres, and predictability conditions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Repeated measures analyses of (co)variance (rmANCOVA), implemented in SPSS, were our main tool for statistical analysis. This approach provides a comprehensive, multi-factorial analysis, but requires pre-selection of brain areas (see Regions of Interest), a frequency range, and a time range of interest (see Power and coherence). The dependent variable was either the event-related change in power or coherence, the hemispheric lateralization of the event-related power change (see Lateralization), or Granger causality.

It was observed that different movement phases, such as starting, stopping briefly, and stopping completely, affect beta oscillations in the motor system.</p><p>It was found that unpredictable cues lead to stronger changes in STN-cortex beta coherence. Additionally, specific patterns of beta and gamma oscillations related to different movement actions and contexts were observed.

Given the availability of sensing enabled DBS devices now and HD-EEG, does MEG offer a significant enough gain in spatial localizability to offset the fact that it has to be done shortly postoperatively with externalized leads, with attendant stun effect? Specifically, for paradigms that are not asking very spatially localized questions as a primary hypothesis?</p><p>Further investigation of the gamma signal seems warranted, even though it has a slightly lower proportional change in amplitude in beta. Given that the changes in gamma here are relatively wide band, this could represent a marker of neural firing that could be interestingly contrasted against the rhythm account presented.</p><p>Comments on revisions: I congratulate the authors on their paper and their revisions and I have no further comments. I look forward to seeing the continuous analyses in the future.

We agree that the interpretation of the role of the STN during reversals is rather difficult, because reversal-related STN activity was highly variable across patients. Although there seem to be consistent patterns in sub-groups of the current cohort, with some patients showing event-related increases (Fig. 3b) and others showing decreases, the current dataset is not large enough to substantiate or even explain the existence of such clusters. Thus, we limit ourselves to acknowledging this limitation and discussing potential reasons for the high variability, namely variability in electrode placement and insufficient spatial resolution for the separation of specialized cell ensembles within the STN (see Discussion, section Limitations and future directions).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examines the role of beta oscillations in motor control, particularly during rapid changes in movement direction among patients with Parkinson's disease.

We address these issues one by one in our responses to points 2, 4 and 6, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The small sample size and variability in clinical characteristics among patients may limit the robustness of the study's conclusions. It would be beneficial for the authors to acknowledge this limitation and propose strategies for addressing it in future research. Additionally, incorporating patient-specific factors as covariates in the ANOVA could help mitigate the confounding effects of heterogeneity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. The challenges associated with recording brain activity peri-operatively can be a limiting factor when it comes to sample size and cohort stratification. We now acknowledge this in the revised discussion (section Limitations and future directions). Furthermore, we suggest using sensing-capable devices in the future as a measure to increase sample sizes (Discussion, section Limitations and future directions). Lastly, we appreciate the idea of adding patient-specific factors as covariates to the ANOVAs and have thus included age, disease duration and pre-surgical UPDRS score into our models. This did not lead to any qualitative changes of statistical effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The author may consider using standardized statistics, such as effect size, that would provide a clearer picture of the observed effect magnitude and improve comparability.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. As measures of effect size, we have added partial eta squared (<italic>ηp&lt;sup2</italic>) to the results of all ANOVAs and Cohen’s d to all follow-up <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Although the study identifies relevance between beta activity and motor events, it lacks causal analysis and discussion of potential causal mechanisms. Given the valuable datasets collected, exploring or discussing causal mechanisms would enhance the depth of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this idea and have conducted Granger causality analyses in response to this comment. This new analysis reveals that there is a strong cortical drive to the STN for all movements of interest and predictability conditions in the beta band. The detailed results can be viewed on p. 16 in the section on Granger causality. For statistical testing, we conducted an rmANCOVA, similar to those for power and coherence (see p. 46-48 and 54-56 for the corresponding tables), as well as t-tests assessing directionality (Figure 6-figure supplement 2 on p. 35). In the discussion section, we connect these results with prior findings suggesting that the frontal cortex drives the STN in the beta band, likely through hyperdirect pathway fibers (p. 17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The study cohort focused on senior adults, who may exhibit age-related cortical responses during movement planning in neural mechanisms. These aspects were not discussed in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment and agree that age may have impacted neural oscillatory activity of patients in the present study. We now acknowledge this in the limitations section, and point out that our approach to handling these effects was including age as a covariate in the statistical analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Including a control group of patients with other movement disorders who also undergo DBS surgery would be beneficial. Because we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed findings are specific to PD or can be generalized. Additionally, the current title and the article, which are oriented toward understanding human motor control, may not be appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and fully agree that it cannot be ruled out that the present findings are, in part, specific to PD. We acknowledge this limitation in the Limitations and future directions section (p. 20-21). Indeed, including a control group of patients with other disorders would be ideal, but the scarcity of patients with diseases other than PD who receive STN DBS in our centre makes this an unfeasible option in practical terms. We do suggest that future research may address this issue by extending our approach to different disorders or healthy participants on the cortical level (p. 21). Lastly, we appreciate the idea to adjust the title of the present article. The adjusted title is: “Context-Dependent Modulations of Subthalamo-Cortical Synchronization during Rapid Reversals of Movement Direction in Parkinson’s Disease”.</p><p>That being said, we do believe that our findings at least approximate healthy functioning and are not solely related to PD. For one, patients were on their usual dopaminergic medication and dopamine has been found to normalize pathological alterations of beta activity. Further, the general pattern of movement-related beta and gamma oscillations reported here has been observed in numerous diseases and brain structures, including cortical beta oscillations measured non-invasively in healthy participants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study highlights how the initiation, reversal, and cessation of movements are linked to changes in beta synchronization within the basal ganglia-cortex loops. It was observed that different movement phases, such as starting, stopping briefly, and stopping completely, affect beta oscillations in the motor system.</p><p>It was found that unpredictable cues lead to stronger changes in STN-cortex beta coherence. Additionally, specific patterns of beta and gamma oscillations related to different movement actions and contexts were observed. Stopping movements was associated with a lack of the expected beta rebound during brief pauses within a movement sequence.</p><p>Overall, the results underline the complex and context-dependent nature of motor-control and emphasize the role of beta oscillations in managing movement according to changing external cues.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The paper is very well written, clear, and appears methodologically sound.</p><p>Although the use of continuous movement (turning) with reversals is more naturalistic than many previous button push paradigms.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The generalizability of the findings is somewhat curtailed by the fact that this was performed perioperatively during the period of the microlesion effect. Given the availability of sensing-enabled DBS devices now and HD-EEG, does MEG offer a significant enough gain in spatial localizability to offset the fact that it has to be done shortly postoperatively with externalized leads, with an attendant stun effect? Specifically, for paradigms that are not asking very spatially localized questions as a primary hypothesis?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s feedback and acknowledge the valid point raised on the timing of our measurements. Indeed, sensing-enabled devices offer a valid alternative to peri-operative recordings, circumventing the stun effect. We acknowledge this in the revised discussion, section Limitations and future directions (p. 23): “Additionally, future research could capitalize on sensingcapable devices to circumvent the necessity to record brain activity peri-operatively, facilitating larger sample sizes and circumventing the stun effect, an immediate improvement in motor symptoms arising as a consequence of electrode implantation (Mann et al., 2009).” This alternative strategy, however, was not an option here because we did not have a sufficient number of patients implanted with sensing-enabled devices at the time when the data collection was initialized.</p><p>That being said, we would like to highlight that in the present study, our goal was not to study pathology related to Parkinson’s disease. Rather, we aimed to learn about motor control in general. The stun effect may have facilitated motor performance in our patients, which is actually beneficial to the research goals at hand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further investigation of the gamma signal seems warranted, even though it has a slightly lower proportional change in amplitude in beta. Given that the changes in gamma here are relatively wide band, this could represent a marker of neural firing that could be interestingly contrasted against the rhythm account presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s interest and we have extended the investigation of gamma oscillations. We now provide statistics regarding the influence of predictability on gamma power and gamma coherence (no significant effects) and explore Granger causality in the gamma (and beta) band (see comment 4 of reviewer 2). Unfortunately, we cannot measure spiking via the DBS electrode, and therefore we cannot investigate correlations between gamma oscillatory activity and action potentials. We do agree with the reviewer, however, that action potentials rather than oscillations form the basis of motor control in the brain. This view of ours is now reflected in the revised discussion, section Limitations and future directions (p. 21): “Lastly, given the present study’s focus on understanding movement-related rhythms, particularly in the beta range, future research could further explore the role of gamma oscillations in continuous movement and their relation to action potentials in motor areas (Fischer et al., 2020; Igarashi, Isomura, Arai, Harukuni, &amp; Fukai, 2013), which form the basis of movement encoding in the brain.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>This is a well-conducted study and overall the results are clear. I only have one minor suggestion for improvement of the manuscript. I found the order of appearance of the results somewhat confusing, switching from predictability-related behavioral effects to primarily stopping and reversal-related neurophysiological effects, back to predictability but starting with coherence. I would suggest that the authors try to follow a systematic order focused on the questions at hand. E.g. perhaps readability could be improved if the results section is split into reversal vs. stopping related effects, reporting behavior, power, and coherence in this order, followed by a predictability section, again reporting behavior, power, and coherence. Obviously, this is an optional suggestion. Apart from that, I just missed a more direct message related to the absence of statistical significance related to STN power changes during reversal. I think this could be made more clear in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the feedback to our study. In order to ease reading, we modified the order and further added additional sub-titles to the results section. We start with Behavior (p. 4) and then move on to Power (general movement effects on power – movement effects on STN power – movement effects on cortical power – predictability effects on power). Next, we move on to Connectivity (movement effects on connectivity – predictability effects on connectivity – Granger causality). We hope that these adaptations will help guide the reader.</p><p>Additionally, we thank the reviewer for noting that we did not explicitly mention the lack of statistical significance of reversal-related beta power modulations in the STN. We have adapted the section on modulation of STN beta power associated with reversals (p. 8) to: “In the STN, reversals were associated with a brief modulation of beta power, which was weak in the group-average spectrum and did not reach significance (Fig. 3a).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The small sample size and variability in clinical characteristics among patients may limit the robustness of the study's conclusions. It would be beneficial for the authors to acknowledge this limitation and propose strategies for addressing it in future research. Additionally, incorporating patient-specific factors as covariates in the ANOVA could help mitigate the confounding effects of heterogeneity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. The challenges associated with recording brain activity peri-operatively can be a limiting factor when it comes to sample size. We now acknowledge this in the revised discussion, section Limitations and future directions (p. 20):</p><p>“Invasive measurements of STN activity are only possible in patients who are undergoing or have undergone brain surgery. Studies drawing from this limited pool of candidate participants are typically limited in terms of sample size and cohort stratification, particularly when carried out in a peri-operative setting. Here, we had a sample size of 20, which is rather high for a peri-operative study, but still low in terms of absolute numbers.”</p><p>Furthermore, we suggest using sensing-capable devices in the future as a measure to increase sample sizes (p. 21):</p><p>“Additionally, future research could capitalize on sensing-capable devices to circumvent the necessity to record brain activity peri-operatively, facilitating larger sample sizes and circumventing the stun effect, an immediate improvement in motor symptoms arising as a consequence of electrode implantation (Mann et al., 2009).”</p><p>Lastly, we appreciate the idea of adding patient-specific factors as covariates to the ANOVAs and have thus included age, disease duration and pre-surgical UPDRS score into our models. This did not lead to any qualitative changes of statistical effects.</p><p>Revised article</p><p>Methods, Statistical analysis:</p><p>“To account for their potential influence on brain activity, we added age, pre-operative UPDRS score, and disease duration as covariates to all ANOVAs. Covariates were standardized by means of zscoring.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The author may consider using standardized statistics, such as effect size, that would provide a clearer picture of the observed effect magnitude and improve comparability.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this useful suggestion. As measures of effect size, we have added partial eta squared (<italic>ηp&lt;sup2</italic>) to the results of all ANOVAs and Cohen’s d to all follow-up _t-_tests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Although the study identifies relevance between beta activity and motor events, it lacks causal analysis and discussion of potential causal mechanisms. Given the valuable datasets collected, exploring or discussing causal mechanisms would enhance the depth of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this idea and have conducted Granger causality analyses in response to this comment. This new analysis reveals that there is a strong cortical drive to the STN for all movements of interest and predictability conditions in the beta band, but no directed interactions in the gamma band. For statistical testing, we conducted an rmANCOVA, similar to the analysis of power and coherence (see p. 46-48 and 54-56 for the corresponding tables), as well as <italic>t</italic>-tests assessing directionality (Figure 6 figure supplement 2 on p. 35). In the discussion section, we connect these results with prior findings suggesting that the frontal cortex drives the STN in the beta band, likely through hyperdirect pathway fibers (p. 17).</p><p>Revised article</p><p>Methods Section, Granger Causality Analysis</p><p>“We computed beta and gamma band non-parametric Granger causality (Dhamala, Rangarajan, &amp; Ding, 2008) between cortical ROIs and the STN in the hemisphere contralateral to movement for the post-event time windows (0 – 2 s with respect to start, reversal, and stop). Because estimates of Granger causality are often biased, we compared the original data to time-reversed data to suppress non-causal interactions. True directional influence is reflected by a higher causality measure in the original data than in its time-reversed version, resulting in a positive difference between the two, the opposite being the case for a signal that is “Granger-caused” by the other. Directionality is thus reflected by the sign of the estimate (Haufe, Nikulin, Müller, &amp; Nolte, 2013). Because rmANCOVA results indicated no significant effects for predictability and movement type, and post-hoc tests did not detect significant differences between hemispheres, we averaged Granger causality estimates over movement types, hemispheres and predictability conditions in Figure 6-figure supplement 2.”</p><p>Results, Granger causality</p><p>“In general, cortex appeared to drive the STN in the beta band, regardless of the movement type and predictability condition.

In line with this idea, we observed a cortical drive of subthalamic activity in the beta band.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The study cohort focused on senior adults, who may exhibit age-related cortical responses during movement planning in neural mechanisms.

Dopaminergic medication has been demonstrated to normalize power within the STN and globus pallidus internus, as well as STN-globus pallidus internus and STN-cortex coherence (Brown et al., 2001; Hirschmann et al., 2013). Additionally, several of our findings match observations made in other patient populations and healthy participants, who exhibit the same beta power dynamics at movement start and stop (Alegre et al., 2004) that we observed here. Notably, our finding of enhanced cortical involvement in face of uncertainty aligns well with established theories of cognitive processing, given the cortex' prominent role in managing higher cognitive functions (Altamura et al., 2010). Yet, transferring our approach and task to patients with different disorders, e.g. obsessive compulsive disorder, or examining young and healthy participants solely at the cortical level, could contribute to elucidating whether the synchronization dynamics reported here are indeed independent of PD and age.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Despite the strengths of the &quot;rhythm&quot; account of cognitive processes, the paper could possibly be improved by making it less skewed to rhythms explaining all of the movement encoding.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment - the point is well taken. There is a large body of literature relating neural oscillations to spiking in larger neural populations, which itself is likely the most relevant signal with respect to motor control.

In case of coherence, the difference between pre- and post-event was generally more positive in the unpredictable condition, meaning that suppressions (negative pre-post difference) were diminished whereas increases (positive pre-post difference) were enhanced. With respect to power, we also observed less suppression in the unpredictable condition at movement start. Therefore, the direction of change is in fact the same.

This would be a nice finding if you could also show that the beta is modulated continuously by the continuous movements. In the natural world, we rarely do a continuous movement with a sudden reversal, or stop, most of the time we are in continuous movement. Look at this might also be a strength of your dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We could not agree more. In fact, having a continuous behavioral output was a major motivation for choosing this particular task. We are very interested in state space models such as preferential subspace identification (Sani et al., 2021), for example. These models relate continuous brain signals to continuous behavioral target variables and should be of great help for questions such as: do oscillations relate to moment-by-moment adaptations of continuous movement? Which frequency bands and brain areas are important? Is angular position encoded by different brain areas/frequency bands than angular speed? These analyses are in fact ongoing.
