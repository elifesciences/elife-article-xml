Its putative domain-global role appears to tie into poorly understood differences between cognitive domains in both hemispheres. Across attentional, semantic, and social cognitive tasks, our study explored functional specialization within the IPL. The task specificity of IPL subregion activity was substantiated by distinct predictive signatures identified by multivariate pattern-learning algorithms. Moreover, the left and right IPL exerted domain-specific modulation of effective connectivity among their subregions. Task-evoked functional interactions of the anterior and posterior IPL subregions involved recruitment of distributed cortical partners. While anterior IPL subregions were engaged in strongly lateralized coupling links, both posterior subregions showed more symmetric coupling patterns across hemispheres. Our collective results shed light on how under-appreciated hemispheric specialization in the IPL supports some of the most distinctive human mental capacities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human intelligence</kwd><kwd>systems neuroscience</kwd><kwd>lateralization</kwd><kwd>human cognition</kwd><kwd>language</kwd><kwd>attention</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BZ2/4-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bzdok</surname><given-names>Danilo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG068563A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bzdok</surname><given-names>Danilo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HA 6314/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartwigsen</surname><given-names>Gesa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BZ2/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bzdok</surname><given-names>Danilo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BZ2/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bzdok</surname><given-names>Danilo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HA 6314/4-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartwigsen</surname><given-names>Gesa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartwigsen</surname><given-names>Gesa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Data-driven and effective connectivity analyses reveal patterns of functional specialization, common mechanisms, and brain-wide interaction profiles within the human inferior parietal lobes for multiple functional domains.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many cognitive processes are realized by spatially distributed neural networks in the human brain. The inferior parietal lobe (IPL) is a heteromodal convergence zone of various brain networks that is central to realizing key cognitive operations across different levels of the neural processing hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kernbach et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seghier, 2013</xref>). These mental operations include lower level processes, such as spatial attention, as well as higher level processes that are distinctly elaborate in the human species, like semantic memory and modes of social exchange.</p><p>During primate evolution, the IPL has probably undergone remarkable expansion and functional reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Van Essen and Dierker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). The emergence of new areas inside the human IPL has been seriously considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mars et al., 2013</xref>), while its precise correspondence to nonhuman homologues is still debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seghier, 2013</xref>). The evolutionary trajectory of the IPL, as part of the recent cortical expansion in humans may bear important relationships to language ability, future planning, problem solving, and other complex mental operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dohmatob et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seghier, 2013</xref>) at which humans excel.</p><p>Diverse cognitive capacities have been linked to neural activity in the IPL. Among these, spatial attention is crucial in an ever-changing environment that requires rapid behavioral adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Corbetta et al., 2008</xref>). Systematic reviews have identified the right IPL as a key region for visuospatial attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>). Accordingly, neurological damage of the right IPL entails a clinical condition called hemi-neglect: the failure to orient visual attention to the contralesional side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Morrow and Ratcliff, 1998</xref>). In contrast to visuospatial attention, language function is widely accepted to lateralize to the (dominant) left hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Friederici, 2017</xref>). Tissue damage to the left temporo-parietal cortex has been reported, for decades, to cause impairments of semantic processing – key to reading and other elaborate forms of language comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hartwigsen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seghier, 2013</xref>). Semantic processing is instrumental for the human ability to contextualize and act according to the meaning of objects, events, and situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lambon Ralph and Patterson, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, semantic concepts are an integral component of numerous high-level cognitive operations, and are suspected to contribute to both social cognition and language from early development to adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Binder and Desai, 2011</xref>). Semantic processing is presumably closely intertwined with social cognition. This view receives support from previous reports on spatial overlap between both cognitive domains in the left IPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bzdok et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mars et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seghier, 2013</xref>). However, many human neuroimaging experiments have shown that advanced social cognitive functions, such as the capacity to infer others’ thoughts, beliefs, and behavioral dispositions, tend to engage the IPL in both hemispheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bzdok et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bzdok et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Substantiating these earlier hints at functional specialization of left versus right IPL, both regions also differ on the structural level. Architectural heterogeneity is indicated by cytoarchitectonic borders and gyral differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Caspers et al., 2008</xref>) as well as anatomical fiber bundle connections as quantified by fiber tractography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Caspers et al., 2011</xref>). Such heterogeneity in the IPL is not only found between individuals, but also between the left and right hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Toga and Thompson, 2003</xref>). This structural scaffold has the potential to support the unique neurocognitive properties of the left and right IPL.</p><p>Finally, the IPL harbors a major hub of the transmodal association network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braga et al., 2019</xref>) (‘default mode network’) and is densely connected with other cortical key areas for various functions. This is reflected in intimate functional interactions with several other large-scale brain networks as measured by intrinsic functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kernbach et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buckner and DiNicola, 2019</xref>). Despite indications in favor of lateralized functional specialization for human-defining cognitive domains, it remains unclear how the left and right IPL interact with distributed neural networks to realize advanced cognitive operations like social and semantic processes.</p><p>For these reasons, our study capitalized on cognitive neuroimaging experiments that tap on multiple functional domains. The combination of an arsenal of data-driven analysis techniques allowed zooming in on the hemisphere-specific functional specialization and brain-wide interaction profiles of the IPL and its segregated components. Our well-matched experimental paradigms prompted attentional reorienting, lexical decisions, and mental perspective taking – archetypical processes that exemplify the broader cognitive domains attention, semantics, and social cognition. The direct task comparison in the same sample of subjects enabled us to identify functional specialization and involvement of common mechanisms across attentional, semantic, and social realms of human cognition. Our unique characterization of IPL function, subspecialization, and interaction patterns provides key insights into cognitive operations that underlie elaborate forms of human interaction and communication.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IPL recruitment in different cognitive tasks: neural activity responses</title><p>We designed three different tasks to probe the three domains of interest.

By deploying a linear predictive pattern-learning algorithm, we solved the classification problem of assigning task-membership from single experimental trials based on the subregion-level neural activity changes. We evaluated the quality of the predictive model via leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, that is, by testing the fitted model on data from a subject that was not used during model building. Our results indicate that neural activity response patterns from our IPL subregions alone carried relevant information that was granular enough to allow for successful task classification significantly above chance. The logistic predictive model was cross-validated in a one-versus-rest scheme to attempt classifying trial brain scans from hold-out subjects. This machine learning pipeline resulted in an overall out-of-sample classification accuracy of 52.11% (chance: 33.33%). Note that this cross-validation scheme leads to conservative accuracy estimates, as the classifier is tested on brain activity information from subjects it has not seen before. Therefore, this approach provides a reliable estimate for the expected generalization in neuroimaging subjects scanned in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bzdok and Yeo, 2017</xref>).

In contrast, successful trial classification pertaining to lexical decisions was driven by neural activity increases in the left anterior subregion and neural activity decreases in the right anterior subregion, relative to the other two tasks.

The attention coupling topology was distinctively closer to the intrinsic connectivity than effective modulation patterns underlying both other domains. Both other tasks prompted more complex patterns of coupling modulations among IPL subregions. During lexical decisions, we found strong interhemispheric modulations, both facilitatory and inhibitory, between IPL subregions. Strikingly, task-related connectivity increases from the left anterior subregion to all other subregions were facilitatory. In contrast, the right anterior subregion had an inhibitory influence on all other subregions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, center). Perspective taking was mainly characterized by increased facilitatory influences between IPL subregions, with the right posterior subregion exerting a facilitatory influence on all other subregions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, right panel).

However, it remains open to question how some of the most basic and some of the most advanced cognitive processes converge and diverge in the IPL to realize human communication and interaction. To address this unresolved issue from different perspectives, we carried out a multi-method investigation that makes the functional specialization within the IPL apparent across attention, semantics, and social cognition tasks. By drawing insight from predictive, causal, and functional coupling analyses, we revealed a functional triple dissociation between the probed cognitive domains in the IPL at subregion-resolution. Based on neural activity estimates for the three cognitive domains, two distinctable subregions, one anterior and one posterior, were identified per IPL by a functional parcellation analysis. These subregions differed in their functional specialization across hemispheres and cognitive functions. The right anterior IPL subregion showed the strongest predictive relevance for attentional reorienting while the left anterior IPL subregion was strongest associated with semantic processing. In contrast, both left and right posterior IPL were robustly engaged when subjects adopted the mental perspectives of others. Functional specialization within the larger IPL regions also differed with respect to whole brain connectivity profiles for the different subregions. In general, we observed increased connectivity with diverse large-scale networks with increasing cognitive complexity across tasks. Global connectivity profiles for the anterior IPL subregions showed strong hemispheric lateralization and domain specificity. Functional connectivity profiles for the left and right posterior subregions were similar within each task and showed a higher degree of across-network coupling. Complementary effective connectivity profiles between specialized IPL subregions also differed across domains, supporting the notion of stronger coupling with increasing cognitive complexity. The degree of functional specialization of the IPL has been contemplated before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seghier, 2013</xref>). Yet, only in recent years, direct comparison of task experiments from different cognitive neuroscience domains, conventionally studied in isolation, has enjoyed increasing attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bzdok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bzdok et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Igelström et al., 2016</xref>). Our present study invigorates these beginning endeavors to transcend cognitive fields that are typically studied independently by separate research communities. We strive toward such cross-pollination across disparate literature streams.</p><p>To pursue this goal, we show that domain-specific functional signatures became apparent within the IPL when interrogating neural activity responses to tasks, derived predictive principles, as well as induced modulations of directed connectivity among IPL subregions and their functional coupling profiles with distributed brain regions. It is a key advantage that our findings were based on carefully controlled experimental paradigms that were administered to the same subject sample. Consequently, our study offers critical new elements of synthesis that pave the way for a more holistic perspective of IPL specialization.</p><p>First, the right IPL showed strong engagement in attentional processes in our study. Previous work has demonstrated a causal relation between tissue damage to the right IPL and left spatial neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Thiebaut de Schotten et al., 2014</xref>). Such neurological patients routinely fail to process cues in their contralesional visual field. Additionally, transient virtual lesions of the right, but not left IPL in the intact human brain were reported to cause performance declines during attentional reorienting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rushworth et al., 2001</xref>). Our findings corroborate and detail this previous research by carefully locating attentional processing and accompanying functional coupling shifts preferentially in the anterior subregion of the right IPL, compared to semantics and social cognition. Moreover, neural activity in the right anterior IPL subregion contained information that enabled successfully discriminating attentional reorienting from semantics and social cognition in our predictive modeling analyses. The new insights on right-hemispheric lateralization of attentional reorienting in the IPL were further refined by unique and simple effective connectivity modulations between IPL subregions. Additionally, our analyses of global functional coupling patterns revealed that the right anterior IPL subregion stands out by its connections to bilateral fronto-parietal and visual-sensory networks. Together, these findings speak to a specialized neuronal infrastructure harbored within the right anterior IPL, which is especially tuned to processing demands of attentional reorienting.</p><p>Second, our results isolate strong engagement of the anterior subregion of the left IPL for semantic processing. Deficits in various facets of semantic processes, such as in Wernicke’s aphasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Corbetta et al., 2015</xref>), have received evidence to be closely linked to left temporo-parietal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Corbetta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dronkers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Fridriksson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fridriksson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mirman and Graziano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schwartz et al., 2011</xref>) among other regions of the language network. Consistently, transient virtual lesions of the left IPL in healthy subjects were reported to disrupt semantic task performance during language comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hartwigsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sliwinska et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings from mapping neural responses during experimental tasks and identifying most predictive subregions reliably situated semantic processing in the left anterior IPL subregion. In addition, our effective connectivity analyses revealed a motif of rich modulatory influences among IPL subregions during semantic processing compared to our other two tasks. Specifically, we found increased task-induced facilitatory coupling from the left to the right IPL, with the left anterior IPL increasing its facilitatory influence on all other subregions during semantic processing. The strong facilitatory modulation exerted from the left to the right IPL was complemented by increased inhibition in the influence of the right on the left IPL and between right-hemispheric IPL subregions, potentially reflecting cognitive control processes (e.g. inhibition of alternative responses). This constellation of task-induced connectivity modulations is consistent with an interpretation of fine-grained interactions between left and right IPL subregions, rather than an exclusive role of the dominant left hemisphere in language processing (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hartwigsen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hartwigsen et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Third, adding to the right and left anterior IPL’s preferential involvement in attentional and semantic processing, respectively, our perspective taking task highlighted the posterior subregion of the IPL in both hemispheres as key regions for social cognition. This last piece of the functional triple dissociation in the IPL received support from our multivariate predictive algorithm approach, and was further annotated by our effective connectivity analyses. When subjects were concerned with inferring others’ mental states, both posterior IPL subregions increased their facilitatory influence on the bilateral anterior IPL subregions. The overall task-specific connectivity configuration derived for our social cognition task was predominantly facilitatory, pointing toward tight intra- and interhemispheric interactions during mental perspective taking. A posterior-to-anterior transition of the neurocognitive processes subserved by the IPL has been proposed in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bzdok et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>). These authors identified the posterior IPL as relatively higher associative and more domain-general processing hub, compared to the anterior IPL subregions. More broadly, the observed bilateral IPL engagement in widely employed social cognition experiments carefully reconciles previous virtual lesion evidence on the functional relevance of the overall right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Krall et al., 2016</xref>) or left (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Samson et al., 2004</xref>) IPL region for social cognitive functions.</p><p>Our compilation of findings provides a multi-perspective answer to the functional subspecialization of the IPL that spans lower and higher cognitive processes. Previous studies have hinted at or considered the possibility of several specialized subregions in the IPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bzdok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bzdok et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kernbach et al., 2018</xref>). While some authors have advocated a monolithic functional role of the IPL, others advertised the possibility of functionally distinct neuronal populations in the IPL, which may be challenging to disentangle using conventional contrast analysis in neuroimaging. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct a within-subject study across such a diversity of cognitive domains. Thereby, we demonstrate that cognitive processing in the IPL can probably not be accounted for by a single account of functional specialization.</p><p>Based on our examination of three functional domains with different experimental tasks, two robust clusters of neural responses within the IPL were identified, each of which probably overlaps with several cytoarchitectonic areas. The observed functional differentiation along the anterior and posterior IPL region is consistent with previous work in human volunteers, which featured such functional gradients based on resting-state connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mars et al., 2011</xref>), meta-analytic connectivity modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bzdok et al., 2016</xref>), and probabilistic fiber tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Caspers et al., 2011</xref>). More anterior portions of the IPL in the left hemisphere were reported to be more specifically associated with lower-level neural processing facets of language and social cognition. Instead, more posterior portions of the IPL were more specifically associated with advanced neural processing facets of both functional domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bzdok et al., 2016</xref>). This observation converges with the present constellation of findings. The relatively automatic lexical decision task in the present study was specifically associated with our left anterior IPL cluster, while the more complex perspective taking task was specifically associated with both posterior IPL subregions. Consistently, our functional connectivity analysis demonstrated relatively stronger across-network coupling with several cortical networks for our posterior IPL cluster.</p><p>A functional dissociation in the specialization of anterior and posterior IPL regions is further consistent with findings in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rozzi et al., 2008</xref>). Anterior parts of the monkey IPL are functionally specialized in somatosensory processes, whereas posterior parts preferentially process information based on visual input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kravitz et al., 2011</xref>). The posterior part is thought to be particularly involved in navigation, that is, processing one's position in space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Crowe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Crowe et al., 2005</xref>). This region is further associated with processing visual information in an external, object-centered manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Crowe et al., 2008</xref>) compared to an egocentric processing system which is used to control body movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chafee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Snyder et al., 1998</xref>). These findings argue for increased processing complexity from anterior to posterior regions in the macaque IPL. It is, however, important to bear in mind that the monkey-human homologue of IPL anatomy remains insufficiently understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mars et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seghier, 2013</xref>).</p><p>A high degree of abstraction from sensory information in the macaque IPL is further substantiated by the existence of intention- and goal-specific neurons rather than pure movement-coding neurons in the macaque IPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fogassi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rozzi et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, the IPL expanded in the primate lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Orban et al., 2004</xref>), while the existence of a homologue in non-human primate remains uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mars et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seghier, 2013</xref>). The expansion of the IPL may relate to cognitive capacities which are unique to humans, including the ability for speech and language processing as well as complex problem solving. We confirm and detail the previously reported gradient in the complexity of processing in the human IPL, which likely reflects fine-tuned functional differentiation for higher cognitive operations in humans.</p><p>Distinct functional specialization for human-defining cognitive operations in the IPL may explain differences in the connectivity profiles of the larger IPL regions between humans and macaques (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Oligschläger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). Uncertain homologies between humans and non-human primates are accompanied by complex structure-function relationships in the human IPL. As an overarching tendency, functional organization reproduces structural organization in unimodal areas in the human brain. In contrast, functional organization is significantly less determined by structure in heteromodal brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Vázquez-Rodríguez et al., 2019</xref>). Such laxer coupling of structure-function relations is observed in heteromodal association areas, including the IPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>). In general, functional specialization for higher cognitive operations may gradually decouple from the underlying structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Vázquez-Rodríguez et al., 2019</xref>). This notion is in line with the present results from our functional parcellation which does not simply follow cytoarchitectonic boundaries.</p><p>Our complementary set of findings indicate that task-specific effective connectivity modulations within and from different IPL subregions uniquely characterize each of the probed cognitive domains. For relatively low-level cognitive processes, here exemplified by attentional reorienting, task-specific coupling adjustment implicated a reduced set of coupling partners. In contrast, for more complex tasks, as exemplified by lexical decision and perspective taking, we found evidence for more elaborate coupling motifs, including dense intra- and inter-hemispheric facilitation and inhibition. Notably, there is a scarcity of existing studies directly devoted to investigating the left and right IPL in several different psychological tasks. The few existing studies committed to the effective connectivity of the IPL mainly focused on task-related connectivity changes between an IPL subregion and other areas of a specialized network for a single cognitive domain, typically in one hemisphere only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fukuda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hartwigsen et al., 2017</xref>). As such, our results usher toward a broader perspective. We complement the identification of intra- and inter-hemispheric IPL coupling patterns with strong domain-specific coupling profiles from IPL subregions to disparate cortical partners from large-scale brain networks.</p><p>Task-induced shifts in functional connectivity revealed key distinctions in interactions with major brain networks. Functional coupling profiles varied significantly between the three experimental tasks. Across domains, coupling partners were recruited from various large-scale brain networks. Our observation reinforces the notion of the IPL interfacing multiple neural systems and different levels of neurocognitive abstraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bzdok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seghier, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, we show that the task-specific coupling profiles between IPL subregions and a variety of cortical partners are anchored in the functional compartments uncovered in the IPL. The wider functional connectivity profiles for the anterior and posterior subregions further elucidate their features of underlying neural processing. As a tendency, functional connectivity profiles for the left and right posterior subregions were similar within each task. Yet, global connectivity profiles varied between the left and right anterior subregions of the IPL. The hemisphere-specific functional coupling for the anterior IPL subregions is broadly consistent with the common reports of right-hemispheric specialization of attentional reorienting processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rushworth et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schuwerk et al., 2017</xref>) and left-hemispheric specialization for semantic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braga et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hartwigsen et al., 2016</xref>). The rich connectivity profiles of the left and right posterior IPL subregions support the notion of bilateral IPL relevance for social cognitive processes, consolidating previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bzdok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bzdok et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Specifically, during attentional processing, the dedicated coupling partners of the right anterior IPL subregion included regions of the visual cortex and the dorsal attention network. During semantic processing, the left anterior subregion enhanced coupling with regions of the default mode and ventral attention network. Ultimately, during social cognition processing, the left and right posterior IPL subregions preferably coupled with the default mode network. The observed task-specific functional coupling of the posterior subregions with major brain networks was largely symmetric across both hemispheres.</p><p>To summarize our integrated experimental and computational study, we provide evidence for a functional triple dissociation in the human IPL, with task-specific functional specialization in distinct IPL subregions. This emerging view is supported by information carried in precise multivariate predictive signatures. Zooming into task-specific coupling motifs among IPL subregions, our effective connectivity analyses revealed that attentional reorienting mediated simpler coupling modulations, while semantic and social cognition were realized by more complex inter-hemispheric influences. Delineating task-evoked shifts in functional coupling patterns, in turn, uncovered that the posterior IPL subregions were linked to bilateral, symmetric recruitment of distributed cortical coupling partners, reminiscent of the default mode network. Conversely, the anterior IPL subregions were engaged in flexible and hemisphere-specific coupling patterns with brain-wide cortical partners. Together, our results shed new light on how currently under-appreciated activity and connectivity profiles within the left and right IPL support some of the most distinctive mental capacities in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subject sample</title><p>Twenty-two healthy, native German speakers (11 female, mean age 27.9 ± 3.28 years) participated in this neuroimaging investigation.

Neural activity estimates were summarized by averaging across all voxels belonging to a given IPL subregion. For each experimental target condition, Pearson’s correlation coefficients were computed between a given IPL subregion and each of the Schaefer-Yeo parcels. To rigorously assess whether connectivity links between a specific IPL subregion and cortical parcel were reliably weaker or stronger in one task relative to the other two, a pooled permutation-based baseline was computed across all three task conditions. Task-specific functional coupling shifts were determined by statistical significance testing based on a non-parametric permutation procedure using an empirical null-hypothesis distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bzdok et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bzdok and Yeo, 2017</xref>).

Following this fully data-driven pattern-learning tactic, for each of the three tasks, the analysis directly provided brain maps of task-dependent functional connectivity profiles for the IPL subregions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Task-specific effective connectivity modulation</title><p>After delineating (undirected) functional connectivity of IPL subregions with brain-wide cortical regions, we explicitly examined task-dependent causal interactions within the IPL. To achieve this goal, we analyzed the effective connectivity among the four IPL subregions by means of DCM. Since this approach centered on the directed interaction among the IPL subregions themselves, this analysis selectively included these four compartments. Effective connectivity was estimated with DCM 12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Friston et al., 2013</xref>) implemented in SPM 12. We defined and deployed subject-wise DCMs with one target node per subregion. Subject-specific node centers per subregion were based on the peak activity across all three tasks. We ensured similar contribution of all tasks by task-wise normalization of neural activity estimates to define the subject-wise DCM nodes. The first eigenvariate from the timeseries of voxels in an 8 mm sphere around this target was extracted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zeidman et al., 2019</xref>). We exclusively included data from voxels within the upper quartile of estimated neural activity to ensure functional relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Seghier and Friston, 2013</xref>) and assured that all voxels fell into the respective IPL subregion. A fully connected DCM (full model) estimated all possible connections among the four IPL subregions (including self-connections) and directions of modulatory influences. The trial onsets of the three target conditions were modeled as direct inputs to the nodes and as modulatory inputs to the inter-regional connections. Neural activity stemming from incorrect trials and control conditions was regressed out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zeidman et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>After model estimation, subject-wise full models were optimized for the intrinsic connections (A matrix) and modulatory inputs (B matrix) at the group level using the Bayesian model selection procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Friston and Penny, 2011</xref>). We decided against optimization of the input parameters (C matrix), as we selectively modeled nodes in high-order association cortex. As such, there was no obvious scientific hypothesis regarding the input to the system. The optimized, reduced model represented fixed-effects at the group level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rosa et al., 2012</xref>). As a second-level random-effects analysis, we conducted a non-parametric permutation test on subject-wise parameters of the optimal reduced model. This layer of analysis identified those model parameters that varied significantly between tasks. Specifically, for each task, the parameter differences of the remaining two tasks were randomly shuffled 10,000 times to obtain and test against an empirical distribution for the null hypothesis (i.e., no differences between task-dependent effective connectivity). Statistical significance was determined based on the absolute parameter difference higher than 99.9% of the baseline difference, corresponding to α ≤ 0.01.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (BZ2/4-1, BZ2/3-1, and BZ2/2-1 to DB and HA6314/3-1 and HA6314/4-1 to GH), the NVIDIA Corporation (donation of a Titan Xp graphics card to GH), and National Institutes of Health (NIH grant R01AG068563A to DB).

Using both task and connectivity fMRI, the authors use data-driven analyses to argue for a functional parcellation of the human inferior parietal lobule into at least two distinct subregions. The paper provides a strong argument for understanding the broad role of the posterior parietal across tasks, and points at the flexibility of its functional response in supporting those roles.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Hemispheric specialization within the inferior parietal lobe across cognitive domains&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Chris Baker as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Overall the reviewers felt that the manuscript had a fair amount of promise but raised some issues about the specific tasks used and some details of the analysis. One reviewer in particular felt that the manuscript should be reworked around the functional connectivity results, which would strengthen the manuscript. I tend to agree with this assessment, particularly as concerns the lateralization framing which is not very well explored by these tasks. The following items will need to addressed in order for the paper to move forward.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Remove or amend the analysis presented in Figure 3B. If the concern about circularity is unjustified please explain.</p><p>2) Please clarify whether the held out data in the analyses came from participants that did not contribute to model creation. If not, please justify why not.</p><p>3) Some clarification of the role of the motor commands in the tasks and how they were controlled or may have contributed to the results is necessary.</p><p>4) The focus on lateralization in the framing does not seem to be borne out in the data and results that follow. Consider changing the framing to focus on the parcellation.</p><p>5) A discussion of the non-human primate literature and its relationship to the findings presented here should be added. This should also include a discussion of why the current results suggest a less differentiated area than suggested by the anatomy or primate work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript lays out a series of fMRI investigations and analyses centered on examining the response of the IPL during three different tasks (attention, semantics, social cognition). The analyses are largely data-driven and examine functional response and connectivity, to make the argument for a functional parcellation of the IPL into at least two distinct subregions. The manuscript is well-written and the analyses well described. There are some concerns about the analyses that dampen enthusiasm slightly and a lack of consideration of the associated literature in non-human primates, but these problems seem imminently correctable.</p><p>The analyses begin with a data-driven cluster analysis across an anatomically constrained IPL ROI, searching for cluster solutions that efficiently parcellate IPL on the basis of the response of voxels across the three tasks. This analysis is fine, but does constrain the average activity in the identified clusters to differ across the tasks. That makes the univariate activation in Figure 3B a bit circular and hard to interpret. Either the error bars should be removed and a note added that the univariate activity is purely descriptive or the univariate data should be displayed from a slice of the data that did not contribute to the derivation of the clusters. The strongest version of this analysis would hold out entire participants.</p><p>The predictive coding analysis is potentially informative but the details were a bit unclear. In the one versus rest analysis the strongest test would be to build the model on the data from n-1 participants and then test it on the trials of the held-out participant. If this was not done, some justification for not doing it would be in order.</p><p>Finally, the authors should also consider integrating some of the non-human primate literature as it only strengthens their case. In the human literature the IPL has proved a tough nut to crack, but the single unit physiology has revealed strong differences in the homologous areas of macaque, some of which directly map onto the division argued for here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper, Numssen and co-workers focus on the functional differences between hemispheres to investigate the &quot;domain-role&quot; of IPL in different type of mental processes. They employ multivariate pattern-learning algorithms to assess the specific involvement of two IPL subregions in three tasks: an attentional task (Attention), a semantic task (Semantics) and a social task (Social cognition). The authors describe how, when involved in different tasks, each right and left IPL subregion recruits a different pattern of connected areas.</p><p>The employed tasks are &quot;well established&quot;, and the results confirm previous findings. However, the novelty of the paper lies in the fact that the authors use these results as a tool to observe IPL activity when involved in different domains of cognition.</p><p>The methodology is sound, well explained in the Materials and methods section, the analyses are appropriate, and the results clear and well explained in the text and in graphic format.</p><p>However, a solid experimental design is required to provide strong results. To the reviewer's view, the employed design can provide interesting results about functional connectivity, but not about the functional role of IPL in the investigated functions.</p><p>I think the study would be correct and much more interesting if only based on functional connectivity data. Note that rewriting the paper accordingly would lead to a thorough discussion about how anatomical circuits are differently recruited based on different cognitive demands and about the variable role of cortical regions in functional tasks. This issue is neglected in the present Discussion, and this concept is in disagreement with the main results, suggesting (probably beyond the intention of the authors) that different part of the right and left IPL are the areas responsible for the studied functions.</p><p>1) the 3 chosen tasks explore functions that are widespread in the brain, and are not specifically aimed at investigating IPL. The results (see. e.g. Figure 1) confirm this idea, but the authors specifically focus on IPL. This seems a rather arbitrary and not justified choice. If they want to explore the lateralization issue, they should consider the whole set of involved areas or use tasks showing all their maximal activation in IPL.</p><p>2) The authors aims to study lateralization using an attentional task, considering the violation of a prevision (invalid&gt;valid), a linguistic task, looking for an activation related to word identification (word&gt;pseudoword) and a social task, considering correct prospective taking (false belief&gt;true belief), but they do not consider that in all cases a movement (key press) is required. It is well known that IPL is a key area also for creating motor commands and guiding movements. Accordingly, the lateralization bias observed could be due more to the unbalance between effectors while issuing the motor command, than to a different involvement of IPL regions in the specific tasks functions.</p><p>3) Like point 2, the position of keys is also crucial if the authors want to explore lateralization. This is especially important if one consider that IPL plays a major role in spatial attention (e.g. Neglect syndrome). In the Materials and methods, the authors simply say &quot;Button assignments were randomized across subjects and kept identical across sessions&quot;, this should be explained in more detail.</p><p>4) The authors show to know well the anatomical complexity of IPL, however their results are referred to two large-multiareal-regions. This seems to the reader at odds with all the description related to Figure 2. If they don't find any more subtle distinction within these 2 macro-regions, they should at least discuss this discrepancy.</p><p>5) The part about Task-specific network connectivity is indeed very interesting, I would suggest to the authors to focus exclusively on this part. (Note that the results of this part seems to confirm that only the linguistic task is able to show a clear lateralization.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63591.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Remove or amend the analysis presented in Figure 3B.

For the linear predictive model (presented in the Results section, subsection “Task-predictive information of the IPL subregions”), we indeed used a one-versus-rest approach to build the model from all but one (n-1) subjects and test it on the held out subject. This building-and-testing sequence was repeated 22 times, that is, one fitted predictive model was applied for each specific subject once to gauge prediction performance. Thereby, data from each subject was used exactly once for the purpose of model evaluation, but never for a model that was fitted with data from this particular subject.

This setup establishes a consistent response pattern requiring one button press at the end of each trial.

To this end, we specified a new set of GLMs that was based on the original one used for the univariate analysis and functional parcellation (GLM<sub>cond</sub>). Here, we added one regressor that modeled the reaction times for all tasks and conditions. Accordingly, we refer to this newly introduced set of GLMs as GLM<sub>cond+RT</sub>. This reaction time regressor captured neural activity responses linked to potential motor responses, which were not of primary interest in our study. The task-dependent BOLD responses from GLM<sub>cond+RT</sub> (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) closely resemble the results from the original analysis (Figure 1). We also reiterated the functional parcellation analyses based on these results from the alternative model. A similar parcellation solution with comparable certainty was selected by this approach (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). Consequently, we are confident that our results are valid and the derived interpretations justified.</p><p>Please see our reply to reviewer 2, comment 2 for specific results and respective changes in the manuscript.

Consider changing the framing to focus on the parcellation.</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful for the constructive feedback, which helped us to realize that our previous version of the manuscript put undue emphasis on the lateralization aspect. We have considerably rewritten several parts of our manuscript, including the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion and also changed the title of our paper to address this concern. Thereby, we have toned down the emphasis in our conclusions on lateralization and instead stress the relevance of our findings for a better understanding of the neural specialization of cognitive functions. We believe that the revised conclusions are better supported by our data. For instance, in the Discussion section, we now summarize our main findings as follows:</p><p>“To address this unresolved issue from different perspectives, we carried out a multi-method investigation that makes the functional specialization within the IPL apparent across attention, semantics, and social cognition tasks. […] Complementary effective connectivity profiles between specialized IPL subregions also differed across domains, supporting the notion of stronger coupling with increasing cognitive complexity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A discussion of the non-human primate literature and its relationship to the findings presented here should be added. This should also include a discussion of why the current results suggest a less differentiated area than suggested by the anatomy or primate work.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much welcomed this reviewer suggestion. We have therefore added several new paragraphs to the Discussion section that link the present results to the non-human primate literature on the IPL. We also elaborate on the parcellation results and their potential relationship with previous findings using cytoarchitectonic parcellation approaches in the Discussion.</p><p>Motivated by previous work (e.g. Bzdok et al., 2016; Vázquez-Rodríguez et al., 2019), we expected differences in the number of observable subregions in the IPL between known (task-independent) cytoarchitectonic parcellations and a task-dependent functional segregation based on our specific cognitive experiments. For instance, Vázquez-Rodríguez et al., 2019, show that the general structure-function relationship in the human brain is strong in primary sensory and motor regions but significantly less clear-cut for heteromodal areas like the parietal area.</p><p>Please also see our reply to reviewer 2, comment 4 for more details on the functional parcellation.</p><p>The following passages have been added to the Discussion:</p><p>“Based on our examination of three functional domains with different experimental tasks, two robust clusters of neural responses within the IPL were identified, each of which probably overlaps with several cytoarchitectonic areas.

As stated in the reply to comment 4 of the Essential revisions above, we have rewritten parts of the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion to address this concern.</p><p>The focus of our study on the human IPL was motivated by the suggested key contribution of this heteromodal association area across numerous cognitive domains (e.g. Bzdok et al., 2016; Seghier, 2012). We acknowledge that many, if not all, (cognitive) functions are embedded in large-scale networks in the human brain. Our main interest was to explore task-specific contributions of different IPL subregions and elucidate their interactions with whole-brain networks. We would argue that our focus on three prototypical cognitive domains in the human brain is well suited to address this question. Based on the previous literature, we think that there is ample evidence for a strong IPL contribution to the three selected domains, which is supported by the univariate analyses, the parcellation approach, and the connectivity analyses. We hope that the motivation for the choice of our tasks, approaches, and region-of-interest is more convincing now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors aims to study lateralization using an attentional task, considering the violation of a prevision (invalid&gt;valid), a linguistic task, looking for an activation related to word identification (word&gt;pseudoword) and a social task, considering correct prospective taking (false belief&gt;true belief), but they do not consider that in all cases a movement (key press) is required. It is well known that IPL is a key area also for creating motor commands and guiding movements. Accordingly, the lateralization bias observed could be due more to the unbalance between effectors while issuing the motor command, than to a different involvement of IPL regions in the specific tasks functions.</p></disp-quote><p>The three experimental tasks were chosen to be as similar as possible in terms of the presented stimulus material, while differing in the required specific cognitive task set (attention, semantics, or social cognition). This setup establishes a consistent response pattern requiring one button press at the end of each trial. During each task one target condition (semantic: <italic>word</italic> condition; attention: <italic>invalid</italic> condition; social cognition: <italic>false belief</italic> condition) was paired with one closely matched control condition (<italic>pseudoword</italic>, <italic>valid</italic>, <italic>true belief</italic>).</p><p>To address a potential imbalance in the subjects’ (preparatory) motor responses in the IPL between the three tasks, we carried out an additional univariate SPM analysis. To this end, we specified a new set of GLMs that was based on the original one used for the univariate analysis and functional parcellation (GLM<sub>cond</sub>). Here, we added one regressor that modeled the reaction times for all tasks and conditions. Accordingly, we refer to this newly introduced set of GLMs as GLM<sub>cond+RT</sub>. This reaction time regressor captured neural activity responses linked to potential motor responses, which were not of primary scientific interest in our study. The task-dependent BOLD responses from GLM<sub>cond+RT</sub> (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) closely resembled the results from the original analysis (Figure 1). We also reiterated the functional parcellation analyses based on these results from the alternative model. A similar parcellation solution with comparable certainty was selected by this approach (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). Consequently, we are confident that our results are valid and the derived interpretations justified. Note that we have uploaded the unthresholded whole-brain statistical maps from both models to neurovault.org (https://neurovault.org/collections/9350/) for the sake of transparency and re-use by other investigators.</p><p>Results subsection “Functional parcellation of the IPL in two subregions”: “To investigate the possible influence of general motor responses within the IPL on our results, we estimated a third set of GLMs (GLM<sub>cond+RT</sub>), which was based on the initial GLM<sub>cond</sub> with one additional regressor that modeled reaction times for all three tasks. […] The cluster similarity across solutions is illustrated in Figure 3—figure supplement 3.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Like point 2, the position of keys is also crucial if the authors want to explore lateralization. This is especially important if one consider that IPL plays a major role in spatial attention (e.g. Neglect syndrome). In the Materials and methods, the authors simply say &quot;Button assignments were randomized across subjects and kept identical across sessions&quot;, this should be explained in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. When subjects were prepared for MR scanning, the two-finger button response box was fixated at their right thigh to assure a stable and comfortable position. We deliberately chose to keep the response hand constant across subjects to avoid potential differences between the dominant and non-dominant hand as all subjects were right-handed. The button assignments for the semantic task (<italic>word</italic> or <italic>pseudoword</italic>) and the social cognition task (<italic>false belief</italic> or <italic>true belief</italic>) were pseudo-randomized across subjects. For each subject, the button assignments were kept constant across the three experimental sessions.</p><p>We updated the task description to provide detailed information on the response button configuration as follows:</p><p>Materials and methods subsection “Tasks”:</p><p>“In all three tasks, subjects responded to a binary choice after each trial with a single button press on a two-finger response box with their right hand. […] The button box was fixated on the subject’s right thigh to assure a comfortable, natural, and stable lying position in the MR scanner.“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors show to know well the anatomical complexity of IPL, however their results are referred to two large-multiareal-regions. This seems to the reader at odds with all the description related to Figure 2. If they don't find any more subtle distinction within these 2 macro-regions, they should at least discuss this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for alerting us to this issue. From a methodological perspective, we would argue that a parcellation strongly depends on the selected method and the input data. The data driven clustering (and cluster number determination) analysis was based on functional activity for the three examined tasks. Therefore, only subregions that significantly differ in their response profile for the domains attention, semantics, and social cognition could be identified. This analysis was carried out with the repeated use of NBClust, a software package that implements 25 metrics to assess the quality of clustering solutions, to prevent possible biases due to the selection of a single cluster metric and its specific criterion. Thereby, we explicitly tested the validity of parcellations of up to seven clusters per IPL to allow for more fine-grained solutions.</p><p>We wish to note that a direct structure-to-function mapping is usually not reported in heteromodal association areas such as the human IPL. This contrasts with primary somatomotor areas in which the functional organization reproduces the underlying structural organization more closely (Vázquez-Rodríguez et al., 2019).</p><p>We have updated the Discussion of the manuscript to include this argumentation as follows:</p><p>“Uncertain homologies between humans and non-human primates are accompanied by complex structure-function relationships in the human IPL. […] This notion is in line with the present results from our functional parcellation which does not simply follow cytoarchitectonic boundaries.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The part about Task-specific network connectivity is indeed very interesting, I would suggest to the authors to focus exclusively on this part. (Note that the results of this part seems to confirm that only the linguistic task is able to show a clear lateralization.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the task-specific network interactions provide new insight into the functional specialization of different IPL subregions across three key cognitive domains. Please note that the connectivity analysis directly builds on the parcellation results. We think that the different analyses are complementary and contribute to a better understanding of the functional specialization of different IPL subregions. First, a parcellation was performed to distinguish different subregions based on their predictive relevance for each of the three cognitive domains. The functional whole-brain connectivity analyses show that the different domains also differ with respect to their whole brain connectivity patterns. Moreover, these analyses also show a general difference in laterality between anterior and posterior IPL subregions. Finally, the effective connectivity analyses zoom into the functional interactions between IPL subregions and provide further evidence for an increase in connectivity with increasing task complexity. As noted above, we have toned down the laterality argument and rephrased parts of the Discussion to emphasize the differences in functional specialization of different IPL subregions and their connectivity profiles.</p></body></sub-article></article>
