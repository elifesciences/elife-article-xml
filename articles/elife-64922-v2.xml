phosphatase, important in clathrin uncoating during endocytosis of presynaptic vesicles. It was identified as a potential drug target for Alzheimer’s disease, Down syndrome, and TBC1D24-associated epilepsy, while also loss-of-function mutations in Synj1 are associated with epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. Despite its involvement in a range of disorders, structural, and detailed mechanistic information regarding the enzyme is lacking. Here, we report the crystal structure of the 5-phosphatase domain of Synj1. Moreover, we also present a structure of this domain bound to the substrate diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, providing the first image of a 5-phosphatase with a trapped substrate in its active site. Together with an analysis of the contribution of the different inositide phosphate groups to catalysis, these structures provide new insights in the Synj1 mechanism. Finally, we analysed the effect of three clinical missense mutations (Y793C, R800C, Y849C) on catalysis, unveiling the molecular mechanisms underlying Synj1-associated disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase</kwd><kwd>catalytic mechanism</kwd><kwd>enzyme-substrate complex</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>phosphoinositide</kwd><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1S04918N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paesmans</surname><given-names>Jone</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1S09120N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Ella</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0D3317N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verstreken</surname><given-names>Patrik</given-names></name><name><surname>Versées</surname><given-names>Wim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11D4621N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deckers</surname><given-names>Babette</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004418</institution-id><institution>Vrije Universiteit Brussel</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Research Program Financing - SRP50</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Versées</surname><given-names>Wim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and biochemical data suggest a mechanism for the Synaptojanin1-catalysed reaction and the role of mutations in the onset of associated neurological diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phosphoinositides (PIPs) are membrane lipids that, together with their corresponding soluble inositol phosphates (IPs), regulate various cellular processes, including membrane recruitment of proteins, actin polymerization, synaptic vesicle trafficking and exo- and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balla, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ueda, 2014</xref>).

Based on their substrate specificity, the mammalian 5PPases can be further subdivided into four groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Majerus et al., 1999</xref>): the type I 5PPase INPP5A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Speed et al., 1996</xref>), the type II 5PPases OCRL, INPP5B, INPP5J (or PIPP), SKIP, Synaptojanin1 (Synj1) and Synaptojanin 2 (Synj2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lowe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mochizuki and Takenawa, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ijuin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McPherson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nemoto et al., 1997</xref>), the type III 5PPases, SHIP1 and SHIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rohrschneider et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Le Coq et al., 2017</xref>), and the type IV 5PPase INPP5E (or Pharbin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asano et al., 1999</xref>). Among the type II 5PPases, the closely related Synj1 and Synj2 contain a similar domain arrangement, with in addition to the central 5PPase domain, an N-terminal suppressor of actin 1 (SAC1)-like domain and a C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD). As such, Synj1 and Synj2 are unique in having two phosphatase activities, where the 5PPase domains can hydrolyse PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, IP<sub>3, </sub>and IP<sub>4</sub>, while the SAC1-like domain can degrade PI(3)P, PI(4)P, and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu and Mao, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cestra et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Whisstock et al., 2002</xref>). Both Synaptojanin proteins are implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, where Synj2 is involved in the early stages of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rusk et al., 2003</xref>), while the brain-specific 145 kDa splice isoform of Synj1 promotes clathrin uncoating during the late stages of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perera et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramjaun and McPherson, 1996</xref>). In agreement with this role, knock-out studies of Synj1 in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cremona et al., 1999</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Verstreken et al., 2003</xref>) show endocytic defects at the neuronal synapses, indicating that Synj1 plays a critical role in synaptic function. This key function at the synapse is further illustrated by the implication of Synj1 in several diseases. Brain autopsy of Down syndrome (DS) patients revealed an excessive expression of the Synj1 protein, that is encoded on the triplicated chromosome 21, and it was shown that the overexpression of Synj1 leads to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> deficiency and learning deficits in Down syndrome model mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Voronov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arai et al., 2002</xref>). Elevated levels of Synj1 are also found in individuals showing a high risk for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miranda et al., 2018</xref>). Based on these findings, Synj1 has been proposed as a potential attractive two-faced target for novel DS and AD treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cossec et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, inhibition of the 5-phosphatase activity of Synj1 has also been found to hold promise toward drug development for TBC1D24-associated epilepsy and DOORS syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lüthy et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, recessive loss-of-function mutations in Synj1 are associated with either early-onset atypical parkinsonism or refractory epileptic seizures with severe progressive neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taghavi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouhouche et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Domain organization of the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase family (5PPases).</title><p>The domain organization of the ten human 5PPases, subdivided in four groups (type I–IV), is shown schematically.

In addition, an unpublished structure of INPP5E has been deposited in the protein data bank (PDB 2XSW). So far no experimentally determined structure is available for the 5PPase domain of either Synj1 or Synj2, although the very first 5PPase structure ever to be determined was the one of a Synaptojanin homolog of the yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsujishita et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the structural data of the 5PPase domains in their apo form, crystal structures in complex with reaction products and inhibitors, together with detailed studies on the structurally and mechanistically related Apurinic/Apyrimidinic endonucleases (APE), have yielded some insights in the catalytic mechanism of the hydrolysis reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Whisstock et al., 2000</xref>). Indeed, structural and sequence comparison revealed similarities in the active site architecture of the 5PPases and APE1, a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzyme that catalyses the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond on the 5’ side of the abasic site in DNA using a conserved aspartate as catalytic base and a conserved histidine that presumably stabilizes the phosphorane transition state. Moreover, leaving group activation has been proposed to occur via a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound water molecule, although the exact role of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ion in the catalytic mechanism of 5PPases has not been fully established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mills et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboelnga and Wetmore, 2019</xref>).

However, subsequent structures of the catalytic domain of INPP5B in complex with diC8-PI(4)P and diC8-PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> revealed another orientation of these reaction products, suggesting that the placement of the ligand in the SPSynj structure does not correspond to the genuine position of the product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>). Further elucidation of the complete hydrolysis mechanism is however hampered by the lack of 5PPase structures in complex with reaction substrates showing directly the exact placement of the 5-phosphate group in the active site.</p><p>In this study we report the first structure of the catalytic 5PPase domain of human Synj1 by using Nanobody-aided crystallography. Moreover, we were able, for the first time, to solve a structure of a 5PPase domain with the substrate diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> trapped in its active site, revealing the placement of, and the interactions with, the 5-phosphate group. In combination with a detailed kinetic analysis of the hydrolysis reaction catalysed by the Synj1 5PPase domain, these structures provide additional insights in the catalytic mechanism.

Various Synj1<sub>528–873</sub>-Nb complexes were used to set-up crystallization screens and well diffracting crystals belonging to space group C121 were obtained for the complex between Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> and Nb13015 (hereafter called Nb15).</p><p>The first dataset was collected and refined at 2.3 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The structure was solved using molecular replacement, revealing three Nb15-Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> complexes in each asymmetric unit (AU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Since Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> consistently behaves as a monomer in solution, as assessed through gel filtration, it can be assumed that the three complexes in the AU are merely interacting via crystallographic contacts. Despite being soaked overnight with IP<sub>6</sub> (inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate), no density accounting for this molecule was observed in the active site, and therefore we will further refer to this structure as an apo-structure. However, several blobs of density in the structure could be modelled as orthophosphates, suggesting that these result from hydrolysis of IP<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, all three Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> molecules contain density close to N543 and E591, which corresponds to the position of a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ion in other 5PPase structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>), and which was therefore also here modelled as Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). While these Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ions were modelled at a very similar position as in the structure of INPP5B in complex with the product diC8-PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>), it must be noted that the distances to residues N543 and E591 are rather long.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table

Analysis of the electron density in the active sites of the three molecules in the asymmetric unit revealed that one active site (corresponding to chain A) contains unambiguous density for the diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> substrate including the scissile 5-phosphate group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), thus showing that we were able to trap the non-hydrolysed substrate by using a strategy of short substrate soaking followed by flash freezing and assisted by the slower substrate turnover under the conditions used for crystallization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s1sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). The other two Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> active sites (corresponding to chain C and E) contain weaker and discontinuous electron density, probably due to substrate already being hydrolysed to a larger extent because of subtle differences in kinetics of substrate access/hydrolysis and product release in these sites depending on the local environment of the crystal packing. The electron density in these active sites was modelled as phosphate ions, with three phosphates in chain C at positions corresponding to the 1-, 4-, and 5-phosphates of diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, while in chain E only a single phosphate could be modelled between the expected position of the phosphates present on the 4- and 5-position of the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Analysis of the density revealed that two out of three Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> molecules (chain A and C) also show density close to residues N543 and E591, where Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ions were modelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

This phosphate is oriented towards two regions previously described to correspond to conserved sequence motifs characteristic for the 5PPase family: WXG<bold>D</bold>X<bold>N</bold>(Y/F)<bold>R</bold> (residues 727–734) and P(A/S)W(C/T)<bold>D</bold>R(I/V)L (residues 802–809) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jefferson and Majerus, 1996</xref>), while it also interacts with a number of other highly conserved active site residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). The first oxygen of 5 P (O<sub>PH</sub>) is within hydrogen bonding distance of N732 (3.0 Å), while it is also appropriately oriented to form a weak hydrogen bond or salt bridge with H689 (3.6 Å). The second oxygen of 5 P (O<sub>PF</sub>) can form a (weak) salt bridge or hydrogen bond with H859 (3.3 Å). The O<sub>PF</sub> oxygen is also oriented towards the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ion, although, in contrast to what was previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>), the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-O<sub>PF</sub> distance of 4.7 Å is too long to account for a direct metal coordination interaction. The third oxygen of 5 P (O<sub>PG</sub>) potentially forms a weak hydrogen bond with Y784 (3.5 Å) and an electrostatic interaction with R734 (3.5 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). D730 and N732 form a pair of conserved residues belonging to one of the conserved sequence motifs of the 5PPase family. It has previously been shown that D730 corresponds to the general base required to activate a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on P<sub>5</sub>. Analysis of the electron density shows such a water molecule, located at 3.1 Å from D730 and 3.5 Å from the P<sub>5</sub>-atom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Additionally, the structure also reveals a hydrogen bond between the water molecule and N732 (2.6 Å), probably required for proper orientation of the water molecule for nucleophilic attack. This thus shows a direct role of the D730/N732 pair in activation of the nucleophilic water.</p><p>The phosphate on position 4 (4 P) forms extensive interactions with the enzyme through the conserved P4-interacting-motif (P4IM), containing Y784, K798, and R800 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mills et al., 2012</xref>). These multiple binding interactions explain the preference of Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> and most other 5PPases for substrates phosphorylated on the 4-position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmid et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ion is located at a distance of 3.6 Å from the O<sub>9P</sub>-atom of the 4 P group. It is also noteworthy that a non-proline <italic>cis</italic> peptide bond is found between active site residues Y784 and K785, belonging to the P4IM region. This <italic>cis</italic> peptide bond is also conserved in the structure of OCRL, INPP5B, SHIP2, and INPP5E, and, while it was not modelled as such in the SPSynj structure, the density can account for a <italic>cis</italic> peptide in that latter structure. While the occurrence of such bonds is mostly of functional importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jabs et al., 1999</xref>), the exact relevance to the 5PPase mechanism is not entirely clear as it is found both in the apo and ligand-bound structures.</p><p>In contrast to the 4 P and 5 P groups, the phosphate on position 3 (3 P) is solvent exposed and does not form any interaction with enzyme residues. The only direct contacts between Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> and the inositol group of diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> are mediated by a weak Van der Waals interaction (3.8 Å) between the β-carbon of A692 and the C<sub>5</sub> atom of the inositol ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Additionally, K669 is located at 2.8 Å from the OH-group on position 6 of the inositol ring, forming a hydrogen bond. Besides the inositol ring, also the phosphate on position 1 (1 P) is commonly used by all 5PPases for substrate recognition and binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). In our structure, the 1 P of diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> forms strong interactions with the side chains of N668 (2.2 Å) and K669 (2.7 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Finally, the lipid anchors of diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> are interacting with two hydrophobic regions, as also described for other 5PPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mills et al., 2012</xref>). The first region is formed by residues V593 to T606 and has been called lipid chain 1 recognition motif (LC1R), while the second region is formed by residues T660 to N668 and has been called lipid chain 2 recognition motif (LC2R) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Kinetic analysis of the Synj1 5-phosphatase activity</title><p>A detailed and systematic kinetic analysis of the contribution of the different phosphate groups of the phosphoinositide substrate to Synj1 catalysis is currently lacking.

While this trend is similar to what has been previously reported based on activity measurements at a single substrate concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmid et al., 2004</xref>), it differs from the substrate preference profile of SPSynj where the following profile was found: IP<sub>3</sub> ≈ diC4-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> &gt; diC4-PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> ≈ diC4-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chi et al., 2004</xref>). This indicates that the yeast homolog is not an ideal model system to study the mechanism of human Synj1.</p><p>The contribution of the acyl chains to catalysis can be deduced by comparing the kinetic parameters of diC8-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and its corresponding head group IP<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This comparison shows that diC8-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> has a nearly 13-fold higher k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> value than IP<sub>3</sub>, due to a 2.5-fold higher affinity (lower K<sub>M</sub>), but mainly due to the 5-fold higher turnover rate (k<sub>cat</sub>), suggesting that the acyl chains are required to properly orient the head group in the active site for catalysis.</p><p>The contribution of the 4 P group to substrate binding and turnover can be obtained by comparing either diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> with diC8-PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> or diC8-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> with diC8-PI(5)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Overall, this analysis for the k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> value reveals a very large contribution of the 4 P group to Synj1 activity by more than 3 orders of magnitude (corresponding to ΔΔG<sub>overall</sub> = 4.3–4.7 kcal/mol). Interestingly, comparing the individual kinetic constants (k<sub>cat</sub> and K<sub>M</sub>) of diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and diC8-PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> reveals that this overall contribution is mainly attributed to the catalytic turnover (k<sub>cat</sub>), with the 4 P group contributing a factor 340 to catalysis (corresponding to ΔΔG<sub>catalysis</sub> = 3.5 kcal/mol). In contrast, the 4 P group only contributes relatively little to ligand binding, with removal of the 4 P group leading to a 7-fold increase in the K<sub>M</sub> value (corresponding to ΔΔG<sub>binding</sub> = 1.2 kcal/mol). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time it is unequivocally shown that the phosphoinositide 4 P group directly contributes to substrate turnover by the Synj1 5PPase domain, having important consequences for its catalytic mechanism (see Discussion).</p><p>On the other hand, comparing diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> with diC8-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> shows an overall small effect of the 3 P group on the catalytic parameters, which corresponds to the solvent-exposed 3 P group in our structure.</p><p>Finally, the contribution of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ion to catalysis was quantified by comparing the catalytic parameters for diC8-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> between Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Removal of Mg<sup>2+</sup> severely impacted activity with a decrease in the specificity constant (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>) by 4 orders of magnitude (ΔΔG<sub>overall</sub> = 5.4 kcal/mol). This decrease in activity is mainly caused by a decrease in substrate turnover (1400-fold decrease in k<sub>cat</sub>, ΔΔG = 4.3 kcal/mol) rather than an effect on substrate binding (7.5-fold increase in K<sub>M</sub>, ΔΔG<sub>binding</sub> = 1.2 kcal/mol). The observed contribution of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ion mainly to catalysis rather than substrate binding is in good agreement with the structure of the enzyme-substrate-complex. In this structure, the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ion is located at a relatively large distance from the substrate’s 4 P group (3.6 Å), accounting for a relatively weak binding interaction. On the other hand, its contribution to catalysis can be accounted for by either a role in water-mediated leaving group activation and/or by a stabilizing interaction with the phosphorane transition state (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Impact of missense disease mutations on the Synj1 5-phosphatase activity</title><p>Missense and nonsense mutations in the 5PPase domain of Synj1 have been associated with several neurological disorders, such as early-onset seizures and early-onset atypical Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taghavi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouhouche et al., 2017</xref>). At the moment of writing this manuscript, three homozygous point variants in the 5PPase domain of Synj1 had been described in patients: the Y793C mutation leading to typical levodopa-responsive parkinsonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xie et al., 2019</xref>), the R800C mutation leading to asymmetric parkinsonism and seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taghavi et al., 2018</xref>), and the Y849C mutation leading to early-onset treatment-resistant seizures and progressive neurological decline (numbering based on Synaptojanin1-145 isoform 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To aid in rationalizing the contribution of these mutations in the onset of disease, their impact on the kinetic parameters for different substrates was determined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The Y793 residue is present on the large loop that contains the P4IM. Although its side chain is pointing away from the active site, it is located in between active site residues Y784 and K785 on the one hand and K798 and R800 on the other hand, all located in the P4IM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). Y793 could potentially stabilize the conformation of this loop by making hydrogen bonds with Y786 and the main chain carbonyl of P782. The Parkinson’s disease mutation Y793C has a clear but rather moderate effect on the Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> 5PPase activity. The largest decrease in activity is observed for IP<sub>3</sub>, where the measured catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>) of the mutant is 100-fold lower compared to the wild-type enzyme. On the other hand, the mutation has a rather similar and less pronounced effect on the catalytic efficiency of hydrolysis of the phosphoinositides, with a 8-, 7-, 5-, and 10-fold reduction for diC8-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, diC8-PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and diC8-PI(5)P, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s2sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>). This decreased overall catalytic efficiency is due to an effect on both substrate binding (higher K<sub>M</sub>) and turnover rate (smaller k<sub>cat</sub>) for IP<sub>3</sub> and diC8-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, while for diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and diC8-PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> it can nearly completely be attributed to an effect on catalytic turnover. The observation that hydrolysis of all the phosphoinositides is affected to a similar degree suggests that the Y793C mutation indeed leads to an increased flexibility or conformational change of the entire P4IM-containing loop, potentially by disrupting the interactions with Y786 and P782.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Localization of the Y793C, R800C, and Y849C disease mutations in the Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overall structure of Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> (green) with the Y793, R800, and Y849 residues represented as blue, magenta, and purple sticks, respectively.

However, in contrast to the Y793 residue, its side chain is pointing into the active site and directly interacts with the substrate via multiple (charged) hydrogen bonds with the 4 P group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). The clinical R800C mutation has a clear impact on the overall 5PPase activity (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>) of Synj1<sub>528–873</sub>, with the extent of the effect varying depending on the substrate. The largest overall effect is also here observed for IP<sub>3</sub> with a 900-fold decrease of k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> due to the mutation, while the k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> value decreases 54-, 12-, 2-, and 1.2-fold for diC8-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, diC8-PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and diC8-PI(5)P, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s3sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 3—source data 1</xref>). From these values it is clear that the R800C mutation has a pronounced effect on the 5PPase reaction for substrates containing a phosphate group on position 4, while the mutation has almost no effect on the reaction for substrates without the 4 P group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This effect on k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> is due to a combination of effects on catalytic turnover (k<sub>cat</sub>) and binding (K<sub>M</sub>). The mutation has a rather small but consistent effect on binding of the 4-P-containing substrates. On the other hand, the R800C mutation has a very high impact on the k<sub>cat</sub> value of IP<sub>3</sub>, which could be caused by misalignment of this smaller substrate in the active site pocket if the interaction with the R800 sidechain is lost. Also for diC8-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> a significant effect of the R800C mutation on k<sub>cat</sub> is observed, which indicates that R800 contributes to substrate turnover via its interaction with the 4 P group, potentially by properly aligning it for catalysis (see Discussion). Rather unexpectedly, only a small effect on k<sub>cat</sub> is observed for the R800C mutation using diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> as a substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>The Y849 residue is buried for the largest part in the hydrophobic core of the protein on one of the β-strands (β12) forming the central β-sandwich fold of the 5PPase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Here, its side chain is surrounded by residues G776, V778, F780, R807, L846 and V862, while its phenol hydroxyl groups forms H-bonds with E775 and the main chain amino-group of V808 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In agreement with this location in the hydrophobic core, the Y849C mutant could not be expressed in the soluble fraction as a His-tagged protein, but a small amount of soluble protein could be obtained when expressing it as a GST-fusion. However, also here it was observed via size-exclusion chromatography that this protein eluted as a higher-oligomer, indicating a significant effect of the mutation on the protein fold and stability. Moreover, while it was confirmed that the wild-type Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> was fully active as a GST-fusion (data not shown), no activity could be found for the Y849C mutant at the highest enzyme concentration tested (1 µM) for any of the tested substrates (IP<sub>3</sub>, diC8-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we report the first structural information on the 5PPase domain of Synj1 (Synj1<sub>528–873</sub>) to 2.3 Å resolution, relying on a strategy of Nanobody-aided crystallization to obtain well diffracting crystals.

Indeed, careful analysis of the electron density in the Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-bound structure reveals electron density accounting for such a water molecule located at 3.1 Å from D730 and at 3.5 Å from the P<sub>5</sub>-atom. This water molecule is furthermore held in place via a hydrogen bond with the conserved N732 residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It should be noted that also the catalytically important H859 residue is located close to the nucleophilic water molecule, and, depending on the orientation of the side chain, H859 could either form an interaction with the O<sub>PF</sub>-atom of the 5 P group or with this water molecule. The 5 P group is closely surrounded by multiple residues, H689, N732, R734, Y784, and H859, many of them potentially bearing a positive charge. Interactions of these residues with the 5 P group in the ground state contribute to binding, while stabilization of the excess of negative charge building up in the trigonal bipyramidal phosphorane transition state would contribute to catalysis. Previous mutagenesis studies on mouse INPP5A, yeast Inp52P and human INPP5B have shown that mutation of the residues corresponding to H689 and H859 negatively impact the activity, although from these studies it is not clear whether this is due to an effect on binding or catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Whisstock et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jefferson and Majerus, 1996</xref>). While multiple interactions are formed with the 5 P group, none of the residues is seen within interaction distance of the oxygen bridging the scissile phosphate to the inositol ring (O<sub>5</sub>) and thus in an appropriate position to act as general acid to activate the leaving group. The O<sub>5</sub>-atom is however located at a distance of 4.0 Å of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ion allowing this distance to be bridged by a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-coordinated water molecule as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, the O<sub>5</sub>-atom is located in our structure at 3.9 Å from one of the oxygens (O<sub>8P</sub>) of the 4 P group. This distance could decrease during the reaction path, allowing a direct role of the 4 P group in leaving group activation. We therefore envision two potential scenarios for leaving group activation to occur, indicated as route 1 and route 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Route 1 envisions a direct role of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ion in leaving group activation by activating a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound water molecule to donate a proton to the leaving O<sub>5</sub>-atom, although such a water is not observed in our structure. A direct role of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in catalysis also agrees with its observed large contribution to catalytic turnover (ΔΔG<sub>catalysis</sub> = 4.3 kcal/mol, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In this scenario, the observed role of the 4 P group in catalysis could for example be due to a stabilizing hydrogen bond to the O<sub>5</sub>-atom in the transition state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Route 2, on the other hand, corresponds to a mechanism of substrate-assisted catalysis, with a more direct role of the adjacent 4 P group in leaving group activation, where the O<sub>8P</sub> hydroxyl group of the 4 P group would transfer a proton to the leaving O<sub>5</sub>-atom. The transferred proton could potentially originally come from the K798 residue in a proton relay mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In our structure, the O<sub>8P</sub>-atom from 4 P is located at 3.9 Å from the O<sub>5</sub>-atom, but small rearrangements in going towards the transition state could easily bring both atoms in close contact. The residues surrounding the 4 P group could in turn contribute to catalysis by properly orienting the 4-phosphate for this role. Such a scenario is in good agreement with our kinetic data showing that the 4 P group has a large contribution to substrate turnover, with removal of the 4 P moiety (i.e. comparing diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> with diC8-PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>) leading to a 340-fold reduction in k<sub>cat</sub> (ΔΔG<sub>catalysis</sub> = 3.5 kcal/mol, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, we also showed that the R800 residue contributes to catalysis via its interaction with the 4 P group. Within this scenario, the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ion could play its observed role in catalysis via a direct interaction with the negative charges building upon the O<sub>5</sub>-atom in the transition state. It should of course be noted that the latter mechanism would not apply for the 5PPases that also efficiently catalyse the hydrolysis of PIPs missing the 4 P group (such as SHIP1, SHIP2, and to a lesser extent OCRL). At this point no conclusive distinction between these two scenarios can be made.</p><p>Apart from being a potential drug target for Alzheimer’s disease, Down syndrome, and TBC1D24-linked epilepsy, loss-of-function mutations in Synj1 also lead to disease, including epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taghavi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouhouche et al., 2017</xref>). This is an important point to take into account in a potential drug design effort. To rationalize such an effort and to find the available therapeutic window for inhibitory drug design, it is of paramount importance to characterize and quantify the effect of the disease-associated mutations on Synj1 activity in detail. At the moment of writing this manuscript, three disease-associated homozygous missense mutations had been described in the 5PPase domain of Synj1: Y793C, R800C, and Y849C (numbering based on Synaptojanin1-145 isoform 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taghavi et al., 2018</xref>). Our structural data and detailed kinetic analysis of the mutants in comparison to the wild-type enzyme allow us to gain deeper understanding in the molecular basis underlying the associated diseases. Our data shows that the Y849C mutant does not display any 5PPase activity with any of the tested substrates. The crystal structure shows that Y849 is nearly completely buried in the core of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and the Y849C mutation leads to severe problems in expressing this protein in a soluble form. Together, this indicates that the Y849C mutant corresponds to a near complete loss-of-function mutation due to disruption of the protein fold. In contrast, the R800 residue is located in the active site where it forms important interactions with the 4-phosphate group of the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Our kinetic analysis of the R800C mutant shows that this residue contributes to both substrate binding and catalysis, specifically via its interaction with the 4 P group. The contribution to substrate turnover (k<sub>cat</sub>) can be explained by a model where R800 acts by orienting the 4 P group in an orientation suitable for subsequent proton transfer to the inositol 5-hydroxylate leaving group, as outlined above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, route 2). Interestingly, the magnitude of the overall effect of the R800C mutation depends on the substrate that is being considered, with a decrease in k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> of a factor 900, 54, and 12 for IP<sub>3</sub>, diC8-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, respectively. Whether this difference in activity toward the different substrates is physiologically relevant and leads to an imbalance in the cellular distribution of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and IP<sub>3</sub>, remains to be seen. Such an imbalance of the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>/PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> ratio, with a relative increase in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> versus PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> as expected from the kinetics of the R800C mutant, has previously been linked to the occurrence of Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sekar and Taghibiglou, 2018</xref>). Finally, the Y793 residue is located on the same active site loop as R800, and likely contributes to stabilizing the loop conformation rather than being directly involved in interactions with the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Our kinetic analysis of the Y793C clinical mutant shows that the 5PPase activity of Synj1 is diminished between 5- and 10-fold for all the substrates in a rather indiscriminatory way.</p><p>As a general trend, it can be observed that the impact of the mutations on the catalytic efficiency of the Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> enzyme <italic>in vitro</italic> links with the severity and age of onset of the clinical manifestations in the patients that are homozygous carriers of these Synj1 mutations. Indeed, the very early onset of the severe neurodegeneration observed for the patients carrying a Y849C mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardies et al., 2016</xref>), corresponds well with our observation that this mutation leads to a complete loss of 5PPase activity. On the other hand, the R800C mutation leads to a decrease in overall activity of 54- to 12-fold for the most relevant substrates PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and was reported to associate with parkinsonism and seizures at age 24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taghavi et al., 2018</xref>), while the even smaller effects on activity we observe for the Y793C mutation, with a decrease in activity of 8-fold for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and 7-fold for PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, leads to Parkinson’s disease at later age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xie et al., 2019</xref>). Although care should be taken with extending these observations to other mutations, this seems to indicate that the impact of the missense mutations on the kinetics of the 5PPase reaction <italic>in vitro</italic> can be used to a certain level to predict the severity of the disease outcome in patients who are homozygous for the corresponding mutation. Finally, these observations also have implications for the window that is available to therapeutically target the 5PPase domain of Synj1 in DS, AD, and TBC1D24-associated DOORS syndrome. While it was previously shown that genetic ablation of one Synj allele, corresponding to half of the normal cellular activity, was sufficient to rescue the disease phenotype in TBC1D24-mutant flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>), we show here that a close to 10-fold reduction of Synj1 activity on the long term could lead to disease in its own respect, thus still leaving a window for inhibitor design.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

purification</title><p>The open reading frame (ORF) encoding the 5-phosphatase domain of Synj1 (residues 528–873) was amplified from the full length Synj1 ORF (NCBI - Gene ID: 8867) and an N-terminal TEV cleavage site was added. This PCR product was digested with NdeI and NotI and ligated into a pET28a expression vector (Novagen). The Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> ORF was also amplified and inserted into a pGEX-4T1 expression vector (GE Healthcare) containing a pre-inserted TEV-site using the BamHI and NotI sites (GE Healthcare). QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis was used to insert the Y793C and R800C mutations into the pET28a-TEV-Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> plasmid, while the Y849C mutation was introduced in the pGEX-4T1-nTEV-Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> plasmid. The resulting plasmids were verified by sequencing (Eurofins Genomics).</p><p>Plasmids containing the wild-type or mutant ORFs were transformed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Cells were grown at 37°C in Terrific Broth (TB) medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics until an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6 was reached. Subsequently, protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG and after an incubation period of 17 hr at 20°C, cells were harvested by centrifugation.</p><p>All steps of Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> purification (WT and mutants) were performed at 4°C. The bacterial pellets containing His-tagged wild-type, Y793C, and R800C proteins were resuspended in buffer A (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) supplemented with 10 mM imidazole pH 8, 1 mM DTT, 1 µg/ml leupeptin protease inhibitor (Roth), 0.1 mg/ml AEBSF serine protease inhibitor (Roth), 2 µM pepstatin A (Promega) and 50 µg/ml DNaseI (Sigma), and lysed with a cell-disruptor system (Constant Systems). After clearance of the lysate via centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A supplemented with 10 mM imidazole pH 8. After extensive washing, the protein was eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration to 1 M and fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled. To cleave the His-tag, 1 mg of His-tagged TEV protease was added per 10 mg of His-Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> and the mixture was dialysed overnight against buffer A supplemented with 1 mM DTT. The mixture was then loaded onto a Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA-Sepharose column, to remove the His-tagged TEV protease and any remaining non-cleaved protein. The bacterial pellets containing GST-tagged wild-type and Y849C protein were resuspended in buffer B (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) supplemented with 1 mM DTT, 1 µg/ml leupeptin protease inhibitor, 0.1 mg/ml AEBSF serine protease inhibitor, 2 µM pepstatin A and 50 µg/ml DNaseI, and cells were lysed as before. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation and the supernatant was incubated with Glutathione Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare) for 1 hr, then packed into an empty PD-10 column (GE Healthcare). Following extensive washing, the protein was eluted with buffer B supplemented with 10 mM of reduced glutathione. As a final purification step, the His-tagged or tag-less proteins were loaded on a Superdex 75 s column (GE Healthcare), while the GST-tagged proteins were loaded on a Superdex 200 s column (GE Healthcare), using buffer B supplemented with 1 mM DTT as running buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Nanobody (Nb) generation and purification</title><p>A llama was immunized with His-Synj1<sub>528–873</sub>. A six-week immunization protocol was followed consisting of weekly immunizations of 200 µg (first two weeks) or 100 µg (last four weeks) protein in presence of GERBU adjuvant. All animal vaccinations were performed in strict accordance with good practices and EU animal welfare legislation. Blood was collected four days after the last injection. Library construction, Nb selection via phage display and Nb expression and purification were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pardon et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, the variable domains of the heavy-chain antibody repertoire from the llama were subcloned in a pMESy4 phage display vector, which adds a C-terminal His-tag and EPEA-tag (=CaptureSelect C-tag). This resulted in an immune library of 2.4•10<sup>9</sup> transformants. This Nb-repertoire was expressed on phages after rescue with the VCSM13 helper phage, and two consecutive rounds of phage display were used to select for phages expressing Nbs that bind to the 5PPase domain of Synj1. Therefore, two different coating strategies were used. In the first coating strategy, biotinylated Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> (as well His-tagged as non-tagged) was captured on neutravidine-coated 96 well-plates and all binding and washing steps were performed in buffer B (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). In the second coating strategy, Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> was captured directly on the bottom of a 96-well plate and all binding and washing steps were performed in buffer B supplemented with 1 mM DTT. After phage display selection, an ELISA screen was performed on crude cell lysates of <italic>E. coli</italic> expressing the Nbs, in order to confirm binding. Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> was coated on the ELISA plate. Incubation with the Nb-containing cell extracts and all washing steps were performed in buffer B. Binding of the Nbs was detected via their EPEA-tag using a 1:4000 CaptureSelect Biotin anti-C-tag conjugate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in combination with 1:1000 Streptavidin Alkaline Phosphatase (Promega). Colour was developed by adding 100 µl of a 3 mg/ml disodium-4-nitrophenyl phosphate solution (DNPP, Sigma) and measured at 405 nm. Sequence analysis was used to classify the binding Nb clones in sequence families.</p><p>For Nb production and purification, pMESy4 vectors, containing the Nb ORFs, were transformed in <italic>E. coli</italic> WK6 (Su<sup>-</sup>) cells. Cells were grown at 37°C in TB medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml ampicillin, 0.1% glucose, and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, until an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6 was reached. Nb expression was induced by adding 1 mM IPTG. After incubation for 17 hr at 28°C, cells were harvested by centrifugation and subjected to an osmotic shock to obtain the periplasmic extract. Subsequently, an affinity purification step on Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA sepharose and a SEC step on a Superdex 75 16/60 column (in buffer C: 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol) were used to purify the Nbs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Crystallization and data collection</title><p>To form the Nb-Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> complex, 250 µM of Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> was mixed with 500 µM of Nb and incubated for 1 hr on ice.

After optimization two similar conditions yielded good quality crystals of the Nb15-Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> complex prepared at 25 mg/ml. Condition 1 was composed of 15% PEG 4000, 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5 and 10% 2-propanol, while condition 2 contained 15% PEG 3350, 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.5 and 13% ethanol. Crystals from these conditions were soaked overnight with mother liquor supplemented with either 1 mM IP<sub>6</sub> (inositol-(1,2,3,4,5,6)-hexakisphosphate) (Merck Millipore) (condition 1) or 1 mM diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (Echelon Biosciences) (condition 2). Subsequently, the former crystals were transferred to a cryo-solution containing mother liquor supplemented with 25% glycerol, while the latter crystals were again very briefly soaked in mother liquid supplemented with 1 mM diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and 15% glycerol as cryo-protectant, immediately followed by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen.</p><p>All data were collected at 100 K. Diffraction data from the crystal soaked with IP<sub>6</sub> was collected at the i03 beamline of the DIAMOND synchrotron (λ = 0.980105) using an Eiger2 XE 16M detector. Data from the crystal soaked with diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> was collected at the Proxima 2a beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron (λ = 0.976246) equipped with an Eiger X 9M detector. Diffraction data were integrated and scaled with autoPROC (Global Phasing Limited; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vonrhein et al., 2011</xref>), using the default pipeline which includes XDS, Truncate, Aimless, and STARANISO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tickle et al., 2018</xref>). Anisotropy analysis by STARANISO showed that diffraction data were anisotropic, with diffraction limits along the reciprocal axes of 2.71 Å along 0.781 a* - 0.625 c*, 2.41 Å along b* and 2.30 Å along 0.975 a* + 0.222 c* for the structure obtained from the IP<sub>6</sub>-soaked crystal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>), and 2.86 Å along 0.043 a* + 0.999 c*, 2.73 Å along b* and 3.14 Å along −0.974 a* + 0.228 c* for the structure obtained from the diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-soaked crystal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref>). Automated resolution cutoff of anisotropic corrected data by STARANISO resulted in a 2.30 Å and a 2.73 Å resolution structure for the IP<sub>6</sub>- and diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-soaked crystals respectively (using I/σ(I) &gt; 1.4 as a cut-off criterion).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Structure determination and refinement</title><p>For the IP<sub>6</sub> soaked crystal the phase problem was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>) from the PHENIX suit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liebschner et al., 2019</xref>).

Since the resulting structure had no IP<sub>6</sub> bound, we flagged it as an apo-structure. The structure of the diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-containing crystal was solved by refining the data against the refined apo-structure, taking care to use the same set of reflections for cross-validation. Analysis of the 2Fo-Fc, Fo-Fc, and omit maps revealed unambiguous electron density for diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>.

A full steady-state Michaelis-Menten analysis of Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> wild-type and the R793C and R800C mutants was performed via initial rate measurements using an enzyme concentration optimized for each enzyme/substrate combination to convert around 10% of substrate over the total measuring time, and at varying substrate concentrations (typically within the range 5–500 µM, depending on the K<sub>M</sub> value). For the GST-tagged Y849C mutant, time measurements at a single substrate concentration of 120 µM (for IP<sub>3</sub>, diC8-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>) and an enzyme concentration of 1 µM were performed. To assess the effect of Nb15 on catalysis, measurements were carried out by incubating Synj1<sub>528–873</sub> with a 40-fold excess (100 nM) of Nb15 for 10 min at 25°C prior to the assay. All measurements were done at 25°C in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM DTT, except for the measurements performed at pH 5.5 where the HEPES was replaced by 25 mM sodium citrate pH 5.5. At different time points, 80 µl of each reaction mixture was transferred to a 96 well plate containing 20 µl of the Malachite Green working reagent to stop the reaction. After 30 min of incubation, the absorption of the samples was measured in a SPECTROstar<sup>Nano</sup> (BMG Labtech) plate reader at 620 nm. The absorption was plotted against time and a linear trendline was drawn through the plotted points. To obtain the initial reaction velocity (v), the slopes were divided by the slope of a standard curve (measured in quadruplicate).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.

Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are concerned that the crystallized substrate-bound complex is non-productive. Moreover, the absence of substrate in 2 of the 3 synaptojanin molecules is troublesome, and there are other concerns about this structure (details in reviews below). Thus, in the present form, the paper is not acceptable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a potentially a major contribution towards understanding the molecular mechanism of synaptojanin. The previous structure of the 5-phosphatase domain of <italic>S. pombe</italic> synaptojanin in complex with inositol‐(1,4)‐bisphosphate (Tsujishita, et al., PDB ID 1i9z) was determined at high resolution but the electron density for the inositol-(1,4)-bisphosphate was ambiguous. As the authors point out, subsequent structures of the catalytic 102 domain of INPP5B in complex with diC8‐PI(4)P and diC8‐PI(3,4)P2 revealed another orientation but these structures lack the 5-phosphate group. In this work the authors present high-resolution structures of the 5-phosphatase domain of synaptojanin, and its complex with the substrate diC8-PI(3,4,5)P3, providing a high-resolution image of a 5-phosphatase with a trapped substrate in its active site.

Based on the structure, they kinetically characterize catalysis towards different substrates and come up with two alternative mechanisms how Syn1 mediates catalysis. They finally characterize three disease mutants of Syn1, which show reduced activity or aggregate.</p><p>The paper is well drafted, the nanobody-aided structure determination of Syn1 is elegant and the kinetic experiments appear overall sound. A question to discuss is whether the novelty of the structural data is sufficient for publication in e<italic>Life</italic>. The structure of yeast synaptojanin is known for a long time and it seems rather similar to the human counterpart (although this is difficult to judge from this manuscript). Furthermore, many features of substrate binding and catalysis were already deduced from the product-bound yeast synaptojanin structure. I have also some questions/doubts about the substrate-bound structure.</p><p>1) Detailed structural comparisons of Syn1 to other 5'-phosphatases (including rmsd) are missing to judge similarities and recognize potential differences between the structures. A structural comparison of the catalytic centers of some 5' phosphatases, including human and yeast synaptojanin with bound ligands, complementing Supplementary file 1, would allow the reader to appreciate (potentially) new mechanistic insights from the Syn1 structure.</p><p>2) A major point of the paper is the substrate bound to Syn1. However, it remains unclear why the substrate has not been turned over after an overnight incubation at 20 C. The authors speculate about a missing catalytic water, but this cannot explain missing catalysis since the substrate-binding site is apparently accessible, in particular for water. Is the crystallization condition incompatible with catalysis? Does nanobody-binding reduce catalysis? Is there at all any substrate left after overnight incubation with the crystals? Without answering this, it remains uncertain whether the observed ligand is indeed a non-converted substrate molecule (see also next point).</p><p>3) Crystallographic data of the substrate-bound crystals: Why is the signal to noise value so low for the substrate-bound crystals? Why did the authors apply anisotropic corrections to their data? Did the crystals diffracted anisotropically – if yes, provide some more information, e.g. to which resolution along a*,b*,c*. Judging from the spherical completeness, the dataset rather correspond to a 3.x A resolution dataset in terms of reflection numbers. It is astonishing that for such low resolution, 91 water molecules with an average B-factor of only 34 Angstroms could be modelled (I would hardly expect to see any visible water molecules at this resolution). Is the model overfitted? Any explanation for the wide gap of Rwork and Rfree? What was the exact refinement strategy? Overall, the data quality of the substrate-bound crystals is borderline to accurately evaluate ligand binding, in particular if the identity of the bound ligand is not 100% clear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors report crystal structures of the apo and substrate bound versions of the inositol 5-phosphatase domain of human synaptojanin-1 (Synj1), crystallized in the presence of a nanobody. The overall structure is similar to those of several previously solved 5-phosphatase enyzmes from yeast and humans. The main addition to the field in the current structure with respect to past work is that a substrate is present in this case, whereas previous structures were apo or product-bound.</p><p>The structure contains 3 catalytic chains per asymmetric unit. The ligand-bound form was obtained by soaking apo crystals in a di-C8 form of the substrate phosphoinositide. The structure of the complex was determined at 2.9 Å resolution. Detail on the catalytic geometry is limited at this resolution. Water and metal ion positions are not visualized at all, or with limited accuracy. Only one of the three catalytic chains binds to substrate. I did not see an explanation for the lack of binding to the other two chains. The 5-phosphate is still present on the substrate, despite that catalytically active wild-type enzyme was used. The authors present a detailed scheme for the catalytic mechanism on the basis of their structure, but I did not see an explanation for the failure of the enzyme to hydrolyze the 5-phosphate. I would speculate that the pH 5.0 of the crystallization could account for this. Have the authors attempted to adapt the crystals to neutral pH? Is a non-hydrolyzable substrate analogue available, or could it be synthesized? (I appreciate that phosphoinositide synthetic chemistry is non-trivial.) It would certainly be helpful for the field to know the geometry of a catalytically productive substrate complex, yet I am not convinced that the authors have as yet succeeded in obtaining such a structure. In my opinion, the conclusions concerning enzyme mechanism are, at this stage, over-interpreted.</p><p>The paper is, apart from the omissions noted above, very thorough. It reads like a review article in the Introduction and Discussion. The results includes more detail than is standard. Overall the paper would be more readable if it were edited to about half of the current length.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64922.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Subsequently, we carefully analyzed the unbiased electron density in the active site of the three protein molecules in the asymmetric unit. The omit map for molecule E very clearly shows electron density for diC8‐PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, including the phosphate groups on position 3, 4 and 5, allowing us to unambiguously model this compound (see unbiased omit map and 2Fo‐Fc and residual Fo‐Fc maps after refinement in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The omit maps for the other two active sites (chain A and chain C) show some continuous density which might account for the presence of a ligand at low occupancy. The latter is especially true for chain C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). These differences in occupancy could reflect differences in kinetics of access of substrate or release of products from the three active sites, depending on their local environment in the crystal packing, and/or could reflect the substrate being hydrolyzed to different degrees.

Considering the importance of this protein as a potential target for drug design, a structure of the real human protein rather than a homologue will be crucial for any structure‐based drug design effort. Also, note that we show in our study that the substrate specificity profile of the yeast homologue, SPSynj, differs from that of the human Synj1, which shows that SPSynj is not an optimal model system, again emphasizing the importance of a structure from the human protein.</p><p>We also provide the very first structure of any 5‐phosphatase protein in complex with the real substrate. In the revised document we carefully re‐processed and reanalyzed the diffraction data, suggesting a higher resolution for the substrate‐bound structure of 2.73 Å, and the PDB validation report shows the good quality of the structure compared to structures of similar resolution. Furthermore, the only objective criterion to address the question of data quality in our believe is to look at the electron density around the bound ligand. We have made a figure showing the electron density around the ligand in our structure and that of SPSynj in complex with the product inositol‐(1,4)bisphosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). For comparison we provide the 2Fo‐Fc and Fo‐Fc maps around the ligands of the respective structures as well as the omit maps. Both maps were calculated in exactly the same way for straightforward comparison. I hope that the reviewer will appreciate that (i) the position of the diC8‐PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> substrate in our structure is very clearly and unambiguously defined and also the scissile 5‐phosphate group can be modelled in an unambiguous way without the danger of any overfitting; (ii) the ligand in the SPSynj structure is clearly much less well defined in the density and modelling seems rather ambiguous. As discussed in the revised document, careful analysis of the electron density in our re‐processed structure of human Synj1 in complex with diC8‐PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> now also reveals density that could account for the nucleophilic water molecule, adding to the information with regard to the mechanism.</p><p>Finally, we also performed a very thorough kinetic analysis, showing for the first time the direct contribution of the 4‐phosphate group to catalysis rather than substrate binding. Together with the structural information, this allowed us to propose two potential mechanisms for this enzyme. Additionally, we also performed a first thorough kinetic characterization of disease‐associated mutations showing a clear link between the effect on catalysis and the severity of disease.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Electron density around diC8‐PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> in the Synj1<sub>528‐873</sub> structure (PDB 7A17) and around inositol‐(1,4)bisphosphate in the SPSynj structure (1I9Z).</title><p>The panels on the left show the Fo‐Fc and 2Fo‐Fc map contoured at 3σ and 1σ respectively, while the panels on the right show the omit map contoured at 3σ.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64922-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Detailed structural comparisons of Syn1 to other 5'-phosphatases (including rmsd) are missing to judge similarities and recognize potential differences between the structures.

Without answering this, it remains uncertain whether the observed ligand is indeed a non-converted substrate molecule (see also next point).</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern raised by the reviewer that a substrate molecule would still be present in the active site after overnight incubation. This question is in part triggered by a lack of detail in the description of the cryo‐solution in our initial manuscript. In contrast to the apo‐structure, for the diC8PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>‐bound structure the cryo‐solution was also supplemented with 1 mM of the substrate diC8PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. As we now explain in detail in our revised manuscript, crystals were transferred to the cryosolution for approximately 30 seconds prior to flash‐freezing in liquid nitrogen. So, it is highly likely that during short soaking in the cryo‐liquid a new substrate molecule re‐entered the active site of one of the protein molecules and was then trapped by flash freezing. This substrate is present with full occupancy and has very clearly determined density, as shown in the refined and omit density maps (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). These issues are now clarified and discussed in the revised document. In addition, the orientation of the substrate in the active site is clearly physiologically relevant as witnessed by the orientation of catalytically important residues vis‐à‐vis the substrate and the high correlation between the structure and our mutagenesis/kinetics results.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we also addressed the question on whether either the presence of the nanobody and/or the crystallographic condition (pH) could affect catalysis. First, using the same method as described in the Materials and methods section of the manuscript, we compared the Michaelis‐Menten kinetics for the substrate diC8‐PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> for Synj1<sub>528‐837</sub> in either absence or presence of an excess of Nb15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A</xref>). This analysis shows that binding of Nb15 induces a small decrease in the overall catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>) of the enzyme by a factor of 3.5, potentially by affecting the enzyme dynamics. Secondly, we tested the effect of the buffer and pH of the mother liquor used to crystallize the protein, by comparing enzyme catalysis in HEPES buffer with pH 7.5 and citrate buffer with pH 5.5. This analysis shows a decrease in catalytic efficiency by a factor of 12 at the pH used to crystallize the protein. Cumulative this shows that substrate turnover is slowed down under the conditions used to crystallize the protein, which could have aided in trapping the substrate in a non‐hydrolyzed form. However, this also shows that the enzyme is still catalytically competent under the conditions used, thus proving the relevance of our structure.</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>The 5‐phosphatase activity of Synj1<sub>528‐873</sub> is affected by Nb15 and acidic pH.</title><p>(A) Michaelis‐Menten curves obtained by using the Malachite green assay with 2.5 nM of human Synj1<sub>528‐873</sub> and various concentrations of diC8‐PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> in absence or presence of 100 nM Nb15.

For a comparison of expected water molecules per amino acid residues at different resolution limits we could e.g. refer to Carugo, Oliviero, and Domenico Bordo. &quot;How many water molecules can be detected by protein crystallography?.&quot; Acta Crystallographica Section D: Biological Crystallography 55, no. 2 (1999): 479‐483.</p><p>In the final refined Synj1<sub>528‐873</sub>‐diC8‐PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> structure the R and R<sub>free</sub> values are 19.88 % and 25.74%, respectively, corresponding to a R‐R<sub>free</sub> gap of 5.86%.

The overall structure is similar to those of several previously solved 5-phosphatase enyzmes from yeast and humans. The main addition to the field in the current structure with respect to past work is that a substrate is present in this case, whereas previous structures were apo or product-bound.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his assessment and comments.</p><p>For the comment with regard to the novelty of our findings we would make the following remarks (see also our answer to reviewer 2):</p><p>This is the first structure of the human Synj1 protein. Considering the importance of this protein as a potential target for drug design, a structure of the real human protein rather than a homologue will be crucial for any structure‐based drug design effort. Also, note that we show in our study that the substrate specificity profile of the yeast homologue, SPSynj, differs from that of the human Synj1, which shows that SPSynj is not an optimal model system again emphasizing the importance of a structure from the human protein.</p><p>We also provide the very first structure of any 5‐phosphatase protein in complex with the real substrate. In the revised document we carefully re‐processed and re‐analyzed the diffraction data, suggesting a higher resolution for the substrate‐bound structure of 2.73 Å. As discussed in the revised document, careful analysis of the electron density in our re‐processed structure of human Synj1 in complex with diC8‐PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> now also reveals density that could account for the nucleophilic water molecule, adding to the information with regard to the mechanism.</p><p>Finally, we also performed a very thorough kinetic analysis, showing for the first time the direct contribution of the 4‐phosphate group to catalysis rather than substrate binding. Together with the structural information, this allowed us to propose two potential mechanisms for this enzyme. Additionally, we also performed a first thorough kinetic characterization of disease‐associated mutations showing a clear link between the effect on catalysis and the severity of disease.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The structure contains 3 catalytic chains per asymmetric unit. The ligand-bound form was obtained by soaking apo crystals in a di-C8 form of the substrate phosphoinositide. The structure of the complex was determined at 2.9 Å resolution. Detail on the catalytic geometry is limited at this resolution. Water and metal ion positions are not visualized at all, or with limited accuracy.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above, in our revised manuscript we have carefully re‐analyzed our data processing and refinement of the Synj1 structure in complex with diC8‐PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> suggesting an even higher resolution for this substrate‐bound structure of 2.73 Å. Subsequently, we carefully analyzed the unbiased electron density in the active site of the three protein molecules in the asymmetric unit. The omit map for molecule E very clearly shows electron density for diC8‐PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, including the phosphate groups on position 3, 4 and 5, allowing us to unambiguously model this compound (see unbiased omit map and 2Fo‐Fc and residual Fo‐Fc maps after refinement in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The orientation of the substrate in the active site is clearly physiologically relevant as witnessed by the orientation of catalytically important residues vis‐à‐vis the substrate and the high correlation between the structure and our mutagenesis/kinetics results. The excellent quality of the density in the active site of chain E also revealed additional electron density that could be accounted for by the nucleophilic water molecule. We attached the PDB validation reports with this re‐submission, showing the good quality of our structures in comparison to other structures of similar resolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Only one of the three catalytic chains binds to substrate. I did not see an explanation for the lack of binding to the other two chains. The 5-phosphate is still present on the substrate, despite that catalytically active wild-type enzyme was used. The authors present a detailed scheme for the catalytic mechanism on the basis of their structure, but I did not see an explanation for the failure of the enzyme to hydrolyze the 5-phosphate. I would speculate that the pH 5.0 of the crystallization could account for this. Have the authors attempted to adapt the crystals to neutral pH? Is a non-hydrolyzable substrate analogue available, or could it be synthesized? (I appreciate that phosphoinositide synthetic chemistry is non-trivial.) It would certainly be helpful for the field to know the geometry of a catalytically productive substrate complex, yet I am not convinced that the authors have as yet succeeded in obtaining such a structure. In my opinion, the conclusions concerning enzyme mechanism are, at this stage, over-interpreted.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern raised by the reviewer that a substrate molecule would still be present in the active site after overnight incubation. This question is in part triggered by a lack of detail in the description of the cryo‐solution in our initial manuscript. In contrast to the apo‐structure, for the diC8PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> structure the cryo‐solution was also supplemented with 1 mM of the substrate diC8PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. As we now explain in detail in our revised manuscript, crystals were transferred to the cryosolution for approximately 30 seconds prior to flash‐freezing in liquid nitrogen. So, it is highly likely that during short soaking in the cryo‐liquid a new substrate molecule re‐entered the active site of one of the protein molecules and was then trapped by flash freezing. This substrate is present with full occupancy and has very clearly determined density, as shown in the refined and omit density maps (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, included in this rebuttal letter). These issues are now clarified and discussed in the revised document.</p><p>As suggested by reviewers 2 and 3 we also investigated the influence of the Nb and the pH of the crystallization conditions on Synj1 catalytic activity. As detailed in our answer to reviewer 2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A</xref>), we find that the presence of the Nb induces a small decrease in the overall catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>) of the enzyme by a factor of 3.5, potentially by affecting the enzyme dynamics, while a decrease of pH from 7.5 to 5.5 causes a decrease in catalytic efficiency by a factor of 12. Cumulative this shows that substrate turnover is slowed down under the conditions used to crystallize the protein, which could have aided in trapping the substrate in a non‐hydrolyzed form. However, this also shows that the enzyme is still catalytically competent under the conditions used, thus showing the relevance of our structure.</p><p>Concerning the presence of clear density for the non‐hydrolyzed substrate in only one of the active sites, as stated above, it is true that the other two active sites (mainly chain C) show only some continuous density which might account for the presence of a ligand at low occupancy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). These differences in occupancy could reflect differences in kinetics of access of the substrate or release of products from the three active sites, depending on their local environment in the crystal packing, and/or could reflect the substrate being hydrolyzed to different degrees.</p><p>This being said, we think it is not unusual that ligands are only found occupying a subset of the binding pockets present in the asymmetric unit, despite being seemingly accessible via solvent channels. A survey at the CCP4 bulletin board and through the literature yielded several similar cases, some of which we mention here:</p><p>– Structure of penicillin‐binding protein 2A in complex with a quinazolinone (PDB 6Q9N), where only one of the two protein chains in the active site contained density for the compound (Janardhanan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019.
