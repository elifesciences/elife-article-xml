evolutionary arms races with viruses, in which both sides rapidly evolve at interaction interfaces to gain or evade immune defense. For example, primate TRIM5α uses its rapidly evolving ‘v1’ loop to bind retroviral capsids, and single mutations in this loop can dramatically improve retroviral restriction. However, it is unknown whether such gains of viral restriction are rare, or if they incur loss of pre-existing function against other viruses. Using deep mutational scanning, we comprehensively measured how single mutations in the TRIM5α v1 loop affect restriction of divergent retroviruses. Unexpectedly, we found that the majority of mutations increase weak antiviral function. Moreover, most random mutations do not disrupt potent viral restriction, even when it is newly acquired via a single adaptive substitution. Our results indicate that TRIM5α’s adaptive landscape is remarkably broad and mutationally resilient, maximizing its chances of success in evolutionary arms races with retroviruses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The evolutionary battle between viruses and the immune system is essentially a high-stakes arms race. The immune system makes antiviral proteins, called restriction factors, which can stop the virus from replicating. In response, viruses evolve to evade the effects of restriction factors. To counter this, restriction factors evolve too, and the cycle continues. The challenge for the immune system is that mammals do not evolve as fast as viruses. How then, in the face of this disadvantage, can the immune system hope to keep pace with viral evolution?</p><p>One human antiviral protein that seems to have struggled to keep up is TRIM5α. In rhesus macaques, it is very effective at stopping the replication of HIV-1 and related viruses. But in humans, it is not effective at all. But why? Protein evolution happens due to small genetic mutations, but not every mutation makes a protein better. If a protein is resilient, it can tolerate lots of neutral or negative mutations without breaking, until it mutates in a way that makes it better. But, if a protein is fragile, even small changes can render it completely unable to do its job. It is possible that restriction factors, like TRIM5α, are evolutionarily 'fragile', and therefore easy to break. But it is difficult to test whether this is the case, because existing mutations have already passed the test of natural selection. This means that either the mutation is somehow useful for the protein, or that it is not harmful enough to be removed.</p><p>Tenthorey et al. devised a way to introduce all possible changes to the part of TRIM5α that binds to viruses. This revealed that TRIM5α is not fragile; most random mutations increased, rather than decreased, the protein’s ability to prevent viral infection. In fact, it appears it would only take a single mutation to make TRIM5α better at blocking HIV-1 in humans, and there are many possible single mutations that would work. Thus, it would appear that human TRIM5α can easily gain the ability to block HIV-1. The next step was to find out whether these gains in antiviral activity are just as easily lost. To do this, Tenthorey et al. performed the same tests on TRIM5α from rhesus macaques and an HIV-blocking mutant version of human TRIM5α. This showed that the majority of random mutations do not break TRIM5α’s virus-blocking ability. Thus, TRIM5α can readily gain antiviral activity and, once gained, does not lose it easily during subsequent mutation.</p><p>Antiviral proteins like TRIM5α engage in uneven evolutionary battles with fast-evolving viruses. But, although they are resilient and able to evolve, they are not always able to find the right mutations on their own. Experiments like these suggest that it might be possible to give them a helping hand. Identifying mutations that help human TRIM5α to strongly block HIV-1 could pave the way for future gene therapy. This step would demand significant advances in gene therapy efficacy and safety, but it could offer a new way to block virus infection in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRIM5α</kwd><kwd>retroviral restriction</kwd><kwd>evolutionary landscape</kwd><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>SIV</kwd><kwd>N-MLV</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001229</institution-id><institution>G Harold and Leila Y.

The potency of restriction factors places selective pressure on viruses to evade recognition in order to complete replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duggal and Emerman, 2012</xref>). In turn, viral escape spurs adaptation of restriction factors, by selecting for variants that re-establish viral recognition and thereby restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCarthy et al., 2015</xref>). Mutual antagonism between viruses and their hosts thus drives cycles of recurrent adaptation, in prey-predator-like genetic arms races (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Van Valen, 1973</xref>). These arms races result in the rapid evolution of restriction factors, which accumulate amino acid mutations at their virus-binding interfaces at a higher than expected rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daugherty and Malik, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Numerous restriction factors, including TRIM5α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sawyer et al., 2005</xref>), APOBEC3G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sawyer et al., 2004</xref>), and MxA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mitchell et al., 2012</xref>), evolve rapidly as a result of arms races with target viruses. The resulting divergence between restriction factor orthologs can result in cross-species barriers to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Compton and Emerman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kirmaier et al., 2010</xref>). Such barriers led to the initial identification of TRIM5α, during a screen for proteins that prevented HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus) from efficiently replicating in rhesus macaque cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stremlau et al., 2004</xref>). Rhesus TRIM5α could potently restrict HIV-1, whereas the virus almost completely escapes TRIM5α-mediated inhibition in its human host. Subsequent studies revealed that restriction of SIVs (simian immunodeficiency viruses) also varies across TRIM5α orthologs and that SIVs likely drove the rapid evolution of TRIM5α in Old World monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCarthy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>TRIM5α disrupts retroviral replication early in infection by binding to the capsid core of retroviruses entering the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maillard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Owens et al., 2003</xref>). Its binding causes the premature uncoating of the viral core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stremlau et al., 2006</xref>), preventing delivery of the viral genome to the nucleus for integration. TRIM5α binds to the capsid via the unstructured v1 loop within its B30.2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sebastian and Luban, 2005</xref>). Experiments swapping the v1 loop between TRIM5α orthologs indicated that it is critical for recognition of capsid from many retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ohkura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perron et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sawyer et al., 2005</xref>). In Old World monkeys and hominoids, rapid evolution of TRIM5α is concentrated within this v1 loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sawyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Single amino acid mutations at these rapidly evolving sites can cause dramatic gains of restriction against HIV-1 and other retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maillard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yap et al., 2005</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether such adaptive mutations are rare among all single mutational steps that might be randomly sampled during TRIM5α’s natural evolution.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TRIM5α has sampled limited amino acid diversity, even at rapidly evolving positions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Alignment of TRIM5α from simian primates.

The topology of this evolutionary landscape, in terms of numbers of peaks and valleys and their connections, represents the adaptive potential of restriction factors in their evolutionary arms race with viruses. Previous studies that have empirically mapped evolutionary landscapes of conserved enzymes and transcription factors revealed that ligand-binding residues are highly intolerant to substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fowler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McLaughlin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suckow et al., 1996</xref>). Moreover, mutations that allowed proteins to gain novel ligand specificity, even for closely related ligands, were rare among all possible substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McLaughlin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stiffler et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, TRIM5α and other restriction factors can dramatically change antiviral potency via single mutations at viral interaction interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daugherty and Malik, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mitchell et al., 2012</xref>). However, since the frequency of such gain-of-function mutations is unknown, it is unclear whether virus-binding surfaces in rapidly evolving antiviral factors are subject to the same evolutionary constraints as previously mapped for other proteins.</p><p>Here, we investigated the adaptive landscape of antiviral specificity conferred by the rapidly evolving, capsid-binding v1 loop of TRIM5α. To our surprise, we found that, rather than the evolutionary landscape of TRIM5α being narrowly constrained among all possible amino acid substitutions, the majority of random mutations in the v1 loop resulted in gains of antiviral restriction. We found that the primary v1 loop determinant for TRIM5α’s restriction of HIV-1 and other lentiviruses is its net electrostatic charge. Furthermore, both rhesus and human TRIM5α proteins are highly resilient to mutation, in that they withstand more than half of all possible single amino acid mutations in the v1 loop without compromising their antiviral restriction abilities. This unexpectedly permissive landscape allows TRIM5α to sample a wide variety of mutations to maximize its chances of success in arms races with retroviruses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A deep mutational scan of the TRIM5α v1 loop</title><p>Despite their rapid evolution, primate TRIM5α orthologs have sampled relatively limited amino acid diversity at rapidly evolving positions within the capsid-binding v1 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For example, although single amino acid changes at residue 332 are responsible for dramatic differences in antiviral restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2006</xref>), this residue repeatedly toggles between just three amino acids. The limited diversity is not due to evolutionary inaccessibility, since most amino acids that can be sampled with single nucleotide changes are not observed among primate TRIM5α orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). There are two alternative explanations for this restricted diversity. First, it might suggest that adaptive gain-of-function mutations in TRIM5α are rare, with TRIM5α’s evolutionary landscape mainly consisting of fitness valleys with only a few mutational avenues to reach fitness peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Conversely, the limited diversity might be a consequence of epistatic interactions with other sites that constrain amino acid sampling, or even simple chance. Under this scenario, TRIM5α’s evolutionary landscape may consist of numerous, wide peaks that tolerate substantial mutational variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We sought to differentiate between these possibilities by experimentally defining the evolutionary landscape of antiviral restriction over all possible single mutational steps in the v1 loop of both human and rhesus TRIM5α.</p><p>We took a deep mutational scanning (DMS) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fowler et al., 2010</xref>) to measure the effect on antiviral restriction of all v1 loop single mutations in a pooled assay. We first generated a library of all single amino acid variants (including stop codons) within the rapidly evolving portion of the v1 loop (amino acids 330 to 340, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), with a library diversity of 231 amino acid (352 nucleotide) variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The resulting TRIM5α variants were stably expressed via transduction into CRFK (cat renal fibroblast) cells, which naturally lack TRIM5α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McEwan et al., 2009</xref>). We transduced CRFK cells at a low dose to limit the integration of multiple variants into individual cells, thus generating a pool of cells each expressing a single TRIM5α point mutant. Libraries were represented with at least 500-fold coverage through all experimental steps to avoid bottlenecking library diversity.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Selection scheme to identify human TRIM5α variants that gain HIV-1 restriction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A DMS library, encoding all single amino acid variants within the v1 loop (rapidly evolving sites are boxed), was generated by PCR with degenerate NNS codons.

To comprehensively assess how many single mutation variants of human TRIM5α had increased activity against HIV-1, we first performed a gain-of-function screen. We challenged the library of human TRIM5α variant-expressing cells with HIV-1 bearing a GFP reporter, at a dose infecting 98% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Because GFP expression becomes detectable only after integration of the HIV-1 proviral genome, cells expressing TRIM5α variants that restrict HIV-1 infection remain GFP-negative.

Therefore, to enrich for cells expressing <italic>bona fide</italic> restrictive TRIM5α variants, we sorted the GFP-negative cells from the first round of infection and subjected them to a second round of HIV-1-GFP infection and sorting. Following this second round of selection, we deep sequenced the TRIM5α variants in the GFP-negative cell population.

Despite the weak (~2 fold) restriction of HIV-1 by wildtype (WT) human TRIM5α, variants containing synonymous nucleotide changes (no amino acid changes compared to WT, blue) had significantly higher enrichment scores than those containing stop codons (p&lt;0.0001, student’s unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction), confirming that the assay worked as expected.</p><p>To investigate whether enrichment scores were truly representative of increased antiviral function, and to validate some of the novel amino acid changes that appeared to result in increased restriction, we made 16 targeted missense mutants from across the enrichment spectrum and challenged them individually with HIV-1-GFP. We determined their fold-restriction by determining the relative viral dose required to infect 10% of cells (ID<sub>10</sub>) expressing a TRIM5α variant compared to an empty vector control; a larger viral dose is required to overcome TRIM5α-mediated restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We confirmed that several previously described gain-of-function variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pham et al., 2013</xref>) had increased antiviral activity and were highly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>: G330E, R332P, R332E, R335E). Moreover, we identified novel amino acid mutations that significantly increased antiviral activity, such as R335A and G333D, whereas moderately enriched variants (e.g. G333Y, Q337N) had correspondingly modest gains in HIV-1 restriction. Indeed, enrichment scores and fold-restriction were highly correlated across all mutants tested (Spearman r = 0.90). Thus, enrichment scores accurately reflect antiviral activity, validating our approach to simultaneously identify all single mutants with increased HIV-1 restriction. Therefore, in subsequent analyses, we use enrichment scores as a proxy for the antiviral restriction activity of TRIM5α mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Most single mutations in the v1 loop improve human TRIM5α restriction of HIV-1</title><p>Based on the limited amino acid diversity among primate TRIM5α v1 loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>), we expected that our DMS assay would reveal only a few beneficial mutations that improve human TRIM5α restriction of HIV-1. Contrary to this expectation, we found that more than half of all missense variants (115, 57%) had enrichment scores that fell more than two standard deviations above WT TRIM5α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Even if we limited our analysis to amino acid variants that are evolutionarily accessible via single-nucleotide changes from the WT <italic>TRIM5α</italic> sequence, this ratio did not change substantially (32, 54%). These enrichment scores represent dramatic gains in HIV-1 restriction, with the most potent variants (R332P and R335A) improving HIV-1 restriction ~15 fold relative to WT (33- and 39-fold restriction, respectively). Our findings indicate that the fitness landscape of the v1 loop is not narrowly constrained, but rather is remarkably permissive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), in that most single amino acid changes not seen in natural sequences enhance the ability of human TRIM5α to restrict HIV-1. Thus, TRIM5α has the capacity to readily evolve antiviral potency against HIV-1 via single mutations.</p><p>We analyzed whether a common biochemical mechanism could explain the unexpectedly high fraction of restrictive TRIM5α variants. We found that increased expression levels could explain some of the improvement in HIV-1 restriction, although several mutations (G333D, G333Y) improved restriction without increasing expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). In contrast, most gains in HIV-1 restriction could be completely accounted for by a reduction in the electrostatic charge of the v1 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), regardless of expression level. Indeed, reducing the electrostatic charge always improved HIV-1 restriction, but did not always increase TRIM5α expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Among all variants tested, mutation of the positively-charged residues 332 or 335 from the WT arginine (R) to any amino acid except lysine (K) significantly improved HIV-1 restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>), consistent with previous reports on R332 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2006</xref>). Mutation of uncharged sites to K or R decreased TRIM5α restriction of HIV-1, whereas introducing a negatively charged aspartic acid (D) or glutamic acid (E) significantly increased HIV-1 restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Since our DMS assay tests only one mutation at a time, all mutations to D or E occur in the context of at least one proximal positively charged residue. Therefore, we infer that the position-independent benefit of introducing D or E derives from offsetting pre-existing positive charge in the v1 loop that is detrimental to HIV-1 restriction. Indeed, reducing the net charge of the v1 loop explains all the highest enrichment scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, we conclude that positive charge in the v1 loop is the dominant impediment to HIV-1 restriction by human TRIM5α.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Many single mutations improve human TRIM5α restriction of HIV-1, primarily by removal of positive charge.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Enrichment in the HIV-1 restrictor pool relative to WT (white) for each TRIM5α variant, arrayed by position mutated and amino acid mutation, is indicated by color intensity.

For example, despite its strict conservation in primate TRIM5α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), a glycine (G) at residue 333 compromises HIV-1 restriction. Mutation of G333 to most other amino acids significantly improves TRIM5α activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We confirmed this finding for several individual variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>: G333Y, G333D). We found a similar pattern for residue F339, which is disfavored for HIV-1 restriction, albeit not to the same extent as G333. Contrary to our initial expectations, there is only a weak association between rapidly evolving residues and residues whose mutation can significantly improve HIV-1 restriction: missense mutations in three of six rapidly evolving sites, versus one of five conserved sites, significantly improve HIV-1 restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This result suggests that conserved positions in the vicinity of rapidly evolving sites possess unexpected potential to improve antiviral potency.</p><p>We also tested whether beneficial mutations might have additive effects on HIV-1 restriction by human TRIM5α. We combined several gain-of-function variants with the R332P mutation, previously described to potently restrict HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yap et al., 2005</xref>). However, we found that no double mutants tested increased HIV-1 restriction beyond that of R332P alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Instead, combination of one gain-of-function variant (R335E) with R332P resulted in loss of protein expression and HIV-1 restriction. Previous reports also found that most beneficial mutations are either non-additive or interfering, identifying only one combination (R332G with R335G) that was partially additive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pham et al., 2013</xref>). Given that R332P is one of the strongest gain-of-function variants we identified, it remains possible that other, more modest gain-of-function variants might additively improve HIV-1 restriction. Nevertheless, these results suggest that single gain-of-function mutations, such as R332P, can confer most or all the increased HIV-1 restriction potential onto human TRIM5α. Thus, remarkably, human TRIM5α appears to be located only one mutational step away from fitness peaks in its evolutionary landscape of potential adaptation against HIV-1.</p><p>Finally, we investigated whether gain-of-function mutations for HIV-1 restriction also conferred protection against other lentiviruses. We focused on lentiviruses whose restriction is v1 loop-dependent: either the entire v1 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) or the R332P mutation from rhesus TRIM5α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stremlau et al., 2005</xref>) could confer human TRIM5α with substantial antiviral function. In each case, WT human TRIM5α only weakly restricts these lentiviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, the charge-altering mutations R332P and R335A increased restriction of all lentiviruses we tested, including HIV-2, SIVcpz (SIV infecting chimpanzees), and SIVmac (SIV infecting rhesus macaques). Introduction of negative charge (R332E, R335E, G330E, G333D, and G337D) also selectively improved restriction of HIV-1, SIVcpz, and HIV-2 but not SIVmac. Thus, positive charge at positions 332 and 335 appears to be generally detrimental for lentiviral restriction. Furthermore, although TRIM5α fitness landscapes are lentivirus-specific, many of the mutations we tested increased restriction against other lentiviruses. These data suggest that the evolutionary landscape for lentiviral restriction by TRIM5α is likely to be generally permissive, as it is for HIV-1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Evolutionary landscapes are generally permissive for evolving novel lentiviral restriction, which is resilient to most mutations once achieved.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CRFK cells expressing the indicated human TRIM5α variant were challenged with GFP-marked lentiviral VLPs to determine fold-restriction as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>.

However, these gains might be just as easily lost through further mutation, since rapidly evolving antiviral proteins like TRIM5α continually adapt in their arms race with viruses. Therefore, in order to test whether newly acquired antiviral potency is fragile or resistant to mutation, we investigated the mutational resilience of the R332P variant of human TRIM5α, which inhibits HIV-1 ~15 fold more than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). To do so, we generated a v1 DMS library of human TRIM5α with R332P fixed in all variants. We challenged this pooled cell library with HIV-1-GFP, at a viral titer which human TRIM5α-R332P restricts to ~1% infection. In this case, we sorted and deep sequenced GFP-positive cells, so that enrichment (relative to initial representation) now reflects the degree to which each TRIM5α-R332P variant lost its antiviral function against HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

However, we found no other consistent biochemical constraints for HIV-1 restriction by TRIM5α-R332P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). Indeed, we found that the majority of missense variants (65%) did not weaken HIV-1 restriction by the R332P variant of human TRIM5α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, WT human TRIM5α is only one mutational step away from a fitness peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that, once achieved, also exhibits a surprising degree of resilience to mutation. This implies that gains of restriction by TRIM5α are not likely to be compromised by its continued adaptation.</p><p>To determine if HIV-1 restriction is also resilient to mutation in a naturally occurring TRIM5α variant, we next assessed the likelihood that random mutations disrupt viral restriction by WT rhesus macaque TRIM5α, which strongly restricts HIV-1 in a manner that strictly requires the v1 loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sawyer et al., 2005</xref>). Like with human TRIM5α, we constructed a library of cells each expressing a single rhesus TRIM5α variant, with each variant containing a single mutation in the v1 loop (note that the v1 loop is slightly longer in macaques compared to humans, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then challenged this pool of cells with HIV-1-GFP and sorted GFP-positive cells for subsequent deep sequencing.

Their loss of HIV-1 restriction cannot be explained by loss of expression or protein stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Two variants (P334M, G335I) enriched one standard deviation above WT correspondingly retained only partial HIV-1 restriction relative to WT rhesus TRIM5α. The eight remaining variants retained HIV-1 inhibition, consistent with their lack of enrichment relative to WT. Based on this validation, we conclude that roughly half of all v1 loop single point mutations do not significantly reduce HIV-1 restriction by rhesus TRIM5α. Thus, a natural rhesus TRIM5α antiviral variant, much like the human TRIM5α-R332P variant, displays considerable mutational resilience.</p><p>We expected that conserved residues should be less tolerant of changes than rapidly evolving sites. However, we found that mutations in only three of seven conserved sites, versus two of six rapidly evolving sites, led to significant loss of function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that rhesus TRIM5α restriction of HIV-1 is highly robust to changes within the critical v1 loop at both rapidly evolving and conserved sites. The biochemical preferences for HIV-1 restriction are similar but not identical between rhesus and human TRIM5α. In both cases, the introduction of positive charge, particularly R, weakened HIV-1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, the introduction of bulky hydrophobic residues, including leucine (L), phenylalanine (F), and tryptophan (W), significantly impaired HIV-1 restriction by rhesus TRIM5α but did not affect the potency of human TRIM5α.

However, some missense mutations dramatically reduced N-MLV restriction, affirming that the v1 loop is indeed critical for inhibition of N-MLV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). In particular, hydrophobic and especially aromatic residues at most positions in the v1 loop significantly decreased N-MLV restriction. This preference against aromatic residues is similar between HIV-1 and N-MLV restriction. However, N-MLV restriction is insensitive to the introduction of positively charged residues, which disrupt HIV-1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results indicate that the evolutionary landscape for rhesus TRIM5α against N-MLV is distinct from that of HIV-1. Nevertheless, the overall degree of mutational resilience against both viruses is remarkably similar: less than half of all missense mutations disrupt restriction of either virus.</p><p>Human TRIM5α restriction of N-MLV was even more resilient to mutation than rhesus TRIM5α. Almost all variants (187, 92%) had no effect on N-MLV restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Indeed, our selection for non-restrictive variants only strongly enriched for stop codons. This extreme mutational resilience may reflect the massive potency (&gt;250 fold restriction, data not shown) of human TRIM5α against N-MLV, and/or a decreased reliance on the v1 loop for N-MLV recognition by human TRIM5α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perron et al., 2006</xref>). We validated several human TRIM5α mutants as retaining nearly WT levels of N-MLV restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Thus, both rhesus and human TRIM5α inhibition of N-MLV is highly resistant to mutations, allowing mutational flexibility without loss of pre-existing antiviral restriction. These results, in conjunction with the substitution tolerance of HIV-1 restriction by human R332P and WT rhesus TRIM5α, indicate that mutational resilience is a general property of TRIM5α’s rapidly evolving v1 loop.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Antiviral restriction factors are locked in high-stakes tit-for-tat evolutionary arms races with target viruses. However, viruses would appear to have the upper hand in these battles because of their higher mutation rates, shorter generation times, and larger population sizes. Although host genomes have the advantage of encoding a diverse, polygenic immune response, evolutionary constraints acting on innate immune genes could curtail their adaptive potential. Here, using deep-mutational scanning approaches combined with viral infection assays, we investigated the evolutionary landscape of adaptation of the most rapidly evolving segment, the disordered v1 loop, of the retroviral restriction factor TRIM5α. We focused on this loop because of its critical role in adapting to changing viral repertoires.</p><p>We found two attributes of this evolutionary landscape that favor host immune evolution. First, human TRIM5α readily gains significant HIV-1 restriction: roughly half of all single missense mutations allow human TRIM5α to better restrict HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Based on our results, we infer that positive charge is the dominant impediment to HIV-1 inhibition in human TRIM5α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Removal of this positive charge improved human TRIM5α restriction not only of HIV-1 but also of multiple lentiviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Recent findings revealed that cyclophilin A (CypA) protects the HIV-1 capsid from TRIM5α recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Selyutina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Veillette et al., 2013</xref>). Although structural studies currently lack sufficient resolution to observe the molecular details of the TRIM5α–capsid interaction, we speculate that positive charge in the v1 loop impairs an interaction between TRIM5α and the capsid’s CypA-binding site via electrostatic repulsion. Alternatively, the detrimental effect of positive charge might largely be accounted for by lowering TRIM5α expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Increasing human TRIM5α expression has been shown to improve HIV-1 restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richardson et al., 2014</xref>), although we identified at least one mutation (V340H) that improved expression without increasing activity against HIV-1 and at least one mutation (G333D) that reduced positive charge and improved HIV-1 restriction without increasing expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, our comprehensive DMS analyses also revealed that both rapidly evolving and conserved residues can contribute to antiviral adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). For instance, many variants at position 333 of human TRIM5α led to increased restriction of HIV-1 and other lentiviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). Thus, it is unclear why simian primates have retained a glycine at this position (333 in human, 335 in macaques). One possibility is that changes in this residue might be generally deleterious for TRIM5α function, yet subsequent analyses revealed little or no impairment of TRIM5α antiviral functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). More broadly, we identified many v1 loop mutations that improved human TRIM5α restriction of HIV-1, and even other lentiviruses, without impairing N-MLV antiviral function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This permissivity stands in stark contrast to the natural evolution of TRIM5α, which has sampled relatively limited amino acid diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The discrepancy might be explained by recurrent selection by a viral lineage distinct from the viruses we tested here (HIV-1 and N-MLV). For example, since the critical R332 was fixed at the common ancestor of humans, chimps, and bonobos ~7 million years ago, it is possible that R332 improved restriction of a paleovirus that has since gone extinct. Alternatively, TRIM5α’s constrained natural evolution could reflect a cellular function independent of viral capsid recognition. For example, TRIM5α has been shown to induce some innate immune signaling even in the absence of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lascano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pertel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tareen and Emerman, 2011</xref>). Many gain-of-antiviral-function mutations increased TRIM5α expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), and this increased expression might increase aberrant signaling by TRIM5α, driving chronic immune activation that can be costly for the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okin and Medzhitov, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our analyses uncovered a second unexpected, advantageous aspect of TRIM5α’s evolutionary landscape: its antiviral restriction displays remarkable mutational resilience across multiple orthologs and against two divergent retroviruses. 51–92% of all possible missense variants retain antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This resilience is manifest even when potent antiviral activity is newly acquired via a single mutation, as with the R332P variant of human TRIM5α against HIV-1. Therefore, we conclude that the fitness landscape of TRIM5α's rapidly evolving v1 loop resembles 'rolling hills' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), in which valleys are infrequent and only one evolutionary step removed from mutationally tolerant plateaus.</p><p>TRIM5α's permissive landscape contrasts with the relative inflexibility of ligand-binding domains in the core of evolutionarily conserved proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McLaughlin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suckow et al., 1996</xref>). However, these studies found increased mutational tolerance in peripheral, disordered loops not involved in critical functions like ligand recognition, where mutations are less likely to disrupt protein structure. The use of flexible loops for viral ligand binding by TRIM5α, as well as MxA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mitchell et al., 2012</xref>), thus grants rapidly evolving restriction factors mutational flexibility without significant risk of disrupting core protein structure. Nevertheless, the degree of mutational plasticity in TRIM5α's v1 loop is remarkable given that this loop is essential for ligand binding, suggesting that even functional constraints do not narrow its evolutionary landscape. Intriguingly, TRIM5α's reliance on the v1 loop for specificity mirrors that of antibodies' dependence on complementarity-defining loops for antigen recognition. Indeed, a high degree of mutational tolerance within complementarity-defining loops allows somatic hypermutation to significantly increase antibody-antigen affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daugherty et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">NISC Comparative Sequencing Program et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our analyses reveal not only many paths for TRIM5α to gain antiviral function but also an unexpectedly low probability of losing antiviral function via single mutations. Such landscapes should be highly advantageous to host genomes in evolutionary arms races with viruses. Mutational tolerance allows the accumulation of neutral variants that do not compromise antiviral function among antiviral genes in a population. Many of these novel variants may carry the capacity to restrict additional viruses, whether these result from cross-species transmissions or mutations that allow species-matched viruses to evade recognition by the dominant antiviral allele. Indeed, mutational tolerance has been shown to facilitate the evolution of de novo functions through the accumulation of neutral mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Draghi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayden et al., 2011</xref>). Although rare in human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clarke et al., 2017</xref>), extensive polymorphism within the v1 loop of TRIM5α in Old World monkeys results in diverse antiviral repertoires that have been maintained by balancing selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Newman et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, TRIM5α appears to evolve with low-cost, high-gain fitness landscapes that favor its success in co-evolutionary battles with rapidly evolving retroviruses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>TRIM5α</td><td>NCBI</td><td>NM_033034.2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Macaca mulatta)</italic></td><td>TRIM5α</td><td>NCBI</td><td>NM_001032910.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>DH5α</td><td>NEB</td><td>C2987H</td><td>Chemically competent cells</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK-293T/17</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-11268;

high-fidelity Q5 polymerase (NEB). Degenerate primers contained a single NNS codon (N = A/T/C/G, S = C/G), which encodes all 20 amino acids with only one stop codon among 32 possibilities. For each of the 11 or 13 codons in the v1 loop of human or rhesus TRIM5α, respectively, the two halves of TRIM5α (on either side of randomized codon) were amplified separately with shared flanking primers and unique internal primers for each codon (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). For the human TRIM5α library in which R332P was fixed, internal primers matched the R332P variant of TRIM5α and codon 332 was not randomized. Internal primers encoded NNS at the designated codon flanked by 17–25 nucleotides of homology on each side; the forward and reverse internal primers shared 17–25 nucleotides of homology with each other to promote hybridization between the N- and C-terminal PCR fragments. The codon-matched N- and C-terminal fragments were combined and amplified into a single fragment using the same flanking primers as in the first amplification. PCR products were gel purified and cloned via Gibson assembly (NEB) into pQCXIP-TRIM5α-HA of the matching species, which had been digested with NotI and BamHI and gel purified. Gibson assembly products were transformed into high-efficiency chemically competent DH5α (NEB) with 30 min of heat shock recovery. Serial dilutions were plated to count the number of unique colonies, and transformations were repeated until at least 100x library coverage was achieved (human: 32 × 11×100=3.52×10<sup>4</sup> colonies; rhesus: 32 × 13×100=4.16×10<sup>4</sup> colonies). To ensure library quality, 40 random colonies were sequenced from each library. Clones were verified to have insert by analytical restriction digest, and the coding sequence was fully sequenced to ensure that (1) each clone had only one mutation, (2) there were no mutations outside the v1 loop, and (3) the number of sites mutated once, twice, etc. among these 40 clones approximated a Poisson distribution. When libraries met these criteria, colonies were scraped from all transformation plates and plasmids were directly purified, without further growth to avoid amplification bias, using NucleoBond Xtra midiprep kits (Takara Bio).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell lines</title><p>HEK-293T/17 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1926">CVCL_1926</ext-link>) and CRFK (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_2426">CVCL_2426</ext-link>) cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and not further authenticated; cells were confirmed to be mycoplasma free by MycoProbe kit (R and D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cells were grown on tissue-culture treated plates in high-glucose and L-glutamine containing DMEM (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 1x penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher). Cells were grown at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in humidified incubators and passaged by digestion with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher). Cell counting was performed using a TC20 automated cell counter (BioRad, Hercules, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Virus production, titering, and transduction</title><p>HEK-293T/17 were seeded at 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in 6-well plates the day prior to transfection. Transfections were performed with Trans-IT 293T transfection reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer’s instructions, using 3 µL reagent per µg DNA. All transfected DNA was purified using PureYield mini or NuceloBond midi kits to minimize LPS contamination and quantified by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher) A260. To produce HIV-1, each well was transfected with 1 µg of p8.9NdSB, 667 ng of pHIV-ZsGreen, and 333 ng of pMD2.G. N-MLV transfections contained 1 µg of pQCXIP-eGFP, 667 ng of pCIG3N, and 333 ng of pMD2.G. HIV-2, SIVcpz, and SIVmac transfections contained 1 µg of pALPS-eGFP, 333 ng of pMD2.G, and 667 ng of either p8.9NdSB HIV-2 CA, pHIV-Gb2, or pHIV-MAC, respectively. TRIM5α-transducing virus was produced using 1 µg of the appropriate TRIM5α construct, 600 ng of JK3, 300 ng of L-VSV-G, and 100 ng of CMV-Tat. After 24 hr, media was replaced with 1 mL of fresh media. Virus was harvested at 48 hr post-transfection. To harvest, cells were pelleted from virus-containing media at 500 x g, and supernatant was removed, aliquoted, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. To increase titers for HIV-2 and N-MLV, and in some cases HIV-1, virus was concentrated prior to freezing. To concentrate, virus was pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion at 23,000 rpm (~70,000 x g) for 1 hr at 4°C. Pellets were air dried for 5 min, and then resuspended in fresh media for 24 hr with periodic gentle vortexing.</p><p>All viruses were titered under conditions most closely mimicking their large-scale use. CRFK cells were seeded at 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL the day prior to transduction. Freshly thawed viruses were serially diluted and replaced cellular media at ½ x volume. No transducing reagent was used for GFP-marked retroviral VLPs; TRIM5α-transducing VLPs were supplemented with 10 µg/mL polybrene. Plates were centrifuged at 1100 x g for 30 min and then incubated at 37°C. The following day, virus was removed and cells were fed fresh media, which contained 6 µg/mL puromycin for TRIM5α-transducing VLPs only. For GFP-marked retroviral VLPs, transduction efficiency was monitored by flow cytometry 72 hr after transduction. For TRIM5α-transducing VLPs, cell survival was monitored daily by estimating cell confluence, until untransduced cells were completely dead (no surface-adhered cells). Media was replaced with fresh puromycin-containing media every 2–3 days, and cells were passaged into larger well format as needed. Multiplicity of infection (MOI) for serial dilutions was estimated by Poisson distribution; for example,~63% of cells are expected to be transduced at least once and thus survive selection with an MOI of 1.</p><p>To stably transduce TRIM5α variants, we chose an MOI of ~0.33 (25–30% survival during titering) to minimize multiple transductions per cell (&lt;5% probability). CRFK cells were seeded in six-well plates at 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well the day prior to transduction; for deep mutational scanning libraries, sufficient cells were seeded to generate at least 500x independent transductions for each nucleotide variant (32 codons x 13 sites x 500 ÷ 25% survival = 8.3×10<sup>5</sup> cells). Cells were transduced at the appropriate MOI with 10 µg/mL polybrene and spinoculation (1100 x g, 30 min), then underwent 6 µg/mL puromycin selection starting at 24 hr post-transduction and continuing until untransduced controls were completely dead (usually ~7 days). Upon completion of selection, surviving cells were pooled and maintained in 2 µg/mL puromycin. Passages always maintained at least 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells (1000x library coverage) to avoid bottlenecking library diversity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Deep mutational scan, sequencing, and enrichment calculation</title><p>CRFK cells expressing a TRIM5α deep mutational scanning library were seeded in 12-well plates at 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well the day prior to viral infection. Sufficient wells were seeded for at least 1000x library coverage among target cells to be sorted 4 days later (assuming at least two doublings in that time, with sorting frequency typically ~5% of cells as estimated beforehand by viral titering against DMS library-expressing cells). Thus, each biological replicate began with at least 2.4 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells (32 codons x 13 sites x 1000 ÷ 5% ÷ 4) seeded from the same CRFK library.</p><p>Libraries were infected with HIV-1-GFP or N-MLV-GFP the following day. For loss-of-restriction experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), we chose viral doses that were restricted by WT TRIM5α to &lt;1%, as determined during preliminary titering experiments. For gain-of-HIV-1-restriction by human TRIM5α, we chose a viral dose in which WT TRIM5α was infected to ~98%, in order to minimize uninfected GFP-negative cells. Infection efficiency was monitored by parallel infection of controls (empty vector, WT TRIM5α, uninfected negative control). Cells were infected by spinoculation (1100 x g, 30 min) and media was replaced 24 hr post-infection. Infected cells were incubated an additional 48 hr to increase GFP expression levels. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, pelleted, and vigorously resuspended as well as filtered (0.7 µm) to minimize aggregation. Cells were FACS sorted, with stringent gating on size, single cells, and presence or absence of GFP (for loss- or gain-of-restriction, respectively). At least 4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells (1000x library coverage) were sorted for each biological replicate. For gain-of-HIV-1-restriction by human TRIM5α, sorted GFP-negative cells were pelleted and re-seeded at 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well for a second round of infection, at the same dose, the following day, in order to enrich true restrictors and deplete cells uninfected by chance. Infection, harvest, and FACS sorting were all performed identically, except that apparent HIV-1 restriction by pooled variants was improved in the second round of enrichment (~50% GFP-negative compared to ~10% in the first round of infection). Sorted cells were pelleted, resuspended in PBS, and genomic DNA was harvested using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Input samples were harvested from infected but unsorted cells for each replicate.</p><p>Illumina libraries were constructed from genomic DNA by 2-step PCR amplification using Q5 polymerase. The first PCR amplified the v1 loop of TRIM5α and added adapters; the second set of PCR primers annealed to these adapters and added a unique 8 bp i7 Nextera barcode as well as P5 and P7 adapters for flow cell binding (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Genomic DNA from each sample (two input replicates, two sorted replicates for each experiment) was amplified in three separate PCR tubes, with 500 ng of genomic DNA per tube, to offset random PCR jackpotting. This sampled a total of 1.5 µg of DNA, which represents ~500 x library coverage, assuming 6.6 pg gDNA/cell and a single TRIM5α integration/cell. After 15 cycles of amplification, samples were digested for 15 min at 37°C with 5 µL of ExoI (NEB) to remove first round primers. PCR products were then pooled from triplicate tubes, purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and the entire elution was divided between three separate PCR tubes for 18 cycles of second round amplification. Barcoded PCR products (234 bp) were pooled from triplicate tubes and purified by double-sided size selection using Ampure beads (Beckman Coulter, Pasadena, CA). In brief, large DNA was removed by incubation with 0.8x bead volume and magnetization; PCR products were bound from the supernatant with 1.5x bead volume, washed with 80% ethanol, and eluted in water. PCR product purity was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Samples were then pooled at equimolar ratios and Illumina sequenced (MiSeq-v2) with single-end reads. Estimated read depth (equally distributed between libraries) always exceeded 1 million counts per library to ensure &gt;1000 x coverage, on average, per nucleotide sequence. One read was generated using the i7 index primer for the 8 bp barcode, and a second read used a custom sequencing primer, which annealed immediately adjacent to the v1 loop (33 bp read for human, 39 bp for rhesus TRIM5α). PhiX was included at 15% in sequencing runs to increase per-bp-diversity, since the majority (10/11 for human or 12/13 for rhesus) of reads should not randomize any given codon.</p><p>Reads counts for each unique nucleotide sequence from all four samples in an experiment were compiled into a single tsv file. Sequences that differed from WT by more than one codon, or sequences in which codons did not end in C or G, were filtered from the dataset; these largely had only a few reads per sample and represented sequencing errors. Reads counts were normalized to total counts per million (cpm) within each barcoded sample. Sequences with low read counts (&lt;50 cpm) were excluded as they were found to introduce noise (poor correlation between replicates and across codons). Enrichment was calculated as the ratio of sorted to input cpm. The average and standard deviation of enrichment was calculated across both replicates of all synonymous codons to determine statistics at the amino acid level, except for WT variants, where we show each synonymous variant separately (averaged across replicates) to better visualize WT variance. Amino acid enrichment values were plotted in waterfall plots (descending order of enrichment), scatter plots (comparing replicates), and double-gradient heat maps (comparing amino acid variants at each position, with baseline value [white] set to the average for WT enrichment) using GraphPad Prism.

CRFK lines were seeded in 96-well plates at 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well the day prior to transduction. Media was removed and replaced with serial 3-fold dilutions of the appropriate GFP-marked retrovirus. Serial dilutions were started at titers that yielded ~95% infection in untransduced CRFK. Plates were centrifuged at 1100 x g for 30 min and then incubated at 37°C. The following day, virus was removed and cells were fed fresh media. Cells were harvested by trypsinization 72 hr after transduction and analyzed by flow cytometry for GFP fluorescence. Cells were gated on size (FSC vs. SSC), single cells (FSC height vs. area), and GFP-positive as compared to negative control (FITC vs. PE empty channel).</p><p>Fold inhibition was calculated by comparing ID<sub>10</sub>, the amount of virus required to infect 10% of cells, between TRIM5α and empty vector. Infection (% GFP-positive) was plotted against viral dose, both on logarithmic scale, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. Infection points &lt; 0.5% or &gt; 50% GFP-positive were excluded due to increased noise or curve saturation, respectively, yielding a simple linear relationship between viral dose and % GFP-positive; infections without at least three data points in this range were excluded from further analysis. A linear regression (against log-transformed data) was then used to calculate the viral dose corresponding to 10% infection (back-calculated to linear scale), and the dose for TRIM5α was divided by that for empty vector. This method was used to calculate fold inhibition for all viruses except human TRIM5α against N-MLV, as we could not consistently achieve infection greater than 1% for WT human TRIM5α; we therefore report raw infection data. All fold inhibitions were calculated from at least three independent experiments, which were performed either in biological singlicate or duplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunoblot</title><p>CRFK cells stably expressing TRIM5α-HA variants were harvested by trypsinization, washed in PBS, and counted; 10<sup>6</sup> cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in 100 µL pre-chilled lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X100, 1x cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche, Basel, Switzerland]). Lysates were pelleted at 20,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. Supernatants were quantified by Bradford protein assay (BioRad) and normalized to load equal protein across all samples (usually 10–25 µg per lane).

innovations in the virus. However, the time scales for host and viral evolution are quite discrepant, raising the question of how a slower evolving host can adapt its restriction factors to rapidly evolving viruses. Here, Tenthorey et al. use the antiviral restriction factor TRIM5α as a model to demonstrate that key regions of TRIM5 are resilient to high rates of mutagenesis, thus providing an evolutionary explanation for how hosts are able to &quot;keep pace&quot; with the viruses that infect them.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mutational resilience of antiviral restriction favors primate TRIM5α in host-virus evolutionary arms races&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Lionel Berthoux (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Previous studies have used random mutagenesis to isolate mutants in the v1 loop of TRIM5α with increased antiviral function. Here, using infection-based functional screening of v1 loop mutant libraries, coupled with deep sequencing, the authors are able to generate a thorough analysis of mutations resulting in gain or loss of antiviral function. Key insights from the study are that (1) human TRIM5α exists in a &quot;poised&quot; sequence space, where missense mutations often exhibit potential for gain-of-function against diverse lentiviruses, and (2) that this sequence space is resilient to perturbation from missense mutations. This study contributes new insight to our understanding of the accessible sequence space of a rapidly-evolving region of a model restriction factor in the context of viral infection.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>It is requested that the authors provide either new experimental data or additional scholarly discussion to address the following major criticisms of the study:</p><p>1) The premise of the article is that rapidly adapting residues in the v1 loop of TRIM5 α must have appeared repeatedly due to intrinsic mutational constraint. Upon testing this possibility, the authors found the opposite; TRIM5α is mutationally resilient in its v1 loop. The shortcoming of this submission is that there is a disconnect between the results generated by the artificial mutagenesis of TRIM5α and the actual evolutionary trajectory of TRIM5α in primates. Since loops in proteins are known to be generally flexible, it is not very surprising that the v1 loop of TRIM5α is mutationally resilient.</p><p>2) It would be helpful if the authors could provide clarity on the possible relationship between expression, charge, and anti-HIV1 activity. While the authors demonstrate that charge correlates with antiviral potency of human TRIM5α variants towards HIV-1 (Figure 3E) and that several LOF Rhesus TRIM5α variants express at WT levels (Figure 5C), it is still possible that in most cases charge of human TRIM5α influences expression/stability, which in turn influences antiviral potency. In Figure 3—figure supplement 1, the authors show that &quot;some but not all&quot; GOF mutations increase TRIM5α expression level – what is the Spearman for Figure 3—figure supplement 1B? Expression and potency still seem to correlate well, albeit with outliers.</p><p>3) Based on a small experiment combining R332P with a few other possible mutations, the authors conclude that the antiviral effects of mutations in the v1 loop are not additive. This is premature, as many other combinations of mutants could be tested. The lack of additive effects might be specific to the R332P mutant. Previous literature is also misquoted in this paragraph. Pham et al. (2010, 2013) did, in fact, report that some beneficial mutations were partly additive (R332G + R335G in particular).</p><p>4) As mentioned above, the findings are in stark contrast with the patterns of natural evolution in TRIM5α, where the v1 loop toggles between a select few amino acid residues at specific sites. Please provide more discussion of why the gain-of-function residues identified artificially do not occur naturally.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>The editors are sensitive to the fact that labs may not be able to perform certain experiments in the current COVID-19 climate. The following comment would appear to require additional experiments. However, if the authors are able to address this point in the current manuscript by leveraging previous studies on known TRIM5 mutants that alter charge, that would be a reasonable alternative.</p><p>Specifically, there is no experimental consideration for lentiviral capsid sequence or capsid net charge to accompany the finding that the net charge of the v1 loop of TRIM5α is important for anti-lentiviral restriction. The authors claim that the mutational resilience of TRIM5α makes it more poised for success in host-virus arms races but they do not yet provide any experimental support for this statement. Please consider experiments that discuss this issue.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59988.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>It is requested that the authors provide either new experimental data or additional scholarly discussion to address the following major criticisms of the study:</p><p>1) The premise of the article is that rapidly adapting residues in the v1 loop of TRIM5α must have appeared repeatedly due to intrinsic mutational constraint.

Indeed, the disconnect between the mutationally permissive and resilient landscape we identify by DMS and the actual evolutionary history of TRIM5α is one of the most surprising and interesting results in our manuscript. As suggested in point 4 below, we have added additional discussion to the Discussion section to further describe hypotheses for how this difference might arise, such as additional selective constraints on TRIM5α that are independent of restriction of modern retroviruses and potential fitness costs to the host.</p><p>We wish to expand on the second point made by the reviewers, who correctly point out that protein loops have been shown to exhibit more mutational flexibility. However, this flexibility largely reflects the <italic>structural</italic> pliability of such loops, which can mutate without affecting the structure of the protein core. Most previously studied proteins did not rely on loops for critical functions like ligand binding. In contrast, TRIM5α is unusual in that its v1 loop is itself essential for ligand (capsid) binding. Therefore, we expected less mutational flexibility than previously studied loops due to <italic>functional</italic> constraints on a ligand-binding domain. Nevertheless, we found that the v1 loop is exceptionally resilient to mutation, which makes our finding very surprising and quite unusual. We have modified the Discussion to more clearly make this important point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be helpful if the authors could provide clarity on the possible relationship between expression, charge, and anti-HIV1 activity. While the authors demonstrate that charge correlates with antiviral potency of human TRIM5α variants towards HIV-1 (Figure 3E) and that several LOF Rhesus TRIM5α variants express at WT levels (Figure 5C), it is still possible that in most cases charge of human TRIM5α influences expression/stability, which in turn influences antiviral potency. In Figure 3—figure supplement 1, the authors show that &quot;some but not all&quot; GOF mutations increase TRIM5α expression level – what is the Spearman for Figure 3—figure supplement 1B? Expression and potency still seem to correlate well, albeit with outliers.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we have added two panels to Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D to assess whether or not decreased charge is linked to increased expression level. We find that decreasing the net charge of the v1 loop, at least among the variants we tested, always increases HIV-1 restriction but does not always increase expression. We clarify this point with the following text: “Indeed, reducing the electrostatic charge always improved HIV-1 restriction, but did not always increase TRIM5α expression level (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-D).” We have also added text to the Discussion to describe how the detrimental effect of positive charge might largely be accounted for by lowering TRIM5α expression level (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-D) and have cited additional references. Finally, as suggested by the reviewers, we have now also added a Spearman correlation (r = 0.80) to Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, which confirms our analysis that some, but not all, of the gain-of-function variants can be explained by increased expression levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Based on a small experiment combining R332P with a few other possible mutations, the authors conclude that the antiviral effects of mutations in the v1 loop are not additive. This is premature, as many other combinations of mutants could be tested. The lack of additive effects might be specific to the R332P mutant. Previous literature is also misquoted in this paragraph. Pham et al., 2010, 2013, did, in fact, report that some beneficial mutations were partly additive (R332G + R335G in particular).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this correction. We have acknowledged this partially additive combination in the text: “Previous reports also found that most beneficial mutations are either non-additive or interfering, identifying only one combination (R332G with R335G) that was partially additive (Li et al., 2006; Pham et al., 2010; 2013).”</p><p>We also appreciate the reviewers’ point that we showed a lack of additive effects for double mutants only in combination with R332P. In fact, we think this is one of the most interesting features of the R332P mutation – this single mutation alone places human TRIM5α at a fitness peak! However, the reviewers correctly point out that we have not shown that other single mutations are already at their fitness peaks. We have therefore softened our conclusion to acknowledge this point, as follows: “Given that R332P is one of the strongest gain-of-function variants we identified, it remains possible that other, more modest gain-of-function variants might additively improve HIV-1 restriction. […] Thus, remarkably, human TRIM5α appears to be located only one mutational step away from fitness peaks in its evolutionary landscape of potential adaptation against HIV-1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As mentioned above, the findings are in stark contrast with the patterns of natural evolution in TRIM5α, where the v1 loop toggles between a select few amino acid residues at specific sites. Please provide more discussion of why the gain-of-function residues identified artificially do not occur naturally.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above (point 1), we agree with the reviewers that our findings are quite surprising in light of the constrained natural evolution of TRIM5α. The contrast between these patterns suggests that there are additional selective constraints driving TRIM5α evolution aside from the viral restriction activities tested in our paper. To acknowledge and speculate on those additional constraints, we have added extensive additional text to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>The editors are sensitive to the fact that labs may not be able to perform certain experiments in the current COVID-19 climate.

Specifically, we would propose to mutate positively charged residues within the HIV-1 capsid to neutrally charged amino acids in the regions thought to interact with TRIM5. Indeed, we have plans to undertake such a study that have been significantly delayed due to COVID-19-related restrictions.</p><p>Although we agree that an experimental test of the mutational resilience hypothesis would be desirable, this is a significant undertaking to address appropriately. Ideally, one would compare TRIM5α for success in host-virus arms races with another restriction factor that did not display mutational resilience, for example by comparing proportion of viral escape mutations during in vitro viral evolution. Such a system does not exist at present, as we have not yet identified (or tested for) a restriction factor that lacks mutational resilience.</p></body></sub-article></article>
