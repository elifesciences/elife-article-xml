functions during pathogenesis in both iron acquisition from lactoferrin (Lf), and in providing protection against the cationic antimicrobial peptide lactoferricin (Lfcn). While previous studies support a dual role for LbpB, exactly how these ligands interact with LbpB has remained unknown. Here, we present the structures of LbpB from <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> in complex with human holo-Lf, forming a 1:1 complex and confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography small-angle X-ray scattering. LbpB consists of N- and C-lobes with the N-lobe interacting extensively with the C-lobe of Lf. Our structures provide insight into LbpB’s preference towards holo-Lf, and our mutagenesis and binding studies show that Lf and Lfcn bind independently. Our studies provide the molecular details for how LbpB serves to capture and preserve Lf in an iron-bound state for delivery to the membrane transporter LbpA for iron piracy, and as an antimicrobial peptide sink to evade host immune defenses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Neisseria</kwd><kwd>lactoferrin binding protein b</kwd><kwd>iron scavenging</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial peptides</kwd><kwd>multidrug resistance</kwd><kwd>lactoferrin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007289</institution-id><institution>Purdue Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Noinaj</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name><name><surname>Yadav</surname><given-names>Ravi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011623</institution-id><institution>Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Noinaj</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name><name><surname>Yadav</surname><given-names>Ravi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006975</institution-id><institution>Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Noinaj</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and biophysical studies detail how Neisseria LbpB interacts with human lactoferrin for iron piracy and provides insight for how LbpB interacts with the antimicrobial peptide lactoferricin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There are 17 species of <italic>Neisseria</italic> that colonize humans with only two being pathogenic, <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seifert, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tone Tønjum, 2017</xref>). <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> asymptomatically colonizes ~10% of the world’s population, however, once pathogenic can lead to meningitidis and sepsis and lead to high fatality rates in the absence of immediate treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caugant and Brynildsrud, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Read, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Siddiqui et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> causes the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhoea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyajian et al., 2016</xref>). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have categorized <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> as an urgent threat to public health, which requires immediate and aggressive actions to combat the emerging antibiotic-resistant strains recently discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitolo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prevention (CDC), 2011</xref>). Although vaccines are now available against all pathogenic serogroups of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, there are well-documented drawbacks and limitations of these vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deasy and Read, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pizza et al., 2020</xref>). And despite decades of research, there is still no vaccine against gonococcal infections. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of new and improved therapeutics for protection against these human pathogens, particularly against <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>.</p><p>Acquisition of nutrients is an essential step during Neisserial pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stork et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zackular et al., 2015</xref>). Iron is an essential nutrient for survival, growth, and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grifantini et al., 2003</xref>). Given that free iron is essentially non-existent in the human host, <italic>Neisseria</italic> have evolved specialized surface receptors to hijack iron from host iron-binding proteins such as transferrin (Tf) and lactoferrin (Lf) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee and Schryvers, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schryvers and Lee, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schryvers and Morris, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yadav et al., 2019</xref>). One of the more well-studied metal acquisition systems in <italic>Neisseria</italic> is the transferrin-binding protein (Tbp) system, which consists of an a TonB-dependent transporter called TbpA and a lipoprotein co-receptor called TbpB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cornelissen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Irwin et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Noinaj et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noinaj et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Noinaj et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pintor et al., 1998</xref>). Here, TbpB serves to capture and deliver iron-loaded Tf to TbpA for iron extraction and import across the outer membrane in a process that requires energy from the Ton complex at the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cornelissen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cornelissen and Hollander, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Noinaj et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>A second analogous system is called the lactoferrin-binding protein (Lbp) system, which is composed of LbpA and LbpB, targets Lf as an iron source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biswas and Sparling, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray-Owen and Schryvers, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee and Schryvers, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Noinaj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schryvers et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schryvers and Morris, 1988</xref>). However, less is known structurally and functionally about the Lbp system as no structures of Lbp proteins in complex with Lf have been reported. While all strains of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> contain a functional Lbp system, it is only observed in roughly half of the <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biswas et al., 1999</xref>). Studies hint that the Lbp system may serve as a backup option to the Tbp system to assist in mediating pathogenesis within diverse host environments, as a Neisserial strain lacking the Tbp proteins were still able to use the Lbp proteins to cause infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>). Further, it was also shown that a strain expressing both systems was more competitive than a strain expressing just the Tbp system alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, anti-sera raised against the Lbp proteins displays bactericidal activity, exemplifying the promise of this system as a target for therapeutic intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pettersson et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lactoferrin-binding protein B (LbpB) forms a stable 1:1 complex with lactoferrin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The proposed role of Lbp system in iron acquisition from lactoferrin and protection from lactoferricin (Biorender).

This was partially confirmed when the structure of the N-lobe of LbpB was reported, showing conservation with the N-lobe of TbpB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brooks et al., 2014</xref>). However, reports have varied on the mode of interaction between LbpB and Lf. Docking studies predicted that N-lobe of Lf interacts with LbpB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arutyunova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brooks et al., 2014</xref>), while hydrogen-deuterium exchange studies, combined with site-directed mutagenesis, showed that the C-lobe of Lf interacts with LbpB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ostan et al., 2017</xref>). Homology modelling studies predicted that binding would align with that observed in TbpB–Tf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Noinaj et al., 2013</xref>), however, no structure of LbpB in complex with Lf has been reported.</p><p>In addition to its role in iron acquisition, LbpB has been shown to provide protection against the host cationic antimicrobial peptide lactoferricin (Lfcn), an 11-residue metabolized fragment from the N-lobe of Lf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morgenthau et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morgenthau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morgenthau et al., 2014b</xref>). Studies have been conflicting on exactly where LbpB interacts with Lfcn to neutralize this threat. One model proposes that it binds along the N-lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brooks et al., 2014</xref>), while another model points to several anionic regions along the C-lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morgenthau et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morgenthau et al., 2014b</xref>). In addition to protecting the surface of <italic>Neisseria</italic> directly, LbpB has been shown to also be proteolytically cleaved by NalP, which enables it to diffuse into the host environment to pre-emptively neutralize Lfcn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roussel-Jazédé et al., 2010</xref>). This additional role for LbpB serving as an antimicrobial peptide sink during Neisserial pathogenesis, in conjunction with its absence in many Neisserial strains despite LbpA being present, has cast some doubt onto its importance in iron import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morgenthau et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>To further characterize the role of LbpB in Neisserial pathogenesis, here we report the crystal structure of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> LbpB (<italic>Nm</italic>LbpB) in complex with Lf and the cryoEM structure of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> LbpB (<italic>Ng</italic>LbpB) in complex with Lf. Our structures were further confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS) studies which also indicated that Lf and Lfcn have non-overlapping binding sites on LbpB with a 1:1 binding ratio for each. Structure-guided mutagenesis studies then probed the binding interfaces between <italic>Nm</italic>LbpB and both Lf and Lfcn using biophysical and biochemical techniques. Our results support the model where LbpB serves dual functions, both in iron piracy from holo-Lf and as an antimicrobial peptide sink, during Neisserial pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Complex formation of Neisserial LbpB with human Lf</title><p>For complex formation and structural studies, we recombinantly expressed and purified the soluble construct of LbpB from <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> (<italic>Nm</italic>LbpB) (residues 20–737) and <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> (<italic>Ng</italic>LbpB) (residues 20–728) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

For large-scale studies, Lf was purchased and further purified using SEC. Complexes of LbpB with Lf were formed upon incubation of purified LbpB with an excess of Lf and separated using SEC, with the complex eluting as a left-shifted peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) analysis confirmed the peak contained both components and suggested a 1:1 stoichiometric complex for both the <italic>Nm</italic>LbpB and <italic>Ng</italic>LbpB complexes with Lf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Solution studies of LbpB complexes with Lf</title><p>It has been previously reported that <italic>Nm</italic>LbpB may have multiple Lf-binding sites and may form higher-order complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ostan et al., 2017</xref>). However, in our studies with complex formation by SEC, we observed that <italic>Nm</italic>LbpB appears to form a stable 1:1 complex with Lf. To further confirm this, we studied the stoichiometry of LbpB (<italic>Nm</italic> and <italic>Ng</italic>) in complex with Lf in solution using inline SEC-SAXS. The SAXS curve provides information about the shape, molecular weight, and maximum length of a protein or protein complex. It is a great tool for comparing the structural effects of different ligands bound LbpB and for comparing the structures of LbpB from <italic>Nm</italic> and <italic>Ng</italic> to determine how closely they match. Further, SAXS allows us to compare how closely our structures match what is observed in solution by seeing how well the simulated SAXS curve from our structure fits the experimental SAXS curve. For our experiments here, our SEC-SAXS studies showed that the individual LbpB and Lf proteins existed as monomers in solution, while the <italic>Nm</italic>LbpB–Lf complex had an experimental molecular weight of 159.6 kDa corresponding to 1:1 stoichiometry complex of <italic>Nm</italic>LbpB and Lf (calculated molecular weight is 156.6 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). The calculated radius of gyration (<italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub>) and maximal intramolecular dimension (<italic>D</italic><sub>max</sub>) are both consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometric complex.

The N-lobe of <italic>Nm</italic>LbpB is composed of residues 1–342 forming two domains, an N-terminal handle domain (residues 45–173) and an eight-stranded β-barrel domain (residues 174–342). The handle domain contains four anti-parallel β-strands and an α-helix between β-strand 1 and 2. The β-barrel domain is packed against the β-sheet of handle domain. The C-lobe of <italic>Nm</italic>LbpB is composed of residues 359–718 and found largely disordered in the crystal structure as evident from higher <italic>B</italic>-factors for this region compared to the rest of the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The C-lobe also contains a handle domain (residues 359–540) and an eight-stranded β-barrel domain (residues 541–718). While the C-lobe β-barrel domain shares homology with the N-lobe β-barrel domain, the C-lobe handle domain is different as it is composed of a six-stranded β-sheet packed against the β-barrel domain and flanked by two antiparallel β-strands. Importantly, the C-lobe of LbpB contains several long anionic loops, however, none of these were observed in the electron density likely due to their flexibility.</p><p>The Lf structure also consists of N- and C-lobes with each lobe further divided into two subdomains termed N1 and N2 (N-lobe) and C1 and C2 (C-lobe).

Albeit to varying levels, these mutants all expressed and could be purified using the same method as for wild type, indicating they were stably folded. We then analyzed the effects of these deletions on Lfcn binding in comparison to wild type using ITC analysis on a Nano ITC instrument (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and SI Table S7). Our results show that Lfcn binds to wild-type <italic>Nm</italic>LbpB with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 3.7 μM, a Δ<italic>H</italic> of −11.4 kcal/mol, and an <italic>n</italic> value of ~1. The loop deletions Δ372–383, Δ416–418, Δ561–565, Δ594–599, and Δ665–698, however, showed only minimal differences in Δ<italic>H</italic> and no significant change in <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>, except for Δ445–526 (Δ<italic>H</italic> of −9.6 kcal/mol and a ~2.5-fold increase in <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>). All <italic>n</italic> values here are larger than 1 and roughly twofold higher than that observed with Lf (<italic>n</italic> value slightly below 1), an observation we attribute to inaccuracies in using absorbance measurements at <italic>λ</italic><sub>280</sub> for determining protein and peptide concentrations. Loops containing residues 445–526 and 665–698 contain charged patches that have been shown to affect Lfcn binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morgenthau et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ostan et al., 2017</xref>), however, individually removing them did not appear to abrogate binding in our study. However, a double loop-deletion mutant Δ445–526_Δ665–698 showed a significantly reduced Δ<italic>H</italic> with only barely detectable binding. This confirms that these two loops together contribute to Lfcn binding in LbpB, which is likely mediated by the charged residues they contain. Exactly how Lfcn binding is mediated though by these loops will require additional structural studies.</p><p>Our SEC-SAXS experiments suggested that Lf and Lfcn had distinct, non-competing, binding sites on LbpB. Therefore, we next performed ITC experiments using a Nano ITC instrument to determine the binding properties of Lf to <italic>Nm</italic>LbpB in the absence or presence of Lfcn. Our results show that Lf binds to <italic>Nm</italic>LbpB alone with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 0.45 μM and a Δ<italic>H</italic> of −15.1 kcal/mol (SI Table S8). Nearly identical binding parameters are observed for Lf binding to the preformed <italic>Nm</italic>LbpB–Lfcn complex, indicating that the presence of Lfcn has no effect on Lf binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and SI Table S8). We next tested the effect of the presence of Lf on Lfcn binding. Our earlier results showed that Lfcn binds to <italic>Nm</italic>LbpB alone with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 3.7 μM and a Δ<italic>H</italic> of −11.4 kcal/mol, while here we found that Lfcn binds to the <italic>Nm</italic>LbpB–Lf complex with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 7.3 μM and a Δ<italic>H</italic> of −10.6 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and SI Table S8). Only ~ twofold difference in <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> was observed here, however, no change in Δ<italic>H</italic> indicating that binding of Lfcn to <italic>Nm</italic>LbpB is not disrupted in the presence of Lf.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The role of LbpB in Neisserial pathogenesis has been debated over the years given that it appears to share many properties with TbpB, which is involved in iron scavenging from Tf, but has also been shown to be important in protecting against the host antimicrobial peptide Lfcn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morgenthau et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morgenthau et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roussel-Jazédé et al., 2010</xref>). For its iron import role, studies have indicated that LbpB may bind multiple copies of Lf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ostan et al., 2017</xref>). However, our studies here strongly support that LbpB binds Lf in a 1:1 complex, which is demonstrated by our SEC, SAXS, X-ray crystal structure, and cryoEM structure. Further, our ITC experiments also demonstrate 1:1 binding properties with an <italic>n</italic> value (molar ratio) of ~1.</p><p>Our structures align well with the previously reported N-lobe only structure of LbpB (PDB ID 4U9C) with an RMSD of 0.34 Å (for 261 Cα atoms) compared to our <italic>Nm</italic>LbpB crystal structure. Additionally, <italic>Nm</italic>LbpB aligns well with <italic>Nm</italic>TbpB (PDB ID 3V8U) with an overall RMSD of 1.8 Å. The interacting lobes from LbpB–Lf and TbpB–Tf (PDB ID 3VE1) have an overall RMSD of 1.4 Å, further evidence that the Lbp and Tbp systems likely share a common mechanism in iron acquisition from their respective host iron-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray-Owen and Schryvers, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Noinaj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schryvers and Lee, 1989</xref>). Here, surface anchored LbpB would selectively accumulate iron-bound Lf, preserving the bound iron for eventual import by LbpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calmettes et al., 2012</xref>). This would ensure efficiency in iron scavenging for survival during pathogenesis since TbpA (and likely LbpA) can also bind with high affinity apo-Tf/Lf which lacks iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noinaj et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Powell et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Unlike TbpB, LbpB has also been implicated in mediating evasion of the host immune responses during infection by specifically neutralizing the antimicrobial peptide Lfcn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morgenthau et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ostan et al., 2017</xref>). This may occur at the surface of the pathogen or in solution following cleavage and release by NalP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morgenthau et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roussel-Jazédé et al., 2010</xref>). Exactly how LbpB interacts with Lfcn has not been fully resolved, however, studies have pointed to several charged patches on the C-lobe as mediating this interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morgenthau et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ostan et al., 2017</xref>). Further, we report here that the loop containing the smaller charged region (residues 665–698) alone has little effect on Lfcn binding compared to wild type, yet does appear to synergize binding with the loop consisting of 445–526. Together, our structural studies, mutagenesis, and binding studies agree with the earlier reports and allow us to conclude that Lfcn specifically interacts with the C-lobe only of LbpB through primarily two loops consisting of residues 445–526 and 665–698. It has been shown that LbpB can protect against other peptides as well, however, whether binding of these other peptides involves the same loops or charged interfaces remains to be determined. The presence of Lf had little effect on the binding of Lfcn and vice versa, demonstrating that each have non-overlapping and non-competing binding sites, refuting the previous notion that both may share a common binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brooks et al., 2014</xref>). While we were able to grow crystals in the presence of Lfcn, the loops along the putative binding interface lacked sufficient density to observe the peptide itself or its interactions with LbpB. Therefore, further studies will need to be done here in order to fully understand the atomic details of this interaction. Together, our studies support a model where LbpB serves a dual function in Neisserial pathogenesis, in both iron import under iron-limiting conditions and as an antimicrobial peptide sink for the evasion of host immune responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, expression, and purification</title><p>The codon optimized LbpB from <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> strain MC58 (<italic>Nm</italic>LbpB) was purchased from Bio Basic.

The study provides important structural details on the molecular interaction between LbpB, a receptor from pathogenic Neisseria bacteria, and the human iron-binding protein lactoferrin. An elegant combination of structural biology and biochemical techniques establishes the binding interaction between these proteins and hints at details of interactions between LbpB and lactoferricin, an antimicrobial peptide derived from lactoferrin itself. This work is especially important for the field of antimicrobial resistance.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural insight into the dual function of LbpB in mediating Neisserial pathogenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Morgenthau et al., (PLOS One, 2014) previously demonstrated that removal of negatively charged sites in the LbpB C-lobe impairs protection against lactoferricin, and other previous studies had implicated the C-lobe of LbpB in lactoferricin recognition. In light of these past studies, it is unclear how our understanding of the LbpB-lactoferricin interaction is significantly advanced. From the title of the paper as well as the abstract, understanding the &quot;dual&quot; functions of LbpB seems to be a key goal of the work. Few of the loop mutations appear to have any effect on lactoferricin binding, and it is unclear how the double loop mutant affects the overall structure of the LbpB C-lobe.

The acquisition of essential nutrient iron and resistance to host-derived antimicrobial peptides are key factors in the ability of bacterial pathogens to colonize and cause disease. Previous work has demonstrated that lactoferrin binding protein B (LbpB) is a conserved surface lipoprotein in Neisseria that binds the abundant host iron-binding protein, lactoferrin. While a role for LbpB has been demonstrated in bacterial iron acquisition, the molecular details of this interaction have remained unclear for decades. Moreover, LbpB has previously been reported to mediate bacterial protection against lactoferricin, an antimicrobial peptide cleaved from lactoferrin itself. The details of the LbpB-lactoferricin interaction have been even more contentious over the years.</p><p>In this study, Yadav et al., use a combination of structural and biochemical approaches to determine the structure of the LbpB-lactoferrin complex. Mutagenesis experiments further support the molecular basis for this binding interface between the LbpB N-lobe and the lactoferrin C-lobe. These finding provide an important advancement in our understanding of the LbpB-lactoferrin interaction and will greatly aid in further studies to combat pathogenic Neisseria. The combination of structural approaches (crystallography and cryo-EM) along with other supporting experiments strongly support the authors conclusions regarding LbpB-lactoferrin interactions.</p><p>The authors also perform a series of experiments to probe the LbpB-lactoferricin interaction, providing some evidence supporting the existing model that lactoferricin interacts with the C-lobe of LbpB, at a distinct surface from lactoferrin. While the findings are consistent with previous work, much still remains to be determined regarding this second reported function of LbpB and its importance during Nesseria pathogenesis.<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Yadav et al., utilize X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy to determine high-resolution structures of the iron-scavenging lipoprotein LbpB from two different species of pathogenic bacteria (N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae) bound to the human iron-binding protein Lactoferrin. Their data reveal the structures of LbpB are very similar between the two species and show that LbpB consists of two distinct lobes: a well-ordered N-terminal lobe which binds Lactoferrin, and a partially disordered C-terminal lobe. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the authors identify several charged residues on LbpB at the interaction interface which appear especially critical for mediating lactoferrin binding. They quantify the effects of these mutations on LbpB-lactoferrin binding using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC).</p><p>The authors also investigate the role of LbpB in protecting Neisseria against the cationic antimicrobial peptide lactoferricin. They show that the C-terminal lobe of LbpB interacts with lactoferricin and identify several flexible loop regions of LbpB which mediate this interaction. Furthermore, they quantify the effects of mutating these loop regions on lactoferricin binding using ITC. Since these loop regions were not well-resolved in their structures, the authors were unable to identify specific residue(s) which may mediate the LbpB-lactoferricin interaction. The authors state that obtaining high-resolution structural data in this C-terminal region will be the subject of future work.</p><p>The manuscript is well written, and the experiments are performed to a high technical standard. The experimental data fully support the authors' conclusions. Furthermore, this work has relevance for human health; Neisseria infection is a growing public health concern, particularly in light of the recent rise of antibiotic-resistant strains. As the authors point out, the Lbp system appears to be a promising target for new therapeutics.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71683.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1.

Therefore, to further probe the binding region for lactoferricin peptide more than what has already been published, we used our structure to create the loop truncation mutants. This has not been performed previously and therefore, we tested whether other loops could be contributing to binding. Overall, our ITC binding results are consistent with the killing assays performed by Morgenthau et al., (PLOS One, 2014). In this previous study, only a single and double mutant were made to remove the charged regions, which made it unclear if both charged loop regions were required or just one. Here, we test both individually and together, finding that it appears that both are required for efficient lactoferricin binding. We have updated the manuscript to highlight this point further. And while we did observe some differences in expression levels between the loop mutants, we could purify them all using the same methods as with the wild type, suggesting their structures were stable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Since n-values for ITC are known to be dependent on exact concentrations, we rationalized that the observed n-values likely reflect inaccuracies in determining concentrations. We used A280 measurements for determining the concentrations of the proteins and peptide; a method that can have associated errors. While we cannot exclude that two lactoferricin peptides possibly bind to LbpB, we do not observe any obvious biphasic behavior in our ITC data. A structure of the peptide bound to LbpB is needed to fully resolve this interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 2 is somewhat difficult to interpret.
