cells with a tremendous capacity to autonomously self-renew. Because microglial self-renewal has largely been studied using static tools, its mechanisms and kinetics are not well understood. Using chronic in vivo two-photon imaging in awake mice, we confirm that cortical microglia show limited turnover and migration under basal conditions. Following depletion, however, microglial repopulation is remarkably rapid and is sustained by the dynamic division of remaining microglia, in a manner that is largely independent of signaling through the P2Y12 receptor. Mathematical modeling of microglial division demonstrates that the observed division rates can account for the rapid repopulation observed in vivo. Additionally, newly born microglia resemble mature microglia within days of repopulation, although morphological maturation is different in newly born microglia in P2Y12 knock out mice. Our work suggests that microglia rapidly locally and that newly born microglia do not recapitulate the slow maturation seen in development but instead take on mature roles in the CNS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>ontogeny</kwd><kwd>in vivo two photon imaging</kwd><kwd>PLX5622</kwd><kwd>repopulation</kwd><kwd>colony stimulating factor 1 receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000135</institution-id><institution>NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F99 NS108486-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mendes</surname><given-names>Monique S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY019277</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Majewska</surname><given-names>Ania K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 NS114480</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Majewska</surname><given-names>Ania K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 NS099973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Majewska</surname><given-names>Ania K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1557971</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Majewska</surname><given-names>Ania K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Adult microglia are born by the division of single surviving microglia that rapidly acquire mature morphologies and functions in order to perform their physiological roles in the brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microglia are the brain's resident tissue macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crotti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ginhoux et al., 2010</xref>) with a developmental origin that is distinct from other macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ginhoux et al., 2010</xref>).

To study microglial self-renewal, recent studies have pharmacologically and genetically depleted microglia and uncovered a remarkable capacity for rapid repopulation of the microglial niche without a contribution of infiltrating monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajami et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elmore et al., 2015</xref>). Early studies in fixed sections from mice following depletion suggested that microglia rapidly repopulate, possibly through a microglial progenitor population which can divide in large proliferative macroclusters from which newly born microglia migrate throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruttger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elmore et al., 2014</xref>). More recent studies have shown that surviving microglia divide and transiently express nestin; however, none of the repopulated microglia derive from nestin progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>). Similar to repopulation in the cortex, microglial repopulation in the retina is driven by remaining microglia; however, proliferation occurs in the central retina, suggesting a specific site of microglial generation in the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). In the retina, repopulated microglia eventually adopted the dynamic features of endogenous microglia before depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), and repopulated cortical microglia also have expression patterns similar to those of endogenous microglia 30 days after repopulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruttger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>). Genomic analysis of newly born cortical microglia shows that new microglia within days of repopulation recapitulate developmental expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elmore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that they may undergo a stepwise maturation after repopulation that resembles developmental maturation.</p><p>Microglia are highly dynamic, and understanding their behavior requires an equally dynamic approach that monitors their characteristics chronically over time in their native milieu. Here, we characterized microglial ontogeny and maturation in the adult visual cortex using time-lapse imaging in vivo in awake young adult mice after microglial depletion. We show that microglial self-renewal is slow under basal conditions, with microglia maintaining their territories and showing little movement, loss, or proliferation. In agreement with previous studies, we show that, following depletion, newly born microglia rapidly repopulate the brain and acquire equal cell-to-cell spacing reminiscent of baseline conditions. Self-renewal is driven locally by residual microglia, which have a capacity for fast and continued self-division. To determine whether other mechanisms such as migration from sites outside of the imaging area contributed to the increase in microglia numbers, we mathematically modeled microglial self-renewal in vivo and showed that the observed division rates could account for the rapid repopulation. Finally, we showed that newly born microglia quickly acquire ramified morphologies and dynamic surveillance capabilities in response to focal injury, suggesting that microglial functional maturation is remarkably rapid in the adult brain and does not recapitulate developmental features. To dissect the underlying mechanisms responsible for our observations of microglial repopulation, we considered signaling pathways in microglia associated with migration, microglial motility, and maturation. While there are many receptors expressed by microglia that respond to changes in their environment, we focused on the P2Y12 receptor. P2Y12 is highly expressed exclusively in microglia in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 2016</xref>) and regulates microglial translocation under physiological conditions in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haynes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eyo et al., 2014</xref>). Neither microglial repopulation nor the maturation of newly-born microglia was altered by P2Y12 loss. These findings suggest that the microglia landscape following depletion is restored through a rapid division of remaining microglia, local migration to fill the microglia niche, and fast acquisition of mature characteristics soon after repopulation without the need for P2Y12 signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> imaging of microglia shows limited migration and turnover with preserved territories in the physiological brain</title><p>To track microglial turnover in vivo under basal conditions, we imaged microglia daily in the same awake young adult mice using the microglial-labeled CX3CR1-GFP transgenic mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jung et al., 2000</xref>) and a chronic cranial window preparation. Because a growing body of literature suggests that microglia behave differently under anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stowell et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2019</xref>), we wanted to capture the dynamics of microglia in the absence of anesthesia to avoid potentially inducing long-term alteration in microglial movement and turnover during repopulation. Microglia in the same cortical area could easily be imaged and tracked from day to day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) without overt changes in microglial morphology, which could indicate immune activation over time. Microglia numbers were stable over 14 consecutive days, and individual microglia could be re-identified in the same location daily over this period, suggesting limited local migration and maintenance of microglial territories during this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Quantitative three-dimensional nearest neighbor (NN) analysis revealed that microglia generally maintain their territories, whereby each microglia soma lies at ~30 μm from its nearest neighboring microglia. This NN distance remained similar on subsequent days and between animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, n=3, 16–17 microglia per mouse, 30–40 μm stacks).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>In vivo</italic> imaging of microglia shows limited migration and turnover in the physiological brain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A field of microglia in an awake mouse imaged over 14 consecutive days.

To measure microglial movement, we defined a ‘translocation index,’ which was an average distance between the location of each microglia on day 1 and the location of the nearest microglia on an nth day (n=3, 16–17 microglia per mouse, 30–40 μm stacks). On average, microglia shifted on the order of 15 μm from day to day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This number increased as the two imaging sessions were further apart in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), possibly due to tissue distortion over time. In general, most microglia did not move by more than 10 μm in either short (1–2 day), (1–4 day), (1–7 day) and long (1–10 day), (1–12 day), (1–14 day) comparisons. The proportion of microglia that moved more than 30 μm (the territory of single microglia) was small in both short and long-term comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>, n=3, 16–17 microglia per mouse, 30–40 μm stacks). Overall, this analysis suggests that microglia are stable under basal conditions and show limited movement within their territory over 14 days.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Microglia rapidly replenish after partial depletion in the visual cortex</title><p>Microglial homeostasis is tightly regulated under basal conditions.

While microglia repopulated in a temporal pattern similar to CX3CR1-GFP mice after cessation of the inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>), there appeared to be a slight delay in early repopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

To determine whether these doublet microglia had distinct morphological characteristics, we analyzed the morphology of microglia in fixed sections from control mice and mice whose microglia repopulated for two days after depletion (peak proliferation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–I</xref>). Doublet microglia during repopulation, had larger and more elongated somas than either control microglia or singlet microglia during repopulation although all these parameters overlapped in the three microglia populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–K</xref>). A combination of soma perimeter and soma elongation effectively separated out doublet microglia from singlet microglia after repopulation and from microglia in control animals, showing that doublet microglia have a distinct morphological signature. It is notable that this analysis suggests that singlet microglia show a larger morphological diversity than control microglia, suggesting that newly born microglia themselves may have an altered morphology. Interestingly, Galectin-3 expression was increased in repopulating microglia, although its expression was not statistically significantly different between doublet and singlet microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), recapitulating previous results showing that proliferating microglia can be Galectin-3 positive or negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhan et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, only a subset of doublet cells was Galectin-3 positive.</p><p>We quantified both the total number of doublets and the percentage of all microglia that were doublets during our imaging of depletion and repopulation and found that both these measures were increased in the repopulation phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Similar dynamics of doublet microglia was observed in P2Y12-KO, again suggesting that P2Y12 signaling did not play a large role in regulating microglial division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). While these dividing cells could contribute to the rapid increase in microglial numbers observed, three pieces of evidence suggested that other mechanisms may be important. First, in our model of depletion, the number of doublet cells per field increased around day 3 to day 5 of repopulation, but microglia had largely repopulated the brain by day 3 after cessation of PLX. Second, the time scale of the division of each doublet was slow, with microglia remaining in the doublet state for days before dividing, making it unlikely that these cells could create the large increases seen in microglial numbers within 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B,C</xref>). Third, the percentage of microglia that were in a doublet state was low even during peak repopulation, and this level of doublets in the microglial population was maintained long after microglial repopulation was complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B,C</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether microglia are capable of more rapid division that could account for the rapid increase in microglial numbers seen 2–3 days following cessation of PLX treatment, we imaged awake young adult mice every 4 hr for 24 hr during the most dynamic time of repopulation (Day 2 Day 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Unlike what we observed during once per day imaging sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), a microglial division could be remarkably rapid where doublets separated into two daughter cells in as little as 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In an analysis of a subset of divisions where cells could be clearly tracked throughout the 24-hr period (22 total from three animals), we found that 91% of new cells were associated with a characteristic increase and elongation of the cell soma of the original cell before it divided into two microglia. Original microglia often had extensive processes, which were maintained during the division and generation of new microglia (95%), and newly generated microglia frequently had a ramified microglia arbor on the same day that division was complete (82%). Cells generated from these divisions persisted over time, moving away from one another to establish their own territories (100% of cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Microglia repopulation in the visual cortex demonstrates that cell division can account for the fast repopulation observed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</title><p>We imaged CX3CR1-GFP mice every 4 hr for 24 hr during the peak of repopulation (day 2 day 3).

These cells then adopted a doublet morphology and divided again in less than 8 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>).

The proportion of microglia that moved 20–30 μm was small during this time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). More in-depth analysis of one of the animals to track and classify microglia showed that only 7% of microglia during this time did not divide, and 5% of these adopted a doublet morphology that persisted throughout the imaging session, suggesting they may divide at a later time. Of new cells, 20% were born by rapid division, while only 2% of microglia were born of secondary divisions in this mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>).

The simulation was run 500,000 times. A schematic of the model is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. In summary, we randomly sampled the number of cells in the population that are eligible for division from a binomial distribution with probability of success equal to the proportion of cells eligible for division and set that equal to the initial day. We counted the number of cells after 24 hr that divided, as well as all the cells in the process of dividing to account for the total number of cells in the final subtotal. In 4 hr intervals (to replicate the 24 hr imaging experimental time points), we resampled cells from the population of those eligible for division (total number of cells in circulation minus cells previously selected for division) and corresponding division rates before concluding after 24 hr passed. The empirical p-value is calculated from the simulated data by taking the percentage of the repopulation simulation results where the final number of microglia was greater than or equal to the number of microglia observed on day 3 of the daily imaging paradigm for each animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The empirical p values vs. the cell division probability were plotted from the simulation with a 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and 8 hr delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) between divisions. With 50% of cells available for division, it is reasonable to believe that the repopulation we observed from days 2 to 3 in our daily imaging experiments in 11 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) came purely from local doublet cell division if 50% of cells are capable of division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). In fact, in half of the animals imaged, only 10% of cells would need to be capable of division to repopulate the visual cortex. This data suggests that the local division of remaining microglia is likely responsible for rapid repopulation with newly born microglia capable of further division and without the need for the migration of newly generated microglia from a different site of generation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mathematical modeling of microglial repopulation.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Mathematical modeling of microglial repopulation using measured kinetic parameters. Empirical ρvalues from the simulation are plotted for a minimum 4 hr delay (<bold>A</bold>) and 8 hr delay (<bold>B</bold>) between subsequent divisions; each animal is represented by a line (n=10). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>: Source data for the mathematical modeling of microglial repopulation.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig5scode1"><label>Figure 5—source code 1.</label><caption><title>Code to generate the mathematical model simulation.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-61173-fig5-code1-v2.zip"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig5sdata1"><label>Figure 5—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Source data for the mathematical modeling of microglial repopulation.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-61173-fig5-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61173-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig5s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Mathematical model of adult microglia repopulation.</title><p>A schematic to demonstrate the steps of the mathematical model and the cells that were used to estimate the total population of cells at the end of 24 hr. In this example, we start N<sub>0</sub>=4 (there are four microglia at t=0), p=0.5 (the probability of each of these cells undergoing a division is 0.5), and R=(4,8,12), which represents the observed division rates in vivo which were 4, 8, and 12 hr with a probability of (0.25,0.5,0.25), reflecting the fact that half the cells took 8 hr to divide, while a quarter tool 4 hr and another quarter took 12 hr. T=0: Given p=0.5, one cell (yellow) will undergo division and will take 4 hr to divide (as sampled from R). T=4: The dividing cell is removed from the dividing population and assumed to be refractory for 4 hr once division is complete. This is indicated by the two yellow 'dividing cells at the bottom of the panel'. The remaining three cells from t=0 are now eligible for division. Given p=0.5, two cells will divide at this time point with rates of 4 and 8 hr as sampled from R. T=8: The two dividing cells from t=four have reentered the dividing population, and now three microglia are eligible for division while two microglia are actively dividing after t=4. One microglia (brown) will divide at this time point with a 12 hr division rate (as sampled from R). T=24: This process is repeated iteratively, until the last time point when 18 microglia are present in the population.

Because microglial morphology is difficult to quantify in the wide-field imaging in awake animals, we imaged a subset of microglia during repopulation under anesthesia in a separate cohort of animals at high digital zoom to closely quantify the subtle changes in repopulated microglial morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We then traced individual microglia and used Sholl analysis to assay the complexity of the arbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). At the peak of depletion (7 days of PLX), the remaining microglia exhibited a ramified morphology with extensive processes similar to the basal microglia process ramification under steady-state conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>) and an increase in soma size that was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In the early phase of repopulation (day 1 – day 3), the newly born microglia appear ramified with secondary processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–E</xref>) and have an enlarged soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). After this, a more complex arbor begins to form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–E</xref>), whereby there is an overshoot in the maximum number of intersections and the integrated area under the Sholl curve at 5 days of repopulation, which coincides with our increase in the number of microglia in our original repopulation data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>). This slight hyperramification is maintained for as long as we imaged (30 days of repopulation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>), despite a return to baseline numbers of microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and a return to a smaller soma size and full width half max quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>).

Motility measurements were carried out under anesthesia as adrenergic signaling in the awake condition dampens microglial dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stowell et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu, 2019</xref>), allowing us to reliably track microglial process extension and retraction on the order of minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). PLX treatment led to only a modest decrease in motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), as imaged over a 1-hr period, suggesting that the 20–30% of microglia that remain after depletion, not only have full arbors, but are motile and can effectively interact with elements in the parenchyma. This decrease in motility was accompanied by a small decrease in the instability index, which measures the retraction of stable processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) and a small increase in the stability index, which measures the stabilization of newly extended processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), although neither of these changes reached statistical significance. As new microglia were generated after depletion, microglial motility recovered such that the increase in movement correlated with the increase in the number of microglia over time. In addition, during the later stages of repopulation (day 21 day 30), we found no significant difference in basal microglia process motility and long-term stability as compared to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–F</xref>). Combined with our previous data on microglia repopulation, these data suggest that repopulation can be divided in two stages: early and late repopulation. As microglia mature in the later stages of repopulation (day 7 – day 30), they exhibit more complex arbors suggesting a dysregulation in their morphology. This long-term change in morphology, however, does not impact microglial motility which resembles basal microglial states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). To complement the morphology assessment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we set out to determine the dynamics of newly born microglia in P2Y12-KO mice.

Following 7 days of PLX, the remaining microglia population survey a much smaller area than observed under basal conditions due to their reduced numbers. Microglial surveillance recovers at day 3 of repopulation when microglial numbers return to baseline values and is maintained until day 30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). When surveillance was normalized to the process coverage in the first time point (<italic>t=0mins</italic>) to account for the loss of microglia with depletion, we found that individual microglia surveilled their territory in the same manner throughout the control, depletion, and repopulation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>). The surveillance pattern was similar in the absence of P2Y12, although P2Y12-KO microglia appeared to be less efficient at surveilling the brain than CX3CR1-GFP microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). This difference is largely due to the less ramified arbor in P2Y12 KO microglia, as it was less apparent when surveillance was normalized to the first time point to account for morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>). Interestingly, it appeared that P2Y12 KO microglia were more efficient at surveying the brain during PLX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M–N</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>). Based on these findings, we conclude that newly-born microglia mature within days of repopulation, acquire complex arbors, and survey the environment effectively. Also, while P2Y12 may mediate the microglial landscape under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eyo et al., 2018</xref>), it likely plays a minor role in newly born microglia ontogeny and maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Newly born microglia respond robustly to acute focal tissue injury</title><p>To determine whether newly-born microglia can carry out their normal pathological functions, we generated focal laser ablation injuries in the visual cortex using the two-photon laser microscope and quantified the movement of microglial processes toward the site of injury over the course of 1 hr using two separate methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). First, we developed a custom optic flow-based algorithm to calculate the directional velocity of microglia processes moving toward the injury site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–F</xref>). Analysis of the average of all vectors moving towards the core showed that microglia at all stages of depletion and repopulation responded robustly to laser ablation injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F,G</xref>). Both the maximum magnitude and the integrated response (area under the curve) were similar across conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G,H</xref>). It is interesting to note that, under PLX treatment, the remaining microglia, although less motile, sparse, and randomly organized in the cortex, responded robustly to laser ablation injury with only a slight trend toward a decreased response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F,G,H</xref>). A similar pattern was observed with convergence analysis, which calculates the number of pixels representing microglia processes entering a small ring around the core of the injury site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). Similar to the directional velocity measure, there was no difference in the maximum convergence at 60 min and the area under the curve value at each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J,K</xref>). This suggests that the newly-born microglia during the early phases of repopulation can respond robustly to focal laser ablation injury.

Because microglia behave differently in awake vs. anesthetized states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stowell et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu, 2019</xref>), we used an awake in vivo chronic imaging setup to track microglial repopulation. First, we showed that microglia maintain their numbers and territories under basal conditions. Next, we found that microglia can divide rapidly and continuously to repopulate the brain within a few days after partial depletion with the colony stimulating factor one receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, PLX, in a manner that is largely independent of signaling through the P2Y12R. A mathematical model based on the imaged kinetics of division confirmed that the repopulation was driven by very rapid, local self-renewal by surviving microglia, which transition to a doublet morphology, divide, and migrate apart before undergoing the next cycle of division. Finally, we found that newly born microglia mature rapidly both structurally and functionally and that P2Y12 modulates morphological changes following repopulation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The dynamics of microglial division are heterogeneous</title><p>Microglia are thought to be long-lived cells, self-renewing slowly and stochastically under unperturbed physiological conditions in the brain with an average lifetime of four years in the human cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Réu et al., 2017</xref>), and 15 months in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Füger et al., 2017</xref>). Despite their stability, microglia can rapidly repopulate the brain when their niche has been depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruttger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elmore et al., 2015</xref>). While this remarkable capacity for self-renewal has been the subject of intense interest, many questions remain unanswered, regarding the kinetics of microglia self-renewal. By taking a chronic <italic>in vivo</italic> approach coupled with mathematical modeling, we were able to identify and track novel behaviors of residual and dividing microglia <italic>in vivo</italic>. Based on the average cell numbers and the various cell division rates, our simulations of microglia repopulation support the conclusion that the residual cells that remain after depletion can rapidly divide to repopulate the visual cortex.</p><p>We observed that during the height of repopulation, ~50% of cells adopted a doublet morphology indicative of an impending division, suggesting that most residual cells are capable of proliferating, and 95% of those cells divided in a 24-hr period. While we also observed these doublet morphologies after repopulation was complete, the division rates at that time were slow with division occurring over a period of days, as seen in the non-depleted brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Füger et al., 2017</xref>), and inconsistent with rapid repopulation. In contrast, at the height of repopulation, division could occur very rapidly, with a cell adopting a doublet morphology and undergoing division within 4 hr. These rapidly dividing cells can undergo a secondary division within our 24-imaging period. This secondary division could occur in both cells generated from the first division, suggesting a remarkable capacity for proliferation in residual microglia.</p><p>However, the rates of microglia division were not uniform. While some cells divided rapidly and repeatedly, others divided slowly within 8 or 12 hr or remained in the doublet state for the 24-hr period of imaging. While we cannot discern whether these differences in division rates are tied to specific subpopulations of microglia, it is well known that microglia are morphologically and transcriptionally diverse, with high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics identifying distinct subpopulations of microglia with unique molecular signatures that change with age and in response to insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hammond et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayata et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2019</xref>). This heterogeneity in microglia is also seen across various brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hammond et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayata et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Koren et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Biase et al., 2017</xref>). Similar heterogeneity in the residual microglial population may play a role in the dynamics of repopulation, contributing to a heterogeneity in the capacity to divide. For instance, it has been suggested that the remaining microglia after depletion are a specialized CSF1R-inhibitor resistant population of Galectin-3-progenitor-like microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhan et al., 2020</xref>). We did not see a correspondence between our doublet morphologies and Galectin-3 expression, which supports the idea that proliferating cells can be Galectin-3 positive or negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhan et al., 2020</xref>), although other factors could define proliferating microglial populations. A similar scenario has been observed in the retina where microglia repopulate from a distinct source and migrate through the optic nerve to repopulate the rest of the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2018a</xref>). While more detailed studies will be needed to determine the extent of microglial heterogeneity after PLX treatment, characterizing the heterogeneity of repopulating microglia may provide new avenues for understanding the phenotypes of adult-generated vs. yolk sac born microglia.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Newly generated microglia rapidly recapitulate functional features of endogenous microglia</title><p>We show that newly born microglia acquire mature characteristics such as baseline motility, surveillance, and response to acute laser ablation remarkably quickly. In fact, dividing doublet microglia have an extensive, motile arbor which is maintained through the division such that the two resulting cells already have extensive processes which surveil the environment and can respond to injury. While microglial expression in newly repopulated microglia recapitulates some aspects of neonatal microglia expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhan et al., 2020</xref>), we did not observe the typical morphologies of microglia or changes in process dynamics and responses to injury that could indicate a less mature phenotype. Developing microglia transition from an ameboid morphology to a ramified morphology at around post-natal day 30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Orłowski et al., 2003</xref>), and while microglial dynamics have not been extensively studied in development, early life microglia have few processes and are migratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kierdorf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoeffel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ginhoux et al., 2013</xref>). Since newly born microglia did not exhibit ameboid morphologies, and somas tended to not move more than 10–20 µm, this suggests that if microglia do revert to a developmental program when they are first generated in the adult brain, this program does not significantly alter their physiological functions. Alternately, they may go through an accelerated maturation program, as expression also matures much faster than the stepwise development of microglia over a period of weeks in early life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Changes in microglial morphology in newly born microglia</title><p>While many studies have shown that after 30 days of repopulation, new microglia largely adopt the gene expression profile of control microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elmore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>), several observations in our study suggest that adult born microglia may not be identical to their yolk-sac-generated counterparts. We found that after repopulation, microglia morphology changed with a hyper-ramification of the processes and that more microglia adopted a doublet-like morphology with an elongated cell body. As these changes persisted for a month after the cessation of PLX, it may be that newly born microglia take on a unique phenotype that persists long after microglia are mature. While hyper-ramification of the microglial arbor was observed in CX3CR1-GFP animals, it was not apparent in P2Y12-KO animals, possibly due to the general effects of P2Y12 loss on ramification at baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sipe et al., 2016</xref>). Hyper-ramification of microglia is typically associated with periods of enhanced plasticity such as that following monocular deprivation in the developing visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2018b</xref>) and with chronically stressed animals in a model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2019</xref>) where microglia transition from their normal ramified morphology to a hyper-ramified state, characterized by an increase in primary and secondary processes. A similar microglial response, which has been referred to as arrested hyper-ramification, is also observed during aging and in response to specific neurotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Streit et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Streit et al., 2004</xref>). Whether this chronic morphological change is a product of the rapid repopulation and efforts to restore homeostasis, a direct result of PLX treatment, or a general phenotype of newly-born microglia is unclear.</p><p>The presence of a persistently increased number of microglia with elongated, doublet-like cell bodies, after repopulation, could be indicative of further morphological alteration of newly born microglia, but it could also suggest an increased capacity for division as similar doublets have been identified as a source of dividing cells in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Füger et al., 2017</xref>). If Galectin-3+ microglia that remain after depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhan et al., 2020</xref> have increased capacity for division, they may divide to produce new microglia that are distinct from yolk sac-generated microglia and rapidly take on mature characteristics, contributing to a different phenotype of adult vs. yolk-sac born microglia. The Galectin-3+ cells may remain in the population as persistent doublet cells primed for division and self-renewal. Thus, while adult born microglia appear to rapidly take on their mature roles in the brain, their characteristics may differ in subtle ways from microglia that are generated in the yolk sac and populate the brain in development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Newly generated microglia chronological versus biological age</title><p>Functional characterization of newly born microglia may provide valuable clues for determining treatments for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases where microglia are often thought to be dysregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Keren-Shaul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krasemann et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that efficient rejuvenation of old ‘senescent’ microglia in the diseased brain with new microglia through depletion and repopulation can generate a new population of microglia with improved functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rice et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spangenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elmore et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is important to recognize that it remains unclear whether the chronologically younger newly born cell is also biologically younger. In fact, we do not yet understand the biological process of microglia repopulation, and it is not known whether the division of microglia is symmetrical or asymmetrical. To determine whether a newly divided cell is in fact, ‘rejuvenated,’ the ‘maturity’ of that cell will need to be tested directly. This could be assessed by looking at transcriptional and epigenetic signatures and comparing to similar studies done in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hammond et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016</xref>). Newly born microglia may go through a stepwise expression program that partly recapitulates development, giving them younger functional characteristics, or they may acquire all the epigenetic and cytoplasmic features of their ‘aged’ parent cell, leading to repopulation but not ‘rejuvenation’ of the microglia niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>). This latter option could also explain why the newly-born cells acquire mature characteristics and functions early in the repopulation phase.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of microglia repopulation</title><p>A combination of exogenous and endogenous signaling mechanisms may contribute to microglia rapid repopulation and spatial organization. Recent evidence has shed light onto some of the extracellular signals that shape repopulation, including those that regulate microglia proliferation such as colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) and interleukin one receptor (IL1R), and those that regulate migration such as fractalkine through its receptor, CX3CR1 (10, 11, 20). A gradient or threshold of these factors may start intracellular cascades in microglia that trigger division and migration, such as NF-ΚB signaling, which has been shown to be important for microglia to repopulate fully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, we show that the P2Y12 receptor does not modulate newly born microglial maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7F</xref>) despite effects of P2Y12 loss on microglia ramification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haynes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sipe et al., 2016</xref>), and it does not affect doublet formation, repopulation, or the acquisition of microglial territories (as reflected by changes in nearest neighbor quantification) in the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). This is surprising given that P2Y12 modulates microglial translocation in baseline conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eyo et al., 2018</xref>). All together, this suggest that microglia repopulate and mature in a P2Y12-independent manner. The progressive distribution of microglia to achieve tiling during repopulation is most likely maintained by lateral inhibition mechanisms and homeostatic microglia-specific genes such as Sal1 and Mafb—which both maintain microglia in a ramified nonclustered state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buttgereit et al., 2016</xref>). Because microglial numbers overshoot their target during the early stages of repopulation, it is also likely that astrocytes may be recruited to phagocytose excess newly-born microglia, and these cells may contribute to the extracellular environment that promotes microglial migration and maturation. Altogether, an interplay of diverse factors likely contributes to microglia homeostasis following depletion, which may include endogenous mechanisms at play in specific populations of microglia, including Galectin-3+ cells, as well as exogenous factors that come from microglia, neurons, and astrocytes and work together to re-establish microglia numbers in the adult brain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Together our results build on current adult microglia ontogeny research showing that rejuvenation of adult microglia is driven by stochastic doublet cell division locally during repopulation, with newly born cells rapidly able to take on their roles in the brain. Loss of P2Y12 impacts microglial morphologies during repopulation but seems to play a minor role in microglial division. In addition, our mathematical modeling supports the idea that division of residual microglia alone can fill the microglia niche following depletion. While our in vivo tracking approach illuminates the rapid and heterogeneous dynamics of microglial repopulation, future studies will be needed to fully understand the mechanisms that lead to the generation of new microglia and their ability to adopt their mature features. Such studies will provide a deeper understanding of the important role microglia play in homeostasis and disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background</td><td valign="top">CX3CR1-GFP, C57/Bl6 background (Mouse)</td><td valign="top">JAX</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:005582">IMSR_JAX:005582</ext-link> <break/>Jax stock #005582</td><td valign="top">B6.129P2(Cg)-<italic>Cx3cr1<sup>tm1Litt</sup></italic>/J <break/>Male and Females used in our study</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background</td><td valign="top">P2Y12 KO, C57/Bl6 background (Mouse)</td><td valign="top">Courtesy of Maiken Nedergaard lab via a Materials transfer agreement</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Mice were generated by the Conley lab doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI17864">10.1172/JCI17864</ext-link>. <break/>Male and Females used in our study</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">PLX5622 drug</td><td valign="top">Research Diets, New Jersey, USA</td><td valign="top">AIN76A-D1001i</td><td valign="top">PLX5622 drug from Plexxikon Inc, Berkeley, CA, USA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Fentanyl (0.05 mg/kg)</td><td valign="top">University of Rochester Medical Center Pharmacy</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Midazolam <break/>(5.0 mg/kg)</td><td valign="top">University of Rochester Medical Center Pharmacy</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Dexmedetomidine (0.5 mg/kg)</td><td valign="top">University of Rochester Medical Center Pharmacy</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">3 mm Biopsy punch</td><td valign="top">Integra, Plainsboro, NJ, USA</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 33–32</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">0.5 mm drill bit</td><td valign="top">FST, Foster City, CA</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 19007–05</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">UV Glue</td><td valign="top">Norland Optical Adhesive, Norland Inc, Cranbury, NJ, USA</td><td valign="top">Cat#: NOA 61</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Loctite 404 Glue</td><td valign="top">Henkel Corp, Bridgewater, NJ, USA</td><td valign="top">Cat#: A-A-309</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Headplate</td><td valign="top">Emachine shop</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Design courtesy of Mriganka Sur</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">C and B Metabond Dental Cement</td><td valign="top">Parkell Inc <break/>Brentwood, NY, USA</td><td valign="top">SKU #: S380</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Ti: Sapphire</td><td valign="top">Mai-Tai <break/>Spectraphysics <break/>Olympics, Center Valley, PA</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Custom built two photon microscope</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Iba-1 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Wako</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_839504">AB_839504</ext-link> <break/>Cat #

For analysis, microglia within a volume of 800 X 600 X 100 μm (approximately 60 to 160 μm from the surface of the brain) were used. The images were processed and aligned using Fiji ImageJ. The centroid for each microglia was identified and the x, y, and z coordinates were recorded. Images were aligned over consecutive days using the blood vessels as gross landmarks. A custom algorithm was created to quantify the distances between individual microglia and the remaining microglia in the image. The minimum value was then used as the 3D nearest neighbor value for that microglia and nearest neighbor values were averaged together for all microglia in a single animal at each time point.</p><p>Distances were calculated as shown below:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">j</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">q</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">j</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">j</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">z</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">z</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">j</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>i, j corresponds to number of microglia in the matrix used to calculate the NN.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Microglial translocation</title><p>The location of selected microglia from the first time point were identified, and the XYZ coordinates for the microglia were recorded for the first day.

For each microglia selected, a z-projection was created using FIJI. All microglia processes were manually traced, thresholded to generate a binarized outline of the process arbor, filtered to remove artifacts, and analyzed with an automated Sholl Analysis plugin (provided by the Anirvan Ghosh laboratory, University of California, San Diego). The maximum number of intersections and the area under the curve (AUC) of the Sholl profile was analyzed to determine microglia arbor complexity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Microglia motility and surveillance</title><p>For motility analysis, XYZT images consisting of 40-μm-deep z-stacks were collected every 5 min, 12 times for a total of 60 min. Single-image 10 μm Z-projections were created for each time point, and lateral motion artifact was corrected using the StackReg and TurboReg functions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/stackreg/">http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/stackreg/</ext-link>). After thresholding and binarizing of the maximum intensity projections for all time points together, overlays of consecutive time points (0–5 min, 5–10 min, etc.) were made, so that white pixels represented stability. A custom Matlab algorithm was used to compare pixels across individual time points and across consecutive time points to generate a motility index (defined as the sum of all changed pixels divided by the unchanged pixels). Additional indices were generated, including stability, as the proportion of extension pixels (green) in one overlay that became stable (white) in the subsequent overlay divided by the total extension (green) pixels in the first overlay. Conversely, an instability index was calculated as the proportion of stable (white) pixels in one overlay that became retracted (magenta) in the subsequent overlay divided by the total stable (white) pixels in the first overlay.</p><p>For the surveillance ratio, we z projected all 12-time points and compiled them into a stack. We then aligned the stacks and modulated the brightness/contrast to ensure that all processes were visible, and background was minimal. The z-projected files were then thresholded. The thresholding parameters were chosen to capture most of the processes while minimizing background pixilation. The thresholded time points were used to calculate the area surveyed (surveillance ratio) by microglia during the 1 hr imaging session. This was done by calculating the total number of pixels representing microglia divided by the total pixels in the field of view. This number was further divided by the proportion of pixels representing microglia in the 1st time point to generate the normalized surveillance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Microglia soma area quantification</title><p>Two to 10 microglia were selected at random from high-magnification images.

The microglia injury response was imaged by collecting z-stacks of 50–90 μm every 5 min. For analysis, Z-projections were all comprised of 10 μm of the stack, encompassing the approximate center of the ablation core. The file was converted to an AVI and subjected to analysis by a custom MATLAB script designed to calculate the movement of microglial processes towards the ablation core. Briefly, for each pixel at each time point, the script generates a vector that estimates the magnitude and direction of motion of the pixel utilizing the Farneback method for estimating optic flow. For analysis, we only included vectors larger than 5 pixels of motion, which were directed toward the ablation core to minimize noise. The magnitude of all the vectors at each time point was summed and normalized to the total number of pixels in the image. For the convergence analysis, the number of pixels that enter the core of the focal injury was summed. We quantified the area under the curve and the maximum value of the normalized magnitude over the 1 hr session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Histology</title><p>Whole brains were perfused with 0.1M PBS and fixed overnight with paraformaldehyde (4%). The tissue was cut on a freezing microtome (Microm; Global Medical Instrumentation) at 50 μm. For immunohistochemistry, sections were rinsed, and endogenous peroxidase activity and nonspecific binding were blocked with a 10% BSA solution. Sections were then incubated in primary antibody solution to detect microglia (24 hr, 4°C, anti-Iba-1, 1:1,000, Wako 019–19741) followed by a secondary antibody solution (4 hr, RT, AlexaFluor 488, 1:500, Invitrogen), mounted and coverslipped. To determine microglial depletion and repopulation, primary visual cortex sections were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). For each section, a 10 mm <italic>z</italic> stack in the center of the tissue was collected with a <italic>z</italic> step of 1 µm at ×40 magnification. The analysis was performed offline in ImageJ. <italic>Z</italic> stacks were smoothed and compressed into a single <italic>z</italic> projection. Microglial cell bodies were marked in ImageJ using the paintbrush tool. Results from four to five sections per animal were averaged.

Sections were incubated in a primary antibody solution (overnight, 4°C, Anti-Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), 1:500, Sigma G3893, clone G-A-5) followed by a secondary antibody solution (4 hr, RT, AlexaFluor 594, 1:500, Invitrogen), mounted and coverslipped. To determine astrocyte coverage, somatosensory cortex sections were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). For each section, a 10 µm <italic>z</italic> stack in the center of the tissue was collected with a <italic>z</italic> step of 1 µm at ×40 magnification. The analysis was performed offline in ImageJ.

Tissue was processed for histology in similar manner as described above. Sections were incubated in goat-anti-Galectin 3 (1:1500, R and D Systems AF1197) at 4°C overnight, then washed and incubated in AlexaFluor 594 (1:1000, Invitrogen) secondary at RT, subsequently mounted and coverslipped. Consistent with our in vivo imaging, primary visual cortex sections were imaged (three sections/animal) on a Nikon AR1 HD laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon). Two or three non-overlapping images were collected per V1; using a 40X water-submersion objective lens and imaged at 0.5 µm z-step using the same laser setting across all sections. Analysis was performed using ImageJ, and statistical analysis was completed in R (R Core Team 2021). For image analysis, the intensity of Galectin-3 was measured in doublets, singlets, and control microglia separately. In addition, microglial soma morphology was also assessed using several parameters: perimeter, area, long axis, and short-axis as well as elongation (long/short axis ratio). Data were processed in R and plotted using Prism (GraphPad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Immunoassay</title><p>CX3CR1-GFP mice (n=seven for each treatment, mixed-sex) were fed PLX5622 chow or control chow for seven consecutive days. On the 7th day, mice were sacrificed using Euthasol (1:10 dilution) and perfused with 0.15M PBS containing 0.5% sodium nitrite (weight/volume) and 2 I.U. heparin/mL. Cortices were dissected from one hemisphere then immediately frozen in ice-cold isopentane. Frozen cortices were weighed and homogenized in T-PER (pH=7.6, 25 µL/mg, Thermo Fisher) for 30 s, vortexed, and subsequently sonicated for an additional 30 s. Cortical lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 g twice; each time, clarified supernatants were saved, and the pellets were discarded. Concentrations of inflammatory modulators in homogenates were measured using MILLIPLEX MAP Mouse TH17 Magnetic Bead Panel (Millipore, Sigma) as per manufacture recommendations. The following cytokines were assessed: IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα. For all cytokines, a 5-Parameter logistic model was used to fit the standard curves for absorbance values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical comparisons were made between animal and treatment groups using Prism eight software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Samples sizes are similar to those reported in the field and were based on previous experiments. All <italic>n</italic> represents individual animals. Exclusion criteria were discussed prior to analysis and included (1) poor image quality (either due to excessive movement artifact or low signal to noise) as determined qualitatively prior to quantification; (2) the health of the animal (defined as hunched posture and limited movement) as observed during imaging; (3) incomplete imaging sessions. All microglia analyzed in each animal were averaged to generate a single value per animal. Because not all animals could be imaged at all time points, we used a one-way ANOVA and treated each measurement at different time points as independent, which was supported by the examination of residuals. All values reported are the mean ± s.e.m. For all analyses, <italic>α</italic> = 0.05. Two-tailed unpaired or paired <italic>t</italic>-tests and one-way or two-way ANOVA with or without repeated measures (ANOVA) with Tukey post hoc comparisons were used to compare cohorts where appropriate. The exact p values are provided in a supplementary file. The data met the assumptions of normality and equal variances as tested by Prism eight as part of the statistical analyses.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank J Olschowka and K O’Banion for sharing PCR resources.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Amanda Sierra (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>All reviewers highlighted the interest of your study that provides an elegant longitudinal study and mathematical modeling of microglial self-renewal and maturation. However, they also raised specific major and major points that should be addressed in a revised version of the manuscript. In particular, they stressed the importance to provide:</p><p>i) A clearer description of the mathematical model;</p><p>ii) A clarification of the notion of doublets, their statistical analyses as well as an in vivo evidence that they correspond to cell division;</p><p>iii) Stronger statistical analyses of the changes in cytokines after PLX diet and of the impact of P2Y12 inactivation on microglial morphology.</p><p>We look forward to receiving a revised version of your manuscript and thank you for considering <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript &quot;P2Y12 is not a major regulator of the microglial self-renewal and maturation in the adult visual cortex&quot; by Mendes et al. is an elegantly written manuscript that shows very solid data on the kinetics of microglial self-renewal and acquisition of functional maturation after depletion with one of the most promising therapeutic tools in neurodegenerative diseases, the CSf1 inhibitor PLX5266. The authors also show that this process is largely independent of P2Y12, a receptor that has been claimed essential to maintain microglial homeostasis.</p><p>The data presented is novel, the methods of analysis are the state-of-the-art and several new tools, including a mathematical model have been developed. There are however, a few issues that need to be addressed by the authors.</p><p>1. The mathematical model, while very interesting, is very poorly described for a lay audience. As an author of papers that include mathematical models, I am well aware that this is extremely difficult, but the authors need to be clearer both in the methods and in the Results sections.</p><p>In the methods, the authors need to describe the rationale for the different formulas proposed to analyze the dynamics of microglia, and the previous references in which their analysis was surely based.</p><p>In the results, the authors need also to be more specific (without entering the formula details). I would suggest 1, the draw a cartoon that summarizes how the model was created; 2, create a table where the values used to create the model (both experimental and simulated); and 3, be more specific about the actual comparison between experimental and simulated data. For instance, I have trouble understanding what the &quot;empirical division rates&quot; are (and how are they calculated), as they first appear in line 353 but they were not mentioned earlier.</p><p>2. The authors claim that they did not observe changes in cytokine production after 7 days of the PLX diet, but this is due to the low n of their sampling and the large variability (ouliers?) in the PLX group, as in fact strong tendencies can be observed in most cytokines analyzed in Supp. Figure 2. The authors should perform power analysis to determine the n-size, and reach that n if it is feasible.

Then, they analyzed the dynamics of repopulation after PLX-induced depletion. They confirmed (ref. 18) that the rapid replenishment observed after depletion is only due to residual microglia, and they propose a mathematical model to support this observation. The authors then show that new-born microglia display a ramified morphology, and a dynamic behavior that is comparable to the one observed before depletion. Finally, the authors show that the parameters of replenishment are not altered by the loss of function of P2Y12R.</p><p>A major concern is that most of the data in this manuscript simply confirmed already published experiments.

The aims are to understand the mechanisms explaining the rapid repopulation and to test whether new microglia are identical to those which have been depleted. There have already been several studies on this subject. The interest of this new study lies in the fact that the authors performed a longitudinal (over 30 days) analysis of microglia dynamics in awake mice.</p><p>The results suggest that the rapid population is based on the local proliferation of microglia that escaped depletion and that the new microglia rapidly acquire functional properties typical of adult microglia. The dynamics of this repopulation is largely independent of P2Y12 receptors.</p><p>1. An important part of the article is based on the analysis of microglia called &quot;doublet&quot;, which would be microglia in the process of proliferation. However, the authors do not provide a very clear definition of what a doublet is and how these doublets were identified. Clearly defined quantitative criteria would make this part more convincing. In addition, as a certain number of these doublets remain in the doublet state, without dividing, during the observation period (up to 30 days), it would be interesting to show that they indeed correspond to cells in the process of proliferation. A correlation between the identification of doublets in vivo and histochemical analysis of nuclear markers after fixation could help.</p><p>2. The approach consisting in using the values of the repopulation dynamics obtained with monitoring microglia every 4 hours for 24 hours in a mathematical model (Figure 4) to test whether proliferation alone can explain the observations made with a monitoring less frequent (1 / day) but longer (30 days) (Figure 2) is interesting. Unfortunately, the description of the mathematical modeling is unclear and it is difficult as it is to understand if the results of this modeling actually support the authors' conclusion that &quot;it is reasonable to believe that the repopulation.… came purely from local doublet cell division&quot; (page 16).</p><p>3. The authors tend to minimize the role of P2Y12. It is true that this receptor does not modify the dynamics of microglia repopulation. However, after repopulation the morphology of P2Y12 KO microglia is very different from that of wild type microglia. Suppl. Figure 4 clearly shows that at the end of repopulation (D30), P2Y12 KO microglia look more like the control, wild type and P2Y12 KO, microglia than do repopulating wild type microglia. Maybe this could be stressed a bit more clearly as this may be important for microglia-neuron interactions. As for wild type microglia (Figure 5A), pictures of P2Y12 KO microglia in control and at different stages of the repopulation should be shown.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61173.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All reviewers highlighted the interest of your study that provides an elegant longitudinal study and mathematical modeling of microglial self-renewal and maturation.

Doublets are therefore defined as cells with large somas which are elongated, often to form an irregular soma shape. We also immunoreacted these sections and find an upregulation of Galectin-3 in repopulating microglia, although both doublet and singlet microglia showed high levels of expression (Suppl.
