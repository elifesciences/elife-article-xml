The metabolically quiescent core region of the human lens lacks cellular or protein turnover; it has therefore evolved remarkable mechanisms to resist light-scattering protein aggregation for a lifetime. We now report that one such mechanism involves an unusually abundant lens metabolite, <italic>myo-</italic>inositol, suppressing aggregation of lens crystallins. We quantified aggregation suppression using our previously well-characterized <italic>in vitro</italic> aggregation assays of oxidation-mimicking human γD-crystallin variants and investigated <italic>myo-</italic>inositol’s molecular mechanism of action using solution NMR, negative-stain TEM, differential scanning fluorometry, thermal scanning Raman spectroscopy, turbidimetry in redox buffers, and free thiol quantitation. Unlike many known chemical chaperones, <italic>myo</italic>-inositol’s primary target was not the native, unfolded, or final aggregated states of the protein; rather, we propose that it was the rate-limiting bimolecular step on the aggregation pathway. Given recent metabolomic evidence that it is severely depleted in human cataractous lenses compared to age-matched controls, we suggest that maintaining or restoring healthy levels of <italic>myo-</italic>inositol in the lens may be a simple, safe, and globally accessible strategy to prevent or delay lens opacification due to age-onset cataract.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>cataract</kwd><kwd>eye lens</kwd><kwd>crystallin</kwd><kwd>chemical chaperone</kwd><kwd>disulfide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY030444</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chowdhury</surname><given-names>Sourav</given-names></name><name><surname>Thorn</surname><given-names>David C</given-names></name><name><surname>Shakhnovich</surname><given-names>Eugene I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM126651</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Serebryany</surname><given-names>Eugene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99GM141459</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Serebryany</surname><given-names>Eugene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY017370</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woods</surname><given-names>Christopher N</given-names></name><name><surname>Klevit</surname><given-names>Rachel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Nanoscience Infrastructure Network</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>Nicki E</given-names></name><name><surname>McClelland</surname><given-names>Arthur A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The human eye lens imports and concentrates within itself a naturally abundant small molecule that inhibits cataract-associated aggregation of an eye lens protein before the aggregates get large enough to scatter light.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cataract disease afflicts tens of millions of people per year and is the worldwide leading cause of blindness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lam et al., 2015</xref>). The disease is caused by light-scattering aggregation of the extremely long-lived crystallin proteins in the lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloemendal et al., 2004</xref>). This aggregation is associated with accumulation of post-translational modifications, including disulfide formation, UV- or metal-catalyzed Trp oxidation, deamidation, Asp isomerization, Lys derivatization, truncation, and various others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hains and Truscott, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Serebryany and King, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Su et al., 2011</xref>). Most age-onset cataract forms in the oldest, nuclear (or core) region of the lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloemendal et al., 2004</xref>). The cells in this region lack all organelles and thus protein synthesis and degradation capacity, and lens crystallins comprise ~90% of their protein mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wride, 2011</xref>). The most thermodynamically stable crystallin in humans is γD-crystallin (HγD), which, at neutral pH, has a T<sub>m</sub> above 80 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Serebryany et al., 2018</xref>), resistance to 8 M urea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kosinski-Collins and King, 2003</xref>), and unfolding half-life estimated to be on the order of decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mills-Henry et al., 2019</xref>). It is particularly abundant in the nuclear region of the lens and enriched in insoluble aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Su et al., 2011</xref>). HγD consists of two homologous intercalated double-Greek key domains. The N-terminal domain is less stable and derives part of its stability from the domain interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mills-Henry et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Serebryany and King, 2014</xref>). All γ-crystallins are Cys-rich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Serebryany et al., 2021</xref>); thus, HγD contains six Cys residues, four of which are buried in the core of the N-terminal domain, yet there are no disulfides in the native state of the protein <italic>in vitro</italic> or in the young lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ramkumar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Serebryany et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In prior research, we have developed a physiologically relevant <italic>in vitro</italic> model of cataract-associated aggregation and investigated in molecular mechanistic detail the unfolding pathway and probable interactions involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Serebryany and King, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Serebryany et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Serebryany et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Serebryany et al., 2018</xref>). Mutations in HγD that cause congenital cataracts, including W42R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), cluster near the N-terminal β-hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Serebryany and King, 2014</xref>). The vast majority of cataracts arise not from congenital mutations but from age-related changes in the lens, including Trp oxidation in lens crystallins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hains and Truscott, 2007</xref>). We have shown that the oxidation-mimicking W42Q variant and the congenital W42R produce similarly strong aggregation under physiologically relevant oxidizing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Serebryany et al., 2016b</xref>). The aggregates generated by the W42Q variant, or by a variant at the cognate site in the C-terminal domain (W130E), have been extensively characterized, making them well-suited for the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Serebryany and King, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Serebryany et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Serebryany et al., 2016b</xref>). These variants are well-folded at pH 7 and 37 °C, yet rare partially misfolded intermediates formed under those conditions, if locked by an internal disulfide bond, proceed to form aggregates. Since aggregation crucially depends on non-native intramolecular disulfides, and due to latent oxidoreductase activity in HγD and likely other crystallins, this conformational transition from the native to the aggregation precursor state depends on the redox state of the crystallin proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Serebryany et al., 2018</xref>). These neutral-pH HγD aggregates do not stain with Thioflavin T, indicating that they are not amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Serebryany and King, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Serebryany et al., 2016a</xref>). This is consistent with electron microscopy of cataractous lens cytoplasm, which did not reveal any extended fibrillar structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costello et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Metlapally et al., 2008</xref>). Others have also shown that crystallin aggregates induced by directly irradiating WT γ-crystallins with UV light are mostly (though not entirely) non-amyloid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roskamp et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schafheimer and King, 2013</xref>). The aggregates’ binding to the surface hydrophobicity probe bis-ANS is also limited and occurs mostly at the earliest stages of aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Serebryany and King, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Serebryany et al., 2016a</xref>). Therefore, the most experimentally tractable way of measuring the aggregation process is to measure light-scattering (solution turbidity) itself. This is also the most physiologically relevant metric since turbidity of the lens fiber cell cytoplasm is the main symptom of cataract. Fortunately, we have shown that solution turbidity is proportional to total mass for these aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Serebryany and King, 2015</xref>) and that simple power laws relate the aggregation rate and lag time to protein concentration, such that all aggregation traces collapse onto a single master curve, where all points that map onto a given master-curve point have the same particle size distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Serebryany et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Despite intense research interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Makley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shanmugam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>), no preventative or therapeutic drugs against cataract have been approved to-date, leaving surgery as the only treatment option. Aggregate costs of cataract surgery are high in high-income countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frick et al., 2007</xref>), while availability and outcomes are often poor in low- and middle-income ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kara-Junior et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lam et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, most cataract around the world remains untreated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">WHO, 2014</xref>). Delaying the age of onset of the disease by ~14% would cut the need for surgery by half by pushing the onset of blindness beyond the average lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">WHO, 2014</xref>).</p><p>However, the search for cataract treatments has been hampered by three major challenges. Any such treatment must be (1) able to permeate into the nuclear region of the lens where most cataract occurs; (2) simple to use (e.g. eye drops) and extremely safe; and (3) sufficiently stable and cheap to be available to the vast majority of cataract patients who do not reside in high-income countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khairallah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). The lens is a tightly packed tissue, and a diffusion barrier that forms during middle age prevents almost all externally applied compounds from penetrating into the lens nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heikkinen et al., 2019</xref>). Unless a drug candidate lies within the highly constrained space of lens-permeating compounds, it is unlikely to be globally useful.</p><p>We therefore wondered whether the small molecule metabolome of the lens cytoplasm itself has evolved to produce or concentrate metabolites that suppress crystallin aggregation. Strong evolutionary pressure to preserve clear vision has produced multiple mechanisms to delay crystallin aggregation in the lens for as long as possible. Prior research focused largely on the crystallins themselves: the thermodynamic stability, kinetic stability, and redox activity of monomeric γ-crystallins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roskamp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Serebryany and King, 2014</xref>) the stabilizing oligomerization and destabilizing deamidation of β-crystallins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lampi et al., 2014</xref>) and the passive chaperone role of α-crystallins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Slingsby et al., 2013</xref>). Aggregation of crystallins, like that of many other proteins, can be modulated by osmolytes or other small metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attanasio et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goulet et al., 2011</xref>). Metabolomic analyses showed certain small metabolites to be unusually abundant in the lens, notably <italic>myo</italic>-inositol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tomana et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsentalovich et al., 2015</xref>) – which, however, is greatly depleted in cataractous lenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsentalovich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yanshole et al., 2019</xref>). We now report that <italic>myo</italic>-inositol (commonly referred to as just ‘inositol’, since it is the naturally prevalent isomer) acts as a kinetic inhibitor of the aggregation of the oxidation-mimicking, cataract-associated W42Q variant of human γD-crystallin, as well as other variants that aggregate under physiologically relevant oxidizing conditions. Notably, this compound slows the aggregation rate even when added at a later stage in the aggregation process. We present evidence that inositol inhibits the rate-limiting bimolecular step in the aggregation pathway and thereby indirectly disfavors the non-native disulfide bonds that stabilize the aggregation precursor. As one of the very few molecules known to permeate into the lens from the outside, by both passive and active transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cotlier, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diecke et al., 1995</xref>), <italic>myo</italic>-inositol therefore has the potential to become a safe, simple, and globally accessible treatment to prevent or delay loss of vision due to age-onset cataract disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inositol suppresses aggregation of cataract-associated γD-crystallin variants</title><p>We tested a variety of sugars and sugar alcohols for their ability to suppress aggregation of W42Q HγD as the <italic>in vitro</italic> model of cataract-associated aggregation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows a representative set of normalized turbidity traces demonstrating strong and dose-dependent suppression of turbidity development by <italic>myo-</italic>inositol.

Solution turbidity at the end of the 4.5 hr incubation was measured in 96-well plates and the turbid solutions then clarified by centrifugation. Consistent with prior studies (see above), the amount of residual protein in the clarified supernatant had a strong linear inverse correlation with end-point solution turbidity, suggesting that these compounds inhibited the aggregation process without changing aggregate shape or size. The linear correlation between turbidity and aggregate mass further validated the use of turbidity as a quantitative measure of this particular aggregation process.

Assuming a water content of ~60% and a total of ~50% of the water in a bound state, per a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heys et al., 2008</xref>), we arrive at an estimate of 82±22 mM <italic>myo-</italic>inositol in the free water fraction of the healthy human lens. In this concentration range, <italic>myo-</italic>inositol already had a substantial effect in our assay, suppressing the rate of turbidity development by ~35% and increasing the lag time by a similar amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), consistent with the ‘master curve’ relationships among maximum rate, lag time, and endpoint turbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Serebryany et al., 2019</xref>).

Dose-dependent suppression of oxidative aggregation was observed in a variety of aggregation-prone HγD constructs. We have previously found that, while the W42Q variant aggregates on its own at sufficient concentrations, the wild-type protein promotes W42Q aggregation without itself aggregating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Serebryany and King, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Serebryany et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> shows that aggregation of low [W42Q] in the presence of high [WT] was also suppressed by <italic>myo-</italic>inositol. The W130Q variant, which mimics oxidation of the cognate tryptophan in the C-terminal domain, was likewise rescued. The N-terminal domain of HγD derives part of its stability from the domain interface, which may be disrupted over time, for example, by deamidation or truncation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mills et al., 2007</xref>); the isolated domain forms aggregates at slightly elevated temperatures with oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Serebryany et al., 2019</xref>). Inositol suppressed aggregation of the wild-type N-terminal domain of HγD (‘N-only’) like that of the other variants. Aggregation of N-only and W130Q, like that of W42Q, was entirely redox-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), so the aggregation precursor conformations adopted by all these variants are likely kinetically trapped by non-native disulfide bonds. Since the two Cys residues forming the most aggregation-favoring disulfide (Cys32 and Cys41) are highly conserved among γ-crystallins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Serebryany et al., 2021</xref>), we expect that this aggregation pathway is typical for the γ-crystallin family and predict that <italic>myo-</italic>inositol and its isomers and derivatives suppress aggregation of other γ-crystallins, whether they are damaged by mutations or by covalent side-chain modifications or backbone truncations accumulated during the course of aging.

The likely explanation is that at high OxD’ without inositol, precursors have already aggregated and precipitated by the end-point of the assay at the higher OxD’ values, while in the presence of inositol a fraction of doubly-disulfide bonded aggregates is still soluble, along with the fraction that remains fully reduced. It is also worth noting that precipitation of the aggregated protein leads to removal of disulfide bonds from the solution, so the true final OxD’ value is lower in the absence of inositol when protein aggregation is sufficiently extensive to lower soluble [GSSG].

The quadruply-PEGylated band, which corresponds to fully reduced protein, became visibly more intense, while intensity of the bands corresponding to one or two internal disulfides per protein molecule weakened relative to the no-inositol control. (Full gels are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The samples for PEGylation were taken from the bulk solution without mixing, so any aggregates large enough to settle to the bottom of the reaction well were not collected. We have previously shown that W42Q aggregation requires a non-native disulfide in each protein molecule, so the aggregates do not contain any fully reduced protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Serebryany et al., 2018</xref>); the lower intensities of quadruply-PEGylated bands without inositol in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> are attributable to lower amounts of the protein remaining soluble at the endpoint of the assay. Thus, surprisingly, <italic>myo-</italic>inositol was able to shift the molecular population in bulk solution toward the reduced state, despite not being itself redox-active. We therefore propose a mode of action for inositol schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>: inhibition of the rate-limiting bimolecular step effectively drives the early-stage aggregation process in reverse when a redox buffer is present.

The proposed model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> predicts that, by inhibiting this rate-limiting step, <italic>myo-</italic>inositol could alter the concentration dependence of W42Q aggregation in two ways. First, if it makes a dimer less likely to contribute to aggregation, then it should decrease the pre-exponential factor. Second, if it requires an assembly larger than a dimer to initiate or propagate an aggregate (e.g. a trimer is now required to attain the requisite stability), then it should increase the exponent of the concentration dependence power law. We observed both these effects in the [W42Q]-dependence experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>.</p><p>At the lowest [W42Q], both with and without inositol, the solution turbidity traces became biphasic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), as they did at the lowest OxD values with inositol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), while the triple-mutant showed biphasic aggregation throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). While a thorough investigation of that behavior is beyond the scope of the current study, the most likely hypothesis is that early-stage aggregation is dominated by formation and growth of the aggregates, while later stage (second phase) aggregation is dominated by coalescence of the smaller aggregate particles to form larger ones, as schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>. The second phase appeared to be smaller for W42Q/C108S/C110S than for W42Q (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> OxD’ 0.2 vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> OxD 0.2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), perhaps because the latter may form disulfides between the solvent-exposed C-terminal Cys residues of subunits from different aggregate particles in addition to non-covalent coalescence.</p><p>Our finding that <italic>myo-</italic>inositol primarily targets the early, bimolecular step on the aggregation pathway raises the question of whether it can have an effect when added later in the process, after the initial aggregates have formed. This question has important implications for whether inositol could potentially serve as a treatment for cataract or only as a prophylactic. The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> predicts that inositol should inhibit the growth of aggregates even when it is added at a later stage because dimerization is important for generating or stabilizing the misfolded conformer that is required for continued aggregation. (In the extreme case, aggregate growth at later stages may even proceed via dimer rather than monomer addition.) We therefore carried out experiments in which W42Q was allowed to aggregate initially at OxD 0.2 as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, followed by addition of inositol after the rapid phase of the aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The initial aggregation was somewhat more rapid than the comparable traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, respectively, perhaps due to the greater surface area:volume ratio of the initial aggregation reactions; interfaces, including the air-water interface, are known to promote protein misfolding.

Further investigation in redox buffers pointed to disruption of the rate-limiting bimolecular interaction that initiates aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Disfavoring the bimolecular interaction is expected to indirectly favor reduction and refolding of the misfolded monomeric aggregation precursor that is kinetically trapped by non-native disulfide bonding – and this is what we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). While inositol was an effective aggregation suppressor even in fully oxidizing buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), it synergized with the glutathione redox couple to suppress aggregation more strongly under mild-to-intermediate levels of oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This suggests especially effective kinetic inhibition of the earliest steps on the aggregation pathway of γ-crystallins during middle age, when the lens fiber cells’ cytoplasm is only mildly oxidizing, to delay and slow the development of lens turbidity.</p><p>We refer to the proposed target of inositol as a rate-limiting bimolecular interaction, rather than as a dimeric aggregation nucleus, because we have previously shown that the aggregation process is misfolding-limited, not nucleation-limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Serebryany et al., 2016b</xref>). (That is, ‘seeding’ the reaction by adding pre-aggregated protein to fresh protein does not make the latter aggregate more rapidly.) Why is the rate-limiting interaction bimolecular, even though the non-native disulfide bond that locks the aggregation precursor is intramolecular? We have previously carried out extensive atomistic modeling of the misfolding process, which showed detachment of the N-terminal β-hairpin from the W42Q variant and reannealing to non-native locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Serebryany et al., 2016b</xref>). Yet, the intramolecular disulfide bond most favored for promoting aggregation could only form within the context of a dimer that reconstituted the topologically rearranged monomer in a manner akin to domain swapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Serebryany et al., 2016b</xref>). (The Cys-Cys distance was too large in the rearranged monomer.) Thus, a dimeric interaction may be the catalyst for non-native disulfide bonding, especially in redox buffers, as indicated in Model 2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. We have not yet obtained direct experimental evidence as to the nature of <italic>myo</italic>-inositol’s interaction with this dimeric intermediate. Inositol may affect the bimolecular interaction in one of three ways: (1) inhibit formation of a dimer; (2) promote dissociation of the dimer; or (3) inhibit a key misfolding event that takes place within the context of the dimer. Determining which of these mechanisms predominates will likely require observing the key dimeric interaction more directly than we are currently able to do. In all three cases, however, inositol lowers the concentration of dimer that is productive for the aggregation process, and thereby either disfavors formation or favors reduction of the non-native intramolecular disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Another apparent paradox is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: If inositol inhibits only the early stages of aggregation (i.e. the bimolecular interaction), why is it effective as an aggregation suppressor even after most of the turbidity has already developed? We have previously observed that mature coalesced aggregates settle to the bottom of the reaction vessel during the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Serebryany and King, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Serebryany et al., 2016a</xref>) – an effect that also occurred in the current study but did not significantly affect turbidity measurements due to the vertically oriented optics. We hypothesize that globular aggregate particles coalesce and settle to the bottom of the plate or cuvette and largely cease growing thereafter. Then, continued rise in turbidity depends on continued formation and coalescence of new aggregate particles even as the soluble monomer is gradually depleted. Thus, the microscopic rate-limiting bimolecular interaction determines the number of particles that can finally precipitate as large light-scattering globules. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and F</xref>, where the number of aggregate particles decreases in 100 mM inositol even though the size of the larger particles does not. The combination of misfolding-limited aggregation kinetics and precipitation of coalesced particles explains why inositol can still inhibit further turbidity development even in already-turbid solutions. If this mechanism translates to the lens, <italic>myo-</italic>inositol could be used to slow down cataract progression.</p><p>Additional research is needed to determine whether <italic>myo-</italic>inositol suppresses aggregation of other lens crystallins to a comparable degree and whether other compounds based on the inositol scaffold are even better aggregation suppressors. For example, since redox chemistry plays a large role in βγ-crystallin aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Serebryany et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Serebryany et al., 2018</xref>), and glutathione fails to diffuse into the aging lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lim et al., 2020</xref>), replacing one hydroxyl of <italic>myo-</italic>inositol with a thiol might yield a bifunctional anti-cataract drug – an aggregation suppressor and a reducing agent. The inositol transporters expressed in the lens are quite selective, yet one of them (SMIT1) has been shown to import inositols modified with chlorine, fluorine, or azide in at least one position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fenili et al., 2011</xref>). Free inositol concentrations and inositol transport capacity need to be measured in healthy lenses across the human lifespan, as existing datasets have focused on aged cataractous lenses for the former and young lenses for the latter. The observation that young lenses have a lower free water content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heys et al., 2008</xref>) suggests that effective [<italic>myo-</italic>inositol] is highest in young age.</p><p>A typical human diet is estimated to contain 1–2 g of <italic>myo</italic>-inositol per day, and ~4 g/day is produced endogenously from glucose in the liver and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fisher et al., 2002</xref>). Of all human tissues in which <italic>myo</italic>-inositol levels have been studied, the lens appears to have the highest, while the second-highest levels are found in the cytoplasm of neurons in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fisher et al., 2002</xref>). High brain inositol has been ascribed to the need for signaling processes via second-messenger cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fisher et al., 2002</xref>), but it may also act as a chemical chaperone there. Thus, both <italic>myo-</italic> and <italic>scyllo-</italic>inositol, as well as some derivatives, have been shown to directly bind and stabilize oligomers of Aβ<sub>42</sub>, inhibiting amyloid aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McLaurin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sun et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Scyllo-</italic>inositol has been clinically studied in Alzheimer’s disease in humans, with some promise as a disease-modifying agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tariot et al., 2012</xref>). Our finding of <italic>myo-</italic>inositol’s likely aggregation-suppression role in the lens calls for more detailed investigation of whether such activity is general for β-sheet-rich proteins.</p><p>Several animal and human studies have observed a relationship between <italic>myo-</italic>inositol levels and cataract. Thus, in rats with streptozotocin- or galactose-induced cataracts, dietary supplementation with <italic>myo-</italic>inositol dramatically decreased the rate of cataract development: by 14 weeks of age, the untreated animals had totally opaque lenses, while the treated showed only initial stages of cataractogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beyer-Mears et al., 1989</xref>). In another study, dietary supplementation with <italic>myo-</italic>inositol triphosphate delayed cataract onset by ~44% in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ruf et al., 1992</xref>). The premise of the rat studies was that <italic>myo-</italic>inositol might act as an inhibitor of aldose reductase in the lens, but this was found not to be the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beyer-Mears et al., 1989</xref>). Direct inhibition of protein aggregation was not considered at the time. Dosage of <italic>myo-</italic>inositol is likely to be important in any potential cataract treatments, as genetic overexpression of its native lens transporter in mice resulted in cataract due to hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jiang et al., 2000</xref>). Trisomy-21 (Down’s syndrome), which leads to overexpression of the same transporter in humans, is likewise associated with premature cataract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chhetri, 2019</xref>). Given that <italic>myo-</italic>inositol is severely depleted in cataractous human lenses but not in age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsentalovich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yanshole et al., 2019</xref>), and given that it is one of the very few molecules able to permeate into lens tissue, maintaining or restoring healthy levels of lens <italic>myo-</italic>inositol should be considered a promising strategy for delaying the onset of visual impairment or blindness due to cataract and thus reducing the global burden of this highly prevalent disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Wild-type and mutant human γD crystallin, without any tags, was overexpressed in BL21 RIL <italic>E. coli</italic> from a pET16b plasmid in SuperBroth medium (Teknova, Hollister, CA) and purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion exchange, and size exclusion as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Serebryany et al., 2018</xref>).

It is non-destructive, very sensitive to secondary structure, and (unlike FT-IR) largely devoid of water in the crucial Amide I band of the Raman spectrum, where distinct secondary structures have distinct signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lippert et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rygula et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sane et al., 1999</xref>). Additional information rich components like Tryptophan Fermi doublets and phenylalanine pockets make Raman a useful technique in probing tertiary structure, as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wen, 2007</xref>). However, thermal scanning with in-solution proteins is a challenging task not typically attempted with Raman due to sample evaporation and lack of precise temperature control. Thus, we developed a novel apparatus to serve as a thermal scanning Raman spectrometer, as described below.</p><p>Raman spectroscopy was carried out using a Horiba XploRa confocal Raman microscope, a detector thermoelectrically cooled to –70 °C, and a 1200 gr/mm grating blazed at 750 nm. A solid-state 785 nm laser was used for excitation, with an acquisition time of 180 s for all measurements and 1 cm<sup>–1</sup> spectral resolution. Typical power levels at the sample were ~41 mW. To allow for automatic removal of cosmic rays, two back-to-back spectra were collected. The Horiba denoise algorithm in standard mode was used to slightly smooth the spectra. The fluorescent baseline was fit and subtracted using a polynomial fit. As the excitation wavelength was distant from any protein absorption bands, photo-bleaching or heat induced sample deterioration was not expected. The spectrometer slit was set to 200 µm. The confocal aperture was set to 500 µm. The system was calibrated to the 520.7 cm<sup>–1</sup> silicon reference sample before every set of measurements. 20 µM protein in 10 mM PIPES buffer pH 6.7 and 150 mM NaCl was used for the measurements with a sample volume of 20 µl. Samples with inositol had 200 mM inositol. Since the Raman microscope was confocal, the measurements could be made through a sealed PCR tube with no sample handling. The PCR tube was laid on its side on a microscope slide with a slight tilt to keep the protein solution in the bottom of the tube. The Raman microscope was then focused into the middle of the protein solution. For thermal scanning, a temperature stage was constructed by taping a 10 kΩ 25 W resistor (Digikey MP825-10.0K-1%-ND) with Kapton tape to the microscope slide. A thermocouple was placed between the PCR tube and the resistor to monitor sample temperature. DC voltage was applied to the resistor to heat the sample; by slowly increasing the voltage and monitoring the thermocouple readout, the temperature could be increased in a controlled manner. The PCR tube was secured on top of the resistor with Kapton tape. Kapton tape was essential for the setup to be able to reach 65 °C. (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> for schematic of thermal stage setup.) Thermal scans were done on the same sample heated in steps. Buffer blanks were carefully taken with buffer and buffer +inositol at every temperature with exactly the same setup and procedure; subtracting the matched blanks was critical for quality spectral readout. All spectra were normalized with respect to the sharp peak at 330 cm<sup>–1</sup>. To ensure the quality of the protein specific signal, we recorded spectra of WT and compared that with PDB 1HK0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basak et al., 2003</xref>). A comparison of the secondary structure contents as retrieved from our Raman Amide I spectra deconvoluted with Labspec 6 software showed comparable contents with 1HK0. We carried out the same quality check for the isolated N-terminal domain and found its structure content similar to the N-terminal domain of the full-length protein in PDB 1HK0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Free thiol counting</title><p>PEGylation gel shift assays were carried out essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Serebryany et al., 2018</xref>). A stock solution of PEG(5000)-maleimide (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA) at 100 mM was prepared in pure DMSO. Immediately prior to protein labeling, NuPAGE 4 x LDS loading buffer (BioRad), 0.4 M MES buffer pH 5.8, 60% glycerol, water, and the PEG-maleimide stock solution were mixed in the ratio 10:6:6:5:5, respectively. (MES buffer was needed to neutralize the Tris buffer in NuPAGE, thus minimizing non-specific reactions of maleimide; glycerol was needed to ensure labeled samples settled into the gel wells for SDS-PAGE). End-point samples from the glutathione redox-buffered protein aggregation reactions were added to this mixture in a 1:4 ratio and incubated at 50 °C for 1 hr, then used directly for SDS-PAGE. Markers were prepared by limited PEGylation of WT HγD, which contains six free Cys residues: two separate incubations were carried out as above but using only 6:1 and 3:1 molar excess of PEG-maleimide to HγD, respectively, then mixed together and frozen immediately after the 50 °C incubation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-76923-transrepform1-v3.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Numerical data and fits used to generate the plots and fits of Figure 1B,C,D,E have been uploaded as source data files.

The conclusions about the conformational transitions and the mechanism of aggregation are therefore not supported by the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Results are presented that establish the ability of myo-inositol to suppress aggregation of γD-crystallin <italic>in vitro</italic> at concentrations found in lens. Having demonstrated this point, the remainder of the study attempts to characterize the effects on aggregate structure (by negative stain electron microscopy) and at a more molecular level (by differential scanning fluorimetry and Raman spectroscopy).</p><p>The strengths of the manuscript lie in the intriguing hypothesis being tested and the data presented in Figures 1 and 2. The notion that an abundant metabolite could serve as a chemical chaperone in the special environment of eye lens is interesting and the <italic>in vitro</italic> data presented in Figure 1 are consistent with the proposal. The effects of differing concentrations of myo-inositol on the nature of aggregates (&quot;globular&quot; versus &quot;fibrillar&quot;) are confusing and the attempts to explain the observations are &quot;hand-waving&quot; at best. It does not appear that the species dubbed &quot;fibrils&quot; have been verified to be fibrils according to the standard definition and the EM images do not, by eye, appear fibrillar. This aspect of the study does little to shed light on the process under investigation. The authors attempt to ascertain whether the observed effects of myo-inositol are direct and, if so, how the metabolite affects crystallin. The approaches used, DSF and Raman, do not provide much insight. The effects detected by DSF (Figure 5) are very small and difficult to interpret. Without more context, it is impossible to know whether the observations are specific to γD-crystallin, or whether the metabolite at concentrations up to 200 mM similarly affect melting transitions of other proteins. The Raman spectroscopy is also difficult to judge. The band at 1650 cm-1 is broad and therefore difficult to measure intensity for. The authors should consider using other types of spectroscopy (CD, NMR for example) to characterize the effects of myo-inositol on γD-crystallin. Without more robust and compelling evidence for an interaction, the paper is reduced to one that reports intriguing observations with little or no mechanistic insights.</p><p>1. If the assignment of species of aggregates as fibrillar is an essential part of the model, then data such as ThT fluorescence and/or other fibril-specific parameters are needed. The current method of handling the images seems rather ad hoc.</p><p>2. The DSF data are not convincing. The effects are small and how the presence of the fluorescent dye molecule alters the system is an unknown. Wouldn't it be more informative to compare WT- γD-crystallin (which is not aggregation-prone on a laboratory timescale) to mutant forms? As well, inclusion of a similar comparison but with circular dichroism should be seriously considered.</p><p>3. γD-crystallin is amenable to solution-state NMR, providing the opportunity to obtain residue-level information on the direct effects of myo-inositol. There are (at least) two different types of NMR experiments that would be informative. First are standard 1H, 15N-HSQC spectra as a function of increasing metabolite, compared with a similar series where a non-effective/less-effective reagent (Figure 1B) is added. A second NMR-based approach would be time-dependent 1D-NMR aggregation assays similar to those used in (Baughman et al. (2018) JBC 293:2687). These could allow the authors to determine whether the effects of myo-inositol occur early on the aggregation pathway, as they suggest in their model (but currently do not have experimental evidence for).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Serebryany et al. here investigated whether myo-inositol could be a physiological chemical chaperone of lens crystallins and thus whether myo-inositol or a derivative thereof could be considered as a drug candidate for the prevention of cataract. This investigation is inspired by the observation that myo-inositol levels are high in healthy lens epithelial cells and are substantially lower in cataractic lenses.</p><p>Myo-inositol is generally regarded as an osmolyte and is also a secondary messenger of the insulin pathway and is therefore seen to drop in diabetes in all insulin-sensitive cell types. The hypothesis considered here should therefore be able to convincingly demonstrate that myo-inositol is a bona fide chemical chaperone and not an osmolyte.</p><p>Chemical chaperones are often small molecule active site analogs that bind specifically and with a reasonably high affinity (low μm to nM) to their target so that they can sufficiently stabilize the native state. The authors argue that myo-inositol is a chemical chaperone because (1) &quot;aggregation suppression is already significant in the low-mM range, when [myo-inositol] is well below 1% w/v (Figure 1A)&quot;. Experiments are performed with mM inositol concentrations and μm protein concentrations. In such molar excess observed inhibition of aggregation can still simply be due to osmotic effects (2) &quot;compositionally similar compounds have highly distinct effects; thus, myo-inositol (C6H12O6) is a much stronger suppressor than mannitol (C6H14O6), while galactose and IPTG have opposite effects (Figure 1B).&quot; Again, at such molar excess this does not demonstrate specificity but could equally be due to differences in osmotic effects.</p><p>Finally, the TEM images, DSF or Raman spectroscopy data also do not support chemical chaperoning to the exclusion of osmotic stabilization. Both TEM and DSF provide &quot;paradoxical&quot; results and the secondary structural consolidation of a poorly structured part of native crystallin by myo-inositol seen by Raman spectroscopy can again be explained by excluded volume effects by osmosis.</p><p>Overall, while mM excess concentrations of myo-inositol certainly contribute to the reduction of g-crystallin aggregation <italic>in vitro</italic> (and probably in vivo) conclusive evidence for chemical chaperoning by myo-inositol is not provided.</p><p>To convince readers that myo-inositol is a chemical chaperone the authors should be able to demonstrate direct binding by identifying the binding site on the protein by structural characterization, quantifying direct binding (ITC, SPR, thermophoresis,…) and demonstrate the SAR analysis discussed in Figure 1B is comprehensible on the basis of that information.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A native chemical chaperone in the human eye lens&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The conclusion about the mechanism of action of myo-inositol remains speculative at this stage.

Additional experiments to address this point are considered beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>2. In addition, please address the following points:</p><p>– The solubility of myo-inositol is reported as 500 mM. It is not clear, however, whether self-association into oligomers could be present at lower concentrations. This is important since the effect of myo-inositol may be due to this self-association.</p><p>– A quantitative plot of the chemical shift changes should be presented in Figure 2. From the spectra shown it is not necessarily evident that the results are incompatible with binding.</p><p>– The curves in Figure 7S1 are described as reproducibly multiphasic. However, it is not clear how the reproducibility was assessed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors investigated whether a metabolite could be responsible for the inhibition of the aggregation of gammaD-crystallin in the lens. They found that myo-inositol can act to achieve this effect.</p><p>They report data that support the conclusion that myo-inositol does not bind the native and aggregate states of gammaD-crystalling, thus suggesting that myo-inositol may be characterised as a chemical chaperone.</p><p>A weakness of this work is the proposed mechanism of action of myo-inositol. The authors conclude that myo-inositol inhibit the formation of a dimeric intermediate in the aggregation pathway. However, this mechanism of action may be considered still speculative.</p><p>The identification of a metabolite capable of inhibiting the aggregation of a protein involved in cataract formation may create novel therapeutic opportunities.</p><p>The authors should be commended for having significantly improved the manuscript with respect to the previous version.</p><p>However, the conclusion about the mechanism of action of myo-inositol seems speculative at this stage. The nature of the interaction of myo-inositol with the intermediate dimeric species remains unclear. In alternative to binding studies, which are highly challenging for intermediate states, the authors could devise a way to assess the effect of myo-inositol on the rate constant of dimerization.

The aggregation of human γD-crystallin in our study is not amyloid, as we have shown in a series of previous papers starting in 2015, including the finding that these aggregates do not stain with the amyloid specific dye Thioflavin T. We have removed all descriptions of the aggregates as “fibrillar” to avoid confusing any readers due to the frequent conflation of “fibrils” with “amyloids” in common scientific usage. Since the aggregates are not amyloid, the approaches traditionally used for characterizing amyloids do not apply to our system. By contrast, solution turbidity is uniquely well-suited to characterize this system because it is (1) quantitative, as we have shown in prior work and further confirmed in this work, and (2) the most physiologically relevant observable, since cataract is lens turbidity. We have added extensive discussion of the nature and physiological relevance of these aggregates to the Introduction section. We realize that in the minds of many readers protein aggregation is now nearly synonymous with amyloid formation, and we welcome the opportunity to draw attention to an aggregation process that is well-characterized and operates by a very different set of principles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Quantitative analysis of these aggregation assays.</p></disp-quote><p>As we have noted above, the aggregates are not amyloid in nature. However, our existing solution turbidity assays provide a very strong basis for quantitative analysis because solution turbidity is a very strong correlate of total aggregated mass of the protein in our experimental system. We have extensively revised both the Introduction and the Discussion to refer to the relevant prior work while clearing up any misunderstanding of the nature of the aggregation process. We have also added more quantitative data on the turbidity measurements themselves, such as maximum rates and lag times with and without inositol. These are now included in the revised Figure 1, as well as the all-new Figures 5 and 6. Other techniques used in our study (negative-stain TEM, Raman spectroscopy, and thiol counting) provide additional qualitative or quantitative insights into various aspects of the aggregation process, leading to a new and surprising mechanistic model proposed in Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This work reports the effect of myo-inositol on the aggregation of γ crystallin. Although in principle this is an important observation, the conclusions are speculative based on the evidence provided. More evidence should be provided on the overall effect of myo-inositol on γ crystallin aggregation, as well as on the mechanism by which this metabolite acts on the aggregation process.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for recognizing the importance of the motivating observation, and we have included much additional data on the mode of action of inositol. In particular, we now know that this compound has little effect on native-state thermodynamic stability – in contrast to the most established theoretical models of osmolyte effects. Nor does it affect the morphology of the aggregates or their size distribution enough to explain the aggregation suppression. Instead, we present evidence that it specifically targets the rate-limiting non-native bimolecular interaction on the aggregation pathway and thereby indirectly shifts the distribution of redox states among the protein molecules, disfavoring the non-native internal disulfide bonds required for aggregation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conclusion from the turbidity measurements in Figure 1 that the compounds investigated act by inhibiting the aggregation process, not by changing the aggregate morphology, should be confirmed. The TEM analysis in Figures 2 and 3 may not support this conclusion, since morphological differences are detected.</p></disp-quote><p>We have confirmed this observation in several ways. First, the strong linear inverse correlation of solution turbidity and total remaining mass of soluble protein (Figure 1B) would have been very unlikely if either the shape or the size distribution of the aggregates were greatly affected. Second, the newly obtained high-quality Raman spectra in Figure 2 clearly show non-native secondary structure formation during the thermal ramp without inositol, and near-total suppression thereof by inositol. Third, we have noted that the morphological differences seen by TEM are very minor and occur predominantly at the very low end of aggregate particle sizes. Light-scattering (solution turbidity) is dominated by the large particles, among which very little difference is observed between 0 and 100 mM inositol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The quantification of the aggregate mass at the end of the reaction seems to be inconsistent from the turbidity and TEM analyses. A plot with the correlation of the two estimates as a function of the concentration of myo-inositol should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the turbidity data are much more quantitative than the TEM data in this regard. They are certainly not contradictory: a visual comparison of the TEM grid surveys in Figure 3B (no inositol) and Figure 3C (100 mM inositol) shows less extensive aggregation in the latter condition. This is less clear from the distributions of aggregate particle sizes in Figure 4. The likely explanation is as follows. Close-up images were needed for the morphometry, yet negative-stain TEM is notorious for the possibility of human bias in which specific spots on the grid get selected for high-magnification imaging, even when the total number of images is high (103 in our study). Therefore, we set up a double-blind: the microscopist (N. E. Watson) was given eight samples numbered in random order – two each from 0, 100, and 250 mM inositol, plus two controls, and instructed to take high magnification images as representative of each sample as possible. The images themselves were then stripped of sample numbers and randomized (by D. C. Thorn) before morphometry was carried out (by E. Serebryany). Naturally, the human eye gravitates toward imaging spots that are not empty, and such spots also ensure proper focusing of the optics, so it is entirely plausible that high-magnification images that contained aggregates were over-represented to some degree for samples containing 100 mM inositol. For this reason, statistical comparison of the ranked particle sizes (by the K-S test) was only carried out with respect to the shapes of the distributions themselves. We consider these double-blinded high-magnification TEM images a good technique for quantifying aggregate morphology but not a reliable measure of the overall extent of aggregation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1C the procedure to calculate the aggregation rate should be defined. The aggregation mechanism proposed in Figure 4 is still speculative based on the evidence reported.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a definition of the calculation to the relevant Methods section, and we have also included a graph of one fit as an example (panel E of the new Figure 6—supplement 2). We acknowledge that the proposed macroscopic mechanism of aggregation (from misfolded precursors, to small extended aggregates, to collapse and coalescence, and finally precipitation) is somewhat speculative, since it is based on end-point snapshots by TEM. We believe it is the most likely mechanism given the data. However, we have modified this scheme (which is now Figure 3H) to separate the proposed model of the macroscopic aggregation process from the microscopic interactions that are the primary target of inositol. We have presented two alternative (though related) models for the latter process in the new Figure 6C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Raman spectra in Figure 6 are of low quality, in particular in panels G and H in the presence of myo-inositol. A quantitative analysis of the secondary structure should consider also the second derivative of the spectra. The conclusions about the conformational transitions and the mechanism of aggregation are therefore not supported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that the quality of the initial Raman spectra was not optimal. Thermal-scanning Raman spectroscopy is not simple and required a custom home-built apparatus, whose properties took time to understand. However, we now have much higher-quality Raman spectra, shown in the new Figure 2, thanks to the changes described in response to the editorial summary above.</p><p>The improved Raman spectra also revealed that, indeed, the mechanism of conformational stabilization that we had proposed on the basis of those initial spectra was not correct. We now can clearly resolve the non-native βstructures that form during the course of the thermal ramp in the absence of inositol and are suppressed by inositol, and we have revised the model and discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Results are presented that establish the ability of myo-inositol to suppress aggregation of γD-crystallin <italic>in vitro</italic> at concentrations found in lens. Having demonstrated this point, the remainder of the study attempts to characterize the effects on aggregate structure (by negative stain electron microscopy) and at a more molecular level (by differential scanning fluorimetry and Raman spectroscopy).</p><p>The strengths of the manuscript lie in the intriguing hypothesis being tested and the data presented in Figures 1 and 2. The notion that an abundant metabolite could serve as a chemical chaperone in the special environment of eye lens is interesting and the <italic>in vitro</italic> data presented in Figure 1 are consistent with the proposal. The effects of differing concentrations of myo-inositol on the nature of aggregates (&quot;globular&quot; versus &quot;fibrillar&quot;) are confusing and the attempts to explain the observations are &quot;hand-waving&quot; at best. It does not appear that the species dubbed &quot;fibrils&quot; have been verified to be fibrils according to the standard definition and the EM images do not, by eye, appear fibrillar. This aspect of the study does little to shed light on the process under investigation. The authors attempt to ascertain whether the observed effects of myo-inositol are direct and, if so, how the metabolite affects crystallin. The approaches used, DSF and Raman, do not provide much insight. The effects detected by DSF (Figure 5) are very small and difficult to interpret. Without more context, it is impossible to know whether the observations are specific to γD-crystallin, or whether the metabolite at concentrations up to 200 mM similarly affect melting transitions of other proteins. The Raman spectroscopy is also difficult to judge. The band at 1650 cm-1 is broad and therefore difficult to measure intensity for. The authors should consider using other types of spectroscopy (CD, NMR for example) to characterize the effects of myo-inositol on γD-crystallin. Without more robust and compelling evidence for an interaction, the paper is reduced to one that reports intriguing observations with little or no mechanistic insights.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the thoughtful critiques and have revised the paper in collaboration with this Reviewer (who is now a co-author) to address them, as described below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. If the assignment of species of aggregates as fibrillar is an essential part of the model, then data such as ThT fluorescence and/or other fibril-specific parameters are needed. The current method of handling the images seems rather ad hoc.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above in response to the Editorial Summary, this aggregation process is not amyloid and does not elicit ThT fluorescence. We have removed all descriptions of the aggregates as fibrillar to avoid this confusion. We now describe the small aggregates as “extended.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The DSF data are not convincing. The effects are small and how the presence of the fluorescent dye molecule alters the system is an unknown. Wouldn't it be more informative to compare WT- γD-crystallin (which is not aggregation-prone on a laboratory timescale) to mutant forms? As well, inclusion of a similar comparison but with circular dichroism should be seriously considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the effects observed by DSF were too minor to explain the effect of <italic>myo-</italic>inositol and that, in fact, the small magnitude of these effects points away from a mode of action via stabilization of the native state. We have thoroughly revised the interpretation of our results accordingly and introduced a much more relevant measure of misfolding (distributions of the number of free thiols per molecule) in the new Figure 6. We attempted label-free characterization of stability by differential scanning calorimetry, but the resulting traces were not interpretable due to an apparent phase transition – possibly precipitation of inositol at very high temperatures (data not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. γD-crystallin is amenable to solution-state NMR, providing the opportunity to obtain residue-level information on the direct effects of myo-inositol. There are (at least) two different types of NMR experiments that would be informative. First are standard 1H, 15N-HSQC spectra as a function of increasing metabolite, compared with a similar series where a non-effective/less-effective reagent (Figure 1B) is added. A second NMR-based approach would be time-dependent 1D-NMR aggregation assays similar to those used in (Baughman et al. (2018) JBC 293:2687). These could allow the authors to determine whether the effects of myo-inositol occur early on the aggregation pathway, as they suggest in their model (but currently do not have experimental evidence for).</p></disp-quote><p>We collaborated with the Reviewer to do exactly this. As suggested by the Reviewer, we expressed and purified <sup>15</sup>N-labeled WT and mutant proteins, whose solution spectra at 37 °C with and without inositol were then obtained in the Reviewer’s lab. The spectra with and without inositol were fully superimposable for both the WT and the mutant, which provides gold-standard evidence that the compound does not affect the native state of either protein. This observation was crucial in helping us rule out native-state effects and properly focus instead on the misfolded aggregation precursor and the rate-limiting bimolecular interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Serebryany et al. here investigated whether myo-inositol could be a physiological chemical chaperone of lens crystallins and thus whether myo-inositol or a derivative thereof could be considered as a drug candidate for the prevention of cataract. This investigation is inspired by the observation that myo-inositol levels are high in healthy lens epithelial cells and are substantially lower in cataractic lenses.</p><p>Myo-inositol is generally regarded as an osmolyte and is also a secondary messenger of the insulin pathway and is therefore seen to drop in diabetes in all insulin-sensitive cell types. The hypothesis considered here should therefore be able to convincingly demonstrate that myo-inositol is a bona fide chemical chaperone and not an osmolyte.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing out the broader importance of <italic>myo-</italic>inositol. The terms “osmolytes” and “chemical chaperones” have been used somewhat loosely. “Pharmacological chaperones” have sometimes been used to describe higher-specificity, higher-affinity interactions. We have used “chemical chaperone” in preference to “osmolyte” simply because the preponderance of available evidence points away from an osmotic effect, as discussed below. We have added a total of 33 references compared to the initial version of the article, most of which cite the relevant literature on osmolytes, chemical chaperones, and their mechanisms of action.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Chemical chaperones are often small molecule active site analogs that bind specifically and with a reasonably high affinity (low μm to nM) to their target so that they can sufficiently stabilize the native state. The authors argue that myo-inositol is a chemical chaperone because (1) &quot;aggregation suppression is already significant in the low-mM range, when [myo-inositol] is well below 1% w/v (Figure 1A)&quot;. Experiments are performed with mM inositol concentrations and μm protein concentrations. In such molar excess observed inhibition of aggregation can still simply be due to osmotic effects (2) &quot;compositionally similar compounds have highly distinct effects; thus, myo-inositol (C6H12O6) is a much stronger suppressor than mannitol (C6H14O6), while galactose and IPTG have opposite effects (Figure 1B).&quot; Again, at such molar excess this does not demonstrate specificity but could equally be due to differences in osmotic effects.</p></disp-quote><p>In our reading of the literature, micro- and nanomolar affinity compounds have typically been termed “pharmacological chaperones,” but this may be a matter of preferred terminology. Crowders are thought to stabilize proteins via excluded volume effects, as the Reviewer notes, but concentrations on the order of 10 g/L are simply too low to cause any appreciable excluded volume effects (see, e.g., Christiansen and Wittung Schafshede, Biophys. J. 2013; Mukherjee et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 2015). The Reviewer may be referring instead to models of osmolyte effect via preferential exclusion from protein surfaces (as in Street, Bolen, and Rose, PNAS 2006). In either case, the net effect is thermodynamic stabilization of the native state. In our study, we observe at best very minor stabilization of the native state by DSF (Figure 2C, D), and we have observed the same by chemical denaturation with intrinsic Trp fluorescence detection (data not shown). Instead, the aggregation suppression is attributable to inhibition of the rate-limiting bimolecular interaction that stabilizes the misfolded conformer locked by a non-native disulfide bond (Figure 6). Finally, we have confirmed experimentally that 100 mM inositol is not sufficient to change bulk solvent properties, as shown in the new Figure 1—supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the TEM images, DSF or Raman spectroscopy data also do not support chemical chaperoning to the exclusion of osmotic stabilization. Both TEM and DSF provide &quot;paradoxical&quot; results and the secondary structural consolidation of a poorly structured part of native crystallin by myo-inositol seen by Raman spectroscopy can again be explained by excluded volume effects by osmosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have resolved the “paradoxical” results of Raman, as described above, by obtaining better-quality spectra. The new Raman data – and, moreover, the new NMR data – make it clear that inositol does not affect the structure of the native state. Our previous finding that it stabilizes the N-terminal domain was erroneous: we now know that aggregation of the protein during the course of the thermal ramp is what decreases the signal intensity at 1650 cm<sup>-1</sup> more quickly without inositol. The new Raman data indicate than even “high” [inositol] in our study (200 mM) does not prevent the protein from unfolding, as seen in the smooth decline of total Raman signal intensity during the course of the thermal ramp without any new peaks emerging (Figure 2H). What is absolutely clear by comparison of the Raman datasets is that inositol suppresses conformational transitions to populate non-native secondary structures – first a peak at ~1630 cm<sup>-1</sup> and subsequently the peak at ~1620 cm<sup>-1</sup> that is typically associated with β-sheet-rich aggregated structures. Chemical chaperones can have a variety of mechanisms, including acting as inhibitors of nucleation or other early aggregation steps. We have added a new paragraph 1 to the Discussion to cite this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, while mM excess concentrations of myo-inositol certainly contribute to the reduction of g-crystallin aggregation <italic>in vitro</italic> (and probably in vivo) conclusive evidence for chemical chaperoning by myo-inositol is not provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We are open to clarifying terminology if the Reviewer believes the term “chemical chaperone” is not the most suitable description of the observed effects. We simply do not wish to mislead readers into thinking the observed effects are due to what is typically observed with osmolytes: stabilization of the native state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To convince readers that myo-inositol is a chemical chaperone the authors should be able to demonstrate direct binding by identifying the binding site on the protein by structural characterization, quantifying direct binding (ITC, SPR, thermophoresis,…) and demonstrate the SAR analysis discussed in Figure 1B is comprehensible on the basis of that information.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have obtained HSQC NMR spectra demonstrating no interaction between inositol and the native state. Some chemical chaperones, however, are known to inhibit downstream processes such as nucleation of aggregates, and these are more relevant comparisons to our present findings.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that the revised paper is substantially improved and will become suitable for publication in eLife with some additional revisions:</p><p>1. The conclusion about the mechanism of action of myo-inositol remains speculative at this stage. Specifically, the nature of the interaction of myo-inositol with the intermediate dimeric species remains unclear. This limitation should be stated clearly in the final manuscript. Additional experiments to address this point are considered beyond the scope of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewers about the need to state forthrightly this limitation of our study, and in fact we stated in paragraph 4 of Discussion that multiple mechanisms remain possible:</p><p>“Inositol may affect the bimolecular interaction in one of three ways: (1) inhibit formation of a dimer; (2) promote dissociation of the dimer; or (3) inhibit a key misfolding event that takes place within the context of the dimer. Determining which of these mechanisms predominates will likely require observing the key dimeric interaction more directly than we are currently able to do.”</p><p>To avoid confusion and further emphasize the Reviewers’ caveat, we have now prefaced this statement with the following sentence:</p><p>“We have not yet obtained direct experimental evidence as to the nature of <italic>myo-</italic>inositol’s interaction with this dimeric intermediate.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In addition, please address the following points:</p><p>– The solubility of myo-inositol is reported as 500 mM. It is not clear, however, whether self-association into oligomers could be present at lower concentrations. This is important since the effect of myo-inositol may be due to this self-association.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for raising this point. Crystallization of <italic>myo-</italic>inositol is driven by hydrogen bonding,<sup>1</sup> so if inositol oligomers (crystal seeds) do form as the concentrations in our experiments get closer to the ~500 mM solubility limit, we should expect formation of inositol-inositol hydrogen bonds.</p><p>Therefore, we carried out Raman spectroscopy using an excitation wavelength of 532 nm (at room temperature) on aqueous <italic>myo-</italic>inositol solutions ranging from 100 mM to 500 mM to investigate hydrogen bonding, both among inositol molecules and between inositol and water. Since the high-wavenumber region of O-H stretch for alcohols overlaps with, and is dominated by, the water O-H stretch, we focused on the 300 to 1100 cm<sup>-1</sup> region, which includes C-O and C-C-O vibrational modes.<sup>2</sup></p><p>First, to determine which Raman peaks of <italic>myo-</italic>inositol are sensitive to hydrogen bonding, we obtained spectra of <italic>myo-</italic>inositol dissolved in water and in D<sub>2</sub>O (Figure 1—supplement 3A). Peaks at 891 and 1071 cm<sup>-1</sup> for <italic>myo-</italic>inositol in water shifted by -45 and -39 cm<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, in D<sub>2</sub>O. Peaks at 423 and 504 cm<sup>-1</sup> each showed a minor shift (-8 cm<sup>-1</sup>) in D<sub>2</sub>O. Notably, the shifts were clear-cut, suggesting absence of OH-OH hydrogen bonds in D<sub>2</sub>O <italic>myo-</italic>inositol solutions.</p><p>Second, to probe for any emergent signature of inositol-inositol hydrogen bonds, we obtained Raman spectra of aqueous <italic>myo-</italic>inositol at five concentrations, from 100 to 500 mM (Figure 1—supplement 3B). Aside from concomitant increases in signal intensity for all peaks in the 300 to 1100 cm<sup>-1</sup> region, no differences were observed among these spectra. To summarize, Raman spectroscopy revealed signatures of the expected inositol-water hydrogen bonds but none for direct inositol-inositol interactions in (or even above) the concentration range used in our crystallin aggregation experiments. However, we cannot rule out indirect interactions, like the probable water-mediated clusters in water-ethanol solutions.<sup>3</sup></p><p>We have added Figure 1—supplement 3 and included the following sentences in the main text of the manuscript:</p><p>“In crystals, <italic>myo-</italic>inositol self-associates via networks of hydrogen bonds [ref: Rabinowitz and Kraut, 1964]. Although the maximum <italic>myo-</italic>inositol concentrations used in this study were not far below the empirical solubility limit of ~500 mM, Raman spectroscopy (Figure 1—supplement 3) did not reveal any signature of direct self-association of inositol in the 100 to 500 mM concentration range. However, as with any alcohol, transient water-mediated clusters [ref: Dolenko <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015] cannot be ruled out for inositol.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A quantitative plot of the chemical shift changes should be presented in Figure 2. From the spectra shown it is not necessarily evident that the results are incompatible with binding.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a new Figure 2 – supplement 1 showing the distribution of chemical shift changes, as well as a new reference.</p><p>First, there is a systematic slight shift across all the peaks in the NMR spectra in the presence of inositol. This does not indicate a specific binding interaction because addition of any osmolyte in this concentration range is expected to produce a minor overall shift in the NMR spectrum due to the change in the solvent environment.<sup>4</sup> We have added this note and reference to the text.</p><p>Second, to address the Reviewers’ request for a more quantitative plot of chemical shift changes, we have produced the following histograms, with are now included as Figure 2—supplement 1. All peak shifts are very small: &lt;0.02 ppm, with a mean shift &lt;0.01 ppm, for both W42Q and WT. We tested whether these additional very small shifts were randomly distributed. The Shapiro-Wilk test could not rule out a normal distribution for the CSPs of W42Q (<italic>p = 0.13</italic>) and indicated only marginal significance for WT (<italic>p = 0.011</italic>). We conclude that lack of a specific binding site remains the most likely interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The curves in Figure 7S1 are described as reproducibly multiphasic. However, it is not clear how the reproducibility was assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in the legend to Figure 7—supplement 1, “Four technical replicates were carried out in parallel for each set of curves, and the curves shown consist of averages ± S.E.M. of the replicates.” In other words, reproducibility was assessed by comparing the aggregation curves from four separate reactions that were run in separate wells of the same 96-well plate at the same time. This observation would have been unexpected if prion-like (nucleation-driven) aggregation were occurring, since in that case formation of an initial nucleus that enables subsequent secondary nucleation tends to be highly stochastic. The small size of the error bars in the figure makes them difficult to see; we therefore revised the figure to add a zoom-in inset showing the error bars more clearly.</p><p>References</p><p>1.
