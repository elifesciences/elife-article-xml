To address this gap, we investigated in 22 young healthy adults the effectiveness of auditory targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during non-rapid eye movement sleep of artificial words with easy and difficult to learn phonotactical properties. Here, we found that TMR of the easy words improved their overnight memory performance, whereas TMR of the difficult words had no effect. By comparing EEG activities after TMR presentations, we found an increase in slow wave density independent of word difficulty, whereas the spindle-band power nested during the slow wave up-states – as an assumed underlying activity of memory reactivation – was significantly higher in the easy/effective compared to the difficult/ineffective condition. Our findings indicate that word learning difficulty by phonotactics impacts the effectiveness of TMR and further emphasize the critical role of prior encoding depth in sleep associated memory reactivation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>targeted memory reactivation</kwd><kwd>prior knowledge</kwd><kwd>sleep-dependent memory consolidation</kwd><kwd>phonotactics</kwd><kwd>sleep spindles</kwd><kwd>alpha oscillations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>168602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klaassen</surname><given-names>Arndt-Lukas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>677875</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rasch</surname><given-names>Björn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeted memory reactivation improved memory performance of easy-to-learn words, but had no effect of difficult-to-learn words, which suggests a critical role of word learning difficulty in sleep associated memory reactivation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Learning of new words is essential in language acquisition. During the learning process of unknown words, top-down influences can facilitate perception and encoding of these words depending on the similarity between the new words and the pre-existing knowledge. One critical characteristic of similarity to pre-existing knowledge in auditory word processing is its speech sound (phoneme) pattern. In phonology as the field of language specific phoneme structures, phonotactics determines the constraints of word phoneme composition of a specific language. Previous studies have shown that artificial words with similar phonotactic properties to real words are easier to learn and to remember (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frisch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gupta and Tisdale, 2009</xref>), suggesting that pre-existing knowledge about the sound structure (i.e. schemas) facilitates encoding and consolidation of new words. A synchronized interplay between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and unimodal associative cortices is proposed to explain schema instantiation and schema mnemonic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilboa and Marlatte, 2017</xref>) at the neural level. To describe the influence of phonotactics on memory processing within this framework, new words with phoneme structures congruent to activated schema variables are inserted with less cognitive effort and difficulty into pre-existing knowledge networks of long-term memory in contrast to schema-incongruent words.</p><p>According to the complementary system account by Gaskell and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis and Gaskell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>), learning of new words comprises a first stage of rapid initial familiarization represented by neural activities of the medial temporal lobe and a second stage of slow offline consolidation of the neocortex. The model suggests that, after initial hippocampal learning, through sleep consolidation memory representations, the words are gradually integrated into long-term lexical and phonological memory structures of the neocortex. Additionally, these processes of memory consolidation might depend on spontaneous and repeated reactivation of the newly formed memory traces during non-rapid eye-movement (NREM) sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>). The active system consolidation hypothesis proposes synchronized hippocampal sharp-wave-ripples, thalamocortical sleep spindles and slow oscillations of NREM sleep as underlying activities of memory reactivation. Accordingly, studies in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mölle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Staresina et al., 2015</xref> and in rodent models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Siapas and Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sirota and Buzsáki, 2005</xref> found that sleep spindles and hippocampal sharp wave ripples occur grouped during slow oscillations and that these events correlate with memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Girardeau and Zugaro, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singer et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>While similarity of the learning material to pre-existing knowledge clearly facilitates encoding, this notion is controversial for the effects on sleep consolidation. For example, Havas and co-authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Havas et al., 2018</xref>) tested learning and consolidation of artificial words phonologically derived either from participant’s native language (L1 words in Spanish) or foreign language (L2 words in Hungarian). Here, sleep-associated improvements in memory recognition were only observable in the condition of the L2 words, suggesting that a reduced similarity to pre-existing knowledge facilitates consolidation during sleep. Also, in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Payne et al., 2012</xref>, sleep-associated memory benefits occurred only for semantically unrelated word-pairs, but not for semantically related words.</p><p>On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zion et al., 2019</xref> reported that sleep facilitated consolidation in a second language learning task in participants with a higher degree of meta-linguistic knowledge, indicating a beneficial effect of pre-existing knowledge on new word consolidation. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Durrant et al., 2015</xref> reported that only schema-conformant but not non-conformant learnings benefitted from sleep. In a study from our own lab, German-participants learning unknown Dutch vocabulary profited more from sleep compared to native French speaker when given the same amount of learning trials, whereas German native speakers might have more pre-existing knowledge about the Dutch words in relation to the French native speakers, which facilitated learning and consolidation of the new Dutch vocabulary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordi et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>A promising approach to examine sleep-associated memory consolidation is to experimentally bias reactivation by re-presenting olfactory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rasch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diekelmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diekelmann et al., 2012</xref>) or auditory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rudoy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schreiner and Rasch, 2015</xref>) reminder cues during sleep, a technique known as targeted memory reactivation (TMR). TMR has been related to elevated slow-wave and spindle activity following cueing presentations as neural markers of memory reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cairney et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antony et al., 2018</xref>). So far, two studies suggest that prior knowledge increase the effectiveness of TMR: Groch and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Groch et al., 2017</xref>) reported improved memory performance by TMR for associations between pseudo-words and familiar objects, but not for word associations of new/unknown objects. Here, before sleep, subjects showed as well better encoding performance for the familiar compared to the unknown objects. In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Creery et al., 2015</xref> of learning sound-object locations, the effectiveness of TMR correlated positively with the initial encoding performance prior to sleep. Additionally, both studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Groch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Creery et al., 2015</xref> found significant associations between TMR’s effectiveness and sleep spindle activities after the cueing presentations. These findings suggest that higher similarity between the learning material and the pre-existing knowledge facilitates reactivation and consolidation during sleep. However, it is unknown whether these findings can be generalized to learning of new artificial words with different levels of phonotactical similarity to prior word-sound knowledge, as a factor of learning difficulty.</p><p>To address this issue, we designed artificial words with varying difficulty levels by phonotactical properties. To consider the beneficial effect of reward related information on sleep-dependent memory consolidation and reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asfestani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischer and Born, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lansink et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sterpenich et al., 2021</xref>), we trained healthy young participants to categorize these words into rewarded and unrewarded words to gain and to avoid losses of money points. By using auditory TMR, we re-presented the artificial words during subsequent sleep to study its effect on categorization performance. As a manipulation check, we expect that artificial words with more familiar phonotactical properties would be easier to learn compared to words with less familiarity. Regarding previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Groch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Creery et al., 2015</xref>), we hypothesized higher effectiveness of TMR for the easy to learn words in comparison to the difficult words, accompanied by higher oscillatory activity on the slow-wave and spindle range.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>To study the impact of difficulty in word learning on TMR, we developed a novel learning paradigm. We formed four sets of artificial words (40 words per set; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref>) consisting of different sequences of two vowels and two consonants. Here, we subdivided the alphabet into two groups of consonants (C1: b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m; C2: n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, z) and vowels (V1: a, e, I; V2: o, u, y). Four-letter-words were created by selecting letters from the vowel and consonant groups according to four different sequences (G1:C1, V1, V2, C2; G2: C1, V1, C2, V2; G3: V1, C1, C2, V2; G4: V1, C1, V2, C2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; see methods for further details). Comparison analyses between the sets revealed significant differences in phonotactic probability (PP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests: G1 /G2&gt;G3/G4, p&lt;0.005, values of Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>&gt;0.71). PP quantifies the frequency of a single phoneme (phoneme probabilities) or a sequence of phonemes (e.g. biphone probabilities) within a language and thus serves as a measurement of the similarity between the artificial words and the pre-existing real word knowledge. According to distinct levels of PP, we paired the four sets to the high- (G1 and G2) and low-PP (G3 and G4) condition, respectively.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Artificial words consist of two vowels and two consonants according to four different sequences.

Therefore, the high- and the low-PP condition, consisted of 40 rewarded and 40 unrewarded words. As a two alternative forced-choice task, we assigned left- and right-hand button presses to the rewarded and the unrewarded word category, counterbalanced across subjects. We instructed the participants to respond to each word by left- or right-hand button presses, whereas one button means the word is rewarded (gain of money points) and the other button means the word is unrewarded (avoid the loss of money points). In the beginning, they had to guess. By three presentations of each word in randomized order and by feedback at the end of each trial, they learned to respond correctly according to the rewarded/unrewarded associations of the words (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>To obtain a measurement of discrimination memory with respect to the potential influence of the response bias, we applied the signal detection theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Green and Swets, 1966</xref>). Because, we instructed the participants to respond to each word by left- or right-hand button presses and that one button means reward is present whereas the other button means reward is absent, we considered correct responses of words of the rewarded category as hits and words of the unrewarded category as correct rejections. Accordingly, we assigned the responses with regard to the reward associations of the words to the following four response types: hits (rewarded, correct); correct rejections (unrewarded, correct); misses (rewarded, incorrect); and false alarms (unrewarded, incorrect). Dependent on responses, subjects received money points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><p>After encoding and before sleep, we tested the pre-sleep memory performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Subjects slept one night in the sleep laboratory and during the NREM sleep stages 2 and 3 we conducted auditory TMR of the low-PP words in one group of subjects and TMR of the high-PP words in the other group (between subject design).

After confirming easier encoding of artificial words with high- compared to low phonotactic familiarity, we found that auditory TMR during sleep improved the memory performance of the easy to learn words, whereas cueing of the difficult words had no effect. Correspondingly, at the neural level, we observed that cueing presentations of the easy words induced significant greater spindle-band oscillations nested during SW up-states in comparison to the difficult words. To our knowledge, we present here the first study to address the critical role of learning difficulty by experimental manipulations of phonotactical word properties on TMR’s effectiveness and its neural signatures.</p><p>Related to our finding of TMR’s effectiveness of the easy words, previous research in object association learning showed beneficial influences of encoding depth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Creery et al., 2015</xref> and prior knowledge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Groch et al., 2017</xref> on TMR. Language studies without using TMR revealed that prior knowledge affected sleep dependent memory integration of new words in children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">James et al., 2017</xref> and in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zion et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordi et al., 2023</xref>). To explain these critical influences on consolidation during sleep, the model of the complementary systems approach of word learning (CLS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis and Gaskell, 2009</xref>) proposes that new word memory temporary encoded in the hippocampus transfer during sleep into cortical structures of lexical and phonological memory for long-term embedding, due to co-activation of both memory systems. Thus, word memory reactivation and consolidation during sleep depend on the hippocampal encoding depth and the cortical prior knowledge in phonotactics. Regarding our results, we suggest facilitated systems co-activation/consolidation of the easy to learn words by auditory cueing during sleep as a manipulation of both factors – via enhanced initial encoding and higher similarity to pre-existing phonotactical knowledge – compared to the difficult to learn words.</p><p>Contrary to our results, other studies found better memorization of words with low phonological <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Havas et al., 2018</xref> and semantical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Payne et al., 2012</xref>) similarity to pre-existing knowledge after a retention period of sleep compared to words with high similarity. To explain this discrepancy, we could speculate that a very high degree of similarity led to a strong memory formation during wake-encoding, which prevented an additional effect of consolidation during sleep. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Creery et al., 2015</xref> showed that learned object-location associations only benefited from TMR during sleep when not almost perfectly recalled during prior wake. Here, a moderate encoding depth might benefit most from subsequent sleep consolidation compared to insufficient or almost perfect encoding. Alternatively, the contrary results could be related to characteristics of the learning paradigms (L1- vs. L2-like novel words with associations to objects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Havas et al., 2018</xref>; semantically related vs. unrelated word pairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Payne et al., 2012</xref>) distinct to our design.</p><p>By conducting an additional exploratory analysis, we observed a significant change of the decision bias in the cueing condition of the easy to learn words and no overnight changes in the other conditions. Here, subjects became more biased in their decision making to avoid losses of money points. This observation suggests that TMR not only captures specific memory traces of the words and their reward associations, but also decision-making tendencies. In a previous study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ai et al., 2018</xref> revealed altered reward-relevant decision preferences by TMR. To what extent concepts of decision-making such as risk avoidance/seeking could be reactivated, transformed, and consolidated by TMR is largely unexplored and might be interesting for future research for example in neuroeconomics.</p><p>Correspondent to our behavior results of TMR’s effectiveness, we found significantly higher spindle-band oscillations nested during SW up-states after cueing presentations of the easy in comparison to the difficult words. Accordingly, the active system consolidation hypothesis proposes slow wave – sleep spindle coupling activities as an underlying mechanism of systems consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klinzing et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to our result of the significant group difference, we failed to find significant correlations between SW nested spindle power values and overnight changes in behavior measurements, whereas previous studies reported associations of SW and spindle activities during sleep with the integration of new memories in pre-existing knowledge networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tamminen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tamminen et al., 2013</xref>). Strikingly, recent studies by implementing machine learning for EEG decoding revealed that classification accuracy of distinct memory categories peaked above chance level synchronized with SW-spindle coupling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cairney et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schreiner et al., 2021</xref>). Here, our results support the assumption of SW-spindle activities as an underlying mechanism of memory reactivation during sleep by providing additional evidence to link successful TMR on behavior to increased spindle activity during SW up-states.</p><p>In validation of our novel paradigm, we confirmed easier encoding and better memorization of artificial words with high- in comparison to low-PP, in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frisch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gupta and Tisdale, 2009</xref>). These results suggest that participants used their prior knowledge of frequently occurring word-sound patterns to facilitate learning. Regarding the framework of schema theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilboa and Marlatte, 2017</xref>), processing of incoming words with high-PP might co-activate consistent schemata of prior word sound knowledge and thus may lead to facilitated memory integration and stabilization during encoding in comparison to processing of more inconsistent words with low-PP.</p><p>Our EEG analyses of encoding revealed desynchronization of alpha oscillations as a function of learning improvements. Additionally, superior encoding of the high-PP words corresponded to greater alpha desynchronization in comparison to the low-PP words. Consequently, we assume that the suppression of alpha oscillations over parietal and occipital electrodes represent a neural correlate of mnemonic functioning. Accordingly, previous studies linked desynchronization of alpha oscillations to memory processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanslmayr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klimesch et al., 2006</xref> and memory replay during wake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Michelmann et al., 2016</xref>). A study of intracranial electrophysiology in epilepsy patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Griffiths et al., 2019b</xref>) showed that neocortical alpha/beta desynchronization precede and predict fast hippocampal gamma activity during learning. The authors propose that these coupled activities represent hippocampal-cortical information transfer important for memory formation. Here, our findings let suggest cortical alpha desynchronization as neural marker of wake mnemonic processing according to distinct levels of difficulty in word learning. Additional studies linked alpha desynchronization to cognitive effort and cognitive load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Proskovec et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). So, one could assume to observe higher alpha desynchronization in the more difficult to learn condition of low-PP compared to high-PP. On the other hand numerous studies investigating oscillatory correlates of learning and memory showed that alpha desynchronization is associated with memory across different tasks, modalities and experimental phases of encoding and retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanslmayr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Griffiths et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Michelmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Griffiths et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Griffiths et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Griffiths et al., 2019a</xref>). Strikingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Griffiths et al., 2019a</xref> revealed by simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings a negative correlation between the occurrence of patterns of stimulus-specific information detected by fMRI and cortical alpha/beta suppression. Here, the authors suggested that a decrease of alpha/beta oscillations might represent the neuronal mechanism of unmasking the task-critical signal by simultaneous suppression of task-irrelevant neuronal activities to promote information processing. Following this interpretation, we assume that over the course of learning elevated memory processing of the easier to learn stimuli is associated with enhanced information processing and thus accompanied by higher cortical alpha desynchronization in comparison of the more difficult to learn stimuli.</p><p>Our study has limitations due to a small sample size and between-subject comparisons. The criteria of data analyses were not pre-registered and the <italic>p</italic>-values of our behavior analyses were not corrected for multiple comparisons. Further, potential influences of phonotactic word properties and the prior encoding depth on TMR cannot be interpreted independently because the conditions of phonotactic word properties impacted already the encoding depth before sleep. To disentangle these potential factors, future studies could include a higher number of encoding trials for the low-PP words to equalize the encoding depth between conditions prior to TMR, as successfully shown in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordi et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, a within-subject design with a larger sample size would provide a more robust control of interindividual differences in sleep and cognition. To control for potential confounders despite the influence of difficulty in word learning on TMR, we compared parameters of sleep, the pre-sleep memory performance and the vigilance shortly before the post-sleep memory test, revealing no significant group differences (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3 supp5">Supplementary files 3 and 5</xref>). Nevertheless, we cannot rule out that other individual trait factors differed between the groups, such as the individual susceptibility to TMR. To rule out these alternative explanations based on individual factors, we suggest for future research to replicate our study by conducting a within-subject design with cueing of subsets of previously learned low- and high-PP words providing all conditions within the same individuals as shown in other TMR studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schreiner and Rasch, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cairney et al., 2018</xref>). Further, we used artificial words based on American English in combination with German speaking participants, whereas language differences of pronunciation and phoneme structures might affect word perception and memory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohn and Best, 2012</xref>). On the other hand, both languages are considered to have the same language family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eberhard et al., 2019</xref>) and the phonological distance between English and German is quite short compared for example to Korean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luef and Resnik, 2023</xref>). Thus, major common phonological characteristics across both languages are still preserved. In addition, our behavior analyses revealed robust word discrimination learning and distinct memory performance according to different levels of phonotactic probabilities providing evidence of successful experimental manipulation. Based on our paradigm, we investigated categorization learning of artificial words according to their reward associations (rewarded vs. unrewarded) and did not studied aspects of generalization learning of artificial grammar rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reber, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batterink and Paller, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batterink et al., 2014</xref>). This difference might limit the comparability between these previous language-related studies and our findings. However, the usage of artificial words with distinct phonotactical properties provided a successful way to manipulate learning difficulty and to investigate word properties on TMR, whereas our reward categorization learning paradigm had the advantage to increase the relevance of the word learnings due to incentives.</p><p>To conclude, our present study demonstrates that difficulty in word learning as a manipulation of phonotactic properties impacts the effectiveness of TMR. Here, TMR of the easy to learn words facilitates categorization learning while TMR of the difficult words had no effect. Auditory cueing of the easy words induced increased spindle activity during the SW up-states – as an assumed underlying activity of memory reactivation – compared to the difficult words. Thus, our findings suggest that future research and clinical applications to restore language capabilities should consider learning difficulty based on phonotactical word properties as a potential factor of successful TMR, whereas alpha desynchronization during initial learning – as a neural marker of encoding depth – may serve as a predictor for sleep-associated memory reactivation and consolidation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>The study included 39 subjects (29 females) with an age range of 19–28 years (M=22.28 years, SD = 2.04).

During each trial, an initial fixation cross was displayed between 1.7 and 2.3 s. Subsequently, concurrent with the onset of a blank screen the sound of an artificial word was played for 0.7–1 s. After a waiting period (blank screen 2 s), a question mark appeared to signal the onset of the response time window (maximal duration 4 s). Following the key press response, a feedback screen with the money points of the trial and the current task score appeared for 2 s. The learning task contained 480 trials in randomized order according to 160 artificial words with three presentations each.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Pre-sleep memory task</title><p>After finishing the encoding task, following a 10 min break, subjects performed the pre-sleep memory task. The memory task had the same trial structure as the encoding task without the last feedback screen. Participants received again money points for correct responses. However, the received amount was only shown at the end of the task. The memory task contains 160 trials according to the 160 artificial words.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Auditory target memory reactivation during sleep</title><p>Following an additional impedance check and re-adjustment of the EEG electrodes, subjects went to bed in a noise and electric shielded cabin of the sleep laboratory. All night sleep periods started with light off between 23:00 and 24:00 hr. Based on online monitoring of N2 and N3 sleep, artificial words were presented aurally via loudspeakers (sound pressure level 55 dB) with a randomized inter-stimulus interval of 8±2 s. One group of subjects were exposed to artificial words with low phonotactic probability during sleep, whereas we presented to the other group the high phonotactic probability words (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> for number of reactivations). We interrupted word presentations when we observed online an arousal or patterns of REM sleep.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Post-sleep memory task</title><p>After sleep and re-adjustment of the EEG, subjects performed the post-sleep memory task (see above the description of the pre-sleep memory task).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Experimental tasks</title><p>All experimental tasks, including sleep reactivation, were conducted by using the E-Prime software (Psychology Software Tools, Sharpsburg, USA).

Four-letter-words were created by selecting letters from the vowel and consonant groups according to four different sequences (G1:C1, V1, V2, C2; G2: C1, V1, C2, V2; G3: V1, C1, C2, V2; G4: V1, C1, V2, C2). Artificial words were converted automatically from text to speech files (wav format) by using MATLAB functions (tts.m, audiowrite.m) with the setting of a female computer voice with American English pronunciation. From this pool of 900 stimuli for each rule, we selected 40 artificial words per rule category (4×40 words) according to the inclusion criteria: fluent and understandable pronunciation; no meaning; no names; aurally discriminable to other selected words (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref> for lists of the used words).</p><p>Phonotactic probability values were computed for each word by using an online computation platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aljasser and Vitevitch, 2018</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://calculator.ku.edu/phonotactic/English/words">https://calculator.ku.edu/phonotactic/English/words</ext-link>) according to an American English lexicon.

Each trial began with a fixation cross of a randomized duration between 2 and 10 s. Participants were instructed to press the spacebar button with the forefinger of the non-dominant hand as quickly as possible after numbers started to count in milliseconds on the screen. The reaction time was displayed for 1 s after the key press.

Impedances were kept below 10  kΩ. The EEG was recorded with a sampling rate of 500 Hz using Brain Vision Recorder software (Brain Products, Gilching, Germany). Signals were referenced to electrodes at the mastoids. The ocular activity was measured via one EOG channel mounted ~2  cm below the right eye. Muscle tone was monitored by EMG recordings made under the chin. The following EEG electrodes were used for subsequent wake and sleep analyses: Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, O2, F7, F8, T7, T8, P7, P8, Fz, Cz, and Pz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Sleep scoring</title><p>The sleep stages of NREM 1–3 (N1 to N3), wake, and REM sleep were scored offline and manually according to the criteria of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) by visual inspection of the signals of the frontal, central, and occipital electrodes over 30 s epochs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iber et al., 2007</xref>).

For each trial, data were segmented into epochs (−2–4 s) time-locked to stimulus onset.

The number of wavelet cycles was adjusted to seven cycles. We extracted oscillatory power in the frequency range of 1–45 Hz with frequency steps of 0.2 Hz and time steps of 10ms.

In addition, time distance between the prior and posterior positive peaks should be in the range of 0.3–2 s. For the following analyses, the 30% slow waves with the highest amplitude (from negative peak to posterior positive peak) were included for each subject.</p><p>We then extracted the corresponding spectral power (1–30 Hz) in a time window around this negative slow wave peak (±2 s) using Morlet wavelet (7 cycles) analysis implemented in the Fieldtrip toolbox, with a time window and step size of 10ms and frequency steps of 0.2 Hz. Extracted power data over frequency and time was averaged of the slow waves and baseline corrected by subtracting the averaged values of the baseline interval of –2 to –1.5 s prior to the negative slow wave peak.

They have created artificial words that are either typical or atypical and showed that reactivation improves memory for the latter but not the former.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is an interesting design and a creative way of manipulating memory strength and typicality. In addition, the spectral analysis on both the wakefulness data and the sleep data is well done. The article is clearly written and provides a relevant and comprehensive of the literature and of how the results contribute to it.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Unlike most research involving artificial language or language in general, the task engaged in this manuscript did not require (or test) learning of meaning or translation. Instead, the artificial words were arbitrarily categorised and memory was tested for that categorisation. This somewhat limits the interpretation of the results as they pertain to language science, and qualifies comparisons with other language-related sleep studies that the manuscript builds on.</p><p>(2) Participants had to determine whether words are linked with reward or omission of punishment (if correctly categorised). Therefore, the task isn't a mere item categorisation task (group A/B), but also involves the complicated effects of reward (e.g., reward/loss asymmetries as predicted by prospect theory). This is not, in itself, a flaw, but there isn't a clear hypothesis as to the effects of reward on categorisation, and therefore no real justification for this design. This aspect of the task may add unneeded complexity (at best) or some reward-related contamination of the results (at worst).</p><p>(3) The study starts off with a sample size of N=39 but excludes 17 participants for some crucial analyses. This is a high number, and exclusion criteria were not pre-registered. Having said that, some criteria seem very reasonable (e.g., excluding participants who were not fully exposed to words during sleep).</p><p>(4) Relatedly, the final N is low for a between-subjects study (N=11 per group). This is adequately mentioned as a limitation, but since it does qualify the results, it seemed important to mention it here.</p><p>(5) The linguistic statistics used for establishing the artificial words are all based on American English, and are therefore in misalignment with the spoken language of the participants (which was German). This is a limitation of the study. The experimenters did not check whether participants were fluent in English. In all fairness, the behavioural effects presented in Figure 2A are convincing, providing a valuable manipulation test.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90930.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The work by Klaassen &amp; Rasch investigates the influence of word learning difficulty on sleep-associated consolidation and reactivation. They elicited reactivation during sleep by applying targeted memory reactivation (TMR) and manipulated word learning difficulty by creating words more similar (easy) or more dissimilar (difficult) to our language.</p><p>In one group of participants, they applied TMR of easy words and in another group of participants, they applied TMR of difficult words (between-subjects design).</p><p>They showed that TMR leads to higher memory benefits in the easy compared to the difficult word group. On a neural level, they showed an increase in spindle power (in the up-state of an evoked response) when easy words were presented during sleep.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors investigate a research question relevant to the field, that is, which experiences are actually consolidated during sleep.

The main disadvantage the task and the operationalisation of memory performance (d') have is that single-trial performance cannot be calculated.

The authors report that the high phonotactic probability (PP) words showed a more pronounced EEG alpha decrease during encoding and were more easily learned than the low PP words. Following TMR during sleep, participants who had been cued with the high PP TMR, remembered those words better than 0, whilst no such difference was found in the other conditions.

Instead, the artificial words were arbitrarily categorised and memory was tested for that categorisation. This somewhat limits the interpretation of the results as they pertain to language science, and qualifies comparisons with other language-related sleep studies that the manuscript builds on.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We agree that we did not test for meaning or translation but used a categorization task in which we trained subjects to discriminate artificial words according to their reward associations (rewarded vs. non-rewarded). Previous language studies (Batterink et al., 2014; Batterink and Paller, 2017; Reber, 1967) used artificial words to investigate implicit learning of hidden grammar rules. Here, the language researchers studied generalization of the previously learned grammar knowledge by testing subject’s ability to categorize correctly a novel set of artificial words into rule-congruent versus rule-incongruent words. These differences to our study design might limit the comparability between the results of previous language studies of artificial grammar learning and our findings. We discussed now this aspect as a limitation of our novel paradigm.</p><p>We added the following sentences to the discussion on p.14, ll. 481-488:</p><p>Based on our paradigm, we investigated categorization learning of artificial words according to their reward associations (rewarded vs. unrewarded) and did not studied aspects of generalization learning of artificial grammar rules (Batterink et al., 2014; Batterink and Paller, 2017; Reber, 1967). This difference might limit the comparability between these previous language-related studies and our findings. However, the usage of artificial words with distinct phonotactical properties provided a successful way to manipulate learning difficulty and to investigate word properties on TMR, whereas our reward categorization learning paradigm had the advantage to increase the relevance of the word learnings due to incentives.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3:</p><p>(2) The details of the behavioural task are hard to understand as described in the manuscript. Specifically, I wasn't able to understand when words were to be responded to with the left or right button. What were the instructions? Were half of the words randomly paired with left and half with right and then half of each rewarded and half unrewarded? Or was the task to know if a word was rewarded or not and right/left responses reflected the participants' guesses as to the reward (yes/no)? Please explain this fully in the methods, but also briefly in the caption to Figure 1 (e.g., panel C) and in the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and added additional sentences into the document to provide additional explanations. We instructed the participants to respond to each word by left- and right-hand button presses, whereas one button means the word is rewarded and the other button means the word is unrewarded. The assignment of left- and right-hand button presses to their meanings (rewarded versus unrewarded) differed across subjects. In the beginning, they had to guess. Then over trial repetitions with feedback at the end of each trial, they learned to respond correctly according to the rewarded/unrewarded associations of the words.</p><p>We added the following sentences to the results section on p.5, ll. 161-168:</p><p>As a two alternative forced-choice task, we assigned left- and right-hand button presses to the rewarded and the unrewarded word category, counterbalanced across subjects. We instructed the participants to respond to each word by left- or right-hand button presses, whereas one button means the word is rewarded (gain of money points) and the other button means the word is unrewarded (avoid the loss of money points). In the beginning, they had to guess. By three presentations of each word in randomized order and by feedback at the end of each trial, they learned to respond correctly according to the rewarded/unrewarded associations of the words (Fig. 1c).</p><p>We added the following sentences to the caption of Figure 1 on p.6, ll. 188-194:</p><p>As a two alternative forced-choice task, responses of left- and right-hand button presses were assigned to the rewarded and the unrewarded word category, respectively.

If the item was of the non-rewarded class and the participant got it correct, they avoided loss. Why would that be considered a correct rejection, as the text suggests? It is no less of a hit than the rewarded-correct, it's just the trial was set up in a way that limits gains. This seems to mix together signal detection nomenclature (in which reward is uniform and there are two options, one of which is correct and one isn't) and loss-aversion types of studies (in which reward is different for two types of stimuli, but for each type you can have H/M/CR/FA separably). Again, it might all stem from me not understanding the task, but at the very least this required extended explanations. Once the authors address this, they should also update Fig 1D. This complexity makes the results relatively hard to interpret and the merit of the manuscript hard to access. Unless there are strong hypotheses about reward's impact on memory (which, as far as I can see, are not at the core of the paper), there should be no difference in the manner in which the currently labelled &quot;hits&quot; and &quot;CR&quot; are deemed - both are correct memories. Treating them differently may have implications on the d', which is the main memory measure in the paper, and possibly on measures of decision bias that are used as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment giving us the opportunity to clarify. As explained in the previous comment, for our two alternative forced-choice task, we instructed the participants to press one button when they were thinking the presented word is rewarded and the other button, when they were thinking the word is unrewarded. Based on this instruction, we applied the signal detection theory (SDT), because the subjects had the task to detect when reward was present or to reject when reward was absent. Therefore, we considered correct responses of words of the rewarded category as hits and words of the unrewarded category as correct rejections (see Table below). However, the reviewer is correct because in addition to false alarms, we punished here the incorrect responses by subtraction of money points to control for alternative task strategies of the participants instead of reward association learning of words. We agree that further explanation/argumentation to introduce our nomenclature is necessary.</p><table-wrap id="sa4table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom">Respond: Reward Present</th><th valign="bottom">Respond: Reward Absent</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Reward Present</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Miss</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Reward Absent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">False Alarm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Correct Rejection</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>We adjusted the results section on p.5, ll. 169-177:</p><p>To obtain a measurement of discrimination memory with respect to the potential influence of the response bias, we applied the signal detection theory (Green and Swets, 1966).

Accordingly, we assigned the responses with regard to the reward associations of the words to the following four response types: hits (rewarded, correct); correct rejections (unrewarded, correct); misses (rewarded, incorrect); and false alarms (unrewarded, incorrect). Dependent on responses, subjects received money points (Fig. 1d).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5:</p><p>(4) The study starts off with a sample size of N=39 but excludes 17 participants for some crucial analyses. This is a high number, and it's not entirely clear from the text whether exclusion criteria were pre-registered or decided upon before looking at the data. Having said that, some criteria seem very reasonable (e.g., excluding participants who were not fully exposed to words during sleep). It would still be helpful to see that the trend remains when including all participants who had sufficient exposure during sleep. Also, please carefully mention for each analysis what the N was.</p></disp-quote><p>Our study was not pre-registered. Including all the subjects independent of low prememory performance, but with respect to a decent number of reactivations (&gt; 160 reactivations, every word at least 2 times), resulted in a new dataset with 15 and 13 participants of the high- and low-PP cueing condition, respectively. Here, statistical analyses revealed no significant overnight change anymore in memory performance in the high-PP cueing condition (Δ memory (d'): t(14) = 1.67, p = 0.12), whereas the increase of the bias in decision making towards risk avoidance still remained significant (Δ bias (c-criterion): t(14) = 3.36, p = 0.005).</p><p>We modified and added the following sentences to the discussion on p.13, ll. 456-458:</p><p>Our study has limitations due to a small sample size and between-subject comparisons.

This is adequately mentioned as a limitation, but since it does qualify the results, it seemed important to mention it in the public review.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the small sample size and the between subject comparisons represent major limitations of our study. Accordingly, we now discussed these limitations in more detail by adding alternative explanations and further suggestions for future research to overcome these limitations.</p><p>We added the following sentences to the discussion about the limitations on p.14, ll. 465-488:</p><p>To control for potential confounders despite the influence of difficulty in word learning on TMR, we compared parameters of sleep, the pre-sleep memory performance and the vigilance shortly before the post-sleep memory test, revealing no significant group differences (see Table S1 and S2). Nevertheless, we cannot rule out that other individual trait factors differed between the groups, such as the individual susceptibility to TMR. To rule out these alternative explanations based on individual factors, we suggest for future research to replicate our study by conducting a within-subject design with cueing of subsets of previously learned low- and high-PP words providing all conditions within the same individuals as shown in other TMR studies (Cairney et al., 2018; Schreiner and Rasch, 2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 7:</p><p>(6) The linguistic statistics used for establishing the artificial words are all based on American English, and are therefore in misalignment with the spoken language of the participants (which was German). The authors should address this limitation and discuss possible differences between the languages. Also, if the authors checked whether participants were fluent in English they should report these results and possibly consider them in their analyses. In all fairness, the behavioural effects presented in Figure 2A are convincing, providing a valuable manipulation test.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer pointing to the misalignment between the German-speaking participants and the used artificial words based on American English. Further, we did not assessed the English language capability of the participants to control it as a potential confounder, whereas comparative control analyses revealed no significant differences between the both cueing groups in pre-sleep memory performance (see Table S1).</p><p>We now discussed these comments as limitations on p.14, ll. 473-481:</p><p>Further, we used artificial words based on American English in combination with German speaking participants, whereas language differences of pronunciation and phoneme structures might affect word perception and memory processing (Bohn and Best, 2012). On the other hand, both languages are considered to have the same language family (Eberhard et al., 2019) and the phonological distance between English and German is quite short compared for example to Korean (Luef and Resnik, 2023). Thus, major common phonological characteristics across both languages are still preserved. In addition, our behavior analyses revealed robust word discrimination learning and distinct memory performance according to different levels of phonotactic probabilities providing evidence of successful experimental manipulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 8:</p><p>(7) With regard to the higher probability of nested spindles for the high- vs low-PP cueing conditions, the authors should try and explore whether what the results show is a general increase for spindles altogether (as has been reported in the past to be correlated with TMR benefit and sleep more generally) or a specific increase in nested spindles (with no significant change in the absolute numbers of post-cue spindles). In both cases, the results would be interesting, but differentiating the two is necessary in order to make the claim that nesting is what increased rather than spindle density altogether, regardless of the SW phase.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted additional analyses based on detected sleep spindles to provide additional data according to this question.</p><p>We added the following section to the supplementary data on pp. 31-32, ll. 1007-1045:</p><p>After conducting a sleep spindle detection (frequency range of 12-16Hz, see methods for details), we compared the sleep spindle density between the TMR conditions of high- and lowPP showing no significant difference (see Fig. S8a and Table S9). Next, we subdivided the detected sleep spindles into coupled and uncoupled sleep spindles with the previously detected slow waves (SW; analyses of Fig. 4). Sleep spindles were defined as coupled when their amplitude peak occurred during the SW up-state phase (0.3 to 0.8s time-locked to the SW troughs). A two-way mixed design ANOVA on the amplitude size of the sleep spindles with the cueing group as a between-subject factor (high-PP-cued vs. low-PP-cued) and SW-coupling as a within-subject factor (coupled vs. uncoupled) showed a significant interaction effect (cueing group × SW-coupling: F(1,20) = 4.51, p = 0.046, η2 = 0.18), a significant main effect of SW-coupling (F(1,20) = 85.02, p &lt; 0.001, η2 = 0.81), and a trend of significance of the main effect of the cueing group (F(1,20) = 3.54, p = 0.08). Post-hoc unpaired t-tests revealed a significant higher amplitude size of the coupled sleep spindles of the cueing group of high- compared to low-PP (t(20) = 2.13, p = 0.046, Cohen’s d = 0.91; Fig. S8b) and no significant group difference of the uncoupled sleep spindles (t(20) = 1.62, p = 0.12). An additional comparison of the amount of coupled sleep spindles between the cueing groups revealed no significant difference (see Table S9).</p><p>Here, we found that detected sleep spindles coupled to the SW up-state phase occurred with higher amplitude after TMR presentations of the high-PP words in comparison to the low-PP words, whereas the sleep spindle density and the amount of sleep spindles coupled to the SW up-state phase did not differed between the cueing conditions.</p><p>We added the following sentences to the methods on pp. 22-23, ll. 822-839:</p><p>Sleep spindle analyses</p><p>We detected fast sleep spindles by band-pass filtering (12-16Hz) the signal of the Pz electrode during the auditory cueing trials in the time windows of -2 to 8s according to stimulus onsets.

In one group of participants, they applied TMR of easy words and in another group of participants, they applied TMR of difficult words (between-subjects design). They showed that TMR leads to higher memory benefits in the easy compared to the difficult word group.

So, one could assume to observe higher alpha desynchronization in the more difficult to learn condition of low-PP compared to high-PP. On the other hand numerous studies investigating oscillatory correlates of learning and memory showed that alpha desynchronization is associated with memory across different tasks, modalities and experimental phases of encoding and retrieval (Griffiths et al., 2016, 2021, 2019a, 2019b; Hanslmayr et al., 2009; Michelmann et al., 2016). Strikingly, Griffith and colleagues (Griffiths et al., 2019a) revealed by simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings a negative correlation between the occurrence of patterns of stimulus-specific information detected by fMRI and cortical alpha/beta suppression. Here, the authors suggested that a decrease of alpha/beta oscillations might represent the neuronal mechanism of unmasking the task-critical signal by simultaneous suppression of task-irrelevant neuronal activities to promote information processing. Following this interpretation, we assume that over the course of learning elevated memory processing of the easier to learn stimuli is associated with enhanced information processing and thus accompanied by higher cortical alpha desynchronization in comparison of the more difficult to learn stimuli.</p><p>In addition, we added the mentioned quote on p.7, ll. 239-240:</p><p>In addition to the behavior results, these EEG results indicate differences between PP conditions in desynchronization of alpha oscillations, as an assumed neural correlate of encoding depth (Griffiths et al., 2021; Hanslmayr et al., 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 35:</p><p>(7) Exclusion criterion.</p><p>Why did you use a d' &gt; 0.9 as a criterion for data inclusion?</p></disp-quote><p>This criterion ensured that each included subject had at least in one PP-condition a d' &gt; 1.05 of pre-sleep memory performance, which corresponds to a general accuracy rate of 70%.</p><p>Accordingly, we adjusted these sentences of the method section on p.19, ll. 677-680:</p><p>Data were excluded from subjects who did not reach the minimal learning performance of d' &gt; 1.05 during the pre-sleep memory test in at least one of the two PP conditions, whereas this threshold value corresponds to accuracy rates of 70% (n = 5).
