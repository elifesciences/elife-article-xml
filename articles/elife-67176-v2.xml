LLPS from a single (&quot;homotypic&quot;) constituent is governed by buffering: above a threshold, free monomer concentration is clamped, with all added molecules entering the condensed phase. However, both experiment and theory demonstrate that buffering fails for the concentration dependence of multicomponent (&quot;heterotypic&quot;) LLPS. Using network-free stochastic modeling, we demonstrate that LLPS can be described by the solubility product constant (Ksp): the product of free monomer concentrations, accounting for the ideal stoichiometries governed by the valencies, displays a threshold above which additional monomers are funneled into large clusters; this reduces to simple buffering for homotypic systems. The Ksp regulates the composition of the dilute phase for a wide range of valencies and stoichiometries. The role of Ksp is further supported by coarse-grained spatial particle simulations. Thus, the solubility product offers a general formulation for the concentration dependence of LLPS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LLPS</kwd><kwd>biomolecular condensate</kwd><kwd>solubility product</kwd><kwd>rule based modeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24 GM137787</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loew</surname><given-names>Leslie M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM132859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loew</surname><given-names>Leslie M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The solubility product, a thermodynamic concept classically applied to poorly soluble ionic solutes, can rationalize the concentration dependence for liquid-liquid phase separation of multicomponent multivalent molecules.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biomolecular condensates comprise a novel class of intracellular structures formed by a biophysical phenomenon called liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>). These structures serve as membraneless compartments where complex biochemistry can be organized and facilitated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Holehouse and Pappu, 2018</xref>); for example, T cell receptor-mediated actin nucleation efficacy spikes up multifold when all the associated signaling molecules concentrate into a condensate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Su et al., 2016</xref>) near the plasma membrane. These structures are also implicated in many age-related or neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mathieu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Numerous theoretical and experimental studies have illuminated many of the biophysical requirements for condensate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Shin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, it is firmly established that clustering of weakly interacting multivalent proteins or nucleic acids is a prerequisite for the phase separation. Even a sufficiently concentrated solution of a single self-interacting protein (homotypic interaction) with multiple binding sites in its sequence can partition into protein-dense and dilute phases. Such homotypic systems display a strict threshold concentration above which phase separation occurs. This phase separation serves as a buffering mechanism for the protein in the dilute phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Holehouse and Pappu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Klosin et al., 2020</xref>), which remains at the threshold concentration; thus, as more protein is added to the system, the dense phase droplets grow in size and number, keeping the concentration clamped in the dilute phase. Although a homotypic system closely conforms to a single fixed threshold concentration, the picture gets much more complex with multicomponent (heterotypic interactions) systems, which underlie all the biomolecular condensates found in living cells and contain complex mixtures of multivalent proteins and/or nucleic acid. Detailed theoretical analysis of lattice-based simulations explained why the dilute phase concentrations of specific components need not stay fixed when phase separation is driven by heterotypic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2019</xref>). This was recently followed by a thorough experimental study of the thermodynamics of the liquid-liquid phase transitions in heterotypic systems, showing clearly that concentration thresholds for phase separation no longer remain fixed and vary with relative compositions of interacting binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Riback et al., 2020</xref>). But a theoretical framework for quantitatively predicting such complex varying concentration thresholds is still lacking.</p><p>We have previously distinguished between strong multivalent interactions, which can produce molecular machines, and weak multivalent interactions, which can produce what we termed ‘pleomorphic ensembles’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mayer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Falkenberg et al., 2013</xref>). The strong binding affinities in molecular machines (e.g., ribosomes, flagella) enforce a specific parts list with a fixed stoichiometry. Pleomorphic ensembles (e.g., cytoskeletal polymers and their associated binding proteins, neuronal post-synaptic densities, etc.) are much more plastic in their composition than molecular machines. Biomolecular condensates are a subclass of pleomorphic ensembles in that their molecular components simultaneously coexist within both a distinct phase and as solutes in the surrounding solution. In trying to quantitatively understand the relationships governing condensate formation from heterotypic components, we asked if there may be lessons to learn from ionic solution chemistry, where salts in solution are in equilibrium with a solid crystalline phase composed of a lattice of counter ions. We realized that the liquid phase separation at threshold concentrations of heterotypic biological molecules might resemble the precipitation of anions and cations from solution.</p><p>Consider a salt (let’s say silver chloride, AgCl) in water; dissolution takes place until the solution becomes saturated; further addition of salt results in precipitation. In the simplest case of pure AgCl, this seems to be similar to the behavior of a homotypic (single component) condensate; that is, above a threshold total concentration of dissolved AgCl, the salt will not dissolve further, maintaining a clamped concentration of Ag<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> in the solution above, whatever amount of AgCl is added. However, the key concept is that the saturation threshold is governed by the solubility product (SP) – the product of the individual concentrations of Ag<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>, [Ag<sup>+</sup>] * [Cl<sup>-</sup>]. Precipitation starts when this product reaches the thermodynamic parameter called the solubility productconstant, Ksp. For AgCl Ksp = 1.7 × 10<sup>−10 </sup>M<sup>2</sup> at 25°C. Importantly, if we add any Cl<sup>-</sup> in the form of a highly soluble salt (e.g., KCl) into the solution, some AgCl will precipitate to maintain the solubility product at Ksp. Of course, the crystal lattice in an ionic solid is very different from the set of weak multivalent interactions inside a biomolecular condensate. But we wondered whether the Ksp might at least approximately be used to understand heterotypic LLPS.</p><p>We explore how well Ksp may apply to biomolecular condensates using two stochastic modeling approaches. With a non-spatial network-free simulator (NFsim; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sneddon et al., 2011</xref>), we show how Ksp can approximately predict the phase separation threshold for a two-component system by systematically changing the concentration of individual components with a variety of valencies. We simulate the dynamics of cluster formation, demonstrating a dramatic transition from a stable distribution of small oligomers below Ksp to an unstable bimodal distribution of small oligomers and explosively growing large polymers at or above Ksp. We will also show how a more complex mixed-valent three-component system also conforms to a Ksp. Moreover, these simulation results help explain experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Riback et al., 2020</xref>), where individual components of heterotypic biomolecular condensates are <italic>not</italic> effectively buffered in the dilute phase. We then expand on prior work on the structural features governing multivalent clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chattaraj et al., 2019</xref>) with a spatial kinetic simulator (SpringSaLaD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Michalski and Loew, 2016</xref>) to support these conclusions and also point to some limitations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phase boundary of a two-component system with molecules of the same valency</title><p>Our baseline model system consists of a pair of tetravalent molecules (A<sub>4</sub> and B<sub>4</sub>), each having four binding sites that can interact with an affinity (Kd) of 350 µM. We start the NFsim simulation with the same concentrations of monomers of each type and measure the free monomer concentrations when the system reaches the steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The product of both free concentrations is called solubility product (SP). As we increase the total concentration (synchronously of both A<sub>4</sub> and B<sub>4</sub>), the concentration of monomeric molecules initially goes up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, inset) and of course SP also goes up; upon reaching a concentration threshold (total concentration ~120 µM in this case), SP plateaus to a constant value (169 µM<sup>2</sup>).

Similar to an analysis we employed in previous work using spatial simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chattaraj et al., 2019</xref>), we probed for how the number of available molecules (i.e., the system volume) affects the cluster size distribution below and above the threshold, 80 µM and 160 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). If the system shows no tendency to condense into large clusters, the size distribution will be insensitive to the number of molecules at a given total concentration. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows this to be the case for the 80 µM total concentration (SP = 154 µM<sup>2</sup> &lt; Ksp). The shape of the cluster size distribution displays an exponential decline from monomers to higher oligomers, and this shape is insensitive to increasing the number of molecules (i.e., volume) in the system (unbinned histograms are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Even in the presence of 800 molecules, there are hardly any clusters greater than 40 molecules (lowest panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Approximately 80% of the total molecules are in clusters containing less than 10 molecules, no matter how many molecules are available in the system. Extrapolating to a macroscopic system, this would be equivalent to a single soluble phase consisting of mainly monomers and small oligomers.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> illustrate the cluster distribution for total concentration = 160 µM, above the threshold for constant SP (SP = 169 µM<sup>2</sup> = Ksp). The histogram does change shape, extending the tail to larger clusters eventually to become a bimodal distribution as we feed more molecules into the system (i.e., as we increase the volume). With 1600 molecules in the system, more than 20% of the total molecules are in clusters larger than 100 molecules. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> shows simulations with 10,000 molecules, averaged over 100 trajectories, systematically varying the total concentrations by changing the simulation volume (as opposed to changing the number of molecules within a fixed volume in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); the Ksp is still 169 µM<sup>2</sup> and bimodal distributions clearly develop above Ksp. We note that the long tail in these histograms (unbinned distribution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) is an average of 100 stochastic trajectories; examination of individual histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> (note the logarithmic scale on the abscissa) shows almost all of them individually containing just one huge cluster along with small oligomers. Thus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> demonstrate that if the system is above Ksp, molecules are funneled into macroclusters.</p><p>We hypothesize that this tendency to form increasingly larger clusters with more available molecules is a hallmark of phase separation behavior, as previously established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chattaraj et al., 2019</xref>), and that a constant solubility product (Ksp) is a quantitative indicator to mark the threshold that underlies biomolecular condensates. Here, we use the percolation boundary, the threshold for forming large clusters, as a proxy for phase separation, realizing that they may not be completely coincident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2020b</xref>). Below a threshold total concentration, when SP has not reached the constant level of Ksp, the tendency to form large clusters is low and the system would exist as a single phase (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Above the threshold where SP converges to the Ksp, the system tends to form very large clusters, yielding two different phases, manifest as bimodal cluster size histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The dense phase containing the larger clusters grows in size and the dilute phase concentration remains constant. Importantly, this behavior is precisely that of a buffering system, which has been proposed as one of the important biophysical functions of biomolecular condensates. The generality of this hypothesis will now be further explored through additional modeling scenarios.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Simulations with monomeric A<sub>4</sub> and B<sub>4</sub> maintained at fixed concentrations</title><p>We now further demonstrate that Ksp marks the phase transition threshold using an alternative modeling approach. In the first approach, we used a fixed total concentration (FTC) of molecules and measure the free monomer concentrations as the system reaches the steady state. In this second approach, we clamp the monomer concentrations to a constant value (clamped monomer concentration [‘CMC,], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and allow the total concentration (free plus bound) to change over time. This is achieved by creating reactions that rapidly create and destroy monomers, such that the concentration is clamped at the ratio of these rate constants – as long as these rates are much faster than the rates of the binding reactions.

However, going to CMC = 13 µM (SP = 169 µM<sup>2</sup> = Ksp), the total concentrations never reach a steady state. This phenomenon is more pronounced for a higher CMC (13.1 µM). Clearly the system is undergoing a fundamental change around SP = 169 µM<sup>2</sup>, identical to the threshold determined for FTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Both these modeling paradigms indicate that there is a solubility product constant (Ksp = 169 µM<sup>2</sup>) beyond which the system has a much higher propensity to form larger molecular clusters, the prerequisite for phase-separated droplet formation. Another striking feature is the variability of the total concentrations at CMC = 13 µM as illustrated by the error bars around the mean counts (second panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). When we look at the individual trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>), the system shows large fluctuations and variable lag times before irreversible growth near the phase boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, CMC = 13 µM); the total concentration explodes in some runs or fluctuates around a metastable state within the given time frame. The behavior is less stochastic away from the Ksp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>, CMC = 12.9 µM and 13.1 µM) as quantified by the relatively narrower error bars. The behavior at Ksp represents stochastic nucleation of clusters containing enough crosslinking that disassembly becomes unlikely; such larger clusters are sufficiently stable only at or above Ksp.</p><p>When we compare the outcomes from FTC and CMC methods, we see that the results are consistent with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, a</xref>nd <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Below the phase boundary, if we clamp the monomer concentrations to the value of free concentrations obtained from the FTC method, we recover the same steady-state total molecular concentrations (top six panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, at even slightly above the Ksp, the CMC total concentration increases with time, rather than leveling off to a higher steady value (bottom panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Phase transition depends on Ksp even when individual monomer concentrations are unequal</title><p>From ionic solution chemistry, we know that irrespective of the individual ionic concentrations, if the product of ion concentrations exceeds the Ksp of the salt (i.e., supersaturation), we always get precipitation to restore the solution concentrations to Ksp, even if one ion is present at a different concentration than the other (‘common ion effect’). We wanted to test whether that simple chemical principle works for our relatively complex multivalent molecular clustering system. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we analyze two cases when the product of reactant’s concentrations (SPs) is above (SP = 172 µM<sup>2</sup>) and below (160 µM<sup>2</sup>) the Ksp (169 µM<sup>2</sup>, derived from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). For each of those SPs, we vary the CMCs of A<sub>4</sub> and B<sub>4</sub> in such a way that the products of the CMCs are always equal to the assigned SP. Satisfyingly, we find that for SP &lt; Ksp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the systems converge to stable steady states (no phase transition); but for SP &gt; Ksp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), irrespective of individual clamped concentrations, systems always show unbounded growth (phase transition). We also titrated unequal FTCs, maintained at a ratio of 3:2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, in this computational experiment the free monomer concentration of the lower abundant component (B<sub>4</sub>) gets exhausted disproportionately as the threshold is approached, so that SP cannot quite reach Ksp (169 µM<sup>2</sup>) and actually begins to diminish somewhat at still higher FTC. However, cluster size distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) still becomes increasingly bimodal with higher concentrations suggesting a phase separating behavior.

Consider a penta- and trivalent (A<sub>5</sub>–B<sub>3</sub>) molecular pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To optimize the clustering such that all sites could potentially be bound would require a stoichiometry of 3A<sub>5</sub>:5B<sub>3</sub>. Maintaining this concentration ratio, as we titrate up the total concentrations, we see an interesting pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, inset): the free monomer concentration of B<sub>3</sub>, which is present in excess, goes up steadily; but the free A<sub>5</sub> goes up first and then starts to go down. When we take the product of free monomer concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), we do not see an SP profile that plateaus to a constant Ksp (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The Ksp expression for this mixed-valent binary system is analogous to a mixed-valent salt like Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>. Indeed, examining the cluster size distribution confirms that this mixed-valent system has a concentration threshold at the same total concentration 128 µM (48 µM A<sub>5</sub> + 80 µM B<sub>3</sub>) where this stoichiometry-adjusted SP becomes constant; beyond that point the cluster size distribution becomes bimodal and more and more molecules populate the larger clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Importantly, the free monomer concentrations do not display buffering above this threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, inset), with the concentration of the pentavalent monomer actually decreasing.

Component A<sub>3</sub> has three sites that can bind to a single domain of component B<sub>1,3</sub>; six sites in component C<sub>6</sub> interact with three different sites on component B<sub>1,3</sub>. In our simulations, all these bindings are assumed to have the same weak affinities (Kd = 350 µM). We started by establishing conditions where B<sub>1,3</sub> and C<sub>6</sub> alone could form a bimodal cluster distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), corresponding to a phase separation. We found that this binary system has a Ksp of ~2700 µM<sup>3</sup> (the units correspond to the ideal stoichiometry of 2 B<sub>1,3</sub>:1 C<sub>6</sub>). We then chose total concentrations of 120 µM B<sub>1,3</sub> and 60 µM C<sub>6</sub> (well above the phase transition in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and performed a series of simulations with increasing levels of A<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref> shows three ways to analyze these data, which we chose to match the way experimental data for titration of NPM1, a key component of the nucleolus, was analyzed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Riback et al., 2020</xref> (shown in the corresponding insets in the panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). We do not know the valencies and affinities for the components that make up the nucleolus, an archetypal biomolecular condensate, so we made no attempt to match the data quantitatively. However, we are gratified with the obvious qualitative match to the experimental patterns, especially the ability of our simple binding model to show how A<sub>3 </sub>does not display simple buffering in this scenario. Specifically, buffering, as observed in homotypic biomolecular condensates, would result in a plateau level of monomeric A<sub>3</sub> (or NPM1) as a function of total A<sub>3</sub> (the illustrative ‘expected’ behavior is shown for NPM1 in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, inset). Instead, our simulations and the corresponding data on the levels of NPM1 in the nucleoplasm (dilute phase) show an increasing concentration of the titrant.

These simulations also allowed us to focus on only the effects of binding valency and stoichiometry. We now apply a spatial simulation framework, SpringSaLaD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Michalski and Loew, 2016</xref>), where the roles of spatial features, such as steric hindrance, molecular flexibility and proximity, may also impact Ksp. A biomolecule is modeled as a collection of spherical sites connected by spring-like linkers. The spheres may be designated as binding sites within a rule-based modeling interface, assigning them macroscopic on and off rates that the software translates to reaction probabilities as the spheres penetrate a computed reaction radius dependent on the on-rate constant. Thus, the software is amenable to computational experiments where the geometric and reaction parameters of the system can be systematically varied.</p><p>Our spatial system consists of a pair of matched tetravalent molecules (A<sub>4a</sub> and B<sub>4b</sub>) where each molecule contains four binding sites, with interspersed pairs of linker sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These linker sites impart flexibility to the molecules mimicking the intrinsically disordered linker sequences that are found in many phase-separating multivalent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Posey et al., 2018</xref>). Each of the magenta sites can bind to each of the green sites with an affinity of 350 µM. We begin with 100 A<sub>4a</sub> and 100 B<sub>4b</sub> molecules, randomly distributed in a three-dimensional rectangular volume. As the system relaxes to the steady state, we quantify the monomer concentrations and plot their product (SP) as a function of the initial total concentration – the FTC approach we described above for NFsim. We generate an SP profile by systematically varying the FTC by changing the volume of the compartment, keeping the total molecular numbers same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The SP converges to a constant value (Ksp = 318 µM<sup>2</sup>) at a threshold FTC (~138 µM in this case). When we look at the detailed cluster size distributions at steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the dimer emerges as a preferred configuration both below and above the Ksp. This dimer preference arises from the matching valency and spatial arrangement of the binding sites in the two partner molecules; such an effect, which we term a ‘dimer trap,’ cannot be realized in non-spatial methods, such as NFsim. Above Ksp, however, most of the individual trajectories, much like NFsim, produce discontinuous distributions with small oligomers along with one or two very larger clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). This obvious bifurcation is obscured when averaging over multiple individual histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>) because the consistent population of small oligomers is reinforced while individual large clusters will become smeared out.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Spatial simulations demonstrate similar phase boundary behavior as network-free simulator (NFsim).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SpringSaLaD representations of a pair of tetravalent binders.

One can think of the CMC approach as being equivalent to having a large external reservoir of monomers that can rapidly diffuse into a volume where clustering is enabled. As we titrate up the CMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), the system undergoes a fundamental change at 17.85 µM, corresponding to SP = 318.6 µM<sup>2</sup>, which is approximately at the Ksp we derived from the FTC calculations. Below that boundary (CMC = 16.7 µM), total concentrations converge to a steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, top panel); at (CMC = 17.85 µM) or above the boundary (CMC = 18 µM), the total concentration of molecules keeps on going up with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, second and third panels). When we look at the individual total concentration trajectories for CMC = 17.85 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>), much like our NFsim results, some trajectories fluctuate around a lower steady state (dilute phase) for the given time frame while some trajectories shoot up (dense phase) after a variable lag. This stochastic behavior is also present for CMC = 18 µM, although the rate of growth is much faster in this case. As quantified by the error bars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, second and third panels), stochastic fluctuations are somewhat greater in spatial simulations than the non-spatial scenario. This stochasticity can be attributed to the variable lag before the nucleation of a sufficiently large cluster for irreversible and accelerating growth; higher variability in spatial simulations is expected due to a larger number of contributing factors like steric crowding and optimal geometric conformations of binding sites.</p><p>Certain features of these results are better appreciated via <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video3">3</xref>, each corresponding to a typical single trajectory at the three CMCs.

The videos each show the actual dynamics of cluster formation and diffusion within the 3D volume, synchronized with the time course of total molecular concentration and a dynamic histogram of cluster size distribution. <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref>, where monomer concentration is clamped at 16.7 µM (SP = 279 µM<sup>2</sup>, below Ksp), shows that the total molecular concentration fluctuates around ~80 µM, matching the third data point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. While this single trajectory is noisy, it corresponds well to the average of 50 trajectories in the top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. Importantly, the dynamic histogram in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref> shows that the system rarely samples a cluster size greater than 15 molecules, which we associate with a single dilute phase. <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video2">Figure 7—video 2</xref> displays a typical trajectory with CMC at the Ksp (monomer concentration 17.85 µM, SP = Ksp = 318.6 µM<sup>2</sup>). Instead of the steady state attained below Ksp (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref>), <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video2">Figure 7—video 2</xref> displays a noisy but accelerating increase in total concentration to a maximum of 500 µM at 400 ms and a corresponding filling of the simulation volume; the dynamic histogram (note the logarithmic scale of the x-axis compared to <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref>) shows primarily small clusters until about 200 ms, followed by a steady siphoning of newly appearing monomers into a single large cluster, which we associate with phase separation. <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video3">Figure 7—video 3</xref>, with CMC set just above Ksp at 18 µM, illustrates how one trajectory reaches a metastable steady state that lasts until ~180 ms, but ultimately explodes to almost 800 µM total concentration, virtually filling the available volume (as also noted for the corresponding averaged trajectories in the lowest panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This corresponds to a nucleation step, which lasts until the formation of a sufficiently large cluster to capture most newly appearing monomers. Motions and spatial locations of individual clusters can be visualized through <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video4">Figure 7—video 4</xref>, which is based on the same simulations used to produce <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video3">Figure 7—video 3</xref> (i.e., below and above Ksp, respectively). <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video4">Figure 7—video 4</xref> displays the individual clusters in a given time frame by computing their centroids and a radius of gyration around that center. For visual clarity, the cluster sizes are scaled down proportionately (by a factor of 4); for example, the largest cluster in the last time frame of the above Ksp (right panel) has a radius of gyration of ~48 nm. The dimension of the simulation volume is 100 * 100 * 120 nm<sup>3</sup>. Through <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video4">Figure 7—video 4</xref>, we can better appreciate the dramatically different spatial distributions of clusters below and above Ksp. The left panel, below Ksp, corresponds to a collection of small clusters homogeneously distributed across the simulation volume (single dilute phase), while the right panel illustrates the evolution of a large cluster (dense phase) coexisting with a pool of randomly distributed small clusters (dilute phase).</p><p>Like our non-spatial simulations, both FTC and CMC approaches yield self-consistent results for the spatial system: as the monomer SP remains below the Ksp threshold (318 µM<sup>2</sup>), the system exhibits only one phase; but above that threshold boundary, the molecules get partitioned into two different phases – a dilute phase with monomers and small oligomers and a highly clustered phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The validity of the Ksp is preserved even when the CMCs are unequal. We illustrate this by choosing two SPs, 280 µM<sup>2</sup> and 330 µM<sup>2</sup>, respectively below and above the Ksp, and varying the individual CMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E, F</xref>). Both the cases with SP = 280 µM<sup>2</sup> converge to a steady state, while SP = 330 µM<sup>2</sup> combinations explode in both cases. It should be noted that as the total concentration explodes in these simulations, the volume can become filled with newly created molecules; this puts a brake on the total concentration in long duration simulations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It has been widely understood that for single component, self-interacting (homotypic) multivalent systems undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), the concentration of monomer in the dilute phase remains fixed above the phase transition, no matter how much of the monomer is added to the system; this feature of biomolecular condensates underlies buffering and noise reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Holehouse and Pappu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Klosin et al., 2020</xref>). Of course, the maintenance of a fixed concentration in a saturated solution of a solute in equilibrium with its solid phase is an elementary thermodynamic rule. Recognizing this, we set out to see how far the analogy to solution chemistry could take us in considering heterotypic interactions between different multivalent binders. Somewhat more complex than the saturated solution of a single solute is the precipitation of solid salts from saturated solutions of their ions. Chemists well know that ionic solutions of weakly soluble salts are governed by the solubility product constant, Ksp = [C<sup>m+</sup>]<sup>n</sup>[A<sup>n-</sup>]<sup>m</sup>, where m and n are the valencies, respectively, of the cation C<sup>m+</sup> and anion A<sup>n-</sup>; importantly, n and m are the stoichiometries, respectively, of the cation and the anion in the solid phase to balance the positive to the negative charges. The solubility product constant derives from a fundamental thermodynamic principle – equality of chemical potential between coexisting phases (ions in solution and solid). We wondered whether similar expressions could define the thresholds for LLPS in multicomponent (heterotypic) multivalent interaction systems.</p><p>One limitation in the analogy is that the composition of the ionic solid phase, and therefore the activity, is invariant, making the system-free energy dependent on only the activities of the ions in solution. However, the ideal stoichiometry, which absolutely constrains the composition of an ionic solid, is not so strictly enforced in the condensed phase of a multivalent condensate because of the weak binding affinities that underlie these systems. Therefore, to explore how well the Ksp might apply to LLPS, we used a non-spatial stochastic network fee simulator, NFsim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sneddon et al., 2011</xref>); it isolates only the effect of valency and binding on the concentration dependence of clustering. We used a single weak binding affinity (Kd = 350 μM) for all our simulations. The efficiency of this computational method also made it possible to screen many scenarios with a sufficient number of molecules and trajectories to assure statistically that we were not missing any interesting effects. We used two approaches to assess the threshold behavior. First, we titrated up the total concentration of pairs of multivalent binders. We found that there was a threshold above which the concentration of free monomers obeyed a Ksp expression – that is, [A]<sup>n</sup>[B]<sup>m</sup>, where m and n are the ideal stoichiometries for an oligomer with all binding sites occupied. Below the Ksp threshold, the histogram of cluster size distributions tails off exponentially from monomers to small oligomers and its shape is independent of the number of molecules available (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, for total concentrations above the Ksp threshold, the histogram of cluster size distributions becomes bimodal, with an increasing population of huge clusters as more molecules are added to the system (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>); we consider this bimodal cluster size distribution to be a hallmark of phase separation. The individual trajectories show a separation between small oligomers and a single large cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This bifurcation between one large cluster and small oligomers has been used to define a percolation boundary, generally considered a proxy for phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2020a</xref>). To further relate the behavior of these stochastic systems to the macroscopic phase transition, we used a second modeling approach where we clamped the monomer concentrations (CMC) while allowing the clusters to grow. When monomer concentrations were clamped below the Ksp, the system reached a steady state identical to that of the corresponding closed fixed total concentration simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), with identical cluster distributions containing a single decaying histogram of cluster sizes. However, when the CMC was set to the Ksp or slightly above it, the plot of total concentration vs. time exploded following an initial lag (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that as new monomers enter the system they were funneled into large clusters without attaining a steady state. Together, we feel that the behavior of these two different modeling approaches shows that the Ksp defines a threshold of monomer concentrations above which a phase separation occurs.</p><p>The generality of the Ksp as an indicator of threshold was then further tested using different scenarios. We tested a situation where the total concentrations of each molecule in the binary tetravalent heterotypic system were unequal; while these simulations showed that the Ksp determined in the analysis of the equal concentration system was obeyed for a range of unequal concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), there will be deviations if the range is extended too far (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This deviation is not surprising considering that the binding affinities are weak, leaving an excess of binding sites empty within a cluster, when the free concentration of one binding partner is too highly depleted. We tested cases where the valencies were not identical for a binary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and even a ternary system of mixed valency interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In these systems, a more complex Ksp formulation was required to account for the appropriate ideal stoichiometry of the cluster. In both of these cases, the Ksp was successful in defining a threshold for phase separation.</p><p>The ternary system of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> also allowed us to explore how well the simple multivalent binding simulations could reproduce some recent experiments demonstrating how the components of heterotypic biomolecular condensates are <italic>not</italic> effectively buffered in the dilute phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Riback et al., 2020</xref>). For several prototypical cellular LLPS systems, this study elegantly showed that titration of a single component produced a free concentration of that component that increased even more rapidly than its total concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> inset is an example). The simulation results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> show that our simple multivalent binding system is able to reproduce these experimental titration patterns; importantly, it also further demonstrates, despite this failure of simple buffering, that the concentrations of individual components in the dilute phase are still constrained by Ksp.</p><p>Recent computational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2019</xref>) and theoretical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deviri and Safran, 2021</xref>) studies demonstrated that buffering of dilute phase concentrations in multicomponent systems has a complex relationship with the interplay of homotypic and heterotypic interactions. For a two-component heterotypic system, plotting the total concentrations of one component against the other produces a phase diagram with an elliptical region corresponding to the coexistence of the dilute and condensed phases; the system has a single phase anywhere outside that ellipse. In fact, the dilute and condensed phase concentrations remain constant (i.e., buffered) along tie lines that are approximately parallel to the major axis of the ellipse; buffering fails perpendicular to tie lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deviri and Safran, 2021</xref>). The derivation of approximate order parameters, such as a percolation boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2020b</xref>), to estimate the shape of phase diagrams, could be possible with our approach, but it is beyond the scope of this work. However, the SP should be approximately constant (Ksp) within the two-phase elliptic region. That is, the SP may be used to predict concentrations in the dilute phase even for short traversals <italic>perpendicular</italic> to tie lines in the phase diagram.</p><p>We turned to coarse-grained spatial simulations of clustering to determine if the Ksp might still be generally applicable when the shape and flexibility of multivalent molecules is explicitly considered. We used SpringSaLaD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Michalski and Loew, 2016</xref>) software; it models molecules as a series of linked spheres to represent domains within macromolecules. We had previously used this software to address the structural features that control clustering of multivalent molecules and showed that above a concentration threshold, the system display unlimited growth characteristic of LLPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chattaraj et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, we examined a heterotypic pair of tetravalent binders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), similar to the non-spatial model used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>. The SpringSaLaD structures included four binding spheres, each separated by a pair of linker spheres; the distances between sites were identical within each binding partner. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) show that this model displays the same behavior noted for the non-spatial model. The product of concentrations of monomer becomes independent of the total concentration above a threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). When monomer concentrations are clamped at or above this Ksp threshold, the total concentration explodes after a lag time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, F</xref>) and the histogram of cluster sizes becomes bimodal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). These results are dramatically displayed in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video3">3</xref>, corresponding to typical single trajectories for the clamped monomer concentrations below, at, and above Ksp, respectively; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video4">Figure 7—video 4</xref> offers a view directly comparing cluster sizes as a function of time below and above Ksp. Thus, the Ksp concept remains valid for the spatial system shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>.</p><p>Manipulation of computational models thus allowed us to systematically determine how well the Ksp concept, familiar from ionic solution chemistry, might apply to the very different situation of weak interactions between multivalent macromolecules. We found that for most scenarios, if not all, the Ksp does define a threshold for the unbounded growth of large clusters and a quantitative metric for the tendency of a system to phase separate. Additionally, for those cases where there are deviations from the stereotypical behavior, insights may be gleaned into the underlying molecular factors inhibiting cluster growth. But it is important to appreciate that experimental systems may introduce additional levels of complexity, such as nonspecific low-affinity binding interactions and long-range electrostatic forces. For real biomolecular condensates, the valency and stoichiometry of the components may be unknown, and they may have multiple binding interaction of differing affinities. However, it should be possible to measure Ksp experimentally using fluorescently labeled binding partners and determining their concentrations in the dilute and condensed phase via quantitative confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fink et al., 1998</xref>). Titration experiments can readily be performed in vitro and have been among the earliest studies of biomolecular condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, methods have been developed to perform titrations in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Riback et al., 2020</xref>). Such experiments could serve, initially, to validate the Ksp concept. Beyond validation, enough such data may make it possible to find optimal fits to a Ksp expression, providing an indication of the effective valency of the interactions in complex multivalent biomolecular condensates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Non-spatial simulations (NFsim)</title><p>To develop models that probe for the effects of valency and concentrations but do not account for spatial effects, we employ the NFsim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sneddon et al., 2011</xref>) – a non-spatial rule-based stochastic simulation framework where each biomolecule represents a molecular object that may have multiple binding sites. These sites can bind with other sites depending on a set of rules defined in the model. The simulations have units of molecular counts, but these can be readily converted to equivalent concentrations, which is how we present our results.</p><p>The NFsim model file is specified in BioNetGen Language (BNGL<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bionetgen.org/">; http://bionetgen.org/</ext-link>). Let us take the example of tetravalent binders – A<sub>4</sub> (a1, a2, a3, a4) and B<sub>4</sub> (b1, b2, b3, b4). We need 16 binding rules to define all the bimolecular interactions, each having an affinity (Kd) of 350 µM. Now 1000 molecules of A<sub>4</sub> and B<sub>4</sub> with an affinity of 3500 molecules would translate to 100 µM molecular concentrations with 350 µM binding affinity. There are two equivalent ways to change the molecular concentrations: (1) change the Kd, keeping the molecular counts same, which is mathematically equivalent to changing the volume of the system; (2) change the molecular counts, keeping the Kd same. We utilize both approaches for our simulations and specify which is used in our descriptions of the results. We chose binding rules to only allow inter-molecular binding; we felt this was appropriate because NFsim cannot account for spatial proximity of binding sites or steric crowding within clusters. Once the BNGL file is defined, we then generate the corresponding XML file, which serves as the NFsim input file. We run multiple stochastic simulations in parallel using the high-performance computing facility at UConn Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://health.uconn.edu/high-performance-computing/">https://health.uconn.edu/high-performance-computing/</ext-link>). A single NFsim run (500 ms, FTC approach), containing 1000 A<sub>4</sub> and B<sub>4</sub> molecules each, took ~1 min with 100 trajectories run in parallel. A Python script is then used to perform statistical analysis across all the trajectories.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Spatial simulations (SpringSaLaD)</title><p>To account for realistic spatial geometry, we employ SringSaLaD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Michalski and Loew, 2016</xref>) – a particle-based spatial simulation platform where each biomolecule is modeled as a collection of hard spheres connected by stiff spring-like linkers. The simulation algorithms are fully described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Michalski and Loew, 2016</xref>), and we previously studied various spatial biophysical factors in the context of multivalent biomolecular cluster formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chattaraj et al., 2019</xref>) with this software. SpringSaLaD also uses a rule-based method to define binding reactions between multivalent binders.</p><p>The SpringSaLaD model files are generated using the graphical user interface (GUI) of the software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://vcell.org/ssalad">https://vcell.org/ssalad</ext-link>). We define the size of binding sites, distance between the binding sites and the overall shape of the molecule inside the GUI. To build a spatial version of the reference system (A<sub>4a</sub> and B<sub>4b</sub>), two linear tetravalent molecules are constructed first, each having four binding sites and six linker sites. Unlike NFsim, in SpringSaLaD, one binding rule between ‘A_type’ and ‘B_type’ sites can take care of all the possible binding interactions. Also, we can define the binding affinity in concentration units (350 µM) directly inside the GUI. We initialize our system in a 3D rectangular geometry; for example, 100 molecules in a 10<sup>6</sup> nm<sup>3</sup> cubic volume (X = Y = Z = 100 nm) would correspond to 166 µM. We change the volume of our system to alter the molecular concentrations. Once the model is specified, as before, we run multiple stochastic simulations in parallel using our high-performance computing facility. Execution time is very much sensitive to the number of total sites due to the computational overhead of tracking individual site locations. A typical run (50 ms, FTC approach), containing 100 molecules each of A<sub>4a</sub> and B<sub>4b</sub> (total sites = 2000), took ~6 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data analysis and visualization</title><p>Python scripts are used to analyze and visualize the data.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by José Faraldo-Gómez as the Senior Editor. All reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1. Please refocus the title, abstract and scope to highlight the proposal/finding that the solubility product &quot;rescues&quot; the concept of buffering even in systems where heterotypic interactions drive phase transitions. The consensus is that the solubility product might be rather useful, if it can be readily calculated, to set expectations regarding thresholding/buffering in systems with heterotypic interactions, i.e., all biomolecular condensates.</p><p>2. Please improve the overall scholarship to place the work in the appropriate context. Please note that Choi et al., previously explained why the dilute phase concentrations of specific components need not stay fixed when phase separation is driven by heterotypic interactions. Please see Figure 12 and the accompanying discussion in https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007028.</p><p>Please also note that Deviri and Safran have introduced a physical theory for how buffering can be achieved when phase separation is driven by heterotypic interactions.

Please eliminate all remarks about freshman chemistry or high school chemistry.</p><p>4. Please provide a mechanistic explanation for the implications of solubility products setting thresholds.</p><p>5. The consensus is that the section on the effects of linkers detracts from the focus of the manuscript. A detailed and rigorous treatment of this subject has been published in <italic>eLife</italic> by Harmon et al.,. We recommend that the revised manuscript exclude all results beyond Figure 7. This, we believe, will sharpen the focus, highlight novel aspects, and avoid overlap with work that has come before.</p><p>6. The reviewers have raised specific concerns and weaknesses regarding the solubility product. It is a useful concept that touches base with percolation transitions, but not necessarily with the rigor of concepts underlying phase transitions. Specifically, the connections between solubility products and slopes of tie lines needs to be established. We believe that this is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, but it will be very helpful to discuss this issue in a revised Discussion section. Please also note that formal order parameters are not being used in either simulation paradigm for defining phase separation.</p><p>7. Please provide a synthesis to explain how either simulation paradigm and the calculation of solubility products can be used to analyze experimental data. In doing so, please spell out the type of experimental data that will come in handy in testing the hypothesis that the solubility product sets an upper limit in systems with heterotypic interactions, thereby enabling the field to assess where the buffering capacity lies in distinct multicomponent systems.</p><p>8. And please consider presenting analyses in terms of amplitudes of fluctuations. These will likely help in paring down the number of panels that one presents for each system.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic>There, unfortunately, are far too many concerns to be raised with regard to the technical and theoretical aspects of this work. A lot of new jargon terms are introduced without connecting to established terminology. The work on linkers is a minimalist redux of that of Harmon et al. The &quot;dimer trap&quot;, also explained by Harmon et al., is a redux of the work of Wingreen and colleagues. The unique insight here has to do with the finding / proposal that the solubility product sets an upper limit on the joint concentrations, and hence appears to rescue the concept of buffering in systems with heterotypic interactions. Recent work from Deviri and Safran and from at least one other lab have introduced the concept of heterotypic buffering and provided rigorous thermodynamic descriptions, in the language and formalism of slopes of tie lines, focusing on chemical and mechanical equilibria to explain the full range of buffering capacities realizable as a consequence of the interplay between homotypic and heterotypic interactions. If we remove all the parts of the current manuscript that are best described as redux, then we are left with the solubility product and the rescue of buffering as the novel insight. What is lacking is a rigorous connection to the concepts of phase separation and percolation, achievable only through the calculation of full phase diagrams or at least coexisting curves and the demonstration that the solubility product is invariant along tie lines, and it should be true for all tie lines.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The resolution of the cluster sizes is quite low for the non-spatial simulations, showing only 4 bins, whereas it is much higher for the spatial ones. Why so low?</p><p>– The movies are helpful in observing the dynamics, but what are the Spring constants?</p><p>– Does Ksp still hold in Figure 5 when the Stoichiometry of components is not 5:3?</p><p>– In Figure 6, what is the fit function to the dots?</p><p>– Do all sites retain excluded volume, even when they are bound to other sites?</p><p>– What rate constants were used? What was the integration time-step? Are the results sensitive to these choices?</p><p>– I think mentioning freshman/high school chemistry once in the paper is enough. The repeated references in the discussion to the age at which we all should have learned this start to sound like a failure of the field. A text book reference could instead emphasize that the concept is old and well established.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic>The authors claim that the solubility product is a simple yet useful concept to study the phase boundary, but in fact, the solubility product is a specific realization of a much more general concept of the reaction quotient (Q) and the equilibrium constant (K), which is also from freshman chemistry. Hence, their simulation data just show that at low concentrations Q is smaller than K, and after Q reaches K, it remains constant. What is the benefit of using Ksp instead of more general K?</p><p>Unfortunately, it seems to me that there are almost no new findings relevant to the field of phase separation biology. Importance of the linker flexibility and the sticker spacing in phase separation have been known for a while, and the valency effect as well.

We have eliminated the additional results (Figure 8) on how the Ksp might be influenced by structural features of the interacting molecules. Of course, the Ksp reduces to simple buffering for homotypic systems, so the last comment of the editor that our idea applies to all biomolecular condensates is also helpful. We believe we have captured this refocus in our new title and abstract:</p><p>“The solubility product extends the buffering concept to heterotypic biomolecular condensates.”</p><p>“Biomolecular condensates are formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of multivalent molecules. LLPS from a single (”homotypic”) constituent is governed by buffering: above a threshold, free monomer concentration is clamped, with all added molecules entering the condensed phase. However, both experiment and theory demonstrate that buffering fails for the concentration dependence of multi-component (“heterotypic”) LLPS. Using network-free stochastic modeling, we demonstrate that LLPS can be described by the solubility product constant (Ksp): the product of free monomer concentrations, accounting for the ideal stoichiometries governed by the valencies, displays a threshold above which additional monomers are funneled into large clusters; this reduces to simple buffering for homotypic systems. The Ksp regulates the composition of the dilute phase for a wide range of valencies and stoichiometries. The role of Ksp is further supported by coarse-grained spatial particle simulations. Thus, the solubility product offers a general formulation for the concentration dependence of LLPS.”</p><p>We have extensively revised the manuscript to focus on this message, to address the other issues raised by the reviewers and to further clarify the presentation. The major changes that address the Reviewers’ comments are highlighted in red in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

For a two-component heterotypic system, plotting the total concentrations of one component against the other produces a phase diagram with an elliptical region corresponding to the coexistence of the dilute and condensed phases; the system has a single phase anywhere outside that ellipse. In fact, the dilute and condensed phase concentrations remain constant (i.e. buffered) along tie-lines that are approximately parallel to the major axis of the ellipse; buffering fails perpendicular to tie lines [23]. The derivation of approximate order parameters, such as a percolation boundary [13, 21], to estimate the shape of phase diagrams, could be possible with our approach, but it is beyond the scope of this work. However, the solubility product should be approximately constant (Ksp) within the two-phase elliptic region. That is, the solubility product may be used to predict concentrations in the dilute phase even for short traversals perpendicular to tie lines in the phase diagram.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

In doing so, please spell out the type of experimental data that will come in handy in testing the hypothesis that the solubility product sets an upper limit in systems with heterotypic interactions, thereby enabling the field to assess where the buffering capacity lies in distinct multicomponent systems.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the concluding sentences to suggest how the Ksp concept could lead to new experimental insights:</p><p>“However, it should be possible to measure Ksp experimentally using fluorescently labelled binding partners and determining their concentrations in the dilute and condensed phase via quantitative confocal microscopy [24]. Titration experiments can readily be performed in vitro and have been among the earliest studies of biomolecular condensates [9]. More recently, methods have been developed to perform titrations in cells [14]. Such experiments could serve, initially, to validate the Ksp concept. Beyond validation, enough such data may make it possible to find optimal fits to a Ksp expression, providing an indication of the effective valency of the interactions in complex multivalent biomolecular condensates.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

Individual trajectories displaying varying time lags for nucleation, are now available in Supporting Figures. Because of this interesting variable nucleation time, we felt it was important to include them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There, unfortunately, are far too many concerns to be raised with regard to the technical and theoretical aspects of this work.

We also attempted to better place our work, which is more chemistry oriented, in the context of previous work on the physics of LLPS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The resolution of the cluster sizes is quite low for the non-spatial simulations, showing only 4 bins, whereas it is much higher for the spatial ones. Why so low?</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected. Importantly, we now also show histograms for single FTC simulations at steady state (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3); these show clear bifurcations between an exponentially decreasing distribution at low cluster sizes in equilibrium with a single cluster at a very high molecular count.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The movies are helpful in observing the dynamics, but what are the Spring constants?</p></disp-quote><p>We use the default value throughout: dt_spring = 10-9 s<sup>-1</sup> (see input file in the Git repository). The algorithm only uses the stiff springs to transmit the Langevin forces between linked spheres; their actual deformation is negligible. See [19] for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Does Ksp still hold in Figure 5 when the Stoichiometry of components is not 5:3?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 shows that when we deviate from ideal stoichiometry (for A4 – B4, it is 1:1), SP reaches a maximal level close to the Ksp derived from the ideal stoichiometry. The maximal point does represent the onset of phase transition. We did not try this for a titration with a non-ideal stoichiometry for the system in Figure 5, but expect it to behave similarly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 6, what is the fit function to the dots?</p></disp-quote><p>The data is fitted to a generic function y = a*x n where a and n are pre-exponent and exponent factors respectively.

Of course all these values were kept the same for all simulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I think mentioning freshman/high school chemistry once in the paper is enough.

What is the benefit of using Ksp instead of more general K?</p></disp-quote><p>All of the points in our FTC titration diagrams are at equilibrium. The reaction quotient (Q) refers to a system that is out of equilibrium, allowing the chemist to predict how concentrations will change as equilibrium is approached, so we do not understand the relevance of this comment. Furthermore, we don’t see how an equilibrium constant, K for these complex systems could be formulated. Because of multivalency, we are dealing with systems containing multiple cascading reversible reactions and an infinite number of possible species and also with a system that undergoes a phase transition (or percolation transition). The key point in our treatment is that the SP, which can be determined empirically, converges to an approximate constant at the concentration threshold for LLPS (or more precisely, the percolation threshold). We are sorry that Reviewer 3 missed this key point and hope that the revised manuscript will help her/him understand the novelty of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unfortunately, it seems to me that there are almost no new findings relevant to the field of phase separation biology.
