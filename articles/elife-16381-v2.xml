While patients with ANE syndrome have fewer mature ribosomes, it is unclear how this mutation disrupts ribosome assembly. Here we use yeast as a model system and show that the mutation confers growth and pre-rRNA processing defects. Recently, we found that Nop4 is a hub protein in the nucleolar large subunit (LSU) processome interactome. Here we demonstrate that the ANE syndrome mutation disrupts Nop4’s hub function by abrogating several of Nop4’s protein-protein interactions. Circular dichroism and NMR demonstrate that the ANE syndrome mutation in RRM3 of human RBM28 disrupts domain folding. We conclude that the ANE syndrome mutation generates defective protein folding which abrogates protein-protein interactions and causes faulty pre-LSU rRNA processing, thus revealing one aspect of the molecular basis of this human disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16381.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16381.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16381.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>ANE syndrome is a rare genetic disease that causes many problems including hair loss, mental retardation and a failure to develop normally during puberty. A study of 5 boys in the same family that were all born with the condition revealed that the disease is caused by a small change (or mutation) in a protein called RBM28.

The fundamental cellular process of ribosome assembly requires the coordinated action of all three RNA polymerases, over 200 biogenesis factors, and a number of small nucleolar RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Thomson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Woolford and Baserga, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernández-Pevida et al., 2015</xref>). In yeast, ribosome biogenesis initiates in the nucleolus with the transcription of the 35S polycistronic pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor by RNA polymerase I. The 35S pre-rRNA undergoes a number of cleavage and modification events to give rise to the mature 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNAs. Mutations that partially disrupt ribosome assembly or function are often deleterious and can lead to disease in humans. Collectively, these diseases of ribosome biogenesis are called ribosomopathies. Ribosomopathies are caused by mutations in proteins that function in all stages of ribosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McCann and Baserga, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armistead and Triggs-Raine, 2014</xref>).</p><p>A homozygous missense mutation in the nucleolar protein RBM28 causes the ribosomopathy, alopecia, neurological defects and endocrinopathy (ANE) syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nousbeck et al., 2008</xref>).

The mutation segregated in the family in an autosomal recessive manner and was mapped to a single leucine to proline amino acid substitution at position 351 (L351P) of RBM28. This residue resides in the first α-helix of its third RNA recognition motif (RRM3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). ANE syndrome was classified as a ribosomopathy because RBM28 is localized to the nucleolus and because patient fibroblasts showed reduced numbers of ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Damianov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nousbeck et al., 2008</xref>). While the L351P mutation is predicted to disrupt the first α-helix of RRM3 and thereby impair RBM28 function, it is not known how this single amino acid substitution disrupts the normal function of RBM28 in the nucleolus.

Recently, the LSU processome interactome revealed that Nop4 functions as a hub protein, interacting with many more proteins than average within the LSU processome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCann et al., 2015</xref>).

Surprisingly, the C-terminal half of Nop4, where the ANE syndrome mutation occurs, is necessary and sufficient for hub protein function, cell growth and pre-rRNA processing. Consistent with these findings, circular dichroism and NMR reveal that the ANE mutation in RRM3 of the Nop4 human ortholog, RBM28, disrupts folding of the entire domain, not just the first α-helix. Together, these results suggest that the molecular basis of ANE syndrome lies in defective protein folding that reduces protein interactions and the function of RBM28 as a hub protein, resulting in pre-rRNA processing defects in the nucleolus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The ANE syndrome mutation in Nop4 causes growth defects in yeast</title><p>Our goal was to elucidate the molecular basis of the ribosomopathy ANE syndrome, which is attributed to a single amino acid substitution, L351P, in RBM28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nousbeck et al., 2008</xref>). Human RBM28 can complement the growth defect in the yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, when its ortholog, the essential Nop4 protein, is depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kachroo et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we used yeast genetics to pinpoint the molecular basis of ANE syndrome. A ClustalX alignment of the yeast Nop4 and human RBM28 amino acid sequences permitted identification of the orthologous ANE syndrome mutation in Nop4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Over their entire length, the amino acid sequences of Nop4 and RBM28 are ~26% identical and 34% similar, and both contain four RRMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The ANE syndrome mutation in human RBM28, L351P, is within the third RRM. Inspection of the alignment revealed an orthologous leucine in the third RRM of yeast Nop4, which we mutated to proline to introduce the ANE syndrome mutation into Nop4 (L306P; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We determined that the ANE syndrome mutation in Nop4 (L306P) impaired yeast growth. We generated a strain where endogenous <italic>NOP4</italic> is under the control of a galactose-inducible, glucose-repressible promoter and tagged with a triple-HA epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Unmutated (wild type; WT) Nop4 or Nop4 L306P protein is tagged with a triple-FLAG epitope and constitutively expressed from a plasmid (p414GPD). Western blotting of total protein demonstrated that after growth of this strain in glucose for 48 hr at 23°C, the endogenous Nop4 was reduced to undetectable levels and plasmid-borne Nop4 WT and Nop4 L306P were expressed at comparable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Serial dilutions of strains bearing the plasmids: empty vector (EV), Nop4 WT and Nop4 L306P were spotted onto plates containing glucose and incubated at 30°C, 37°C, 23°C and 17°C. At all tested temperatures, depletion of Nop4 (EV) conferred a severe growth defect relative to growth of Nop4 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The L306P mutation impaired growth at all temperatures tested compared to WT, although the defect was not as severe as that observed with the EV control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To confirm our findings, we analyzed growth in liquid medium at 23°C and estimated the doubling time for each strain. Endogenous Nop4 was depleted and the growth of strains bearing the plasmids: EV, Nop4 WT or Nop4 L306P was monitored for 48 hr. Similar to growth on solid medium, Nop4 L306P exhibited a moderate growth defect in liquid culture, doubling every 7.8 hr, compared to WT, which doubled every 4.8 hr; however, the defect was not as severe as that observed with the EV control, which doubled every 20.5 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The ANE syndrome mutation causes pre-rRNA processing defects in yeast</title><p>The ANE syndrome mutation, L306P in yeast Nop4, also disrupts pre-rRNA processing. As growth defects caused by mutation of a nucleolar protein are often indicative of ribosome biogenesis defects, we tested whether the growth defects conferred by Nop4 L306P were due to disruption of ribosome biogenesis. Previously, it has been shown that the mature 25S rRNA and the 27S and 7S pre-rRNA precursors are severely reduced in yeast depleted of Nop4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergès et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun and Woolford, 1994</xref>). To determine whether Nop4 L306P similarly disrupts production of the 25S rRNA, total RNA was harvested from strains bearing plasmids expressing no Nop4 (empty vector; EV), Nop4 WT or Nop4 L306P and depleted of endogenous Nop4 for 0 and 48 hr. The 25S and 18S rRNAs were visualized by ethidium bromide staining, quantified and the ratio of 25S/18S, a measure of the relative levels of the mature rRNAs, was calculated and normalized to Nop4 WT for each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> top panels). The observed decrease in the 25S/18S ratios correlated with the trend of the observed growth defects. The EV control, which had the most severe growth defect, also had the most severe reduction in 25S/18S ratio levels in comparison to Nop4 WT.

While all 5 bait proteins interacted with Nop4 WT, as indicated by growth on SD-Leu-Trp-His + 6 mM 3-AT, Mak5, Nop4, and Nsa2 did not interact with Nop4 L306P, as no growth was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Noc2 did interact with Nop4 L306P, but growth was reduced compared to WT. In contrast, Dbp10 interaction with Nop4 was unaffected by the L306P mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, the presence of the ANE syndrome mutation (L306P) disrupts Nop4 interaction with a subset of Nop4’s interacting proteins (Mak5, Nop4, Nsa2 and Noc2) by Y2H, suggesting that the ANE syndrome mutation disrupts Nop4 function as a hub protein in the LSU processome.</p><p>To confirm our findings, we utilized a co-immunoprecipitation method developed to validate Y2H datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCann et al., 2015</xref>) to assay for changes in protein-protein interactions in the presence of the ANE syndrome mutation (L306P). Nop4 WT and Nop4 L306P were expressed as 3xHA fusion proteins from the modified yeast expression vector p414GPD-3xFLAG and the 5 Nop4-interacting proteins were expressed as 3xFLAG fusion proteins from the modified yeast expression vector p415GPD-3xHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mumberg et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCann et al., 2015</xref>).

To test this, we analyzed WT and mutant human RBM28 RRM3 domains (amino acids 330–419) by circular dichroism (CD) and NMR. We used RBM28 RRM3 because Nop4 RRM3 was not soluble. We found that the L351P mutation disrupts the backbone structure of the RBM28 RRM3 domain. The CD spectra of WT and L351P RBM28 RRM3 showed notable differences in ellipticities [θ] at 208, 215 and 222 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), indicating that the amino acid substitution reduced α-helical and β-sheet content. The CD spectrum of the L351P mutant protein with a minimum only at ~200 nm indicated the presence of random coil. We confirmed the disruption of domain folding by NMR. <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC of WT RBM28 RRM3 showed well dispersed resonances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), indicating the presence of both α-helices and β-strands, as expected for an RRM domain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nagai et al., 1990</xref>). In contrast, the majority of resonances in the spectrum of L351P ANE syndrome mutant RRM3 were clustered around 8.0~8.5 ppm in the proton dimension, demonstrating that the mutant protein backbone is disordered. A homology model of the human RBM28 RRM3, based on an NMR structure of mouse RBM28 RRM3, indicates that L351 is buried within the core of the domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

Introducing the ANE syndrome mutation into RRM3 of the yeast ortholog, Nop4 (L306P), causes growth and pre-rRNA processing defects, as well as reduced association with interacting protein partners. RRMs 3 and 4 of Nop4 alone are necessary and sufficient for Nop4 protein-protein interactions and for yeast growth and pre-rRNA processing. Biophysical methods indicate that RRM3 containing the ANE syndrome mutation is unfolded. Taken together, these results provide evidence that ANE syndrome is a ribosomopathy with a molecular defect in nucleolar steps of ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>The finding that an essential function of Nop4 is to mediate protein binding was unexpected. Nop4 has been cross-linked to pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergès et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun and Woolford, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Granneman et al., 2011</xref>), leading to the expectation that its 4 RRMs would be essential for RNA binding. We show by Y2H analysis that the C-terminal half of Nop4 (RRMs 3 and 4) mediates protein-protein interactions and hub protein function in the LSU processome. Strikingly, this half of Nop4 is necessary and sufficient to complement the growth and pre-rRNA processing defects observed upon depletion of endogenous Nop4. As the ANE syndrome mutation occurs in RRM3 and disrupts Nop4 protein-protein interactions, ANE syndrome is therefore likely a disease of altered protein interaction rather than of RNA binding. We are now in a position to determine which interactions are critical for Nop4 function and how disruptions of those specific interactions contribute to ANE syndrome pathogenesis.</p><p>Nevertheless, Nop4 is undoubtedly an RNA-binding protein. Nop4 binds RNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sun and Woolford, 1997</xref>), co-immunoprecipitates the 27S and 7S pre-rRNAs and crosslinks to the 25S within the pre-rRNA in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Granneman et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, all 4 RRMs are important for Nop4 function as mutations in any of the RRMs disrupt growth and LSU assembly at 37°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sun and Woolford, 1997</xref>). Although RRMs 1 and 2 are not required for Nop4’s hub protein function or sufficient for growth, they may bind the pre-rRNA. Furthermore, while RRMs 3 and 4 mediate protein binding, the possibility that they may also bind RNA is not precluded.</p><p>How does an RRM facilitate protein binding and thus hub protein function? Several examples of RRMs mediating interactions with other proteins have been identified including in the U2AF<sup>35</sup>-U2AF<sup>65</sup>, the U2AF<sup>65</sup>-SF1, the Snu17-Bud13, and the Y14-Mago complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kielkopf et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fribourg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lau et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Selenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tripsianes et al., 2014</xref>). An RRM is comprised of a 4-stranded β-sheet, which forms the primary RNA binding interface, and 2 α-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maris et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cléry et al., 2008</xref>). The α-helices of the RRM often mediate interaction between protein pairs, leaving the β-sheet accessible for RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kielkopf et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Selenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tripsianes et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, in the case of the Y14-Mago complex, the interaction is through the β-sheet, which precludes RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fribourg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lau et al., 2003</xref>). RRMs also can serve as oligomerization domains. In the case of Human antigen R (HuR), the third RRM promotes dimerization through its α-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scheiba et al., 2014</xref>). These examples highlight the possibility that RRMs 3 and 4 of Nop4 may mediate protein binding and hub function through more than one of its structural motifs. The ANE mutation lies in an α-helix and the mutation disrupts not only the α-helix, but unfolds the RRM tertiary structure. Since the mutation abrogates some but not all protein-protein interactions, a subset of Nop4 interactions may be mediated by unstructured peptide elements in RRM3 or by the RRM4 domain.</p><p>Fibroblasts from patients with ANE syndrome have ribosome levels reduced to approximately 60% of controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nousbeck et al., 2008</xref>), consistent with the modest defects in ribosome biogenesis that we can now associate with the ANE syndrome mutation. In the yeast model system, the mutation confers reduced growth and mild pre-rRNA processing defects when compared to the Nop4 null (EV). Thus, the ANE syndrome mutation is a hypomorphic allele, consistent with its autosomal recessive inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nousbeck et al., 2008</xref>). This hypomorphism may, in part, explain how the ANE syndrome mutation is compatible with life, as the presence of the mutation leads to a partially functional RBM28 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Amino acid sequence alignment</title><p>The amino acid sequence of Nop4 was obtained from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.yeastgenome.org">www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>).

The resulting transformed strains were grown in medium containing 2% dextrose and lacking leucine and tryptophan (SD-Leu-Trp) at 30°C. Negative control strains were only transformed with p415GPD-3xHA-GW clones and were grown in medium containing 2% dextrose and lacking leucine (SD-Leu) at 30°C. For each co-immunoprecipitation, 20 mL of cells at an OD<sub>600</sub> of ~0.5 was collected, washed with water and resuspended in NET2 (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) with 1x HALT protease inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, Illinois). Cells were lysed with 0.5-mm glass beads. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000g for 10 min at 4°C. Aliquots of 500 µL of lysate were incubated with α-FLAG beads (Sigma) for 1 hr at 4°C. The beads were washed five times with NET2 and resuspended in 25 µL SDS loading dye. Immunoprecipitates were separated on 4–12% Bis-Tris PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Western blot analysis with α-HA (Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts) and α-FLAG-HRP (Sigma) was performed. The protein bands were quantified using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) and the ratio of HA to FLAG was calculated. GraphPad PRISM was used to plot the means of the ratios with error bars (SD). Significance compared to the WT control for each interacting protein was determined using a t-test. Three biological replicates were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>For analysis of the Nop4 fragment localization, the YPH499 <italic>GAL::3xHA-NOP4</italic> yeast strain was transformed with either pACT2 Nop4 WT, pACT2 Nop4 RRM 1–2 or pACT2 Nop4 RRM 3–4 and endogenous Nop4 was depleted for 48 hr at 23°C as described above. For immunofluorescence, 50 mL of cells at an OD<sub>600</sub> of ~0.5 was collected, washed with water, resuspended in Fixing buffer (100 mM Sucrose, 5% paraformaldehyde) and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. The cells were then washed three times with Buffer B (100 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.5, 1.2 M sorbitol), resupsended in 1 ml of Spheroplasting buffer (100 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.5, 1.2 M sorbitol, 30 mM β-mercaptoethanol) containing lyticase (Sigma) at 800 U/mL and incubated for 8 min at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 mL of ice-cold Buffer B. The yeast were washed once with ice-cold Buffer B, resuspended in 1 ml of Buffer B and 500 µL were plated into each well of a 12-well plate containing a poly-D-lysine coated cover glass. Cells were incubated for 1 hr at 4°C, washed once with Buffer B and permeabilized overnight in 70% ethanol at -20°C. Fixed and permeabilized cells incubated with mouse anti-HA.11 (BioLegend, San Diego, California) diluted 1:1000 for 90 min at room temperature. The secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-Mouse; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) was used at a dilution of 1:1000 and was incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Cover glasses were mounted with Prolong Gold containing DAPI (Life Technologies) and cells were imaged on a wide-field, epifluorescence microscope using a x100 oil-immersion objective (Carl Zeiss).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> codon-optimized cDNAs encoding the wild type (WT) and L351P mutant human RBM28 RRM3 (330-419) were obtained by gene synthesis (Genewiz, Inc.). The cDNAs were subcloned into pSMT3 with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO tag. WT and L351P human RBM28 RRM3 domains were overexpressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California) at 20 °C overnight after induction with 0.5 mM IPTG. The cells were collected by centrifugation, and pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl) and stored at −80 °C until use.</p><p>Cells expressing WT human RBM28 RRM3 domain were disrupted by sonication. The soluble fraction was applied to a Ni-NTA agarose column and thoroughly washed with lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. The target SUMO fusion protein was eluted with lysis buffer containing 400 mM imidazole. The fusion protein was cleaved overnight with 0.2 mg of Ulp1 protease. The cleaved fusion protein sample was applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with lysis buffer containing 1 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP). The eluted fractions containing WT hRBM28 RRM3 protein were pooled and applied to a Ni-NTA agarose column again to remove released SUMO protein. The protein sample was dialyzed against a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM TCEP and purified further using a HiTrap Q HR anion-exchange column (GE Healthcare). Bound proteins were eluted using a linear gradient from 0.05 to 1 M NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 0.5 mM TCEP. Peak fractions containing WT hRBM28 RRM3 were pooled and concentrated.</p><p>L351P mutant human RBM28 RRM3 domain was purified by the same procedure as WT protein up to the first Ni-NTA agarose column. The eluted SUMO fusion protein was cleaved overnight with Ulp1 protease in conjunction with dialysis into 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM TCEP. The cleaved fusion protein sample was applied to a HiTrap Q HR anion-exchange column and eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1 to 1 M NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 0.5 mM TCEP. The eluted fractions containing L351P hRBM28 RRM3 protein were pooled and reapplied to a Ni-NTA agarose column. The protein was concentrated and purified further using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column equilibrated with lysis buffer containing 0.5 mM TCEP. Two peaks of L351P hRBM28 RRM3 eluted from the Superdex 75 column. Because the peak eluting at 58.5 ml contained many contaminating proteins, only the fractions containing the peak eluting at 72.2 ml were pooled and concentrated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy</title><p>The CD spectra of WT and L351P mutant human RBM28 RRM3 domains were measured on a JASCO J-810 CD spectrometer at room temperature.

The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;The molecular basis for ANE syndrome revealed by the large ribosomal subunit processome interactome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three reviewers in addition to a Reviewing Editor, and James Manley was the Senior Editor. The decision was reached after consultation between the four reviewers. Based on these discussions, and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work cannot be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While all reviewers thought that the subject matter was significant, there was some disagreement regarding the overall quality of the work. In particular, two of the referees felt that the experiments did not go far enough in dissecting the molecular defect caused by the mutation. They also raised a number of technical points, most importantly the question of the effect of temperature. Even the more positive reviewer raised similar technical points. The reviewers concluded that there was insufficient enthusiasm for the work to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Because <italic>eLife</italic> does not encourage major revision we are declining the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this interesting paper the authors study the biochemical consequences of a missense mutation in the nucleolar protein RBM28 known to be causative for ANE syndrome. Most of the experiments are conducted on the yeast ortholog of RBM28, Nop4. They show that mutant Nop4 causes a growth defect in yeast traced down to impaired rRNA processing. They further show that the mutant protein fails to interact with a number of its binding partners. The mutation is in RRM3 of the protein. This domain previously thought to bind RNA is a protein-protein interaction site. Finally, they show that the Leu-&gt;Pro mutation disrupts the structural integrity of RRM3 The work is clearly presented and provides new insight into ANE syndrome. The quality and impact of the work make it suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by McCann et al. entitled &quot;The Molecular Basis for ANE Syndrome Revealed by the Large Ribosomal Subunit Processome Interactions&quot; describes an experimental approach that uses modeling in budding yeast to probe the molecular defects that underlie ANE syndrome. In humans, this disease is caused by a L-&gt;P amino acid substitution in the RBM28 protein. The budding yeast orthologue of RBM28, Nop4, has a conserved leucine that is located in the analogous domain as the change detected in patients.</p><p>As RBM28 can replace the function of the essential Nop4 protein, the authors modeled the disease-causing amino acid substitution in the budding yeast Nop4 protein. The authors use a nice complement of functional studies coupled with dissection of the key interacting domain and finally structural studies. The study is fairly straightforward but does provide insight into what mechanisms might underline disease and also provides insight into key interactions required for proper large subunit assembly.</p><p>The authors make the surprising finding that RRM3 and 4 of Nop4 are sufficient to confer function and they seem to do so by mediating protein-protein interactions. One experimental issue is that Nop4 functions within the nucleolus and thus needs to be targeted there to function. A quick perusal of the literature shows no published information on how Nop4 enters the nucleus – which it must do to access the nucleolus. There are a number of predicted classical nuclear localization motifs and most are in the C-terminal domain of the protein. While this is not an issue for the two-hybrid system which presumably contains a nuclear targeting module, this could be an issue for the functional studies. The authors should really include localization as an aspect of their studies to validate their conclusions that the Rrm3-4 mediates the essential function of Nop4 and that Rrm1-2 is not sufficient to do so (see detailed comments below).</p><p>With the broad interactions examined, the use of the two-hybrid is quite reasonable; however, for at least some of the interactions, the authors should validate the loss of interaction with a biochemical approach. They could easily choose binding partners for which antibodies are available or employ commercially available TAP-tagged proteins.</p><p>One minor issue that should be clarified is the reference to the Leucine to Proline amino acid substation as a point mutation. While this change in the codons could easily occur due to a single point mutation in the DNA that changes a leucine codon to a proline codon (presumably this is what happens in the patients?) – it is the amino acid change that is the consequence of the point mutation that causes the functional change. The authors should merely keep this in mind in finalizing the text.</p><p>Overall there are some relatively minor points that could enhance the impact of the studies but the experiments are nicely set up and the data presented support the conclusions drawn.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> presents the phenotype observed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> presents a schematic that compares RBM28 with Nop4. Although the detailed amino acid sequences of these proteins are included as a supplemental figure, providing the sequence of amino acids immediately surrounding the conserved leucine would make the information presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> far more convincing that the leucine is located within a conserved domain – without forcing the reader to refer to the supplemental figure.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> employs two-hybrid screening to identify interactions that are lot or maintained with the L306P amino acid change. The approach is reasonable for the broad screening. However, the authors should validate at least a few of these differential interactions through a biochemical approach (co-immunoprecipitation being the logical approach). Such biochemistry would complement the rationale use of the two-hybrid analyses.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> assesses the domains of Nop4 required for function. The immunoblot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> is very difficult to interpret. The RRM1-2 domain appears very degraded. The authors need to provide a different blot showing that at least some protein of the predicted size is generated. Arrows marking the correct bands (corresponding to the predicted size) would help. Addition of molecular weight markers would also help in this and other immunoblots shown. The immunoblot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> does not really compare to the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> (albeit they are different constructs- one FLAG-tagged and one for two-hybrid).</p><p>The authors really do not comment on the temperature sensitive rescue of rRNA processing and growth by the Rrm3-4 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> does not mention the different temperatures. The authors need to provide some insight into why this rescue is temperature-dependent. Do they suspect that the domain may be less stable at higher temperatures? Some immunoblotting carried out from cells grown at the different temperatures might help to address this temperature-sensitive effect.</p><p>The other experimental issue that should be addressed for this analysis is the localization of the protein domains. These fragments appear to be FLAG-tagged so it should be straightforward to examine the localization of the protein domains and append an NLS if needed. Could the two-hybrid clones be used to test for function?</p><p>It would be nice to have a bit more information about how RBM28 rescues the yeast phenotype and whether the amino acid substitution in the human protein recapitulates the defects seen with the altered yeast protein.</p><p>The authors are now in a position to determine which interactions are critical for the function of Nop4. This point could be mentioned in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors have taken the observation, by others, that a recessive mutation in RBM28, a human homologue of Nop4 of yeast, causes ribosomopathy, and expanded on it with reference to their recent very nice work on the Processosome (McCann et al. G&amp;D). They show that when this mutation is transferred to the yeast gene, the formation of 25S rRNA is partially disrupted, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and that the interaction of Nop4 with a number of other proteins is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These are interesting findings, but perhaps not surprising since the mutation causes substantial reduction of 60S ribosome synthesis in human cells. The rest of the paper is concerned with Nop4 and its fragments in yeast, where they conclude that only the C=terminal half of Nop4 is sufficient for growth, but only at 23 degrees. Quite similar experiments were reported by Sun &amp; Woolford in 1997 (L611) that suggested all 4 RRMs were essential. But the difference is simply a matter of temperatures used for growth. Finally, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) some protein structural measurements suggest that the L&gt;P mutation disrupts the structure of RRM3 suggesting that leads to loss of interactions with other members of the processosome.</p><p>I have a number of problems with the data, but overall I feel the authors have sold themselves short by not investigating just how the mutation affects 60S ribosome synthesis, which the yeast system is perfect for. Instead they have confined themselves to nibbling around the edges of a problem that they are in the perfect position to solve. While I am not in a position to critique <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, again it seems to me that more could be done, e.g. the effects of mutation &amp; temperature on structure and on interaction with other proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the data presented are for the most part sound, but the conclusions contribute only marginally to deep analysis of the problem.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript McCann et al. investigate the molecular basis of ANE syndrome pathogenesis. ANE syndrome is caused by a mutation in the nucleolar protein RBM28 (L351P) which affects the LSU processome resulting in ribosome biogenesis defects. McCann et. al use yeast as a model to study the effect of ANE mutation on the structure and function (as a hub protein) using the homologous protein, Nop4p. The authors first validate the model system, demonstrate that the ANE mutation affects Nop4 &quot;hub&quot; function, investigate the molecular biology of the RRM3 and RRM4 domains of Nop4 and conclude with biophysical analyses demonstrating that the L351P mutation disrupts folding of the RRM3 domain. This is a very straightforward study employing basic yeast molecular genetics and complemented with some nice biophysical studies. The conclusions are warranted by the data.

One experimental issue is that Nop4 functions within the nucleolus and thus needs to be targeted there to function. A quick perusal of the literature shows no published information on how Nop4 enters the nucleus – which it must do to access the nucleolus. There are a number of predicted classical nuclear localization motifs and most are in the C-terminal domain of the protein. While this is not an issue for the two-hybrid system which presumably contains a nuclear targeting module, this could be an issue for the functional studies. The authors should really include localization as an aspect of their studies to validate their conclusions that the Rrm3-4 mediates the essential function of Nop4 and that Rrm1-2 is not sufficient to do so (see detailed comments below).</italic> </p><p>Reviewer #2 makes an excellent point that the failure to rescue by RRM1-2 may simply be due to a mislocalization of this fragment. To address this concern, we repeated the growth complementation assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref> using the yeast two-hybrid vector, pACT2, which will ensure nuclear localization. We found that even when targeted to the nucleus, RRM1-2 fails to rescue the growth defect conferred by depletion of endogenous Nop4 in both solid and liquid medium. Additionally, using immunofluorescence, we confirmed the nuclear localization of the Nop4 fragments expressed from the yeast two-hybrid vector, pACT2. These results have been included in the Results section and have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>With the broad interactions examined, the use of the two-hybrid is quite reasonable; however, for at least some of the interactions, the authors should validate the loss of interaction with a biochemical approach. They could easily choose binding partners for which antibodies are available or employ commercially available TAP-tagged proteins.</p><p>We have now done this and included the results in new panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. To validate the loss of interaction in the presence of the ANE syndrome mutation, we employed the co-immunoprecipitation approach described in (McCann et al. 2015, Genes &amp; Dev). This assay utilizes yeast expression vectors that express 3xHA or 3xFLAG tagged proteins of interest. We prefer not to use commercially available strains or antibodies as we find that making them ourselves provides greater experimental reliability. We assayed for the loss of interaction between Nop4 and Noc2, Mak5, Nop4, Nsa2 and Dbp10 when the ANE syndrome mutation (L306P) is present. We found that the co-immunoprecipitation results mirrored the yeast two-hybrid results. In the presence of the ANE syndrome mutation (L306P), the amount of co-purifying Nop4 was significantly reduced when immunoprecipitating with Noc2, Mak5, Nop4 and Nsa2 but was not significantly affected when immunoprecipitating with Dbp10. These results are discussed in the Results section and have been added to new panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>One minor issue that should be clarified is the reference to the Leucine to Proline amino acid substation as a point mutation. While this change in the codons could easily occur due to a single point mutation in the DNA that changes a leucine codon to a proline codon (presumably this is what happens in the patients?) – it is the amino acid change that is the consequence of the point mutation that causes the functional change. The authors should merely keep this in mind in finalizing the text.</italic></p><p>Thank you for this important comment. We have edited the text such that we refer to the Leucine to Proline mutation as an amino acid substitution rather than as a point mutation.</p><p> <italic>Overall there are some relatively minor points that could enhance the impact of the studies but the experiments are nicely set up and the data presented support the conclusions drawn. Specific Comments: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> presents the phenotype observed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> presents a schematic that compares RBM28 with Nop4. Although the detailed amino acid sequences of these proteins are included as a supplemental figure, providing the sequence of amino acids immediately surrounding the conserved leucine would make the information presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> far more convincing that the leucine is located within a conserved domain – without forcing the reader to refer to the supplemental figure.</italic> We have now done this. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> has been changed to include the amino acid alignment of the ~30 amino acids of RRM3 surrounding the conserved leucine that is mutated in ANE syndrome. The alignment has also been expanded to include four other species.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> employs two-hybrid screening to identify interactions that are lot or maintained with the L306P amino acid change. The approach is reasonable for the broad screening. However, the authors should validate at least a few of these differential interactions through a biochemical approach (co-immunoprecipitation being the logical approach). Such biochemistry would complement the rationale use of the two-hybrid analyses.</p><p>We have now done this as stated above. We validated the loss of interaction in the presence of the ANE syndrome mutation, through the co-immunoprecipitation approach described in (McCann et al. 2015, Genes &amp; Dev). We assayed for the loss of interaction between Nop4 and Noc2, Mak5, Nop4, Nsa2 and Dbp10 when the ANE syndrome mutation (L306P) is present. We found that significantly less Nop4 L306P was co-purified with Noc2, Mak5, Nop4 and Nsa2. These data are included in the Results and has been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> assesses the domains of Nop4 required for function. The immunoblot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> is very difficult to interpret. The RRM1-2 domain appears very degraded. The authors need to provide a different blot showing that at least some protein of the predicted size is generated. Arrows marking the correct bands (corresponding to the predicted size) would help. Addition of molecular weight markers would also help in this and other immunoblots shown. The immunoblot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> does not really compare to the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> (albeit they are different constructs- one FLAG-tagged and one for two-hybrid).</italic> We have replaced the blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and added molecular weight markers. The predicted sizes of the different domains have been added to the figure legend. Additionally, we have added either molecular weight markers or arrows marking the correct bands to all the western blots in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>The authors really do not comment on the temperature sensitive rescue of rRNA processing and growth by the Rrm3-4 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> does not mention the different temperatures. The authors need to provide some insight into why this rescue is temperature-dependent. Do they suspect that the domain may be less stable at higher temperatures? Some immunoblotting carried out from cells grown at the different temperatures might help to address this temperature-sensitive effect.</italic></p><p>We have added the temperature and length of depletion to the figure legend. At present we cannot speculate why rescue would work better at 30°C and 23°C than at 37°C though a likely explanation, as the reviewer points out, is that at higher temperatures the domain folds less well.</p><p><italic>The other experimental issue that should be addressed for this analysis is the localization of the protein domains. These fragments appear to be FLAG-tagged so it should be straightforward to examine the localization of the protein domains and append an NLS if needed. Could the two-hybrid clones be used to test for function?</italic> As we stated above, we have addressed this concern by repeating the growth complementation assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref> using the yeast two-hybrid vector, pACT2, which will ensure nuclear localization. We found that even when targeted to the nucleus, RRM1-2 fails to rescue the growth defect conferred by depletion of endogenous Nop4. Furthermore, we confirmed the nuclear localization of the Nop4 fragments expressed from the yeast two-hybrid vector, pACT2, using immunofluorescence.

Science 2015), we have repeated the complementation experiment using a strain where we can conditionally deplete Nop4 by changing the carbon source in the growth medium from galactose to glucose (dextrose) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We have discussed these new results in the Results section and included them in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.

Determining the effects of the human mutation in a more relevant experimental system, such as human cell culture or <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>, both of which we have used previously to study ribosomopathies (Griffin et al. PLoS Geneti. 2015, Freed et al. PLoS Geneti. 2015), is an important future goal for my laboratory.</p><p><italic>The authors are now in a position to determine which interactions are critical for the function of Nop4. This point could be mentioned in the Discussion.</italic> We have added this to the Discussion.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p> <italic>The authors have taken the observation, by others, that a recessive mutation in RBM28, a human homologue of Nop4 of yeast, causes ribosomopathy, and expanded on it with reference to their recent very nice work on the Processosome (McCann et al. G&amp;D). They show that when this mutation is transferred to the yeast gene, the formation of 25S rRNA is partially disrupted, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and that the interaction of Nop4 with a number of other proteins is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These are interesting findings, but perhaps not surprising since the mutation causes substantial reduction of 60S ribosome synthesis in human cells. The rest of the paper is concerned with Nop4 and its fragments in yeast, where they conclude that only the C=terminal half of Nop4 is sufficient for growth, but only at 23 degrees. Quite similar experiments were reported by Sun &amp; Woolford in 1997 (L611) that suggested all 4 RRMs were essential. But the difference is simply a matter of temperatures used for growth. Finally, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) some protein structural measurements suggest that the L&gt;P mutation disrupts the structure of RRM3 suggesting that leads to loss of interactions with other members of the processosome.</italic> With all due respect, the reviewer is mistaken that we know that “the mutation causes substantial reduction of 60S ribosome synthesis in human cells.” Indeed, this is not known, either for human or yeast cells. Our work here is the first time the consequences of the mutation have been investigated experimentally in either organism. In Nousbeck et al. (2008) where the ANE syndrome was first described, the authors counted mature free cytoplasmic ribosomes in micrographs of cultured fibroblasts by transmission EM, and found that numbers were reduced in patients with ANE syndrome. That is the extent of the experiment: no analysis of 40S or 60S synthesis was done. So we do not yet know how the ANE syndrome mutation affects ribosome biogenesis in any organism. That is one reason why our work presented here is so important and highly significant.</p><p>In addition, it is not true that “quite similar experiments were reported by Sun &amp; Woolford in 1997.” While it is true that they made a missense mutation in RRM3, this mutation was at a different amino acid than the ANE syndrome mutation. They did not examine the effects of the ANE syndrome mutation, as it had not been discovered yet.</p><p><italic>I have a number of problems with the data, but overall I feel the authors have sold themselves short by not investigating just how the mutation affects 60S ribosome synthesis, which the yeast system is perfect for. Instead they have confined themselves to nibbling around the edges of a problem that they are in the perfect position to solve. While I am not in a position to critique <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, again it seems to me that more could be done, e.g. the effects of mutation &amp; temperature on structure and on interaction with other proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In summary, the data presented are for the most part sound, but the conclusions contribute only marginally to deep analysis of the problem.</italic> We are concerned that the reviewer has read our manuscript with the mistaken impression that much of the work has previously been done, and therefore that our work does not provide much new insight. We vigorously disagree.</p><p>First, as discussed above, the ANE syndrome mutation has not been studied at the biochemical level before in any organism. The results from patient material presented in Nousbeck et al. indicate reduced levels of free cytoplasmic ribosomes by counting them in electron micrographs. This is a non-biochemical and somewhat crude level of analysis that was probably a result of the limitations of obtaining patient material. This study here is the first to define the consequences of the ANE syndrome mutation in any organism, and therefore is valuable for furthering our understanding of this ribosomopathy, and of ribosome biogenesis in general.</p><p>Second, introducing the orthologous amino acid change that causes ANE syndrome into yeast Nop4, we were able to pinpoint its effects on growth and pre-rRNA processing, and to define precisely how defective the mutated Nop4 is for the first time. Similarly, these experiments have not been done or published before in any organism. It is critical for understanding the molecular basis of ANE syndrome to determine the extent to which the mutated protein causes defective pre- rRNA processing, as we have done.</p><p>Third, based on our recent published work finding that Nop4 is a hub protein in the LSU processosome interactome (McCann et al. Genes Dev 2015), we have gone one to show unexpected and surprising aspects of the function of the RRMs in Nop4. While RRMs are named for being RNA binding domains, we find here that instead they play a critical role in protein interaction. Introduction of the ANE syndrome mutation into RRM3 reduces interaction with a subset of proteins, as we have now shown by two methods. Furthermore, RRMs 3-4 are sufficient for protein interaction and growth, a truly novel finding.</p><p>We do not understand how this extensive work that required 7 figures with an average of about 4 parts, all of which are new experiments that have never been done before and that provide a molecular basis for the ANE syndrome for the first time, can be considered “nibbling around the edges of a problem.” The reviewer writes that “the authors have sold themselves short by not investigating just how the mutation affects 60S ribosome synthesis.” But this is exactly what we have done.</p><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p> <italic>In this manuscript McCann</italic> et al.</p><p> <italic>investigate the molecular basis of ANE syndrome pathogenesis. ANE syndrome is caused by a mutation in the nucleolar protein RBM28 (L351P) which affects the LSU processome resulting in ribosome biogenesis defects. McCann et. al use yeast as a model to study the effect of ANE mutation on the structure and function (as a hub protein) using the homologous protein, Nop4p. The authors first validate the model system, demonstrate that the ANE mutation affects Nop4 &quot;hub&quot; function, investigate the molecular biology of the RRM3 and RRM4 domains of Nop4 and conclude with biophysical analyses demonstrating that the L351P mutation disrupts folding of the RRM3 domain. This is a very straightforward study employing basic yeast molecular genetics and complemented with some nice biophysical studies. The conclusions are warranted by the data. However, the work could benefit from some minor improvement, and some of the data analyses are questionable. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</italic></p><p>The abbreviation EV is not explained/mentioned in the figure legend and text.</p><p>We are sorry that this was not clear enough.

However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> only shows the processing schema.</italic> Yes, the reviewer is absolutely correct that we reference the processing schema in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. We were trying to help the reader understand the complexity of pre-rRNA processing and the nature of the Nop4 depletion phenotype by pointing them to a diagram. As the Nop4 depletion processing phenotype has already been published, we included the references to the relevant papers (Sun and Woolford EMBO 1994, Berges et al. EMBO 1994). However, to be more clear, we have also included a reference to the northern blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, which show the same defect.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> top panel (gel) uses Ethidium bromide to quantify the 25S and 18S rRNA. The method is not terribly sensitive for quantitation. To be honest, I cannot discern the differences between the wild-type and mutant in either the top or bottom panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> that are graphed in panel C. Additionally, in the 48 hr EV lane, there is so little rRNA (because the cells are dead) that it borders on disingenuous to claim any quantitation in Panel C.

Author response <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">table 1</xref> contains the quantitative analysis of the 25S and 18S rRNAs by ethidium bromide staining.

In this longer exposure, the 25S rRNA is much more visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1A</xref>). However, we chose not to use this particular image in the figure because the other lanes are significantly overexposed. Additionally, we have included an image of one methylene blue stained membrane that was subsequently used for northern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1B</xref> left panel). Methylene blue also detects the mature 25S and 18S rRNAs.

This is why it is so important to include a quantitative analysis. We agree with the reviewer that the differences are subtle, which is consistent with the ANE syndrome mutation being a hypomorphic allele. However, as we have demonstrated, there is a method independent, reproducible, statistically significant difference between 25S/18S ratios for the wild-type and the ANE syndrome Nop4 mutant

The Scr1 loading control blots and the additional quantitative analyses are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>. We have also edited the Results to include this new data. The quantitation of the levels of the individual pre-rRNA species compared to the loading control further supports our claim that the ANE syndrome mutation disrupts processing of the large subunit ribosomal RNAs, as there is a subtle but statistically significant decrease of the 7S pre-rRNA in the presence of the ANE syndrome mutation.</p><p><italic>The claim that Nop4 L306P results in 'severe reduction in 27S and 7S levels…' (subsection “The ANE syndrome mutation causes pre-rRNA processing defects in yeast”, last paragraph) is not supported by the quantification in 2C. The fold change as compared to WT is moderate.</italic></p><p>We are sorry to disagree with this reviewer but this is factually incorrect. In the text, we wrote: “Depletion of Nop4 resulted in a severe reduction of 27S and 7S levels, with a concomitant decrease in the 27S/35S and 7S/35S ratios, indicative of an ITS1 processing defect, as has been previously observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>; Bergès et al. 1994, Sun and Woolford 1994). The Nop4 L306P mutant showed an intermediate growth defect and also displayed an intermediate, but statistically significant ITS1 processing defect as indicated by reduced 27S/35S and 7S/35S ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>).” We did not claim that the mutation resulted in a severe reduction. To attempt to make this more clear, we have rewritten this section.</p><p><italic>The claim that the EV control had most severe reduction in 25S/18S ratio and also 27S and 7S levels (subsection “The ANE syndrome mutation causes pre-rRNA processing defects in yeast”) again borders on disingenuous, because this mutant is dead, or at the very least, in the process of dying.</italic></p><p>An empty vector (EV) is frequently used in my laboratory and in others as a null control in experiments to ascertain the affect of depletion or mutation on yeast growth and/or ribosome biogenesis (Ferreira-Cerca et al.

PNAS 2006, Kos and Tollervey Mol Cell 2005). Nop4 is essential and yeast depleted of Nop4 (EV null control) will eventually die. However, as the growth curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref> demonstrate, we harvested RNA while the EV control strain was still doubling.</p><p><italic>The statistical comparisons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> are different than those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>.

Thus, the statistical analyses were done comparing the fragments to the empty vector.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</italic></p><p><italic>It is unclear why such a small panel of bait reporters were assayed here, especially in light of the fact that the lab possesses 23 bait reporters already (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

While the western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> has been replaced with a cleaner image (with quantitation), both the original blot and the new blot in 5A show the same trends as seen in the western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>: Nop4 RRM 1-2 is expressed at much higher levels than Nop4 WT while Nop4 RRM 3-4 is expressed at lower levels than Nop4 WT. It is not clear why there are such dramatic differences in expression. However, since the trends remain the same across different expression vectors (pACT in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and p414GPD 3xFLAG in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), this result is likely due to differences in the function, localization and/or stability of the fragments.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. Since the mutation associated with ANE is in RRM3, one would like to see a construct expressing RRM1, 2 and 4 only. This would be a great negative control.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is critical to determine how the individual RRMs in Nop4 contribute to Nop4 function. It has been shown previously that all 4 RRMs are essential for Nop4 function in vivo. More specifically, mutations to highly conserved amino acids within the individual RRMs of Nop4 were all temperature sensitive and all perturbed assembly of the large ribosomal subunit (Sun and Woolford JBC 1997). However, the precise function of each RRM of Nop4 has yet to be determined. This is an important future goal for my laboratory.</p><p>For this manuscript, we did generate a construct expressing only RRM3 and attempted to determine if RRM3 alone was sufficient to mediate protein-protein interactions by yeast two-hybrid. However, RRM3 alone is not expressed and therefore its function could not be assayed in any experiments. This has been added to the Results.</p><p><italic>The protocol notes that the growth time for the Y2H assay in 4C was 2 weeks. Those familiar with Y2H assays might be concerned about the high false positive rate when these assays are performed in the cold for such a long time.</italic></p><p>We are confused about why the reviewer thought we did the experiment at 4°C, where yeast will not grow, as this was not written in the text. We are also confused about the literature that the reviewer draws on about the high false positive rates for Y2H experiments performed in the cold. We are not aware of such a literature and we have been doing Y2H experiments since 1999 (Lee &amp; Baserga 1999 MCB).</p><p>As with other, published Y2H experiments from us and others (McCann 2015 Genes &amp; Development, Rolland 2014 Cell, Hegele 2012 Mol. Cell, Charette and Baserga 2010 RNA, Freed and Baserga 2010 NAR, Wong 2007 MBC, Ito 2001 PNAS, Drees 2001 JCB, Uetz 2000 Nature), the Y2H experiments in this manuscript were always performed at 30°C. This was included in the methods for the ANE syndrome Y2H experiment but had not been included for the fragment Y2H experiment. The published screen (McCann 2015 Genes &amp; Development) was actually incubated for 3 weeks at 30°C. We have now indicated the 30°C temperature in the methods for this experiment.</p><p><italic>Co-immunoprecipitation assays would serve as orthogonal test of the protein -protein interactions.</italic></p><p>The use of the yeast two-hybrid assay to identify protein-protein interactions has been validated extensively by our lab and others (McCann 2015 Genes &amp; Development, Hegele 2012 Mol. Cell, Wang 2011 Mol Syst Biol., Suter 2007 Genome Res.). The vast majority of high-confidence interactions identified by yeast two-hybrid are recapitulated by co-immunoprecipitation. All of the Nop4 interactions examined here have been previously validated by co-immunoprecipitation (McCann 2015 Genes &amp; Development). Thus, we feel confident in our use of the yeast two-hybrid assay to identify biologically relevant protein-protein interactions. The yeast two-hybrid assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> was performed twice and the same interactions were observed. Most importantly, there is a striking difference between the number of interactions mediated by Nop4 RRM 1-2 and Nop4 RRM 3-4 despite the fact that Nop4 RRM 1-2 is expressed at higher levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</italic></p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3 have a lot of background. Additionally, the figure lacks quantification.</italic></p><p>We have replaced the western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. We have also included a lighter exposure of the Nop4 RRM 1-2 since it is significantly overexpressed in comparison to Nop4 WT and Nop4 RRM 3-4. We have included the quantitation in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>Again the growth assays in 5C and 5D a) contain random time points (time points not equally spaced);</italic></p><p>We are sorry that the reviewer is unhappy with the spacing of the time points for these growth assays. However, both growth assays have been carried out three times, with each replicate having the same number of time points, and the end result is always the same. Having more or better-spaced time points does not change that.</p><p><italic>b) Missing quantification of doubling time;</italic></p><p>As we stated above, accurate doubling times cannot be calculated from this type of experiment because the growth rate changes over time. However, we have estimated the doubling times and included them in the figure and the Results.</p><p><italic>c) The EV control is dead in the dilution spot assays, however it grows in liquid media.</italic></p><p>Again, the reviewer is correct that the empty vector (EV) expressing strain does not grow in the dilution spot assays but does grow in liquid media. This is not a concern for the reasons listed above.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> the scale on Y-axis is misleading. It seems that the log scale on Y-axis starts at 'zero' because the origin is not labeled. The next tick upward on the Y-axis is also not labeled.</italic></p><p>We have added the appropriate labels for the Y-axis.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</italic></p><p><italic>Again, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> top panel (gel) uses Ethidium bromide to quantify the 25S and 18S rRNA. However, here, we can actually see a difference at 30°C.</italic></p><p>We are glad that the reviewer can visually detect a difference in 25S rRNA levels by ethidium bromide staining. As the quantitation of the ratio of 25S/18S in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> demonstrates, the Nop4 RRM 1-2 and Nop4 RRM 3-4 fragments have a much greater reduction in the 25S/18S ratio than the ANE syndrome mutation (L306P), which is why it is easier to observe by eye.</p><p><italic>In 6B the significance of the ratios 25S/18S, 35S/Scr1, 27S/Scr1 and 7S/Scr1 is calculated as compared to the EV control. However, EV control strain is dead. As noted above, the proper comparison should be to WT.</italic></p><p>We are sorry, but we disagree with the reviewer. This experiment is to test whether a fragment of Nop4 can complement the pre-rRNA processing defect due to Nop4 depletion. In this case, the null hypothesis is that the fragments will not complement, meaning they will behave like the empty vector (EV) control. Thus, the statistical analyses were done comparing the fragments to the empty vector. This is distinctly different than <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> where the null hypothesis is that the mutation does not disrupt Nop4 function and is thereby expected to behave like Nop4 WT. That is why the statistical analyses were done comparing the mutant to the wild type in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>There is no way to compare the quantitative graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> because <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> lacks a loading control. This results in an apples to oranges comparison that only serves to confuse the reader. For example, the claim that RRM 3-4 significantly restored the pre-rRNA processing defects at 23°C is supported by the data in 6B as there is a discernable difference in the ratios. However, the similar analyses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> indicate that the differences are lesser, but the claim is that the effects are greater. I am totally confused.</italic></p><p>We have included a loading control, Scr1, to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and have added the quantitative analysis of the ratios of the pre-rRNA precursors 35S, 27S and 7S to Scr1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. This now allows for a comparison of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. However, it is important to remember that while the assays are the same, the questions we are asking in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are different.</p><p>Additionally, as we stated above, we claimed that the ANE syndrome mutation causes a statistically significant, moderate processing defect. At no point in the manuscript did we compare the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and claim that the differences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> are greater.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</italic></p><p><italic>This is the biophysical characterization of the mutant, but it is done with the RRM3 fragment of the human protein. While I do not have a problem with the switch from yeast-based studies to the human protein, an explanation for why would be informative. (Indeed, one might ask, if the human protein can complement deletion of Nop4 in yeast, why weren't these studies performed using the human protein to begin with?).</italic></p><p>We have included a sentence to explain that we switched to the human protein for the structural studies because the yeast protein was not soluble at the high concentrations needed for the biophysical studies.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> (NMR data) requires more explanation to illuminate the differences between the WT and the mutant protein structure. As written, the information content is minimal.</italic></p><p>We are uncertain what additional explanation is requested for the NMR data. As stated in the manuscript, we can conclude that the WT RBM28 RRM3 is a folded, globular protein based on the well-dispersed resonances in the <sub>15</sub>N-HSQC spectrum, and we can conclude that the L351P substitution disrupts the domain structure based on the clustering of resonances from 8.0 to 8.5 ppm in the <sub>1</sub>H dimension of the <sub>15</sub>N-HSQC spectrum. Additional analysis is included in the figure legend indicating that decreased dispersion of glutamine and asparagine side chain resonances are also consistent with disrupted domain structure.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> needs labels: a) WT and mutant protein and b) location of the mutation L351P.</italic></p><p>We have added labels to clarify that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> is a ribbon diagram of a homology model of the WT human RBM28 RRM3 with the amino acid that is mutated in ANE syndrome (L351) shown with red space-filling spheres. The two images are different views of the same model and do not represent the WT vs. the mutant protein, since the mutant protein is unstructured. We added a rotational arrow to make this clear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic></p><p><italic>As noted in the long form review, quantitative analyses are lacking in some places, and the statistical analyses performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> need to be aligned.</italic></p><p>We have included quantitative analyses of all western blots.
