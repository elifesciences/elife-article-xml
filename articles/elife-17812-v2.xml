A mechanistic understanding of assemblies requires accurate measurement of their stoichiometry, affinity and cooperativity, and frequently consideration of multiple co-existing complexes. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation equipped with fluorescence detection (FDS-SV) allows the characterization of protein complexes free in solution with high size resolution, at concentrations in the nanomolar and picomolar range. Here, we extend the capabilities of FDS-SV with a single excitation wavelength from single-component to multi-component detection using photoswitchable fluorescent proteins (psFPs). We exploit their characteristic quantum yield of photo-switching to imprint spatio-temporal modulations onto the sedimentation signal that reveal different psFP-tagged protein components in the mixture. This novel approach facilitates studies of heterogeneous multi-protein complexes at orders of magnitude lower concentrations and for higher-affinity systems than previously possible. Using this technique we studied high-affinity interactions between the amino-terminal domains of GluA2 and GluA3 AMPA receptors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17812.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17812.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17812.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many proteins in cells combine to form molecular machines or complexes that carry out specific processes inside cells. Analytical ultracentrifugation is a technique commonly used to explore the physical properties of proteins and their complexes and in this way to gain insights into the biological roles of these molecules. The technique involves spinning a sample containing the molecules to generate a strong centrifugal force, while monitoring the movement of the molecules. Under these conditions, molecules with different sizes and masses sink – or “sediment” – at different rates, so individual proteins and their complexes can be clearly distinguished.</p><p>Analytical ultracentrifugation was recently extended to make it possible to detect fluorescent tags added on to proteins. This advance allowed researchers to study more dilute samples or complexes that are held together especially tightly. However, only tags of a single color can be detected because of physical constraints of the fluorescent detection system. This meant that only one kind of fluorescent signal could be tracked at any one time. However, a group of fluorescent tags called photoswitchable fluorescent proteins (psFPs) offer new opportunities for detecting multiple signals. This is because these psFPs switch between fluorescent and non-fluorescent states while being detected in the ultracentrifuge.</p><p>Zhao et al. have now exploited this unique photoswitching property by accurately measuring how fast a number of psFPs switched between fluorescent and non-fluorescent states while they were sedimenting. Each different psFPs switched in a distinct way, even for psFPs of the same color, meaning that each psFP could be identified from its switching rate, similar to identifying a person from their fingerprints. This discovery allowed Zhao et al. to distinguish different psFPs in a mixed sample as if they had different colors.</p><p>Further experiments went on to demonstrate that this approach could identify the binding proteins in a protein mixture made of three components, and be used to study a biologically important protein complex that can itself exist in two distinct forms. The approach will therefore provide a valuable tool to observe different components in a complex individually and will provide researchers the opportunity to study how mixed protein complexes form at very low concentrations. Future developments of the approach may make it possible to study other properties of protein complexes such as their overall shape and their behavior under conditions that mimic those inside the cell.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17812.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17812.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>protein interactions</kwd><kwd>photoswitchable fluorescent proteins</kwd><kwd>analytical ultracentrifugation</kwd><kwd>hydrodynamics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000070</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIA EB000051-09 LCIM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuck</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fluorescence detected sedimentation velocity offers a new method for studying heterogeneous protein interactions in solution by exploiting characteristic temporal signal modulations of photoswitchable fluorescent proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The dynamic formation of multi-protein complexes is a key step in the assembly of supramolecular structures and in the regulation of many cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gavin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krogan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu and Fuxreiter, 2016</xref>). For example, in immunological signal transduction the assembly of adaptor protein complexes into micro-clusters after T-cell activation plays a critical role in the sensitivity and specificity of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sherman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dustin and Groves, 2012</xref>). Another well-known multi-protein complex is the post-synaptic density, a large structure assembled <italic>via</italic> interactions between many different scaffolding proteins, signaling proteins and ligand gated ion channels, that regulates postsynaptic neurotransmission and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kennedy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferré et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar and Mayer, 2012</xref>). Many of the protein interactions involved in the assembly of such molecular machinery are multivalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Houtman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coussens et al., 2013</xref>). This often allows structurally polymorph complexes to co-exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu and Fuxreiter, 2016</xref>), posing formidable challenges for any biophysical method to elucidate basic architectural principles and driving forces, which requires the study of reversible interactions of multiple protein components with multiple states.</p><p>Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV) is a classical technique that allows determination of the number, size, and shape of reversibly formed protein complexes, and provides information on their affinity, stoichiometry and binding kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schuck, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2015</xref>). Though a long established technique, it is worth recapitulating the basic principles of SV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In SV the spatio-temporal evolution of macromolecular concentration profiles in a sample solution after application of a strong centrifugal field is optically monitored in real-time. SV has unique opportunities for studying protein interactions, since—different from separation techniques—faster sedimenting protein complexes will always remain in a bath of slower-sedimenting constituent components, such that the association/dissociation of non-covalent complexes is maintained throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Since sedimentation takes place free in solution, the analysis can be based on first principles and mathematical models for the sedimentation/diffusion process, and modern size-distribution analysis results in sedimentation coefficient distributions with high hydrodynamic resolution. Thus, SV has emerged as a powerful technique in the study of the solution state behavior of complex interacting systems of macromolecules, including ion-channels, adaptor proteins, membrane proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar and Mayer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Houtman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">le Maire et al., 2008</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Niewiarowski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Padrick and Brautigam, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harding et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jose et al., 2012</xref>). Extended to multi-signal analysis SV can distinguish different sedimenting components from characteristic extinction properties, directly revealing binding stoichiometries and resolving co-existing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Houtman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coussens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Padrick and Brautigam, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balbo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barda-Saad et al., 2010</xref>). For example, through applications of this approach an essential mechanism for the formation of signaling particles in T-cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Houtman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coussens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barda-Saad et al., 2010</xref>) was discovered to be the multivalent intracellular oligomerization of LAT via three-component adaptor protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Houtman et al., 2006)</xref>. Such biophysical multi-protein solution studies naturally complement super-resolution fluorescence imaging and co-localization studies of live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sherman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Houtman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coussens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barda-Saad et al., 2010</xref>). But, unfortunately, traditional SV is limited in several ways by optical detection systems that generally require the use of micromolar concentrations of purified proteins.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17812.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Concentration profiles in a sedimentation velocity experiment.</title><p>Two different macromolecular components are depicted (blue and red) reversibly forming a complex (magenta). As a result of centrifugal force at 200,000–300,000 g, macromolecules sediment at a rate determined by their mass, density, and Stokes radius (or translational friction coefficient) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Svedberg and Rinde, 1924</xref>). The velocity of sedimentation normalized relative to the centrifugal field strength is expressed in the molecular sedimentation coefficient <italic>s</italic>. With time, transport clears the region of the solution column closest to the center of rotation and a moving front is formed -- the sedimentation boundary – that separates the cleared zone from a zone of constant concentration named the solution plateau region. While the boundary moves with time (dashed vs solid line), the concentration in the plateau region continuously decreases, solely due the radial geometry of sedimentation resulting in an increase in intermolecular distances (for a detailed description, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schuck et al., 2015</xref>). If protein interactions cause complexes to form, these generally sediment faster and therefore migrate through a bath of slower sedimenting free constituent components. This allows association/dissociation reactions to continuously occur in a way that reflects equilibrium and kinetic properties of the interaction, at the same time as the complex boundaries are hydrodynamically resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schuck, 2010</xref>). The temporal evolution of the boundary shapes is governed by macromolecular diffusion and polydispersity, and the latter can be extracted by mathematical modeling of experimental data in form of sedimentation coefficient distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schuck, 2000</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17812.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17812.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-17812-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>Recently, analytical ultracentrifugation was enhanced by the availability of a commercial fluorescence optical detection system (FDS), that uses confocal detection radially scanning the sample in the spinning rotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacGregor et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). After accounting for characteristic data features, the FDS allows highly quantitative analyses of the sedimentation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhao et al., 2013b</xref>), extending the sensitivity of SV by several orders of magnitude into the low picomolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Le Roy et al., 2015</xref>).

Unfortunately, these advantages come with a drawback of having only a single excitation wavelength, either 488 nm or 561 nm, due to the technical constraints of accommodating a moveable confocal optical system inside the evacuated rotor chamber of the ultracentrifuge. Thus, spectral discrimination of multiple components is not available in AUC fluorescence detection, which significantly limits the study of multi-protein complexes.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17812.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Principle of fluorescence detected sedimentation velocity and optical switching of psFPs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic setup: A rotating sample solution is scanned radially in a confocal configuration with 488 nm excitation (13 mW unless mentioned otherwise), inducing slow photoswitching of psFPs.

The psFPs make up a class of fluorescent proteins that can be actively switched between fluorescent and non-fluorescent states using different wavelengths of illumination. While they have been engineered for entirely different purposes in nanoscience and fluorescence imaging, we have previously observed that under the illumination conditions of FDS-SV they are induced to slowly switch by virtue of the excitation light when radially scanning the spinning sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2014b</xref>). Even though the mechanism of photoswitching in psFPs generally may involve multiple states, in the low-power exposure that occurs during sedimentation using the FDS the process is quantitatively modeled very well as a single exponential. This is exploited and further developed in the present work. Different classes of psFPs exhibit different time-courses of photoswitching in FDS-SV, and may be switched on to a fluorescent state or switched off to a dark state. We show that this process is highly quantitative, and how this signal change can be manipulated spatially and temporally during sedimentation. The new spatio-temporal signal dimension is folded into the computational analysis of the sedimentation process, and thus offers an avenue for monochromatic multi-component (MCMC) detection. Using existing commercial FDS instrumentation, the MCMC approach allows us to simultaneously determine separate sedimentation coefficient distributions for each class of fluorophore, which can be used to determine the identity and binding stoichiometry of hydrodynamically resolved complexes of psFP-tagged proteins.</p><p>We first demonstrate experimental proof of principle of exploiting the photo-switching kinetics as a novel aspect of fluorophore analysis. Using psFPs commonly employed in super-resolution microscopy, we show an example for the identification of binding partners in a three-component protein mixture. We then use this approach to study the high-affinity interactions of glutamate receptor GluA2 and GluA3 amino terminal domains, which engage in competitive homo-dimerization and hetero-dimerization processes that are thought to control the combination of receptor subtypes into diverse homomeric and heteromeric ion channel tetramers with different gating properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar and Mayer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rossmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herguedas et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fluorescence signals of psFPs in sedimentation velocity</title><p>Fluorescence SV signals of psFPs are highly unusual when compared to the temporal evolution of concentration profiles in traditional AUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), in that they exhibit sedimentation boundaries modulated by characteristic signal magnification or diminution on the time-scale of sedimentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). This is caused by the 488 nm excitation beam of the FDS scanner which induces photoswitching between fluorescent and dark states. But in contrast to typical power densities of ~ kW/cm<sup>2</sup> for photoswitching on the millisecond time-scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grotjohann et al., 2012</xref>), the transient exposure in FDS-SV during radial scanning and sample rotation leads to a time-averaged incident power density that is ~10<sup>5</sup>-fold weaker. This slows the photoswitching kinetics down to the time-scale of hours, commensurate with the sedimentation process in SV. A prerequisite for exploiting this new temporal dimension for the multi-component decomposition of fluorescence SV data is the ability to precisely describe the signal evolution of the individual psFPs. We have developed a model <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref> that assumes a single-step process with constant quantum efficiency for switching, while accounting for the radially non-uniform exposure during scanning (caused by psFPs transitioning through the beam in a shorter time as they migrate to higher radii at the same angular velocity). Combined with a description of molecular sedimentation and diffusion, the model predicts signal boundaries to be subject to an exponential overall signal modulation with slightly radially sloping solution plateaus, with a small positive slope for those switching off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) and a small negative slope for FPs switching on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) under 488 nm illumination. As shown in the examples of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, fits of this model to within the noise of data acquisition can routinely be achieved for the fluorescence sedimentation data of diverse FPs, including, for example, the rapidly de-activating rsEGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grotjohann et al., 2012</xref>) and the strongly activating Padron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andresen et al., 2008)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). From the fits of the single component samples, we can obtain the relative amplitude and time-constant of photoswitching for different fluorophores, which serves as a highly reproducible, characteristic temporal tag. For example, for rsEGFP with a scanning beam of 13 mW we measure a depletion rate of 5.08 [4.97–5.19; 95% CI]×10<sup>–4</sup>/sec, approaching a final fluorescence of 13.4 [13.0–13.9; 95% CI]% its initial value, associated with a particle sedimentation coefficient of 2.50 [2.45–2.54; 95% CI] S and apparent molar mass of 29.5 [26.5–33.0; 95% CI] kDa. By contrast, as previously established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2014b</xref>), no photophysical processes are detectable under this illumination for other fluorophores such as fluorescein-based DL488 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) and standard EGFP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MCMC decomposition of mixtures</title><p>The strikingly different signal patterns in sedimentation of psFPs can be utilized for the computational decomposition of sedimentation data of mixtures into separate sedimentation coefficient distributions for each differently tagged component.

From visual inspection of the data one can discern a boundary structure with more complex temporal modulation, which, again, cannot be accounted for with any conventional boundary model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Application of the MCMC decomposition produces an excellent fit, with component sedimentation coefficient distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref> solid lines) again being highly consistent with the results from the separately measured Padron and rsEGFP2/mAb mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref> dashed lines). Here, the sedimentation coefficient distribution of rsEGFP2 shows a 7 S peak with no 2.5 S peak, consistent with the formation of an antibody/rsEGFP2 complex. Thus, the binding partner of the antibody can be correctly identified by exploiting the new temporal signature dimension characteristic of the psFPs.

In fact, in modeling the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, the time-constants of rsEGFP2 were initially constrained to the separately measured values, but subsequent refinement led to a significantly better fit: As may already be visually discerned from comparison with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, a portion of the fast-moving boundary of the rsEGFP2/mAb complex in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> remains fluorescent after long time (α = 0.2070 [0.2052–0.2088, 95% CI]), whereas free rsEGFP2 shows nearly complete conversion to the dark state (α = 0.0274 [0.0270–0.0281, 95% CI]). Clearly, when bound by the anti-GFP antibody, the contrast of rsEGFP2 is lower than in the unbound state. Similar observations were made with rsEGFP, which exhibits slightly altered photoswitching kinetics in the presence of the anti-GFP antibody (data not shown). These observations were confirmed by rsEGFP and rsEGFP2 fluorescence measurements in a benchtop fluorimeter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), where we found marked alterations in the off rates and on/off contrast ratios for both rsEGFP and rsEGFP2 in the presence of antibody as compared to their unbound state. At the same time, their emission spectral properties changed little with the addition of the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). These effects point to possible conformational changes induced by antibody binding impacting the equilibrium of photophysical states (see Discussion). In general, however, such effects should be irrelevant in applications of this approach where the psFP will be designed as an inert tag rather than offering a binding site.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17812.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Photoswitching behavior and fluorescence emission spectra of EGFP variants in the absence and presence of GFP antibody in a benchtop spectrofluorometer.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Normalized fluorescence data of 500 nM rsEGFP in the presence (red) and absence (black) of equimolar anti-GFP mAb, monitored at 508 nm during excitation at 490 nm.

While older FDS instruments are equipped with a fixed-power 13 mW solid-state laser, newer models operate with an adjustable 50 mW diode laser that offers additional flexibility for modulating photoswitching kinetics by using different power settings for the scanning beam.

However, rapid photoswitching can be advantageous if we exploit the reversibility of the process to switch it back on. Stopping the 488 nm exposure will cause rsEGFP to spontaneously relax back into the equilibrium fluorescent state on the time-scale of an hour. Thus, passive restoration of the fluorescent signal by simply pausing the data acquisition is possible (data not shown) but presents a viable approach only for slowly sedimenting species. However, rapid and virtually complete restoration of the initial psFPs signal is possible by illumination at 405 nm. In this way, for example, rsEGFP and rsEGFP2 can undergo hundreds of on/off cycles with very little loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grotjohann et al., 2012</xref>). To this end, we took advantage of the window in the rotor chamber that usually forms part of the interference optical system, and modified it to allow illumination of the spinning rotor with a high-power 405 nm LED at ~10 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. To achieve a quantitatively uniform reset of fluorescence, a sector-shaped mask was used to produce constant 405 nm exposure times for molecules rotating through the beam at all radii. SV experiments were carried out with several cycles of rapid signal depletion under 488 nm illumination at 25 mW (producing a depletion rate of 9.7×10<sup>–4</sup>/s for rsEGFP2), alternating with a 2 min pulse of 405 nm illumination (leading to &gt; 98% recovery of the fluorescence signal of rsEGFP2). The sequence of exposure and scanning events is schematically represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>. An example for the resulting ‘blinking’ boundary for rsEGFP2 is shown in the <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>.

With signal recovery time-points included into the model, blinking SV data could be fitted within the noise of data acquisition, and blinking has been fully implemented in the MCMC decomposition of signals from mixtures with different fluorophores. However, on the basis of the theoretical analysis of information content in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (magenta line), for switching processes at rates below 3×10<sup>–4</sup>/sec, blinking can be detrimental to component discrimination, because it does not allow the fluorophore to ever significantly populate the dark state.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17812.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Blinking fluorescence SV data.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cartoon illustrating the timing of events in standard <italic>vs.</italic> blinking experiments. Dependent on sample history, an initial brief illumination with 405 nm may be applied prior to start of centrifugation. In standard time-domain experiments (top) a series of 488 nm scans at constant frequency is initiated shortly after full rotor speed is reached. It causes a gradual depletion of signals for molecules switching off, depicted by the fading blue bar, such as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>. For blinking experiments (middle and bottom) the sequence of scans was briefly interrupted at select time points (indicated by purple arrows) by short pulses of high-power 405 nm illumination, switching on molecules that switch off at 488 nm such as rsEGFP2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, or switching off molecules that switch on at 488 nm such as Padron in (<bold>b</bold>), respectively.

Fluorescence scans were acquired with 488 nm excitation in ~5 min intervals (only every second scan shown), interrupted three times by 2 min exposure of the spinning rotor to 405 nm light. During the data acquisition cycles the fluorescence signal increases, due to switching on of Padron, but the increase is reversed each time in the 405 nm light that switches Padron to the off state. At these time points, gaps in the boundary overlay can be visually discerned; these appear largely due to the decreasing signal magnitude of the boundary. The complete fluorescence or dark state is not reached in these cycles, and the fluorescence signal magnitude after 405 nm exposure is treated as a fitting parameter.

In contrast to blinking, this can be executed without any instrument modification, simply by positioning the existing FDS detector at a fixed radius for an extended period of time at the beginning of the sedimentation process. Based on the size of the focal spot we estimate the stationary exposure to be on the order of 100-fold stronger as compared to the time-averaged exposure during scanning across the standard radial scan range. Localized switching to the dark state causes a trough in the fluorescence signal (or a peak for molecules switching on at 488 nm). Much like the well-known technique of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), molecules in the dark state that are located initially in the trough will diffuse and exchange with fluorescent molecules from outside, diminishing the trough. In contrast to FRAP, the diffusion processes are coupled to size-dependent migration from sedimentation, which translates and stretches the shape of the trough as it diminishes. Simultaneously, this process is superimposed by the same uniform photoswitching of psFPs that sets in with radial scanning (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). Even though this appears to be a more complicated process, the evolution of the trough is naturally modeled in the same framework developed above for the sedimentation in quasi-uniform exposure: Since SV models already account for diffusional spread superimposed to sedimentation, the FRAP-like SV model solely requires the additional application of appropriate boundary conditions (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8">Equation 8</xref>) at early times. However, in comparison to standard sedimentation boundaries, the resulting data are enriched in several ways, as (1) additional information on diffusion becomes available; (2) two additional sedimentation boundaries are generated to improve the precision of sedimentation coefficients; and (3) in data from mixtures of psFPs with stable fluorescent molecules, the depth of the trough will provide a landmark at early times reporting directly on the concentration of psFPs-tagged components. In applications to the analysis of experimental data, excellent fits were achieved with this model with residuals close to the noise of data acquisition. For example, with the single-species model fitted to the rsEGFP2-GluA3 data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, the <italic>s</italic>-value is 4.59 [4.50–4.68, 68% CI] S, consistent with the value obtained from blinking and from constant illumination experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Application to the GluA2 – GluA3 ATD interaction</title><p>Glutamate receptor ion channels (iGluRs) assemble into homo- and hetero-tetramers with their subtype composition dictating the properties of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geiger et al., 1995</xref>).

At a high concentration of 30 nM, the sedimentation coefficient distributions rsEGFP2-GluA3 and DL488-GluA2 both show a single co-sedimenting peak at ~5.9 S, consistent with a saturated 1:1 hetero-dimer complex, moderately extended with a frictional ratio of 1.42. With decreasing concentrations the peaks occur at lower sedimentation coefficients, characteristic for a rapid association/dissociation equilibrium relative to the time-scale of sedimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schuck, 2010</xref>). Due to the decreasing signal/noise ratio peaks also broaden at lower concentrations. Further, at concentrations below 1 nM a separate slower sedimenting peak of DL488-GluA2 can be discerned, consistent with the s-value of free GluA2 monomer, co-existing with a faster-sedimenting dimeric fraction of GluA2. Due to the smaller difference between the s-value of the hetero-dimeric complex and free rsEGFP2-GluA3, the latter cannot be resolved at the low signal/noise ratios below 1 nM. However, the signal-weighted average sedimentation coefficient s<sub>w</sub> can still be determined as a function of concentration for both components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b</xref>).

Although psFPs were designed to serve a very different purpose, we have embarked on the quantitative analysis of their switching kinetics as a novel temporal tag to substitute for spectral discrimination. In the low-power illumination conditions of FDS-SV the time-course of photoswitching can serve as a finger-print for different psFPs and permit quantitative multi-component analysis. Thus, the study of heterogeneous interactions can be carried out with mixtures of psFP-tagged proteins, proteins labeled with stable fluorophore dyes, and/or non-fluorescent proteins. This opens the possibility for the same fusion proteins observed co-localizing in microscopy to be overexpressed and purified for in vitro binding studies in FDS-SV, to provide information of number, size, and stoichiometry of complexes. Further, there is a potential for FDS-SV to be applied to more crowded solutions such as cell extracts and serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Polling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kokona et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hill and Laue, 2015</xref>), in which the hydrodynamic interpretation of complex sizes is less quantitative, but complex stoichiometries derived from multi-component detection should be invariant. Exploiting the switchable signal further, we have demonstrated that additional spatial and temporal modulation of the psFPs signal in FDS-SV is possible. This has the potential to further improve discrimination of different psFPs and to enhance hydrodynamic analysis, for example, in the FRAP-like configurations used in the present study.</p><p>The switchability of signal and localized optical manipulation afforded by psFPs can be envisioned to expand the toolbox of analytical ultracentrifugation in many other unexpected ways. For instance, the creation of lamella-like signal configurations within the concentration plateau region may enable novel assays, for example, to observe subunit exchange rates of size-resolved macromolecular complexes from the lamella migration and signal amplitude changes, or to study complex formation in crowded solutions within the plateau region of rapidly sedimenting co-solutes. Even though the present work was focused on SV, sedimentation equilibrium (SE) analytical ultracentrifugation would be expected to equally benefit from the use the new temporal tag: for example, once molecules are in thermodynamic equilibrium of sedimentation, psFPs may be reset or depleted, for example, by uniform 405 nm or 488 nm illumination, and the ensuing temporal signal evolution could reveal the equilibrium distribution specifically of psFPs in a mixture. Further, one could envision FRAP-like localized switching in SE to complement thermodynamic with hydrodynamic information obtained while maintaining SE. Beyond analytical ultracentrifugation, quantitatively exploiting the characteristic dynamics of photoswitching arising from different switching quantum yields may prove useful in other techniques.</p><p>The new MCMC approach we developed may be compared to other fluorescence methods used to detect binding, including fluorescence correlation/cross-correlation, polarization, proximity and life time imaging methods. These generally offer greater flexibility in solution conditions and can be carried out in vivo. However, the strongly size-dependent migration of molecules in the gravitational field is a unique feature of FDS-SV that can lead to significantly higher resolution of macromolecular complexes. We believe this has great potential for the study of systems that exhibit polydisperse mixtures of different complexes, which would elude traditional structural characterization, and only display population-averaged features in spectroscopic techniques.</p><p>Of interest, we discovered changes in the switching rate and final contrast of rsEGFP and rsEGFP2 induced by antibody binding. This suggests that subtle binding-induced conformational changes of the GFP β-barrel occur that can lead to changes in the equilibrium populations of photophysical states of the chromophore. For Dronpa, NMR studies have revealed flexibility of the β-barrel allowing non-radiative decay processes in the dark state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mizuno et al., 2008</xref>), and viscosity-mediated reduction of flexibility has been proposed as a mechanism for the viscosity sensitivity of its fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kao et al., 2012</xref>). Also, structural flexibility mediating conformational changes from the protein exterior to the chromophore environment inside the β-barrel has been exploited for GFP as a sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg et al., 2009</xref>). It seems conceivable that a similar mechanism may be at work in the binding sensitivity of its photoswitchable variants. Even though the psFPs will typically be designed to be an inert tag, rather than offering binding sites, this reveals the potential for an additional, more subtle source of information in temporally modulated FDS-SV, if the equilibrium of photophysical states is altered through occupation of a binding site.</p><p>Prior work on the assembly of AMPA receptor ATDs suggested an inefficient process for the formation of GluA2/GluA3 heteromers because the K<sub>d,22</sub> for homodimer assembly by GluA2, 1.8 nM, was only 1.4 fold greater than the K<sub>d,23</sub> of 1.3 nM for heterodimer assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rossmann et al., 2011</xref>). Using the MCMC approach we find that the process is much more efficient, with a K<sub>d,23</sub> for heterodimer assembly of 0.32 nM, 85-fold smaller than the 27.1 nM K<sub>d,22</sub> for homodimer assembly by GluA2, and four orders of magnitude smaller than the K<sub>d,33</sub> for GluA3 homo-dimerization, which is consistent with the obligate formation of GluA2/GluA3 heterodimer in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rossmann et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>While this first application highlights the potential of the method to determine sub-nanomolar dissociation equilibrium constants of protein complexes involving competitive or cooperative self- and hetero-association processes, other key aspects of the method are the ability to simultaneously monitor the size-distribution of individual components and their complexes formed in solution, and the potential to discriminate two or more different psFPs. The availability of size-distributions for all components distinguishes MCMC FDS-SV from methods such as SPR or ITC often used for studying bimolecular reactions. Considering that, from large-scale proteomic experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gavin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krogan et al., 2006</xref>), on average more than four components are in cellular protein complexes, it is necessary to develop methods that can elucidate their stoichiometries, architectures, and driving forces. We believe MCMC FDS-SV offers a powerful new approach to study such multi-component complexes in solution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Analytical ultracentrifugation with fluorescence detection system (FDS)</title><p>SV experiments were carried out in an Optima XL-A (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis IN) equipped with an FDS (Aviv Biomedical, Lakewood NJ).

The plasmid rsEGFP2 was produced by mutating the pQE31-rsEGFP plasmids using following primers, T65A (5’-CCACCCTG<underline>GCC</underline>TACGGCGTG-3’), A150V (5’-GCCACAAC<underline>GTC</underline>TATATCATGG-3’), and N205S (5’-GCACCCAG<underline>TCC</underline>AAGCTGAGC-3’). Mutations are underlined. The plasmid pQE31-Padron was also provided by Stefan Jakobs and EGFP was expressed from the pRSETA-EGFP plasmid both described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>The GluA2 ATD cDNA, residues Met1–Ser404, was cloned into the pRK5-IRES-EGFP mammalian expression vector with a C-terminal LELVPRGS-His<sub>8</sub> linker, thrombin cleavage site and affinity tag. The rsEGFP–GluA3 ATD fusion construct was created as follows: The cDNA for the GluA3 signal peptide residues Met1–Gly22, followed by an SGSG tetrapetide linker, was inserted upstream of the cDNA for rsEGFP residues Val2–Lys239, and connected by an SGS tripeptide linker to the cDNA for GluA3, residues Gly23–Ser408, followed by a C-terminal LELVPRGS-His<sub>8</sub> linker, thrombin cleavage site and affinity tag, cloned into the pRK5 mammalian expression vector. Both constructs were expressed in HEK293T cells by transient transfection of suspension cultures using PEI MAX 40000 (Polysciences Inc.). The secreted constructs with native complex glycosylation were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Pellicon 10 kDa MW cutoff cassettes (Millipore) and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography using a HiTrap NTA column (GE Healthcare), followed by proteolysis with thrombin, and then ion exchange chromatography using a HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare). The pooled fractions were concentrated and then dialyzed against AUC or labeling buffer as appropriate (150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaPhosphate, pH 7.5 and 7.0 respectively).</p><p>A 14.4 µM concentration of purified GluA2 ATD was mixed with a 12 M excess of <italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester–activated Dylight488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) dissolved in DMSO and then diluted with labeling buffer. The reaction was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 45 min and then loaded onto a high resolution size exclusion chromatography column (Superdex 75 10/300 GL) equilibrated with AUC buffer to separate free dye from labeled protein. The protein concentration and labeling ratio were then determined by UV-Vis spectrophotometry using values for ε<sub>280</sub> of 55,720 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup> for the unmodified protein, ε<sub>280</sub> of 10,290 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup> and ε<sub>493</sub> of 70,000 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup> for Dylight488.</p><p>Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was acquired from Sigma Aldrich (catalog#A7030, St. Louis) and fluorescently labeled with FITC using the labeling kit from Thermo Fisher targeting the primary amine on BSA (catalog#53027). Monoclonal anti-GFP IgG (D153-3) was purchased from MBL International (Woburn, MA) and subjected to exhaustive dialysis with the working buffer, phosphate buffered saline (5.62 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.06 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 154 mM NaCl, pH 7.40). To all samples, unlabeled BSA was added at 0.1 mg/ml to suppress surface adsorption of the proteins of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fluorescence spectroscopy</title><p>Benchtop fluorescence spectroscopy experiments were carried out in a Fluorolog spectrofluorometer (Horiba Instruments Inc., Irvine CA). rsEGFP or rsEGFP2 at were studied at a final concentration of 0.5 µM in the presence or absence of equimolar anti-GFP antibody, after 2 hr incubation of the mixture. Emission spectra were collected with slit widths set to 1 nm. For kinetic experiments of photoswitching, the 490 nm excited 508 nm fluorescence of rsEGFP or the 483 nm excited 502 nm fluorescence of rsEGFP2 was monitored, respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Stefan Jakobs and Stefan Hell (Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry) for providing pQE31-rsEGFP plasmid.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work addresses an important experimental challenge: the quantitative characterization of the energetics and dynamics of macromolecular interactions in complex multicomponent systems. The authors describe a new method to extract multi-component information from fluorescence-based sedimentation velocity data based on definable fluorescence bleaching or photoswitching rates of fluorophores. They present an analytical framework that enables a quantitative analysis of the data and show that their method can be used to measure equilibrium dissociation constants of homo- and heterodimeric GluA2/GluA3 complexes. The manuscript describes a very clever and creative advance and further extends from the large leaps of innovation in this methodology driven by Peter Schuck over the last 15-20 years.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The data and their analysis are of high quality and rigor. The method represents quite a step forward and may be applicable to a wide range of problems. The manuscript, however, should be improved to increase its accessibility to a broad audience. At many instances, terminology is used that is likely not familiar to most readers and specialized knowledge and is implicitly assumed to be present. The authors should careful go through their manuscript and add/revise liberally to make sure it becomes accessible to a wide audience without sacrificing detail and rigor.</p><p>- In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, polydispersity is determined using the new method. Perhaps the power of this result could be more clearly illustrated if the data is presented side-by-side with a &quot;traditional&quot; analysis – such as c(s) fitted with radial independent noise to account for bleaching. Also the labels spec 1 and spec 2 could be labeled more clearly as to what they mean – this is not immediately apparent.</p><p>- The manuscript could be more easy to follow with some additional simple diagrams of the concepts or methodological design added to the figures. For example:a) small cartoon of the binding model and how the two signal components relate to this binding model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: Were scans taken at regular intervals? If so would be useful to show on graph when the 2 min exposure happened. A diagram of the timing of events would be useful.c) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: hard to see different scans – perhaps show less scans? Also what are the purple scans? Are these run in parallel AUC cells. Also it is not clear what the sequence of events are in collecting this data. Perhaps a diagram showing the temporal series of events could be used to illustrate the concept more clearly next to the data.</p><p>- Subsection “Application to GluA2 – GluA3 ATD heteromers”: the GluA3 data should be shown for completeness, perhaps added onto <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17812.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The data and their analysis are of high quality and rigor. The method represents quite a step forward and may be applicable to a wide range of problems. The manuscript, however, should be improved to increase its accessibility to a broad audience. At many instances, terminology is used that is likely not familiar to most readers and specialized knowledge and is implicitly assumed to be present. The authors should careful go through their manuscript and add/revise liberally to make sure it becomes accessible to a wide audience without sacrificing detail and rigor.</italic> </p><p>We greatly appreciate the positive feedback on the quality and utility of the method, and agree that it would greatly benefit from better accessibility to a wider audience. We made significant efforts to achieve this goal.</p><p>We have introduced a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> showing the basics of a sedimentation experiment, in order to clarify some of the indispensable operational terms, such as ‘boundary’, ‘plateau’, and ‘sedimentation coefficient’. It has the additional advantage of seamlessly highlighting the unique potential of this technique for studying protein interactions. This distils the essence of the technique and as such is a good starting point for experts and non-experts alike. The introduction was slightly expanded accordingly.</p><p>Further, we have modified the manuscript to eliminate references to more technical aspects (such as to the Lamm equation, frictional ratios, and hydrodynamic scaling parameters) that are not central to the new method. We found these aspects can be covered well in the methods section instead, alongside the other technical information, with some additional explanatory information and references.</p><p><italic>- In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, polydispersity is determined using the new method. Perhaps the power of this result could be more clearly illustrated if the data is presented side-by-side with a &quot;traditional&quot; analysis – such as c(s) fitted with radial independent noise to account for bleaching. Also the labels spec 1 and spec 2 could be labeled more clearly as to what they mean – this is not immediately apparent.</italic></p><p>We agree this is a very useful addition for highlighting the characteristics of the psFP signals in a way we had previously not thought of.</p><p>As suggested, we have now included new panels to this Figure (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) to show how a traditional analysis fails, even if one were to try capturing the decreasing plateau signals with time-dependent baseline offsets. (Although radial-invariant time-dependent baseline changes are an important component of Rayleigh interference data, there is no physical reason for allowing such time-varying offsets in the analysis of FDS-SV data, and usually excellent fits can are achieved with a constant baseline if the correct model is used.) The large misfit of this impostor model, especially in the initial boundaries, emphasizes the impact of the psFP signal change on the measured boundary amplitudes, not only the plateaus, and is therefore a very useful extension in particular of the discussion of the data from the rsEGFP2/FITC-BSA mixture. For the mixture including Padron a standard analysis fails even more clearly, affirming the previous point.</p><p>We also agree that the labels in the distribution plots were not very clear, and we have improved this in the revision.</p><p><italic>- The manuscript could be more easy to follow with some additional simple diagrams of the concepts or methodological design added to the figures. For example:a) small cartoon of the binding model and how the two signal components relate to this binding model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: Were scans taken at regular intervals? If so would be useful to show on graph when the 2 min exposure happened. A diagram of the timing of events would be useful.c) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: hard to see different scans – perhaps show less scans? Also what are the purple scans? Are these run in parallel AUC cells. Also it is not clear what the sequence of events are in collecting this data. Perhaps a diagram showing the temporal series of events could be used to illustrate the concept more clearly next to the data.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for encouraging the inclusion of more diagrams. We have followed this recommendation and feel they clarify the concepts considerably. With regard to the specific points:</p><p>a) We have included a cartoon of the binding scheme of GluA2-ATD and GluA3-ATD with the competitive homo- and hetero-dimerization as a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. For greater clarity, the schematics introduces indices to better distinguish the different Kd-values.</p><p>b) We have included a schematics of the timing of events during the blinking experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We have also clarified in the Figure legend that the visual gap is mostly not from a prolonged time between scans (it is only extended by 50% to accommodate the 405 nm exposure) but from the significant change in the boundary signal magnitude. On first glance, one tends to compare non-equivalent points in the spreading boundary, but on closer inspection one can recognize the boundary midpoints are not as far apart.</p><p>c) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we have exchanged data in panels c and e to better display the scans. However, the individual data points are still hard to see. At the root of the problem is the fact that a lot of the scans cross, which does not usually happen in traditional SV.</p><p>To address this concern differently, we have added movies for all sedimentation processes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> through <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2e</xref>. They are referred to from within the figure legend, and allow very clear and unambiguous inspection of the signal evolution with time. The associated videos should be easy to retrieve from the <italic>eLife</italic> website directly or from links embedded in the article pdf.</p><p>Still, we feel it is useful to allow a visual comparison of the different types of temporal modulation in side-by-side overlay plots, since such overlay plots such as panel b are the traditional form of SV data presentation. We have experimented with various formats, and came to the conclusion that the extended rainbow color scheme from purple-blue-green-red works best. Reducing the number of scans does not always offer a significant improvement in overall clarity, since it has the disadvantage of making the temporal progression harder to follow. However, we have improved the resolution of the plots, which should allow a reader to zoom in when reading an electronic copy.</p><p>Finally, the temporal series of events should now be clearer with the new schematics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and the help of the movies.</p><p><italic>- Subsection “Application to GluA2 – GluA3 ATD heteromers”: the GluA3 data should be shown for completeness, perhaps added onto <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. The revised figure (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) shows the requested rsEGFP2-GluA3 data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
