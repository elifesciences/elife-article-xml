constructs of cognitive control. It is notoriously difficult to quantify from overt behavior, since the outcome of successful inhibition is the lack of a behavioral response. Currently, the most common measure of action stopping, and by proxy response inhibition, is the model-based stop signal reaction time (SSRT) derived from the stop signal task. Recently, partial response electromyography (prEMG) has been introduced as a complementary physiological measure to capture individual stopping latencies. PrEMG refers to muscle activity initiated by the go signal that plummets after the stop signal before its accumulation to a full response. Whereas neither the SSRT nor the prEMG is an unambiguous marker for neural processes underlying response inhibition, our analysis indicates that the prEMG peak latency is better suited to investigate brain mechanisms of action stopping. This study is a methodological resource with a comprehensive overview of the psychometric properties of the prEMG in a stop signal task, and further provides practical tips for data collection and analysis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>response inhibition</kwd><kwd>electromyography</kwd><kwd>stop signal task</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Partial response electromyography is a useful and reliable measure of action stopping in a stop signal task, supported by psychometric and meta-analytic evidence.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Response inhibition, or the ability to stop actions, is a core construct of cognitive control and is widely studied among cognitive and clinical neuroscientists. Most of our knowledge about inhibitory capability is derived from a single behavioral measure, the stop signal reaction time (SSRT), which quantifies the time the stopping process needs to countermand an already initiated action. SSRTs are slower in patients with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, drug abuse, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and Tourette syndrome among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jahanshahi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lipszyc and Schachar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Snyder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wylie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yaniv et al., 2017</xref>). However, accumulating evidence suggests that SSRT estimations may be unreliable in many practical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bissett et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bissett and Logan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matzke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skippen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Verbruggen et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we scrutinize electromyography (EMG) recordings from the muscles that are successfully stopped as a potential physiological marker to capture individual differences in action stopping.</p><p>The stop signal task is among the most common experimental tasks used to study inhibition, with more than 7000 publications using the task in the last years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Verbruggen et al., 2019</xref>). The principle of the task is very simple: participants react repeatedly to a go signal with a button press but need to inhibit this response when a stop signal appears after the go signal with a variable delay (stop signal delay, SSD). The resulting go reaction time distribution, probability of responding despite stop signal presentation, and the resulting SSDs are the necessary variables for calculating the SSRT.</p><p>The SSRT estimation is based on the independent race model (or horse race model), in which go and stop processes independently race against each other, and whichever process wins this race, determines whether a planned action will be executed or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Band et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Logan and Cowan, 1984</xref>). The theoretical basis of the model is well established and an extension of this model also has biological plausibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boucher et al., 2007</xref>). However, recent work indicates that SSRT estimates may be inaccurate in many practical cases, for example due to extensive slowing of go responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Verbruggen et al., 2013</xref>), violations of the independence assumptions at short SSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bissett et al., 2021b</xref>), or failures to initiate the stop process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skippen et al., 2019</xref>). The available solutions focus on the derivation of putatively improved SSRT estimates, either by refining the estimation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Verbruggen et al., 2019</xref>), discarding participants or trials that show obvious violations of the model assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bissett et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bissett et al., 2021b</xref>), or by proposing alternative modelling approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heathcote et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matzke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matzke et al., 2013</xref>). However, the field has been in a remarkable standstill when it comes to the development of complementary measures that could potentially bypass issues related to model assumptions in the first place.</p><p>A notable exception is the proposition to derive a more direct measure of the stopping latency from EMG. Specifically, EMG recorded at the effector muscles that generate the response can be used to capture the time-point when the motor activity begins to decline in the muscles. In many successfully stopped trials (trials without a registered response), surface EMG recordings still capture small bursts of muscle activity. These bursts are presumably responses initiated after the go signal that are stopped before the muscle activity culminates in a button press. We have termed these responses partial response EMG (prEMG; see <xref ref-type="box" rid="box1">Box 1</xref> for visualization and reflections on the naming). The proposition to use the peak latency of the prEMG as an indicator of an individual’s stopping speed seems to have originated independently in two different laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atsma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raud and Huster, 2017</xref>). Raud and Huster used surface EMG from thumb muscles in a selective stop signal task and measured the prEMG peak latency to be about 150 ms, which was significantly shorter than the corresponding SSRT of about 200 ms. Atsma et al. used intramuscular recordings of the upper-limb muscle during reaching movements. They reported a prEMG offset latency (the time-point when muscle activity returned to the baseline level) at 165 ms, compared with an SSRT of 244 ms. While their methods and goals were different, both studies showed that the EMG-derived stopping latency was much faster than that of the model-based SSRT.</p><boxed-text id="box1"><label>Box 1.</label><caption><title>Definition and naming of the partial response EMG (prEMG).</title></caption><p>prEMG refers to small muscle bursts in successful stop trials (third panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="box1fig1">Box 1—Figure 1</xref>). These bursts are elicited in response to the go signal but stopped in response to the stop signal before the muscle activation culminates in a button press. As such, the trial itself is considered a successful stop trial, but the prEMG onset and peak latencies indicate the exact timing of the go- and stop processes at the effector muscles, respectively.</p><fig id="box1fig1" position="float"><label>Box 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Examples of electromyography (EMG) signals in a go, unsuccessful stop, and successful stop trial in an example participant. EMG in go and unsuccessful stop trials is associated with a button press (marked by RT), while no button press is registered in successful stop trials and the muscle burst therefore qualifies as partial response EMG (prEMG).

However, we believe prEMG to describe the phenomenon most accurately without any assumptions about the underlying mechanisms. Below, we list the terms found in the previous literature.</p><p><bold>Partial EMG</bold>. Early papers used this term and it is a more concise version of the term prEMG. However, partial EMG implies that the EMG signal itself is incomplete, which is not the case. Rather, the EMG signal in successful stop trials itself is perfectly valid but different from other EMG bursts because the response is not completed.</p><p><bold>Interrupted EMG</bold>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGarry and Franks, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McGarry and Franks, 1997</xref> used this term for muscle bursts in stop trials that had a similar shape at their onset to the go EMG, indicating a slow stopping process after the motor pool activation by the go process. They further dissociated <italic>interrupted response EMG</italic> from <italic>partial response EMG</italic>, the latter having accumulation rates and milder slopes at their onset. This was interpreted as a weakened activation of the motor pool (or a leakage signal) in trials where go EMG was interrupted early, before reaching the motor pool. However, they used a stop signal task with unusually short SSDs from −100 to 100 ms relative to the go signal. Dissociation between these response types is unlikely in a more typical stop signal task with SSDs &gt;100 ms.</p><p><bold>Partial error</bold>. This term is consistently used in tasks in which an erroneous automatic response needs to be overridden by a correct response (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coles et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rochet et al., 2014</xref>). In such tasks, the term ‘error’ is appropriate. However, the prEMG in the stop signal task is not erroneous as it is elicited by the go signal, which is perfectly in line with the task instructions.</p><p><bold>Subthreshold EMG</bold>. This term was used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raud and Huster, 2017</xref>, indicating that the EMG in successful stop trials did not reach the threshold to trigger the button press. However, such thresholds are relatively arbitrary and depend on the physical properties of the response device. In addition, this naming becomes inappropriate if continuous movements are of interest, as for example is the case with measurements of force or movement trajectories.</p><p><bold>Cancel time</bold>. This term, suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jana et al., 2020</xref>, specifically refers to the prEMG peak latency. Whereas appealing due to its simplicity, it is potentially misleading as it implies a direct cancellation mechanism for stopped movements. Yet, alternative mechanisms may cause the same EMG phenomenon, such as the activation of antagonist muscle groups, or a simple reduction in response maintenance.</p></boxed-text><p>While using the prEMG latency as an index of stopping capability is a relatively recent suggestion, recording EMG in a stop signal task is not particularly novel by itself. Earlier work identified that muscle activity can be stopped at any time before the movement is completed, and additionally focused on the time-courses of different electrophysiological measures, that is EMG, electrocardiography, and electroencephalography (EEG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Jong et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jennings et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Boxtel et al., 2001</xref>). These studies identified the motor cortex as a site of inhibition, yet they showed that the peripheral nervous system is affected as well. Several studies have attempted to interpret the prEMG within the context of the horse race model. For instance, trials with prEMG seem to roughly correspond to the middle part of the go-RT distribution, indicating that these trials have a relatively fast go process that nonetheless is slow enough to be suppressed by the stop process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Jong et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Boxtel et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, the occurrence of the prEMG is dependent on the SSD, as prEMG frequency declines and its amplitude increases with increasing SSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coxon et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, EMG in unsuccessful stop trials may be affected by the stop process as well, as these trials exhibit lower EMG amplitudes, but prolonged motor times (the time between EMG onset and the registered response) compared with standard go responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van de Laar et al., 2014</xref>). This violates the assumption of independence underlying the independent horse race model, which states that unsuccessful stop trials are drawn from the distribution of fast go responses and should therefore be unaffected by the stop signal. The dependence of go and stop processes was recently directly shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raud et al., 2020a</xref> who found a positive correlation between go-locked prEMG onsets and stop-locked prEMG peak latencies at the level of single stop trials.</p><p>The earlier timing of the prEMG peak latency compared to the SSRT has been replicated in a number of independent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hannah et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jana et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raud et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raud et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sundby et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tatz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thunberg et al., 2020</xref>). However, while the existence of the prEMG is relatively well established, its characteristics and utility have not been explored sufficiently. We therefore present a thorough investigation of the prEMG in the stop signal task. Importantly, we treat prEMG as a marker of action stopping only, without specifically linking it to inhibitory brain mechanisms, as mechanisms other than active inhibition may cause cessation in muscle activity too. This separation between action stopping and response inhibition holds for the SSRT as well, but is often overlooked in the literature, in which the stop runner in the horse race model is frequently interpreted as an active process to counteract the go process. Nonetheless, as the SSRT and the prEMG have been previously associated with the same underlying neural mechanisms, we benchmark the prEMG peak latency against the SSRT and the existing horse race model framework; investigate potential relationships between response onset, stopping, and the SSD at a single-trial level; present novel information about stopping variability; and estimate the reliability of the EMG measures. We additionally provide practical tips for data collection and analysis, accompanied by publicly available analysis code that can easily be adjusted to new datasets. With that, we demonstrate the full potential of prEMG with the aim to encourage and accelerate future studies to adopt it as a standard outcome measure of supposed inhibition tasks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavior and EMG in a stop signal task</title><p>We analyzed surface EMG recorded over the thumb muscles (<italic>abductor pollicis brevis</italic>) from 46 healthy young adults who performed a standard stop signal task. The primary task was a choice reaction time task where participants had to respond to a go signal either with a left or right hand button press (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In 24% of the trials, a stop signal occurred instructing the participants to stop their response. The full analysis pipeline was additionally applied to a publicly available dataset provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jana et al., 2020</xref> to replicate the current results. The main difference between these two datasets was the proportion of trials with prEMG of successful stop trials, which was relatively low (~20%) in the discovery, but higher (~60%) in the replication dataset. With a few minor exceptions, the results were the same in both datasets. Therefore, we report the results obtained on the discovery dataset, and only report the replication results when these deviate from the discovery dataset results.

PrEMG was detected in 23% of successful stop trials.</p><boxed-text id="box2"><label>Box 2.</label><caption><title>Detecting prEMG and extracting peak latency.</title></caption><p><bold>EMG detection</bold></p><p>The identification of EMG bursts is a signal detection problem. Given that the signal-to-noise ratio of EMG data is relatively high, simple threshold-based detection algorithms perform reasonably well. Basic preprocessing steps to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio may include high-pass filtering, rectification or a root mean square transformation, smoothing or low-pass filtering, baseline normalization, and the definition of a temporal window eligible for burst detection. We additionally normalize the full EMG time-courses to be able to keep the detection threshold constant across participants. Our processing pipeline is freely available at the Open Science framework. Alternatively, one may refer to the toolbox provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jackson and Greenhouse, 2019</xref>.</p><p>Simple threshold-based algorithms may, however, show declined performance in the presence of high baseline EMG activity or when crosstalk from different muscle groups is prevalent. In such cases, burst detection in the frequency domain may outperform detection in the time-domain (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atsma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2015</xref> for examples).</p><p><bold>Extracting peak latency</bold></p><p>There are several ways to extract the prEMG peak latency. Here, we extracted the peak latency of an EMG burst from each trial in which prEMG was detected, and then averaged across trials to get a summary measure for each participant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="box2fig1">Box 2—Figure 1</xref>, left upper panel). This method typically requires extra cleaning and restraints, discarding trials with elevated baseline muscle tone or irrelevant muscle artifacts outside of the expected response window. A more robust method is to first average the EMG activity time-point-wise across all successful stop trials with prEMG and then extract a single peak latency from the averaged waveform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="box2fig1">Box 2—Figure 1</xref>, left middle panel). A third alternative is to extract the average peak latency from trials stemming from the most frequent SSD (the mode; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="box2fig1">Box 2—Figure 1</xref>, left lower panel). This has the closest resemblance to the SSRT estimation (as that is typically calculated at a single SSD, such as the mean SSD), but this method also has significantly fewer available trials, reducing the overall signal-to-noise ratio.</p><p>We compared the three methods and found a good correspondence between them (Spearman <italic>r</italic> between 0.69 and 0.83). All three methods also correlated with the SSRT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="box2fig1">Box 2—Figure 1</xref>, right panels). Peak latency estimates extracted from averaged waveforms appear more normally distributed than estimates from single trials, indicating that the former may represent the more robust estimation approach. However, as this method gives only a single summary measure per participant, it is not appropriate if single-trial analyses are of interest. The prEMG peak latency calculated using only the trials at mode SSD seems to be susceptible to outliers, likely because very few trials are used to derive the summary measure.</p><fig id="box2fig1" position="float"><label>Box 2—figure 1.</label><caption><title>(Left panels) Schematics of partial response electromyography (prEMG) peak latency extraction methods on four trials, in which the ‘bumps’ represent rectified and smoothed EMG bursts, and the vertical red lines indicate the extraction points for latencies from the time-courses.

A similar decline also occurred in unsuccessful stop trials, although they peaked slightly earlier at 99 ms after the stop signal (BF = 3.47 × 10<sup>12</sup>). Speculatively, the steep decline of the falling flank seen in unsuccessful stop trials may suggest that unsuccessful stop trials were also affected by the processes triggered by the stop signal around the same time as the prEMG decline in successful stop trials.</p><p>We additionally quantified motor time, that is the difference between the EMG onset and the RT, and the rise time, that is the duration of the EMG burst from its onset to peak (relative to go signal). Even though the differences are numerically small (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), the motor time was longer in unsuccessful stop trials than in go trials (BF = 5.94; replicating the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van de Laar et al., 2014</xref>). When go trials were divided into fast, medium, and slow trials (see paragraph about the assessment of contextual independence for details on this division), the motor times increased with increasing RTs, so that slow go-trial motor times were equivalent to unsuccessful stop trial motor times (BF = 0.16). The motor time results deviated somewhat in the replication dataset, which had generally much longer motor times at 118 ms. While motor times still increased with increasing RT in go trials, the unsuccessful stop trial motor times were equivalent with the medium part of the go distribution (BF = 0.39), resulting in equivalence also with the full distribution (BF = 0.17). The absolute rise times were also longer in the replication dataset (ranging between 30 and 60 ms for different conditions), but they were shorter in unsuccessful stop trials than in go trials in both datasets (discovery BF = 1.16 × 10<sup>6</sup>; replication BF = 3.93 × 10<sup>5</sup>). Altogether, these results indicate different response dynamics in unsuccessful stop trials and go trials, suggesting that unsuccessful stop trials may be affected by the stop process as well. However, this may be contingent on task procedure and even on the response device mechanics. Here, we used a response device with very little resistance to produce a button press, resulting in very small motor times and low proportion of trials with prEMG. Nonetheless, the replication dataset with longer motor times and a higher prEMG proportion still indicates different response dynamics in go and unsuccessful stop trials.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Associations of prEMG peak latency and frequency with behavior</title><p>In many studies, the SSRT has been reported as a single behavioral outcome measure of the stop signal task, purportedly reflecting the speed of response inhibition. However, recent evidence indicates that both SSRTs and prEMG peak latencies are related to go RTs, potentially due to behavioral adaptations beyond response inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huster et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore investigated the correlational structure of the prEMG and other behavioral measures, both across individuals in the current study and across different experiments by performing a meta-analysis. Given that the major caveat of the prEMG is that it is only present in a portion of successful stop trials, we further investigated whether its peak latency is affected by the proportion of available trials.</p><p>Firstly, goRTs correlated strongly with the SSRTs (<italic>r</italic> = −0.61, p = 1.62 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) and moderately with the prEMG latencies (<italic>r</italic> = −0.33, p = 0.027). Secondly, goRTs correlated moderately with the prEMG detection frequency (<italic>r</italic> = −0.35, p = 0.018). The relationships between prEMG frequency and stopping latency indices were not significant (SSRT <italic>r</italic>=0.23, p = 0.127; prEMG peak latency <italic>r</italic> = 0.27, p = 0.065). In sum, persons who responded fast had more prEMG trials and longer stopping latencies, likely due to a strategic trade-off between going and stopping. Noticeably, this trade-off seems to be best captured by the associations between the goRT and the SSRT.</p><p>Next, we quantified these relationships across 21 different experiments or conditions as reported in 10 studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Despite the large variability of goRTs across the studies (range 246 ms), the prEMG peak latency was surprisingly stable (range 35 ms) and averaged to 158 ms with an average detection frequency of 49% (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> for more descriptive statistics). Given that most articles reported several experiments or task conditions, relationships between prEMG and behavior were tested using general mixed models with article as a random variable (but the relationships were the same if the average value across conditions and experiments was used for each study; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The strong negative association between go RTs and SSRTs seen across individuals was also evident across studies (<italic>b</italic> = −2.08, <italic>t</italic>(19) = −2.65, p = 0.012), as was the smaller association between the go RTs and prEMG peak latencies (<italic>b</italic> = −1.33, <italic>t</italic>(11) = −2.21, p = 0.049). Similarly, studies with faster go RTs reported higher prEMG detection frequencies (<italic>b</italic> = −2.03, <italic>t</italic>(15) = −2.96, p = 0.010).

A feature of the stop signal task is that the SSD varies, most commonly due to an online tracking algorithm that adapts the SSDs to each participant’s performance. The purpose of this is to capture the SSD where participants manage to stop their response for about 50% of the time. A key assumption of this approach is that the probability of unsuccessful stopping (p(button press|stop)) is low (approaching zero) at short SSDs, increases steeply at mid-SSDs, and approaches one at long SSDs. With EMG, this would correspond to the probability of producing EMG at any given stop trial (i.e., p(EMG|stop)), as this implies that the go process was at least initiated before stopping process. This probability thus includes all stop trials with detectable EMG, and is conceptually the sum of unsuccessful stop trials and successful stop trials with prEMG. Thus, by definition, the function of p(EMG|stop) should be shifted to the left from the function of p(button press|stop). In addition, assuming that the successful stop trials with prEMG are drawn uniformly from the distribution of successful stop trials, we would expect the two functions to run in parallel. However, preliminary evidence suggests that prEMG occurs more often at short SSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coxon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Jong et al., 1990</xref>). Given that p(EMG|stop) represents the sum of unsuccessful stop trials and successful stop trials with prEMG, this would lead to larger differences between the two functions at short than in long SSDs.</p><p>The empirical inhibition functions are depicted on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. To capture the expected nonlinear shape of the functions, we fit a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM), predicting the probability of responding (p(button press|stop)) or producing EMG (p(EMG|stop)) despite a stop signal as a function of SSD (model <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.64); this model thus also allows for the assessment of the interaction of response type (button, EMG) and SSD.

In particular, the context independence assumption states that the stop process does not affect the primary go process, thus the distribution of the go-finishing times (estimated by go RTs) is identical in the go and stop trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Band et al., 2003</xref>). We applied two tests of this assumption to both the behavioral and EMG data.</p><p>The most common test compares the mean go RT with the mean RT of unsuccessful stop trials. If response activation is identical in the go and stop trials, the unsuccessful stop trial distribution is censored at the right side; it thus follows that the mean RTs should be shorter in unsuccessful stop trials than in go trials. This was true in our data both for RTs (BF = 1.53 × 10<sup>24</sup>) and EMG onset latencies (BF = 1.32 × 10<sup>24</sup>).</p><p>However, a more stringent test directly compares the equivalence of the corresponding portions of the response time distributions in go and stop trials. Dividing the go-RT distribution at the percentile corresponding to p(button press|stop, SSD) gives an estimate of the distribution of trials for a given SSD in which the go process would or would not escape the stop process. Specifically, the portion at the left of this division are the fast go trials that would escape inhibition, and the portion on the right are slow go trials that would be stopped. We found that the mean unsuccessful stop trial RTs were not equivalent to the mean of the left side of the go-RT distribution (mean = 470 ms, sd = 72; BF = 1542). Since the means of the fast go-RT portions may misrepresent the central values, we repeated the analysis using median values instead. Here, we did find the participant-specific medians of the left side of the go-RT distribution equivalent to the unsuccessful stop trial RTs in the discovery set (BF = 0.53), but not in the replication dataset (BF = 34,849).</p><p>This test has been extended to the EMG onset latencies, deriving an additional division line using the percentile corresponding to p(EMG|stop, SSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Jong et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jennings et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Boxtel et al., 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> explains the key expectations.

The trials between those two lines should correspond to successful stop trials with prEMG. Consequently, the mean go-EMG onset latencies from trials between these two division lines should be equal to the prEMG onsets.

Secondly, the average prEMG onsets were faster than the corresponding average onset of the middle partition of the go-EMG distribution (BF = 2.17 × 10<sup>4</sup>), which contrasts the prediction that these should be roughly equivalent. Lastly, the slow go-EMG onsets occurred later than the prEMG onsets, as expected (BF = 2.81 × 10<sup>21</sup>). These patterns remained the same if medians were used instead of means.

Based on previous findings, we expected the prEMG frequency to decline and its amplitude to increase with increasing SSD. Further, as go RTs tend to correlate positively with the SSDs, we expected that the prEMG onset latencies (calculated relative to the go signal) would increase with SSDs as well.

Many EEG systems include a limited number of dedicated channel pairs that allow for the recording of activity referenced against each other instead of a referencing against the common EEG reference. Those channels can be used to record from electrodes placed on the skin above muscles to capture EMG. Alternatively, EMG electrodes can be referenced against the common EEG reference during acquisition and then re-referenced offline to get a single bipolar EMG channel. Note though that a major caveat of this procedure is that a larger distance between the active EMG electrodes and the EEG reference increases the chance of amplifier saturation, rendering the EMG signal useless.</p><p><bold>Muscle choice and movement direction</bold></p><p>The signal-to-noise ratio of EMG bursts is highly dependent on the combination of target muscle, electrode placement, and movement direction. Most studies have recorded from thumb muscles (abductor <italic>pollicis brevis</italic>), index fingers (<italic>first dorsal interosseous</italic>), or a combination of both, although head, neck, and biceps muscles have been used as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atsma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goonetilleke et al., 2010</xref>). The most intuitive movements (for pushing a button, for example) do not necessarily produce the largest signal-to-noise ratio in EMG recordings. Therefore, we recommend testing various ways of producing a movement before starting the experiment. For APB, the strongest signal is produced by moving the thumb down while keeping the rest of the fingers flat on a surface (it may thus be necessary to elevate the rest of the hand on a book or a block so that downward thumb movements become possible). For the index finger FDI, moving the finger horizontally while keeping the palms flat on the table gives the best results, sometimes outperforming the APB measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coxon et al., 2006</xref>). Even though such movements may be unusual for the participants at first, they typically learn fast after some training. Gamified instructions may help to speed up the learning process (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Quoilin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p><bold>Avoiding spurious muscle tension</bold></p><p>Even though EMG bursts related to movement are large and clear, detection algorithms may struggle with exact onset and peak latencies if a lot of baseline muscle tension is present. This can be reduced significantly by letting the participants rest their arms comfortably on a pillow, and by reminding them before and during the task to relax their hands. Such verbal reminders typically help even if the participant is not aware of any muscle tension. One potential problem is that specific instructions to relax the hands may interfere with task-related tonic EMG fluctuations, but to the best of our knowledge, such effects have not been investigated systematically.</p></boxed-text><sec id="s3-1"><title>The independent horse race model and prEMG</title><p>Several results from our analysis indicate incompatibility of the prEMG with the horse race model. On the one hand, we replicated the results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Jong et al., 1990</xref>, who demonstrated that prEMG trials correspond to trials in the go-trial distribution that are fast enough to initiate muscle activity, but slow enough to not outrun the stopping process. On the other hand, neither unsuccessful stop trials nor successful stop trials with prEMG matched the corresponding partitions of the go-EMG distributions. This indicates that the horse race model framework should not be extended to the go-EMG distribution. Furthermore, prEMG peak latency varied with the SSD, indicating that stopping latency is not stable. Lastly, the single-trial analysis indicated a major violation of the horse race model independence assumption, as the go process (measured by the go-locked prEMG onset latency) and the stop process (measured by the stop-locked prEMG peak latency) share about 70% of variance if the SSD is accounted for. Together, these results add to the increasing pool of evidence which suggests that the independent horse race model is not an appropriate approximation of the stopping performance in practice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Comparison of the prEMG peak latency and the SSRT</title><p>There are three main findings when comparing the prEMG with the SSRT. First, the prEMG peak latency occurs earlier than the SSRT. Second, the prEMG correlates moderately to highly with the SSRT. Third, prEMG frequency and latency distributions show that the horse race model assumptions do not hold in practice, particularly in trials with short SSDs. This begs the question of whether prEMG and SSRT reflect the same underlying mechanism, and if not, how should these measures be interpreted?</p><p>The most parsimonious explanation would be that the prEMG and the SSRT capture the same conceptual construct – action stopping – but they simply reflect different stages in the cascade of events. The prEMG peak latency leads the SSRT by 60ms with an average correlation of <italic>r</italic> = 0.64 across studies. The 60ms delay between the myographic (prEMG peak latency) and behavioral (SSRT) measures may reflect the final ballistic component of the movement, the so-called point of no return, after which initiated movements are unaffected by any higher-order control mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Osman et al., 1986</xref>). In this case, the prEMG may simply reflect the inertia in the neuromuscular system and response device presiding after the prepared movement has been stopped in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gopal and Murthy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jana et al., 2020</xref>). However, several lines of evidence challenge this explanation. First, such ‘leakage’ EMG has been shown to have a milder rising slopes compared to the normal go-EMG responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGarry and Franks, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McGarry and Franks, 1997</xref>). In the current study, the EMG onset slopes were identical for all trial types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Second, even with a moderate-to-strong association across all studies, correlation of prEMG and SSRTs varies considerably between studies. With explained variances ranging from about 10% to 60%, there remains plenty of unexplained variance even for the studies with the highest correlations. Third, the correlational structure with other behavioral and electrophysiological measures derived from the stop signal task differ greatly between the prEMG and the SSRT, where the latter exhibits a correlational structure indicative of an association with a trade-off between fast going and accurate stopping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huster et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To account for the observed differences between the prEMG and the SSRT, we propose that both reflect the latency of action stopping to some degree, but that the SSRT is additionally affected by behavioral strategies and is thus more dependent on the task context. In support of this, the SSRT correlates negatively with go RTs, both across individuals in a single study, as well as across different studies. Whereas the prEMG detection frequency is also affected by task characteristics, evidenced by the correlations with go RTs, the primary outcome of interest, the peak latency, is relatively stable across different studies.</p><p>In sum, the prEMG peak latency captures action stopping speed and its variability across single trials. The SSRT likely captures action stopping to some degree but it is further affected by strategic behavioral adaptations and inaccuracies due to violations of the horse race model’s assumptions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Generalizability of the prEMG peak latency</title><p>The generalizability of the prEMG is potentially hampered by the fact that it appears only in a fraction of trials. The prEMG latency distribution is a truncated representation of the distribution of the underlying stopping process, lacking trials in which actions were stopped cortically before muscle activation or in which go process was not initiated in the first place. The prEMG distribution is thus affected by two interacting processes – action generation and action stopping. The current dataset does not allow us to test which of these processes is dominating.</p><p>To estimate the potential effect of the missing trials, we tested whether the prEMG frequency is associated with other behavioral and EMG measures across participants and studies. First, participants and studies with faster RTs produced more prEMG trials, but there was no relationship between the prEMG frequency and peak latency. Of note, faster RTs were associated with longer stopping latencies, and this relationship was particularly strong for the SSRT. Second, whereas prEMG was detected only in a minority of 20% trials in our data, most of our results were replicated in an independent dataset where 60% of successful stops contained prEMG. Third, the split-half reliabilities of the prEMG latency measures were high even for a small number of trials. Altogether, the fact that the prEMG distribution is truncated does not invalidate its use as a marker of action stopping, since the peak latencies are relatively stable despite the varying number of trials available for its estimation.</p><p>Nonetheless, as the contribution of the missing prEMG trials is unknown, it may still be argued that the available trials do not represent ‘typical’ stop trials. However, stopping actions may be achieved by different underlying mechanisms across different tasks, as well as within the same task across different trials. As such, whether there exists a ‘typical stop-trial’ is an empirical question that the prEMG can provide answers to. This can be achieved by (1) optimizing task design to produce more prEMG trials, for example by encouraging fast responding, using a response device with stiff buttons, or using an anticipated response task that discourages response slowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coxon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MacDonald et al., 2014</xref>); (2) requiring multicomponent movements and/or using antagonist muscle onsets as proxy of stopping latency in each trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goonetilleke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goonetilleke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Havas et al., 2020</xref>); (3) combining EMG with other parametric approaches in which action stopping can be measured on a continuous scale, for example measuring movement trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atsma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Havas et al., 2020</xref>) or response force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). If properly validated, parametric approaches may eventually outperform EMG measures, especially in clinical samples where obtaining clean EMG signals may be challenging.</p><p>Another unsettled question regarding the generalizability is whether prEMG trials could be qualitatively different from other successful stop trials. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McGarry and Franks, 1997</xref> designed a stop signal task with untypically short SSDs, and found that they could differentiate between trials with early and late stopping mechanisms based on the shape of the prEMG rising slope (see <xref ref-type="box" rid="box1">Box 1</xref> about interrupted response for details), although it has been disputed that the same pattern could result from the differential recruitment times of motor neurons with different sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Boxtel and Band, 2000</xref>). Further, EEG studies have found that prEMG trials show decreased lateralized readiness potentials and increased frontal negativities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Jong et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Boxtel et al., 2001</xref>). Increased frontal negativities have also been related to awareness of the prEMG in response conflict tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ficarella et al., 2019</xref>). However, whether these cortical changes reflect qualitatively different mechanisms or merely a continuous variation in the strength of the underlying processes is unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Boxtel et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Finally, does prEMG latency generalize across different contexts? While it has been shown that the SSRT becomes increasingly unreliable in more complex stop signal tasks and its use is thus discouraged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bissett and Logan, 2014</xref>), prEMG can still be recorded in such task settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raud et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raud and Huster, 2017</xref>). Further, (pr)EMG is not limited to the stop signal task, but can be recorded in any task that requires overt responses, as well as tasks that require more complex movements activating several muscle groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tao et al., 2018</xref>). As such, EMG can provide highly sought-after physiological measures that are comparable across different contexts and is currently the most useful approach for investigating putative response inhibition in tasks that rely on the absence of overt behavior as the primary outcome measure. For example, one study using this approach found that the prEMG peaked significantly later in the go/no-go task than in the stop signal task. This was also paralleled by differences in cortical activity, suggesting that these tasks may recruit different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raud et al., 2020b</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tatz et al., 2021</xref> showed that EMG activity declines after any infrequent salient stimulus, highlighting the interdependence between attentional capture and inhibitory control constructs. Thus, comparisons of prEMG characteristics and their driving mechanisms in different contexts provide a rich ground for future research on motor and cognitive control.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Response inhibition and prEMG</title><p>While prEMG can be considered an assumption-free physiological measure in its implementation, it is not free from assumptions in its interpretation. The most urgent unresolved question is whether prEMG captures the latency of inhibitory mechanisms in the brain. On the one hand, prEMG decline unequivocally indicates stopping of muscle activity, so it is safe to presume that the peak latency represents the latency of action stopping. On the other hand, the actual mechanisms that cause this EMG decline cannot be derived from prEMG alone. Alternative explanations to cortical active inhibition mechanisms include activation of antagonist muscles triggering peripheral lateral inhibition, an initial subthreshold activation of the go response, or cessation of the invigoration of the go response by the motor system. Several studies have investigated whether stopping of specific muscle activity could be caused by the activation of antagonist muscles and found that agonist stopping occurs before antagonist activation; thus, the former cannot be caused by the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atsma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corneil et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goonetilleke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goonetilleke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scangos and Stuphorn, 2010</xref>). It is also unlikely that prEMG represents initial subthreshold go activations, as such stimulus-locked responses are typically &lt;100 ms after stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pruszynski et al., 2010</xref>), while prEMG onsets are closer to 300–500 ms. However, it remains to be seen whether prEMG declines because of a reduction in response maintenance (e.g., by restoring the inhibitory state of the cortical-basal ganglia–thalamic loop during rest), or because of an active inhibition mechanism that blocks ongoing motor activity (e.g., by blocking the direct pathway output by increased inhibition via the subthalamic nucleus, or by direct inhibitory influences on M1; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hynd et al., 2021</xref>). Complementary simultaneous data from brain imaging and neural stimulation studies are necessary to understand the neural mechanisms that cause the halt in muscle activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on the synthesis of previous work together with a comprehensive analysis of prEMG characteristics in an independent dataset, we conclude that prEMG is a useful and reliable measure of action stopping. PrEMG is not limited to specific muscles, stimulus modalities, or task contexts, so it provides a comparative physiological measure for a range of different scenarios. Even though there are some similarities between the SSRT and the prEMG, these two measures should not be used interchangeably, but rather complementarily. The SSRT benefits from decades of research and is therefore well characterized across different contexts and sample populations. Yet, it is founded on assumptions that are not always met in empirical data, and it seems to be more strongly affected by behavioral strategies than the prEMG. In contrast, prEMG is directly observable and provides action stopping latencies at a single-trial level. Its peak latency is relatively stable even though design choices may limit the number of available trials. Importantly, neither the SSRT nor the prEMG peak latency is an unambiguous marker of response inhibition in the brain, but since the prEMG is directly observable, it has stronger potential for guiding research on brain mechanisms underlying action stopping.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">E-prime</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 2.0</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Matlab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Math Works, Inc <italic>MATLAB</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">9.4.0.949201 (R2018a)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Eeglab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delorme and Makeig, 2004</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">14.1.1b</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">R Core Team, 2019</xref>;</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3.6.2 (2019-12-12)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BEESTS; Dynamic Models of Choice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matzke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matzke et al., 2013</xref><break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heathcote et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BEESTS2-GF</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample</title><p>Data were analyzed from 46 healthy young adults (mean age = 23.7, sd = 5.5, 30 females, 3 left-handed).

Task presentation was controlled by E-prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA). For this analysis, we focus on the stop signal task exclusively. The primary task was to respond with a button press using the thumb of the left or right hand to an arrow pointing to the left or right, correspondingly. In 24% of the trials, a stop signal appeared after a variable SSD, instructing participants to stop their initiated response. In total, there were 684 go trials and 216 stop trials, equally distributed between left- and right-hand trials.</p><p>Each trial started with a black fixation cross (duration jittered between 500 and 1000 ms), followed by a colored arrow as a go signal, presented for 100 ms. In stop trials, a second arrow of a different color was presented after the SSD. The SSD could vary between 100 and 800 ms and was adjusted based on an adaptive tracking procedure collapsed across both hands: The initial SSD was set to 250 ms, and then increased or decreased by 50 ms following successful and unsuccessful stop trials, respectively. Responses were collected up to 1000 ms after the go stimulus and potential responses after this window were treated as omissions. All stimuli were presented centrally against a gray background and the stimulus color assignments (green, orange, or blue) were counterbalanced across participants. Trial order within a block was randomized, except for the first block, which always started with a minimum of 10 go trials. Short pauses (9 s) were given after every 75 trials, and a longer break with a duration of roughly 5 min was allowed halfway through the task.</p><p>Prior to the experiment, the participants completed a short training block (20 trials, 50% stop trials) with computerized trial-by-trial feedback. In addition, participants were told that it was important to be both fast and accurate, that they were not supposed to wait for the stop signal, and that it was not possible to successfully stop in all stop trials. Automated feedback was presented on screen after every 75th trial. Here, participants were instructed to be faster if their average goRT was above 600 ms, and to be more accurate if the average stop accuracy was below 40%. If neither of these applied, they received the feedback ‘Well done!’.</p><p>The following behavioral variables were extracted based on task performance: go accuracies, error, and omission rates, go reaction times, stop accuracies, unsuccessful stop reaction times, average SSD, and SSRTs. These were calculated using the integration method, where corresponding go reaction time distributions included choice errors, and omissions were replaced by the maximum reaction time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Verbruggen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We also estimated SSRTs and their variability using a Bayesian parametric approach (BEESTS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matzke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matzke et al., 2013</xref>). We chose the BEESTS2-GF model due to the low amount of choice errors in our sample. This model assumes a single go process as well as a stop process, and that both the go and SSRTs can be approximated by an ex-Gaussian distribution, defined by the <italic>μ</italic> and <italic>τ</italic> parameters and a standard deviation of <italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup> + <italic>τ</italic><sup>2</sup>. As this model only fits one go process, choice errors were removed prior to analysis. We also removed outlier trials, defined as trials with RTs ± 3 SDs away from each participant’s mean. Estimation was run using the Dynamic Models of Choice toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heathcote et al., 2019</xref>) in R Studio (version 1.3.1093) where models were fitted to each participant individually. Parameter priors were defined as weakly informative truncated normal distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heathcote et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skippen et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, we set the mean to 500 ms (<italic>μ</italic><sub>go</sub> and <italic>μ</italic><sub>stop</sub>), 200 ms (<italic>σ</italic><sub>go</sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>go</sub>), and 100 ms (<italic>σ</italic><sub>stop</sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>stop</sub>), and the standard deviations to 1000ms.

The EMG signal was bandpass filtered between 20 and 250 Hz using a second-order butterworth filter and resampled to 500 Hz. Data epochs were extracted for all trials from −0.2 to 1.6 s relative to go signal onset.

The peak latency was defined as the time-point of the highest amplitude in a trial. Onset latency was determined by tracking amplitude values backwards in time, starting at the peak latency, up until continuous data points of 8ms were below amplitude threshold. Lastly, peak latencies of the EMG in stop trials were recalculated relative to the stop signal onset by subtracting the SSD. All variables were averaged over left- and right-hand trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">R Core Team, 2019</xref>) and the package collection of <italic>tidyverse</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wickham et al., 2019</xref>) and custom scripts in MATLAB.

To account for individual variability in SSDs, we centralized the SSDs per participant instead of using the absolute values. The mode of each participant’s SSD distribution was treated as zero and we extracted the values ±3 SSD steps around the mode. The prEMG characteristics were averaged per SSD, so that each participant had one value per SSD, given that they had any trials with prEMG at that specific SSD.</p><p>The relationships between the prEMG characteristics and the prEMG were expected to be nonlinear with the exact shape unknown. Therefore, these were tested by the GAMMs using the R package <italic>gamm4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wood and Scheipl, 2020</xref>). GAMM includes the possibility of adding a smooth term to the model, which is a linear sum of several splines. The degree of nonlinearity (or wiggliness) of the resulting model fit is determined by the edf and the corresponding <italic>F</italic> and p values, together with the estimated lambda factor that penalizes for overfitting. For example, in cases where linear fit is the best fit, the edf will be close to one; in case of second-order polynomial fit, the edf will be close to 2, etc. We considered smooth parameters with a p value below 0.05 as indicative of a significant effect.</p><p>Single-trial analysis. The single-trial analysis was done on prEMG (successful stop trials) only, using prEMG onset latencies, peak latencies, and AUC from onset to peaks. These were calculated as a cumulative sum of the amplitudes from onset to peak. AUC thus integrates the duration and amplitude of the prEMG bursts before their decline. As the bivariate correlations with the SSD at a single-trial level were high for the onset latencies (<italic>r</italic> = 0.88), they were orthogonalized for the SSD by predicting onsets from the SSD for each participant and using the residuals instead of original values. AUCs were log transformed since the original values were extremely skewed toward low values. Additional data cleaning was applied, in which trials were excluded if the peak latency occurred before the stop signal or if the onsets (go-locked) or peaks (stop-locked) exceeded two interquartile ranges of the individual participant’s data. Three separate GAMMs were performed predicting peak latency from onset latency, AUC from peak latency, and AUC from onset latency.</p><p>Variability. Individual prEMG variability was estimated as the standard deviation of the prEMG peak latencies across trials for each participant. As some participants had implausibly large variability estimates, we identified and excluded four outliers who exceeded two interquartile ranges. One of these was also an outlier for the standard deviation of the SSRT, calculated by the BEESTS method. Bivariate Pearson rank-ordered correlation coefficients and (uncorrected) p values were used to identify relationships between prEMG variability and the number of prEMG trials per participant, go reaction time standard deviations, average root mean square amplitudes during the intertrial interval of −20 to 0 ms before go stimulus, and standard deviation of the SSRT calculated by the BEESTS method. The scatterplots with the outliers included are in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>.</p><p>Reliability. We estimated the internal consistency of the different prEMG metrics (onset latencies, peak latencies, peak amplitudes, and AUCs from onset to peak) using a permutation-based split-half approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parsons et al., 2019</xref>). After the same level of additional data cleaning as in the single-trial analyses, we split the data for each participant into two random halves and calculated the mean of each half. These estimates for each half were then correlated across participants and the correlations were corrected using the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown, 1910</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spearman, 1910</xref>). This process was repeated 10,000 times, thus resulting in a distribution of reliability estimates. We used the mean of this distribution as our summary reliability estimate, and 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles as the upper and lower limits of the confidence intervals.</p><p>Initially, all trials from all participants were used for the reliability estimates. Next, we repeated the analysis iteratively using an equal number of trials per participant and excluding all participants who did not have enough trials available for a specific iteration. We started with 6 trials per participant (lowest number of trials available for all participants) and increased the number of trials per iteration by one until we were left with 32 trials per participant (with 12 participants remaining). We repeated this process 1000 times, thus getting a distribution of reliability estimates at each trial count.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Meta-analysis</title><p>Three databases (Pubmed, Scopus, and Google Scholar) were searched with keywords (‘EMG’ OR ‘electromyography’) AND (‘stop signal’ OR ‘countermanding’ OR ‘antisaccade’ OR ‘anticipated response’) on 11/21/2021. The abstracts of 158 entries were screened and included in the meta-analysis if they reported prEMG peak or offset latencies relative to the stop signal onset. Most studies reported data from more than one experiment or experimental condition. All experiments/conditions were included as separate entries, except for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thunberg et al., 2020</xref>, from which we only included the three baseline sessions (and excluded the remaining six peri- and post-TDCS sessions, not to bias the results toward a single study with nine entries). Studies that reanalysed data already included in the meta-analysis were excluded. This resulted in 21 conditions/experiments from 10 different studies. In case of missing values, authors were contacted, and all authors provided the required values. We calculated the averages and standard deviations of the go RTs, SSRTs, prEMG detection frequencies, and peak/offset latencies, the differences between the SSRT and prEMG peak latencies, and correlations between the prEMG and SSRT. For the correlation coefficients, the means and standard deviations were calculated on Student <italic>z</italic>-transformed data, and then retransformed into correlation coefficients. The associations between the behavioral and EMG measures were tested with general mixed models with ‘study’ as a random variable, using the R package <italic>lme4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates, 2022</xref>). The spreadsheet with extracted data for all included studies is uploaded in the accompanying OSF page (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raud et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Participants gave written informed consent prior to data collection, and everyone received monetary compensation for their participation.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Inge Leunissen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Both reviewers found the work to be important and timely, given the growing use of pmEMG as a measure of stopping. However, in review and discussion, it was not clear to all reviewers that the data fully support the conclusion that prEMG is an unambiguous marker of stopping latency. Though one reviewer was more positive in their review, both reviewers highlighted concerns that were potential serious. For example, there was agreement that only a small percentage of trials show the bursting effect. This raised concern in consultation about the conclusions. Indeed, one reviewer commented that these results could have led to the opposite conclusion, namely that much is still unknown about prEMG and its relationship to stopping, and so it is premature to declare it a viable marker of stopping latency. In light of these ambiguities, it was decided that the paper was not suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. I have included the full reviewer comments appended below to convey the basis for this decision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The current article proposes the usage of &quot;partial response electromyography (prEMG)&quot; to measure inhibitory control processing in the context of the stop-signal task. Specifically, the idea is to use single-trial EMG to detect subthreshold activity (and its subsequent reduction) on trials in which no overt response was made (i.e., signal-inhibit or &quot;successful stop&quot; trials). According to the authors' proposal, this would allow for a single-trial quantification of the latency of the stopping process.</p><p>This possibility is attractive for obvious reasons, chiefly the fact that the latency of the stopping process in the stop-signal paradigm is not directly or overtly observable from behavioral data alone. While this &quot;partial response EMG&quot; approach has been used in several prominent papers in the 90s, it has recently seen a resurgence, largely due to prior work by the current group of investigators, as well as others (notably including a paper from the Aron group in this journal). This resurgence is largely due to the explicit proposal that the offset latency of the prEMG in particular could be used as a proxy of the latency of the stopping process on individual trials.</p><p>Here, the authors perform an extensive investigation of several psychometric properties of prEMG as well as its relationship to behavior and other aspects of the stop-signal task.</p><p>Based on this, the authors propose that prEMG (and in particular, its offset latency) is a &quot;unique and reliable measure of stopping&quot; and &quot;encourage the widespread us of prEMG to investigate the underlying mechanisms of response inhibition&quot;.</p><p>Interestingly, based on the results of their current investigation, which is thorough and extensive in many ways, I actually arrive at a different conclusion.</p><p>Indeed, while I completely agree that there is utility to prEMG as a measurement, I think there are many theoretical and practical considerations that severely limit that utility. Furthermore, while the authors may turn out to be right that prEMG is a &quot;reliable measure of stopping&quot;, I am quite unconvinced that this has been conclusively shown yet, including in the current paper. Indeed, some of the data presented here casts even more doubt on that purported association.</p><p>Chiefly, my concerns are as follows:</p><p>– First, I see no definitive reason to assume that the reduction of the EMG that constitutes the prEMG measurement is actually due to an inhibitory process. While this may well be the case, it also seems entirely possible that the observed reduction of the EMG is merely due to a cessation of the invigoration of the go-response by the motor system, which could happen entirely in the absence of inhibitory processing. Furthermore, alternatively, it could also reflect an initial subthreshold activation of the go response in those trials. At this point, as much as the authors (and others, including myself) may prefer it, there seems to be little evidence to favor the inhibition-based interpretation over the others – at least to me.</p><p>– Second, as the authors themselves note (to their credit), the correlation between prEMG and SSRT is only very moderate – as low as ~10% variance explained, depending on the study. I understand and agree that SSRT has problems as a measurement, but it is also true that relationships to SSRT have been used as the ultimate benchmark when evaluating the utility of a physiological measurement as a potential &quot;biomarker&quot; of stopping – including by the current authors at several points of their manuscript. At face value, the low correlation to SSRT further casts doubt on the proposed association between prEMG and inhibition / stopping behavior.</p><p>– Third, while again I agree with the authors that SSRT has been the subject of recent (justified) criticism, I am not aware of the fact that anybody is arguing for abolishing it altogether. Of course, work by investigators like Matzke, Bissett, Verbruggen and others have outlined boundary conditions under which SSRT estimates can become imprecise (though corrections exist in most cases). But the same is of course true of the EMG measurement, which is subject to considerable noise, as well as crosstalk from other muscles – including, notably, the antagonist of the responding muscle, etc. Hence, it is at least doubtful to me that prEMG is inherently superior in regard to its associated principled problems (some of which I will get into further below).</p><p>– Fourth, this leaves the single-trial argument, which I agree is quite compelling: SSRT is a compound measure, whereas prEMG carries some degree of single-trial information (though compared to the compound mean-prEMG measure, its single-trial reliability is more limited, as shown in the current study). However, this glosses over the highly pertinent aspect that only a remarkably low fraction of successful stop-trials even shows a prEMG burst (23% in the current study!). As such, there is a huge problem in that trials on which prEMG can be measured do not represent the typical stop-signal trial (or even their majority), and instead only reflect a very minor portion of the trials. The proposition that we can learn something general and universal about the behavior in a certain task by only looking at a small fraction of atypical trials in the critical condition seems like a huge deal to me, which is not really reflected in the considerations presented in this article at all. This problem is amplified by the fact that I imagine that there is some degree of dispersion around that mean, meaning that there will be subjects in which the fraction of prEMG trials is even lower than this 23%. How much are we really gaining in terms of an 'overt' measure of the stopping process if it is only present in such a small subset of trials?</p><p>– Fifth, the trial-wise variation of prEMG latency is quite considerable. While the authors argue that there is some informational value in that intra-subject standard deviation (which may well be accurate, though the association with other subject variables is quite moderate at best; in fact, the highest correlation found for this measurement was to the number of trials, rather than some meaningful behavioral measure or task variable), I find it very hard to believe that the true stopping process within a given subject varies by as much as a standard deviation as large as 143ms would indicate. Indeed, the BEESTS method estimates the SD of SSRT to be &lt;50ms at the largest, as is evident from Figure 7B. The comparably enormous variation of the prEMG measure seems therefore underappreciated.</p><p>– Sixth, how does it make sense that prEMG occurs most prominently at short SSDs? Intuitively, wouldn't one presume that prEMG is most likely to occur when stopping happens &quot;at the last second&quot; – i.e., after cortico-spinal volleys have already been fired and the responding muscle has begun to contract? If so, shouldn't that be _least_ likely when SSDs are short?</p><p>– Seventh, the authors cite the recent Tatz et al. paper as an independent replication of the association between prEMG and SSRT. However, they never discuss what seems to be the core thrust of that study, which is that reductions of EMG are not specific to stopping and appear to occur after other events as well.</p><p>– Finally, the theoretical framing of the paper seems a bit unclear to me. The authors initially frame prEMG as an &quot;alternative to SSRT&quot; and &quot;a more direct measure of the stopping latency&quot; (p. 3f). However, they then argue that prEMG and SSRT are &quot;partially independent&quot; (which, incidentally, could be better phrased – measures are either independent or they are not). In the Conclusions, the authors then unequivocally state that &quot;prEMG is a unique and reliable measure of stopping&quot;. So, if I understand the take home message correctly, the authors suggest that prEMG is a measure of stopping, which is (partially?) independent from SSRT, which, however, is also a &quot;behavioral measure&quot; of stopping (p. 23). In other words, the proposed relationship between prEMG, SSRT, and stopping should be more explicit. Do they both measure stopping? If so, how is that sensible? Or does only one of them? Should we discard SSRT in favor of prEMG? If the latter is to be the argument, I would put forward the above concerns, and reiterate that an explicit proof that prEMG reflects an inhibitory effort is still outstanding. If both SSRT and prEMG measure stopping, then how can they be only very moderately correlated and occur on different time scales?</p><p>In summary, I remain rather unconvinced that prEMG is as of yet established as an &quot;unambiguous marker of the stopping latency&quot;, which is the study's primary claim. It is also not clear to me if the additional set of problems associated with this measure makes it a viable &quot;alternative to SSRT&quot;, as is implied. Hence, while I appreciate that two flawed measures (SSRT and prEMG) may be superior to only one, even if their relationship is unclear, I still believe it's too early to &quot;encourage the widespread us of prEMG to investigate the underlying mechanisms of response inhibition&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Raud et al. explore the possibility of using partial electromyography responses on successful stop trials as a physiological measure to capture individual stopping latencies (prEMG). They provide an extensive overview of the measure in a large stop signal task data set, how it compares to traditional measures, how it relates to the assumptions underlying the horse-race model and its variability / reliability. In addition, it provides practical tips on how to collect the EMG data and to extract the partial responses. Overall, the data analysis is rigorous, and the conclusions are justified by the data. The main limitation of the approach is that partial responses were only detected on 23% of all successful stop trials. Previous literature has reported incidence of ~50%, but it remains a question whether this portion of the data is representative of all stopping behavior. The conclusion that the prEMG does not support the independent horse race model could have severe implications. It is not the first account of violations of the independence assumption of the model, which is widely used for the estimation of inhibition speed. It is vital to investigate the degree of violation in both response times and partial EMG responses under different task conditions to get an idea of the degree of the violation and its impact on the stopping latency estimations. I commend the efforts of the authors and would very much like the field to adopt the inclusion of these EMG recordings.</p><p>1. The percentage of successful stops with a partial EMG response seems to be quite low (~23%). In my own experience the percentage was more around 40 (with a choice reaction time version of the SST) to 50% (with an anticipated response version of the SST) (data associated with Leunissen et al. 2017 Eur J Neuroscience, unpublished). Also in the paper of Coxon et al. 2006 and Jana et al. 2020 the percentage seems to be quite a bit higher (for the latter even 67%). I wonder whether the focus on the go task (and not slowing down here) can explain these differences. The RTs reported in your experiment are fairly long. Providing more feedback on the go task might help to increase the percentage of successful stops with a partial response. This would be important for at least two reasons: it is unclear how well 23% of all successful stops represent stopping behavior. Moreover, most researchers do not present 216 stop trials, but rather only 80-100. Leaving one with only ~10 partial responses per participant. The willingness to adopt such a lengthy protocol in addition to the EMG might be low, therefore I think it would be good to reflect on this.</p><p>2. APB vs FDI: You report the partial EMG responses from a downwards thumb movement in the APB. Of course, this makes sense for this movement direction, but in my experience it is much easier to get a good signal to noise ratio in the EMG for the FDI (which would require and abduction of the index finger or a different hand position). See Coxon et al. 2006 J Neurophysiology Figure 1 and 3 for a comparison of the EMG traces of the APB and FDI. Having a better SNR might also help in identifying the partial responses in a greater number of trials.</p><p>3. You show a dependency between the go and stop process based on the EMG analyses. It might be of added value to check the level of dependency in the response times as well. For example based on the BEEST approach outlined by Dora Matzke in this pre-print (https://psyarxiv.com/9h3v7/). It would be interesting to see if there is agreement between the two approached with respect to the (lack) of independence. It would also be nice to be able to compare the RTs on unsuccessful stops and the fast go-RT portion (discussed on page 14, line 215 but not shown).</p><p>The conclusion that there is dependency between the go and stop process seems to hinge on the finding that the average EMG onset in unsuccessful stop trials was slower than the average EMG onset in fast go trials. Could a difference in power perhaps produce this result? You have many more go trials than unsuccessful stop trials, would the full distribution simply not have been sampled in the unsuccessful stop trials?</p><p>4. In my opinion the discussion could state a bit more clearly what the benefit of using the EMG peak latency on successful stop trials is compared to a parametric approach of analyzing the response times for example. Should it really be EMG or could one also simply use a force censor to obtain a similar measure? What are possible disadvantages of EMG? For example, in clinical populations one will find that the background EMG is much higher, making it more difficult to identify the partial responses.</p><p>5. I think it would be helpful to include a visualization of the stop signal task used.</p><p>6. Please include a figure that visualizes how the different latencies are determined.</p><p>7. Rise time is defined as EMG onset to peak latency. But peak latency was the time between the stop signal and the peak amplitude in the EMG, obviously there is no peak latency in go trials. Please redefine for clarity.</p><p>8. Motor time was longer in unsuccessful stop trials than in go trials. Was this true for all portions of go trials in the distribution? Response force on go trials tends to increase with the increasing likely hood of a stop signal appearing (i.e. participants wait and then respond very quickly and forcefully) (van den Wildenberg et al. 2003 Acta Psychol). Those trials might have a higher RT but a very short motor time.</p><p>9. Could the average areas under the curve be added to table 2? This would be helpful for understanding the analysis on the different dynamics of going and stopping.</p><p>10. Page 24, line 370-371. Comment regarding SSRT being associated with a speed-accuracy trade off suggests that this is (possibly) not the case for prEMG. Give that this speed-accuracy tradeoff reflects the strategic choices of the participant I assume that this should also be reflected in the (number, size, ...) of the prEMG.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70332.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

While this may well be the case, it also seems entirely possible that the observed reduction of the EMG is merely due to a cessation of the invigoration of the go-response by the motor system, which could happen entirely in the absence of inhibitory processing. Furthermore, alternatively, it could also reflect an initial subthreshold activation of the go response in those trials. At this point, as much as the authors (and others, including myself) may prefer it, there seems to be little evidence to favor the inhibition-based interpretation over the others – at least to me.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point. Importantly, it is not our goal to ‘sell’ prEMG as an unambiguous marker of response inhibition – we agree with the reviewer that there is no evidence for this. Yet, by definition, the decline of prEMG is a marker of stopping already initiated actions. Correspondingly, we recognize prEMG as an extremely useful tool, as it allows us to address whether action stopping is achieved by an active inhibitory process or other mechanisms in the brain. This is what motivated us to submit the manuscript in the ‘tools and methods’ section of the journal, not as a separate empirical finding.</p><p>We had addressed this point the original submission’s discussion in a section entitled ‘Outstanding question 1: Is prEMG peak latency a marker of individual inhibition capacity. Given that we changed the outline of the discussion, this point is now discussed in paragraph ‘Response inhibition and prEMG’ in the revised manuscript. As this point is critical to the interpretation of the prEMG, we have further elaborated on it in the introduction (lines 87-93), changed the title and abstract correspondingly, and screened the manuscript carefully for ambiguities in wording, so that in no place we would indicate that prEMG decline is a biomarker of inhibition as such.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Second, as the authors themselves note (to their credit), the correlation between prEMG and SSRT is only very moderate – as low as ~10% variance explained, depending on the study.

Interestingly, most individual studies consider this correlation as evidence for the prEMG latency and the SSRT to capture the same process, but at different time-points (at stages in the peripheral nervous system and at the behavioral level, respectively). The time-difference between the two also varies greatly between the studies but is typically ‘explained away’ by the electromechanical delay, that is the delay between muscle contraction/relaxation and behavioral response.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this across-study variability indicates weak evidence that the SSRT and the prEMG latency captures the same underlying process. However, we disagree that this somehow invalidates the prEMG measure.</p><p>The fact that the SSRT has been used as a benchmark stopping-measure is of course true, but it does not mean that one should dismiss new evidence suggesting that this approach is not as straight-forwards as it was believed to be. We find it counter-intuitive that a new measure should be rejected on the grounds that it does not fully correspond to an existing flawed measure. We have now added a paragraph directly discussing the interpretation of the prEMG and the SSRT (lines 431-465) and listed the advantages and disadvantages of the SSRT and prEMG in the conclusion (lines 552-561).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Third, while again I agree with the authors that SSRT has been the subject of recent (justified) criticism, I am not aware of the fact that anybody is arguing for abolishing it altogether.

We also do not propose that prEMG is inherently superior to the SSRT, precisely because we think they capture complementary aspects of stopping behavior. However, we do propose to re-evaluate the interpretation of the SSRT, as it has meanwhile been shown that it is not ‘un-ambiguous’ marker of stopping either (as the work by Matzke, Bisset et al. cited by the reviewer indicates). Whereas it is true that physiological raw signals are noisy, prEMG’s split-half reliability of 0.87 (and 0.92 in the replication dataset) for its peak latency showcases excellent reliability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Fourth, this leaves the single-trial argument, which I agree is quite compelling: SSRT is a compound measure, whereas prEMG carries some degree of single-trial information (though compared to the compound mean-prEMG measure, its single-trial reliability is more limited, as shown in the current study).

How much are we really gaining in terms of an 'overt' measure of the stopping process if it is only present in such a small subset of trials?</p></disp-quote><p>We approach this issue with an empirical and a theoretical argument.</p><p>Starting with the empirical: based on our experience with different response devices, we suspect that the low number of prEMG trials in this study was caused by a low resistance of the response device buttons, so that even minor thumb movements resulted in a button press. This may limit the generalizability of prEMG across studies, so we performed several extra analyses to gauge the extent of this issue.</p><p>1) First, we looked at the associations of the prEMG frequency with the goRT, SSRT, and the prEMG peak latency across participants in the current study (lines 162-177). We found a moderate negative correlation with the goRT, indicating that faster participants had more prEMG trials. The correlations of the prEMG detection frequency with the prEMG peak latency and SSRT were small and not significant. This is in context of a strong negative correlation between the goRT and the SSRT. As such, there is evidence for trade-off between fast going and slow stopping. This relationship seems to some degree affect prEMG frequency, but less so its latency, which supports the usability of the prEMG latency as a measure of action stopping.</p><p>2) Second, we quantified the same associations across studies via a meta-analysis (lines 178-194, 706-723, Figure 2). The strong negative association between goRT and the SSRT prevailed also across studies, as did the relationship between goRT and prEMG frequency. The prEMG peak latencies were relatively stable across different experiments and were not associated with prEMG detection frequency.</p><p>3) Third, this still leaves us with the question whether the psychometric properties of the prEMG, as quantified in the current sample, generalize to a sample with more prEMG trials. We therefore applied our pipeline to a previously published dataset from a different lab with ~60% of stop trials with prEMG (Jana et al. 2020 experiments 1 and 2; data available at https://osf.io/b2ng5/). Most of the results replicated and many of the trends were even more clearly visible in the replication dataset. The few instances that did not replicate are now reported in the manuscript (lines 149-161; 342-343). The full replication results are available in Appendix 1.</p><p>Now to the theoretical argument. The reviewer argues that the prEMG potentially does not reflect a ‘typical stop trial’. This implies that a ‘typical stop trial’ exists in the first place, reflecting the long tradition of conceptualizing stopping in the horse race model framework. The reviewer agrees that the horse race model assumptions are a limiting factor for the SSRT and mentions that corrections for the violation of its underlying assumptions exist for most cases. However, these correction methods rely on the removal of participants and/or trials that do not fit said assumptions, or the replacement of such non-typical trials based on further assumptions.</p><p>This inherently implies that there exists a ‘typical stop trial’ which uses the ‘correct’ inhibition process, while trials/participants that deviate from an expected pattern are simply discarded without any further explanation. Notably, this limits the applicability of the SSRT as well as its interpretation, as violations of the assumptions of the horse race model may be common in-patient groups.</p><p>With EMG, we can quantify the variability of stopping latencies across trials, impose trial classifications to address potential sub-processes of action stopping (e.g. by dissociating trials with and without prEMG, or trials in which EMG started before or after the stop signal etc.) and complement such analyses with other physiological measurements.</p><p>In addition, more elaborate task designs can be used to acquire even more information, e.g. on antagonist muscle movements (Atsma et al., 2018; Goonetilleke et al., 2010), partial errors in compound movements (Goonetilleke et al., 2012), or the contraction and relaxation times of different muscle groups (Havas et al., 2020). In sum, whether there exists a ‘typical stop-trial’ is an empirical question, and it is one that the prEMG can provide answers to.</p><p>We have now included a comprehensive discussion on the generalizability of the prEMG in the discussion (lines 467-524).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Fifth, the trial-wise variation of prEMG latency is quite considerable.

Given that we used Spearman’s rank-ordered correlations for the variability analysis, we were not concerned about the outliers affecting our results. In hindsight, this was not the best choice, as it indeed gives an impression of implausibly large variability across participants. We have now excluded 4 outliers who exceeded two inter-quartile ranges from the mean. (Note that one of these was already omitted in the original submission due to implausibly large standard deviation of the BEESTS-SSRT).

Instead, the decreased prEMG frequency at higher SSDs would result from the fact that it is more difficult to stop a response with a high SSD, thus many of these trials end up being classified as unsuccessful stop trials instead.

(2021) is an excellent demonstration of the usefulness of the EMG approach to study the neural mechanisms of inhibitory control. In the authors words “the current results are the first demonstration that this [prEMG] signature is not uniquely indicative of inhibitory control during action-stopping, but again common to all salient events, just like the CSE suppression. This is further in line with the assertion that the rapid invocation of inhibitory control is a stereotypic consequence of stimulus-driven attentional capture (Wessel and Aron, 2017).” We have now referenced this article as a good example for investigating mechanisms of cognitive control using EMG in the manuscript lines 521-523.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Finally, the theoretical framing of the paper seems a bit unclear to me.

We are conceptualizing prEMG as an independent measure of action stopping that is not bounded by the assumptions of the horse race model. However, we do acknowledge that previous research on inhibition heavily relied on the SSRT and the horse race model, and we are thus interested in comparing prEMG against the existing framework.

However, specifics in the task design that caused long goRTs may indeed also have contributed to the low number of prEMG trials.</p><p>We therefore investigated the association between the prEMG frequency and goRTs across the participants in our sample, as well as across different studies by a meta-analysis (lines 162-194; 706-723; Figure 2). Indeed, we found a negative relationship between the goRTs and the prEMG frequency, suggesting that shorter goRTs are associated with more prEMG trials (as hypothesized by the reviewer). This analysis suggests that specific task designs may help to increase the prEMG frequency (added in discussion lines 488-497). It would be particularly interesting to see whether the prEMG peak latency is in a similar range in tasks with less slowing, like the anticipated response task. While we know several studies that have analyzed the prEMG in this task, we are not aware that any of them have reported the prEMG latencies relative to the stop signal. Of note, most of the studies used in the meta-analysis had less stop trials available than in the current study, yet produced similar estimates of the prEMG peak latencies. Thus, lengthy protocols do not seem to be necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. APB vs FDI: You report the partial EMG responses from a downwards thumb movement in the APB. Of course, this makes sense for this movement direction, but in my experience it is much easier to get a good signal to noise ratio in the EMG for the FDI (which would require and abduction of the index finger or a different hand position). See Coxon et al. 2006 J Neurophysiology Figure 1 and 3 for a comparison of the EMG traces of the APB and FDI. Having a better SNR might also help in identifying the partial responses in a greater number of trials.</p></disp-quote><p>The meta-analysis indicates that about half of the prEMG-latency studies report EMG from the APB, while the rest reports from the FDI (or a combination of both). We have experienced that the signal to noise ratio is highly dependent on the movement direction and electrode placement. After some experimenting with both index finger (FDI) and thumbs (APB), we found better signal-to-noise ratio for thumbs in our setting, but we (and others) have also achieved good signal from FDI with different set-up and response device. We have now elaborated on the choice of the recorded muscle in Box 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. You show a dependency between the go and stop process based on the EMG analyses. It might be of added value to check the level of dependency in the response times as well. For example based on the BEEST approach outlined by Dora Matzke in this pre-print (https://psyarxiv.com/9h3v7/). It would be interesting to see if there is agreement between the two approached with respect to the (lack) of independence. It would also be nice to be able to compare the RTs on unsuccessful stops and the fast go-RT portion (discussed on page 14, line 215 but not shown).</p><p>The conclusion that there is dependency between the go and stop process seems to hinge on the finding that the average EMG onset in unsuccessful stop trials was slower than the average EMG onset in fast go trials. Could a difference in power perhaps produce this result? You have many more go trials than unsuccessful stop trials, would the full distribution simply not have been sampled in the unsuccessful stop trials?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reference to the procedure proposed by Matzke et. al., as this is an interesting addition to the context independence analysis. We ran the suggested analysis for the RT data and generalized it to the EMG data. (Note that for comparison with the EMG data, our analysis is based on the observed data instead of predictions based on BEESTS posterior parameters). The cumulative density functions (CDFs) and corresponding delta plots are visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. For the RT data, we found the expected fanning effect. This was also the case for EMG onsets comparing the unsuccessful stop trials and go trials. When we calculated CDFs for all stop trials with EMG combined (unsuccessful + successful trials with prEMG), this CDF was also leftwards from the go-CDF, showing a fanning effect at higher quantiles. When the CDFs were calculated separately for the successful stop trials with prEMG, the go trial CDF dominated the prEMG CDF in the lower quantiles, indicating distribution deviance between go and successful stop trials with prEMG at fast responses. Yet, this may be expected, as the stop trials with fast EMG onsets end up being unsuccessful stop trials, thus the prEMG distribution appears to be censored both at the left and right side.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Cumulative density functions (CDFs) and delta function for reaction time (RT; upper panels) and EMG data (lower panels).</title><p>X-axis (t) in CDF plots represents normalized response times, and the y-axis (F(t)) represents probability of obtaining a response time faster or equal to t. The delta functions represent the horizontal difference between the go and stop trial CDFs as a function of cumulative probability. The combined stop variables include unsuccessful and successful stop trials with prEMG. The shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals across participants. Note that successful stop (prEMG) CDF (lower left panel) is likely inaccurate at high t’s, due to very few available trials with slow EMG onsets.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70332-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>While we find this analysis very interesting, we decided against including it to the manuscript. This is because the theoretical predictions about the prEMG are not well worked out in this framework. Further, according to Matzke et. al., the observed CDFs may only detect severe violations compared with the BEESTS-based CDFs, but no modelling approach exists for the prEMG. Lastly, to explain this analysis sufficiently would lengthen the already dense results section considerably, whereas the results do not add much new information, as the results that are currently included already point to a similar conclusion - trials with prEMG seem to be those with medium response times. Critically, the context dependence test we had already included is more stringent than the one based on the CDFs, as it directly compares the equivalence of the corresponding observable proportions of the go and stop trial distributions. We have now included this test also for the RTs, as suggested by the reviewer (lines 254-259).</p><p>To assess whether differences in the sampling of EMG in unsuccessful stop and go trials could drive the reported EMG onset difference, we ran a control analysis. First, for each participant, we randomly drew a matching number of fast go and medium go trials (on average 105 fast trials, corresponding to the average number of unsuccessful stop trials, and 23 medium trials, corresponding to the average number of prEMG trials). Second, we did two paired t-tests: comparing the sub-sample of fast go trials with the unsuccessful stop trials, and medium go trials with the stop trials with prEMG. Third, we repeated this procedure 1000 times to obtain t- and p-value distribution. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, the t-values are always negative for the unsuccessful stop trials and positive for the prEMG trials, corresponding with the pattern reported in the main manuscript using all values. In addition, the p-values are below 0.05 every single time. In conclusion, we are confident that the results are not affected by the differences in sampling. This analysis is now references in lines 276-280.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70332-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In my opinion the discussion could state a bit more clearly what the benefit of using the EMG peak latency on successful stop trials is compared to a parametric approach of analyzing the response times for example. Should it really be EMG or could one also simply use a force censor to obtain a similar measure? What are possible disadvantages of EMG? For example, in clinical populations one will find that the background EMG is much higher, making it more difficult to identify the partial responses.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. We do think that other parametric approaches are viable options as well, but we chose not to dwell on this point not to diverge from the main message about EMG properties. We have now indicated that alternative parametric approaches, such as force sensors, may outperform EMG in some contexts (e.g., in certain clinical populations), if properly validated (lines 493-497).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. I think it would be helpful to include a visualization of the stop signal task used.</p><p>6. Please include a figure that visualizes how the different latencies are determined.</p></disp-quote><p>These are now depicted in Figure 1 and Box 2 for point 5 and 6, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Rise time is defined as EMG onset to peak latency. But peak latency was the time between the stop signal and the peak amplitude in the EMG, obviously there is no peak latency in go trials. Please redefine for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified that for the rise time calculation, the onset and peak latency are extracted relative to the same signal, i.e. go signal (line 143 and Table 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Motor time was longer in unsuccessful stop trials than in go trials. Was this true for all portions of go trials in the distribution? Response force on go trials tends to increase with the increasing likely hood of a stop signal appearing (i.e. participants wait and then respond very quickly and forcefully) (van den Wildenberg et al. 2003 Acta Psychol). Those trials might have a higher RT but a very short motor time.</p></disp-quote><p>That is an interesting observation and merits further investigation. The appropriate analysis would then be to test the equivalence of motor times in fast go trials and unsuccessful stop trials. We calculated the motor times for the three parts of the go-RT distribution, as outlined in the section of contextual independence testing. In contrast to the reviewer’s prediction, we found increasing motor times with increasing RTs, and that slow go trial motor times roughly correspond to unsuccessful stop motor times. We added this analysis to the manuscript (lines 145-161), but avoided too much speculation on the implications, as the replication analysis on a different dataset showed slight deviation from the overall pattern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Could the average areas under the curve be added to table 2? This would be helpful for understanding the analysis on the different dynamics of going and stopping.</p></disp-quote><p>These have now been added to the table 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Page 24, line 370-371. Comment regarding SSRT being associated with a speed-accuracy trade off suggests that this is (possibly) not the case for prEMG. Give that this speed-accuracy tradeoff reflects the strategic choices of the participant I assume that this should also be reflected in the (number, size, ...) of the prEMG.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, there is evidence for some sort of trade-off between going and stopping. Previously, we mentioned trade-off between fast going and accurate stopping based on previous literature. Here, we do not actually look at stopping accuracies, but do find evidence for a trade-off between fast going and slow stopping, or vice versa. Interestingly, this appears to strongly affect the SSRTs and prEMG detection frequency, but to a lesser degree prEMG peak latency. The correlation analysis is reported on lines 171-177, 184-187, and we have briefly included it in the discussion lines 456-462.</p><p>References</p><p>Atsma J, Maij F, Gu C, Medendorp WP, Corneil BD. 2018.
