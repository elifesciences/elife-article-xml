brain aging includes structural defects of intracortical myelin that are associated with secondary neuroinflammation. A similar pathology is seen in specific myelin mutant mice that model ‘advanced brain aging’ and exhibit a range of behavioral abnormalities. However, the cognitive assessment of these mutants is problematic because myelin-dependent motor-sensory functions are required for quantitative behavioral readouts. To better understand the role of cortical myelin integrity for higher brain functions, we generated mice lacking <italic>Plp1</italic>, encoding the major integral myelin membrane protein, selectively in ventricular zone stem cells of the mouse forebrain. In contrast to conventional <italic>Plp1</italic> null mutants, subtle myelin defects were restricted to the cortex, hippocampus, and underlying callosal tracts. Moreover, forebrain-specific <italic>Plp1</italic> mutants exhibited no defects of basic motor-sensory performance at any age tested. Surprisingly, several behavioral alterations reported for conventional <italic>Plp1</italic> null mice (Gould et al., 2018) were absent and even social interactions appeared normal. However, with novel behavioral paradigms, we determined catatonia-like symptoms and isolated executive dysfunction in both genders. This suggests that loss of myelin integrity has an impact on cortical connectivity and underlies specific defects of executive function. These observations are likewise relevant for human neuropsychiatric conditions and other myelin-related diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myelin</kwd><kwd>mouse mutant</kwd><kwd>oligodendrocytes</kwd><kwd>glia function</kwd><kwd>disease model</kwd><kwd>executive functions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WE 2720/4-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Werner</surname><given-names>Hauke B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WE 2720/5-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Werner</surname><given-names>Hauke B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR274</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ehrenreich</surname><given-names>Hannelore</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005984</institution-id><institution>Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

The formation and preservation of healthy myelin is a prerequisite for normal motor and sensory functions, as indicated by human myelin diseases and their corresponding mouse models, which have been studied in more detail at the molecular and cellular level. The severe developmental defects of myelination that affect children at a young age are dominated by the lack of motor development and severe neurological defects, often leading to premature death. Only milder perturbations of myelination make the associated delays of cognitive development obvious, but they are still masked by severe neurological impairments. Some demyelinating diseases of adult onset are degenerative in nature and begin with psychiatric symptoms, including psychosis, such as in metachromatic leukodystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumann et al., 2002</xref>). Indeed, there is increasing evidence of oligodendrocyte and white matter defects in a range of neuropsychiatric diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nave and Ehrenreich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, advanced brain aging in healthy individuals is associated with subtle myelin defects, as first demonstrated by electron microscopy in aged non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peters and Sethares, 2002</xref>). This raises the question whether structural myelin abnormalities play a role in age-dependent cognitive decline.</p><p>In psychiatric patients, it is difficult to decide whether the correlation of MRI detectable white matter abnormalities or the ultrastructural loss of myelin integrity are the cause or effect of (age-dependent) neuronal dysfunctions, or even caused by long-term pharmacological interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nave and Ehrenreich, 2014</xref>). Thus, novel genetic animal models are required to define the role of oligodendrocytes and subtle myelin defects as an underlying cause of a psychiatric phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hagemeyer et al., 2012</xref>). Unfortunately, the cognitive testing of mice depends on quantitative behavioral readouts which are affected by subcortical and myelin-dependent motor-sensory functions.</p><p>An entire range of myelin abnormalities with a corresponding wide spectrum of clinical defects characterizes mutations of the proteolipid protein gene (<italic>PLP1/Plp1</italic>). The X-linked gene is highly expressed in oligodendrocytes and encodes a tetraspan membrane protein of CNS myelin (PLP) along with a minor splice isoform, termed DM20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jahn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Milner et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nave et al., 1987</xref>). At one end of the disease spectrum, <italic>PLP1</italic> mutations cause the expression of misfolded proteins that trigger oligodendroglial ER stress, apoptosis, hypomyelination, and connatal leukodystrophy (Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease) with premature death in children and corresponding mouse mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nave and Boespflug-Tanguy, 1996</xref>). At the other end, the mere loss-of-function (null) mutations of <italic>PLP1</italic>, such as by a genomic deletion or in <italic>Plp1</italic> null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klugmann et al., 1997</xref>), cause late onset neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griffiths et al., 1998</xref>), modeling spastic paraplegia type 2 (SPG2) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Inoue, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saugier-Veber et al., 1994</xref>). The isolated loss of axonal integrity in the presence of myelin led to the concept that oligodendrocytes not only facilitate impulse propagation but also maintain the axonal integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griffiths et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nave, 2010</xref>). The latter includes glycolytic support of axonal energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fünfschilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2012</xref>) and most likely other cellular interactions, such as anti-oxidant defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukherjee et al., 2020</xref>) via secretion of extracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frühbeis et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Loss of myelin integrity and axonal degeneration are invariably associated with secondary neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kassmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lappe-Siefke et al., 2003</xref>). Recently, we discovered in different myelin mutant mice that microgliosis causes a unique behavioral phenotype: when mice were placed onto a horizontal bar with their forepaws, wildtype (WT) animals turn away within 0.2 s, whereas these mutants exhibit longer response times. We hypothesized that this delay reflects the loss of higher brain (executive) functions rather than a motor impairment. Strikingly, these ‘catatonic signs’ were completely lost following the targeted pharmacological depletion of microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janova et al., 2018</xref>). In an independent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gould et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>Plp1</italic> null mice showed defects in the ‘puzzle box’ paradigm, which measures the escape latency from a brightly lit open space into a shelter via a mechanically blocked entry. Successfully overcoming these obstacles is also considered an ‘executive function’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben Abdallah et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gould et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Connor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pease-Raissi and Chan, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Human catatonia and the loss of executive functions may result from defects in the frontal lobes and its underlying white matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arora and Praharaj, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Northoff et al., 2004</xref>), but experimental evidence is lacking. To test whether executive functions are specifically dependent on forebrain integrity, we targeted the floxed <italic>Plp1</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lüders et al., 2017</xref>) in mice expressing Cre under control of the <italic>Emx1</italic> promoter in ventricular zone stem cells giving rise to neurons and glial cells in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gorski et al., 2002</xref>). When applying a large battery of behavioral tests on adult mutants of both sexes, we found impaired executive functions at adult ages, coinciding with well-known histopathological signs of advanced white matter aging. Surprisingly, this was in the presence of unchanged motor-sensory performance, memory functions, and social behavior. Our genetic data are thus in strong support of the hypothesis that the integrity of myelinated fibers in the forebrain is critical for isolated aspects of executive functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Targeting PLP expression in the mouse forebrain</title><p>We crossbred mice harboring a floxed <italic>Plp1</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lüders et al., 2017</xref>) with mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the <italic>Emx1</italic> promoter (<italic>Emx<sup>IRESCre</sup></italic> mice; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gorski et al., 2002</xref>), yielding experimental male (<italic>Plp<sup>flox/Y</sup>*Emx<sup>IREScre</sup></italic>) and female (<italic>Plp<sup>flox/flox</sup>*Emx<sup>IREScre</sup></italic>) mice, termed forebrain PLP cKO in the following, as well as male <italic>Plp<sup>flox/Y</sup></italic> and female <italic>Plp<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice as controls (controls) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We detected substantial loss of PLP-immunopositive cells in the corpus callosum and in cortical areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B’</xref>). We validated these findings by performing light-sheet microscopy (LSM) in thick (1 mm) sagittal brain slices. Also here, only sparse PLP-immunolabeling was detected in cortical areas, the corpus callosum, and hippocampus. Expectedly, in the striatum which does not belong to the <italic>Emx<sup>IRESCre</sup></italic> recombination territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gorski et al., 2002</xref>), we did not find a considerable reduction of PLP staining. Also, the mid- and hindbrain as well as the cerebellum showed normal PLP labeling, comparable to control brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>The detection of a small number of PLP-positive cells in the forebrain could indicate that recombination efficacy did not reach 100%. Alternatively, WT OPCs/oligodendrocytes from adjacent non-recombined regions could have migrated to these areas. Indeed, we observed a ventral-dorsal gradient of PLP-immunopositivity in the corpus callosum with ventral axons that directly overlie the non-recombined striatum having considerable amounts of PLP+myelin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> closeup).</p><p>Confirming our image-based analysis, PLP/DM20 was hardly detectable by immunoblots of prefrontal cortical lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Using the cerebellum as a control region that lacks Emx-Cre expression, the abundance of PLP/DM20 did, again, not differ between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>We next investigated myelin integrity in the forebrain in PLP conditional knockout (cKO) mice by performing MBP and PLP colabeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). While on first sight overall MBP labeling appeared similar between PLP cKO and control animals in both recombined and non-recombined areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), close inspection of the upper cortical layers in the medial forebrain of PLP cKO mice revealed a loss of MBP+fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Quantifications confirmed this local loss of myelin profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Forebrain PLP cKO mice show restricted neuropathology and inflammation in forebrain white matter tracts</title><p>Conventional <italic>Plp1</italic> null mutant mice that lack PLP expression in all cells show widespread micro- and astrogliosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Monasterio-Schrader et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griffiths et al., 1998</xref>), presumably triggered by progressive axonopathy and/or oligodendroglial stress signals. We investigated PLP cKO and control brains for signs of microgliosis and astrogliosis by IBA1 and GFAP fluorescent immunolabeling, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). We observed significant increases in the area immunopositive for IBA1 and GFAP in the corpus callosum as the primary white matter tract targeted by <italic>Emx<sup>IRESCre</sup></italic> but not in the striatum as a non-recombined white matter region. Surprisingly, cortical areas that were efficiently recombined in <italic>Emx<sup>IRESCre</sup></italic> animals did not show robust gliosis. We validated these findings by performing classical 3,3’-diaminobenzidine-immunohistochemistry for IBA1, MAC3, and GFAP in the fimbria, corpus callosum, and prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

forebrain-specific mutants remained free of motor impairments at any age. On the rotarod, the latency to fall did not differ between cKO and control mice at 6 and 17 months of age, also when quantified separately for males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Exclusively in our test setup, the ‘bar test’ was included and repeatedly performed in which mice were placed with their forelimbs against a horizontally held rod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hagemeyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Poggi et al., 2016</xref>). Here, adult forebrain PLP cKO mice showed an extended response time, in which the apparent immobility constitutes a ‘catatonia-like’ feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Placed into the brightly lit area of an open arena, the latency to reach entry into a ‘safe box’ was monitored, but made increasingly difficult by a series of camouflaging tools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). When assessed at the age of 20 months, both male and female forebrain PLP cKO mice exhibited significant delays compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>We additionally found performance differences of forebrain PLP cKO mice in an adapted ‘hurdle test’ that measures ‘executive function’. Mice were placed into the middle of a 120 cm round open field that was divided into squares (5 cm × 5 cm), separated from each other by 5 cm ‘hurdles’, but 2.3 cm higher than in our previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia-Agudo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We measured the time it took forebrain PLP cKO mice and controls to reach the periphery of this arena. Since motor performance was not affected, a longer than normal latency reflects a reduced goal-directed orientation toward the periphery, an executive psychomotor function, perhaps together with dampened motivational force. While behaving normally at age 6 months, when analyzed at the age of 20 months, male PLP cKO mice required more time to reach the periphery in two of two trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Female PLP cKO mice displayed the longer delay already at the age of 6 months, but when tested again at 20 months only with a non-significant trend (p=0.08). This demonstrates contributory effects of both, sex and age, in this paradigm. Interestingly, in subsequent trials (i.e. comparing time points T1 and T2 for each age group), mutant mice often lost this abnormal delay, which confirms an abnormal executive function rather than an underlying motor impairment.</p><p>Finally, we assessed the performance of PLP cKO and control mice at advanced age (23 months) on the ‘complex running wheel’ (CRW), a paradigm testing cortical motor learning that involves myelinating oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McKenzie et al., 2014</xref>). Both female and male groups displayed reduced total running distance and times (male total time analysis p=0.056) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). Since the maximal and average running velocities did not differ between cKO and control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>), this performance difference likely reflects a reduced drive rather than altered motor learning. This would be in accordance with the reduced executive function in the puzzle box and hurdle test.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Forebrain proteolipid protein (PLP) conditional knockout (cKO) mice display reduced running distance but normal velocity in the complex running wheel (CRW) paradigm.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental setup to study voluntary running behavior and motor skill learning in the CRW.

We have shown that PLP, which provides structural stability to compact myelin, also stabilizes the architecture of the ‘myelinic channel system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steyer et al., 2020</xref>). The latter is a cytosolic space that connects the oligodendroglial cell body with the peri-axonal myelin compartment that contains transporters involved in axonal metabolic support. We could further show that conventional <italic>Plp1</italic> KO mice, which are well myelinated, exhibit lower ATP levels in axons of the optic nerves compared to controls, when analyzed with transgenically expressed metabolic sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Trevisiol et al., 2020</xref>). This makes it likely that conduction blocks, axonal swellings, and neurodegeneration are caused by perturbed axonal energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fünfschilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saab et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trevisiol et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, axonal degeneration leads to secondary neuroinflammation. We note that other myelin mutants, such as <italic>Cnp</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lappe-Siefke et al., 2003</xref>), exhibit an even earlier onset of axonal pathology that virtually coincides with the onset of gliosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edgar and Nave, 2009</xref>). This raises the possibility that inflammation in myelinated tracts is a more general response of resident microglia to oligodendrocyte dysfunctions, possibly reflecting the failure to deliver lactate to the axonal compartment and its release into the extracellular space. It is this secondary neuroinflammation that contributes to reversible catatonic signs in myelin mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janova et al., 2018</xref>) and that can now be defined as a clinical feature of forebrain-specific white matter disturbance.</p><p>Theoretically, the specific behavioral defects of <italic>Plp1</italic> cKO mice could be caused by (1) the moderate decrease of the axonal conduction velocity that was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gould et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gutiérrez et al., 1995</xref>), (2) the progressive axonopathy that is caused by energy deficits and is likely preceded by conduction blocks in fiber tracts that appear morphologically intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Trevisiol et al., 2020</xref>), (3) the secondary gliosis, as also documented for <italic>Cnp</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia-Agudo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janova et al., 2018</xref>), another mutant with structural abnormalities of myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lappe-Siefke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Snaidero et al., 2017</xref>), or (4) any combination hereof. The age-dependent increase of symptom severity suggests that the responsible mechanisms include progressive myelin-dependent axonopathy (with conduction blocks) plus neuroinflammation rather than subtle conduction delays. That is in agreement with the ‘rescue’ of the catatonic signs, which we consider a readout of reduced executive functions, in Cnp mutant mice by microglial depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janova et al., 2018</xref>). We also note that reduced conduction velocity by itself has little impact on cortical processing, as we have shown for auditory signals in <italic>shiverer</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>With respect to CNS regions, the present work further uncouples the role of myelinated tracts for basic motor performance and executive functions. Conventional PLP KO mice exhibit first behavioral abnormalities at the age of 3 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gould et al., 2018</xref>), that is, before the impairment of motor performance that we had initially determined by rotarod experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griffiths et al., 1998</xref>). Here, we show in PLP cKO mice that the forebrain-specific loss of axon-myelin integrity impairs selectively executive functions that require the multimodal integration of cortical processing upstream of any motor output. Motor performance itself was spared at any age tested. Also olfactory and thalamic input as well as emotionally relevant input into (and from) the amygdala should be less affected in forebrain PLP cKOs, which could explain different behaviors of conventional PLP KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gould et al., 2018</xref>). The principle finding that PLP-dependent processes affecting myelin and axonal integrity in the forebrain cause the impairment of executive functions is relevant to higher brain functions known to be affected across psychiatric diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse model</title><p>To delete the <italic>Plp1</italic> gene in the forebrain we interbred <italic>Plp<sup>flox</sup></italic> mice in which exon 3 of the <italic>Plp1</italic> gene is flanked by loxP sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lüders et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lüders et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) with mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the <italic>Emx1</italic> gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gorski et al., 2002</xref>) on C57Bl/6N background.

Social preference was tested on the last day by connecting two social boxes to the left and right side of the cages. Connection of the boxes was carried out via plastic tubes equipped with two-ring RFID antennas, which monitored entrance and exit of individual mice to each box. Initially, both boxes were filled with fresh bedding and animals were allowed to freely explore for a 1 hr habituation. Subsequently, used bedding containing pheromones of male C3H mice was added to one of the boxes and the time spent in the pheromone vs. non-pheromone box was recorded for another hour.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cognitive flexibility, episodic-like memory, and anhedonia</title><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>IntelliCage-based behavioral phenotyping battery</title><p>By application of our IntelliCage-based behavioral phenotyping design, we assessed multiple facets of cognition as well as sucrose preference, as measure of anhedonia, in female mice only, at age 6 months as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dere et al., 2014</xref>). One day after subcutaneous implantation of transponders (see above), mice were group-housed, separated by genotype, and remained in the IntelliCages for 6 days. Place learning was acquired within the first 24 hr (day 1), in which an individual mouse learned that only one out of four corners was rewarded with water, while the other corners remained blocked. The number of mice assigned to each corner was balanced and semi-randomly determined. On day 2, reversal learning was assessed to measure cognitive flexibility as well as perseveration. Mice had to learn that the previously rewarded corner was now blocked, and instead the diametrically opposed corner now rewarded. Sucrose preference was assessed on day 3 by comparing preference for a corner rewarded with a 2% sucrose solution over another corner rewarded with tap water. During these 24 hr, the two previously blocked corners were now rewarded with either sucrose solution or tap water, whereas the remaining corners were blocked. The visits to the respective target corners during place and reversal learning as well as sucrose preference testing were used for statistical analysis. On days 4–5 mice had again access to two rewarding corners providing either a sucrose solution or tap water. However, these corners were now again the diametrically opposed corners to day 3 and access to the corners was only provided for a limited time, namely during the first 2 hr of the active phase of the mice (6–8 PM). Hence, mice were required to form a multimodal association containing the information on the type of reward provided (<italic>what</italic>) as well as their locations (<italic>where</italic>) and the time at which to expect the reward (<italic>when</italic>), rendering this approach an experimental model for the assessment of episodic memory comparably to humans. Visits to rewarded corners during acquisition (day 4) and retrieval (day 5) of episodic-like memory were recorded and the delta between visits to the corner providing sucrose solution and the corner providing tap water was calculated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Spatial memory and learning</title><sec id="s4-11-1"><title>Morris water maze</title><p>Spatial memory as well as cognitive flexibility and perseveration, via reversal learning, were evaluated in male and female mice at the age of 19 or 13 months, respectively, using the MWM task. The test was conducted as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dere et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Netrakanti et al., 2015</xref>). Mice were tested within a circular tank (diameter 1.2 m and depth 0.6 m) filled with opaque water (25±1°C) in various successive phases, starting with 2 days of cued platform training as described above (see: vision). Subsequently, the blue flag cue was detached from the escape platform (10 cm × 10 cm), which was submerged 1 cm below the water surface and relocated within the tank, and mice were tested for 8 days during hidden platform training. Throughout these days mice had to form a spatial memory for the escape platform using various extra-maze cues placed on the walls of the testing room. During all training phases mice were tested in four daily trials with an ITI of 5 min and the individual performances were recorded with a video-tracking system (Viewer3, Biobserve GmbH, Bonn, Germany) for subsequent analysis. Training was followed by a probe test to assess spatial memory and the time spent in the target quadrant of the maze as well as visits and the latency to the target quadrant were used for statistical analysis. Moreover, total distance swam and the average swimming velocity were analyzed, to exclude potential motor deficits. Finally, mice were exposed to 4 days of reversal training, in which the only difference to the hidden platform training was that the escape platform was relocated into a new quadrant of the tank. Reversal training was followed by another probe trial, wherein the same parameters were determined as in the first probe test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Working memory</title><sec id="s4-12-1"><title>Y maze continuous alternation</title><p>Spontaneous alternation was assessed in male and female mice of 20 months age, in a Y-shaped maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dere et al., 2014</xref>). Mice were individually placed into the center of a triangle-shaped maze with three identical open arms (7.5 cm × 18 cm × 23.5 cm) and allowed to freely explore the maze for a total of 5 min. Performance of all mice including total number of arm entries, defined as entering with all four paws, was recorded with a video-tracking system (Viewer3, Biobserve GmbH, Bonn, Germany). An alternation ratio, defined as the number of alternating triplets multiplied by 100 and divided by the total number of entries, was calculated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Catatonic signs and executive function</title><sec id="s4-13-1"><title>Bar test</title><p>Catatonic signs were assessed at various ages ranging from 2 to 21 months in male and 2 to 22 months in female mice. The bar test was conducted as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia-Agudo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janova et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, mice were gently carried by the tail and brought into proximity of a horizontal bar made of stainless steel. Upon grasping the bar with both forepaws and standing upright, the tail was released. Mice were tested in two consecutive trials, which were recorded with a high-resolution camcorder (Sony HDR-CX405, Sony, Tokyo, Japan) and the time spent immobile at the bar (s) was determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-2"><title>Modified hurdle test</title><p>The hurdle test is a novel tool to measure executive dysfunction in catatonia-like syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia-Agudo et al., 2019</xref>). The test setup comprises a circular open field arena containing a polyvinylchloride comb inset (119 cm diameter), made of equally built (10 cm × 10 cm) connected combs, and 140 lux light intensity at the center of the arena, to motivate mice to move to the periphery. We applied minor modifications to the previously reported setup, by increasing the height of the connected combs from 2.7 cm to now 5.0 cm and adding fresh woodchip bedding into each comb. These modifications were applied, to increase the challenge, while simultaneously reducing aversive responses to the novel environment upon introduction of bedding as a familiar and comfortable texture. The experiment was conducted in male and female mice at age 6 and 20 months, respectively, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia-Agudo et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, mice were placed into the center of the above-mentioned inset and their performance until reaching the periphery or the cut-off time of 5 min, was recorded using the Viewer 3 tracking software (Biobserve GmbH, Bonn, Germany). All mice were tested in two consecutive trials with a 5 min ITI. Executive performance was assessed by calculating the ratio of latency to periphery (s) divided by the number of crossed hurdles (#). To account for animals that did not overcome any hurdle, we calculated the ratio as [(s)/(#+1)].</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-3"><title>Puzzle box</title><p>As an additional test assessing executive function, the puzzle box was conducted on male and female mice at age 20 months, respectively. We employed the test as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Connor et al., 2014</xref>) with minor modifications. The experimental setup comprises a rectangular-shaped arena (75 cm × 28 cm × 25 cm) split into an enclosed shelter (15 cm × 28 cm) and an illuminated (140 lux) open compartment (60 cm × 28 cm). The compartments are connected to each other via a small doorway, centered at the front wall of the shelter (4 cm width), through which mice can escape into the shelter upon placement into the open compartment. Over a course of 5 consecutive days, mice were required to overcome a total of five challenges of increasing difficulty, within a limited amount of time, to reach the shelter. We employed the following challenges: (1) open doorway, (2) gateway within doorway, (3) gateway filled with bedding, (4) plug made of paper tissue, (5) plug made of nesting material (shredded cardboard paper). Each mouse was tested in a total of three trials per day, in which mice were exposed to two different challenges daily. During the first trial on each day, mice were exposed to the challenge they had to overcome last on the day before, whereas the following two trials measured escape latencies upon introduction of a novel unfamiliar challenge. Exceptions to this approach were the very first trial on day 1 (open entry), which was tested only this one time, and day 5, since mice were tested only once with the most difficult challenge (plug made of nesting material) on day 5. Cut-off time was increased from 4 to 6 min during challenges 4 and 5, to provide sufficient time for mice to be able to unplug the doorway into the shelter. Performance of each mouse was recorded with a video-tracking system (Viewer3, Biobserve GmbH, Bonn, Germany) and averaged escape latency for each challenge measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-4"><title>Complex wheel running</title><p>Overnight voluntary CRW was conducted at age 23 months, as an additional measure of both drive and motor-cognitive performance. Mice of both genotypes and genders were single-housed and exposed to CRW (TSE Systems, Bad Homburg, Germany) for 24 hr. Placement of mice into the respective CRW cages was carried out in the morning (8–9 AM) allowing the mice to familiarize themselves with the novel environment throughout the day. CRW are defined by randomly omitted bars, providing a motor-cognitive and coordinatory challenge. Voluntary running on CRW was recorded automatically (Phenomaster software, TSE Systems, Bad Homburg, Germany) yielding information on time spent running (min), total distance run (cm), and running velocity (cm/min). Analysis of CRW performance was conducted over 12 hr during the active phase (lights off from 7 PM to 7 AM).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Computation of an appropriate sample size for this study was carried out via G*Power software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faul et al., 2007</xref>) based on the following statistical requirements and assumptions: α-error 0.05, β-error 0.085, statistical effect size 1.000, based on previous IntelliCage-based experiments in our lab. We chose the IntelliCage-based assay serving as a crucial limiting experiment, due to the high cognitive demand of the setup (see also: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dere et al., 2018</xref>). Mice of both genders (male/female) and both genotypes (control/conditional mutant) were used, with each mouse being a biological replicate in each assay.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0. Between-group comparisons were made by either one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures or t-test for independent samples. Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon tests were used if the normality assumption was violated (as assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Data presented in the figures and text are expressed as mean ± SEM; p-values &lt;0.05 were considered significant. Statistical outliers were assessed using the GraphPad Grubbs outlier tool, but no such outliers had to be removed from the data. Only mice of any gender or genotype that did not perform in an experiment were excluded from statistical analyses.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Supervision, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the German animal protection law (TierSchG) and approved by the Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (LAVES) License numbers were 33.19-42502-04-15/1833 and 33.19-42502-04-18/2803.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-70792-transrepform1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata1"><label>Source data 1.</label><caption><title>Source data on all displayed figures and graphs.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-70792-data1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Raw data for the graphs and the western blot is provided in the Source Data files.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank A Fahrenholz and R Jung for technical support, E-M Krämer-Albers for antibodies and the International Max Planck Research School for Genome Science (IMPRS-GS) for supporting SBS.

This work provides the field with a novel and important tool to begin to appreciate regional differences in myelination in relation to executive cognitive functioning that has broad implications in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders. While the study provides interesting evidence of pathology associated with forebrain and oligodendrocyte-specific Plp1 mutant mice, the work is largely descriptive and fails to provide in-depth insight regarding myelin microstructural changes, in particular assessment of myelin sheath thickness, compaction, or nodal changes. A more thorough histological analysis of changes in myelin integrity at earlier developmental time points would add a baseline comparison and further support to the authors' claims of aging-specific deficits. The authors speculate about the possible mechanisms that would explain the phenotypic changes associated with PLP1 depletion of forebrain oligodendrocytes, but they do not test any of these hypotheses. They identify markers of advanced aging in forebrain-specific and oligodendrocyte-specific Plp1 knockouts, such as increased APP spheroids and neuroinflammation, but do not provide a convincing causal relationship between these neuropathological findings and the subsequent deficiencies in myelin integrity.</p><p>– While the goal of the work is directly related to myelin structure and function, the authors fail to provide thorough and localized analysis of myelin in the mutant mice. Are there changes in the expression of other myelin proteins beside PLP and MBP? What is the g-ratio in these regions (using TEM)? The authors leave a great deal to speculation, especially as Figure 1 contains only qualitative data.</p><p>– The authors claim that Plp1 expression is restricted to oligodendrocytes and therefore, the phenotypic differences observed in the conditional knock out mice are caused by the PLP-deficient oligodendrocytes. However, in accordance with another paper by this group published in 2017 and research done by other groups, PLP is not only expressed by oligodendrocytes. Adding a control experiment with a higher magnification colocalization between a neuronal marker and PLP would be needed to assess PLP expression changes in forebrain neurons.</p><p>– The presence of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative markers in mutant mice is interesting, but the authors fail to explain how the forebrain and oligodendrocyte-specific deficits in Plp1 are related to these findings? Is this a cause or consequence of changes in region-specific myelin?</p><p>– The authors emphasize the age-related phenotype and the generation of a new model to study myelin alteration specifically in aged mice, but they do not show any analysis of histology or neuropathology in young adults to claim the phenotype is only seen is aged mice. A histological analysis of young adult brains would be needed to compare phenotypes between ages and claim an age-dependent phenotype. Multiple assessment timepoints are needed here to identify the neurodegenerative onset related to temporal changes in the PLP expression profile.</p><p>– The title of the paper that emphasizes the role of age in the catatonia-executive dysfunction phenotype is not justified by the experiments and the results. First, the authors show catatonia dysfunction in young adults starting at 3 and 5 months in females and males, respectively (Figure 3A,B). Moreover, of the tests performed to evaluate executive function, only 1 was conducted in both young and aged adults (Figure 3E,F). In this particular executive test in which the effect of the age is analyzed, the authors show that males present executive dysfunction when aged, but females exhibit deficit at 6 months but not 20 months. I suggest changing the title and eliminating the emphases of age-related phenotype unless a consistent evaluation and finding of aged-specific changes can be confirmed.</p><p>– I greatly appreciate that the authors broke down behavior based on biological sex and applaud them for taking this important variable into consideration. The authors could strengthen their analyses by including this variable in their histological assessment as they have in their behavioral analyses. As is, the paper shows no analysis of neuropathology or histology in females, even if they indicate in statistical methodology that mice of both sexes were used. Considering Plp is an X-linked gene and that the authors show sexual dimorphism in executive function, adding histological analysis in females would be needed to reach the author's conclusions.</p><p>– As a point of consideration, changes in motor function have been identified in a model of increased myelination specific to the cortico-callosal projections in the corpus callosum and not the cortico-fugal projections (Gibson et al. 2014). As one of the key points of this manuscript is the development of a model in which changes in myelination occur only in the forebrain, including the corpus callosum, in order to isolate executive functioning from motor functioning, how does one reconcile that changes in motor function have been characterized with only changes in the corpus callosum and not cerebellum or spinal cord regions as identified in Gibson et al. 2014. This may be worth discussing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The results are clearly presented and the experimental strategy is powerful. The inclusion of data on the complex running wheel used by other authors to study the effects of loss of oligodendrocyte generation was a nice addition, as the lack of phenotype on the wheel due to the conditional knockout enables an interesting comparison with the results of other laboratories.</p><p>A significant weakness, though, is that the authors have not distinguished the effects of loss of myelin integrity and inflammation. As they showed beautifully in a recent JCI paper, inhibiting inflammation using a drug (PLX5622) administered in the chow can ameliorate phenotypes thought to be due directly to myelin loss. Although the results presented here are very important and represent a significant step in our understanding of myelin functions, the paper would certainly be stronger if this additional experiment had been performed so as to tease apart the direct and indirect effects of PLP loss.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Myelin-axon alterations can cause neuronal/axonal dysfunction and neurological disability. The best examples of this are rodent studies that alter myelin protein content without causing demyelination. The best studied example is deletion of the major CNS myelin protein proteolipid protein (PLP). PLP deletions cause a late onset neurodegeneration modelling human spastic paraplegia type 2. Studies of the global PLP deletion has focused on motor disability. These and other studies have led to the concept that myelin maintains axonal integrity. This manuscript asks the question of whether loss of myelin integrity in the forebrain has behavioral consequences. PLP was selectively removed from ventricular zone stem cells of the mouse forebrain. This resulted in an absence of PLP in oligodendrocytes in the prefrontal cortex, corpus callosum and hippocampal fimbria. This data is convincing and well-documented. These mice showed normal motor function and no evidence of spasticity. In contrast, the mice showed late onset deficits in executive function and displayed catatonic-like symptoms. There are two major strengths to this paper. The site specific deletion of PLP from ventricular zone stem cells using the EMZ promotor and the sophisticated behavioral testing.</p><p>A major impact of this paper relate to the role of myelin-axon integrity in ageing. Subtle changes in cortical myelin have been described in the aged primate cortex. MRI abnormalities have also been found in myelinated periventricular white matter in individuals with mild cognitive impairment and individuals with multiple sclerosis. The concept that the axonal dysfunction can be caused by subtle changes in myelin composition therefore are likely to be of clinical importance.</p><p>Pathological characterization was sufficient to support the author's conclusions that axonal integrity is compromised in CNS regions that harbor the EMZ driven PLP KO. The use of light sheet microscopy to chart the distribution of PLP-positive oligodendrocytes is impressive. Can some comment be made about the consistency of this data? How many mice were examined? The pathological data could be enhanced by thicker sections and wider views of the tissue. It would be nice to see how increased GFAP or microglial activation markers correspond to light sheet images of PLP-null oligodendrocytes.</p><p>This is a clearly written manuscript and the data supports the conclusions of the authors. It is among the first papers to report manipulation of a subpopulation of oligodendrocytes. It also provides an animal model with cortical oligodendrocyte and myelin abnormalities in the absence of demyelination. This has implication to axonal degeneration in ageing, MCI and MS. The model and behavioral data are described in detail. A more robust description of the pathological data would enhance the impact of this paper. What is the distribution of activated microglia? Do they reflect the distribution of PLP-null oligodendrocytes? There are other fundamental questions that will need to be addressed. Does the transgene alter the production of other cell types? What causes the apparent atrophy (ventricular enlargement) that was described as obvious? Despite these limitations, the experimental proof-of-concept approach opens an array of possibilities for futures and more detailed studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70792.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There is general agreement that the study is well done, has several novel aspects that will be of interest to the field.

We quantified the areas with PLP-positive myelin in the cortex and in the corpus callosum, both recombination sites of <italic>Emx<sup>IRESCre</sup></italic> , and for comparison the striatum that should not be affected by Cre recombination. Expectedly, we detected a robust decrease in PLP-positive area in the cKO animals. The reduction was most striking in the cortex. In the ventral corpus callosum significant amounts of PLP+ myelin could still be detected. We suspect that this myelin – rather than being the result of insufficient Cre recombination – originates from OPC/oligodendrocytes migrating into the v entral corpus callosum from the ‘non-recombined’ striatum. We present and discuss these points in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>We also performed a quantitation by western blots for MBP and PLP in the prefrontal cortex (recombined region) and in the cerebellum (non-recombined) region (New Figure 1D, quantification panels). As suggested by the reviewers, we also performed PLP and MBP co-labelling to determine whether forebrain axons are properly myelinated. This revealed a significant reduction also of MBP positive profiles (New Figure 1 – supplement 1), especially in the upper cortical layers where myelination is already sparse. It suggests that in the absence of PLP myelinated internodes are either lost over time or not properly formed during development.</p><p>We refrained from a detailed ultrastructural analysis of PLP-deficient myelin as this has been extensively done and published in the past (Klugmann et al., 1997; Möbius et al. 2016; Patzig et al. 2016; Rosenbluth et al., 2006, Steyer et al. 2020; Trevisiol et al. 2021).</p><p>Our claim of “aging-specific defects” reflects the fact that pathology and behavioral anomalies in PLP-deficient mice manifest with increasing age (as for example in the hurdle test of male mice). As seen in conventional PLP KO mice, the associated phenotype is of progressive nature and worsens in aging mice. However, we agree with the reviewers that the experimental base for this claim in the present paper is weak, as we did not perform every behavioral test at multiple time points. We have therefore removed these claims from the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We now have performed the global characterisation of gliosis in the forebrain using immunofluorescence staining of coronal brain slices (New Figure 2A,B). We also performed a quantitative analysis focusing on the cortex and corpus callosum (both Cre-recombined areas) in comparison to the striatum as a (non-recombined) control region. Robust microgliosis (Iba1+ area) and astrogliosis (GFAP+ area) was only seen in the recombined white matter (corpus callosum). This is in agreement with Figure 2 – supplement 1 in which we quantified areas immunopositive for microglia and astrocyte markers in the cortex and corpus callosum using immunohistochemistry with chromogenic labeling.</p><p>As correctly pointed out by the reviewer (and cited in our manuscript), we had previously performed microglia depletion experiments in CnpKO animals, another model of myelin dysfunction (Janova et al., JCI 2018). In these mutants, a novel catatonia-like behavioral phenotype was detected that was apparently driven by secondary microgliosis (there is no obvious myelin loss). And it is highly probable that the shared catatonia-like phenotype in any Plp null mutant can likewise be ameliorated by microglial depletion. However, we feel that duplicating the entire experimental series in the presence of PLX5622 would exceed the scope of this paper. This is because the aim of the present study was to explore in how far forebrain-specific myelin perturbations can define behavioral consequences, not what the direct or indirect mechanisms are.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

They identify markers of advanced aging in forebrain-specific and oligodendrocyte-specific Plp1 knockouts, such as increased APP spheroids and neuroinflammation, but do not provide a convincing causal relationship between these neuropathological findings and the subsequent deficiencies in myelin integrity.</p><p>– While the goal of the work is directly related to myelin structure and function, the authors fail to provide thorough and localized analysis of myelin in the mutant mice. Are there changes in the expression of other myelin proteins beside PLP and MBP? What is the g-ratio in these regions (using TEM)? The authors leave a great deal to speculation, especially as Figure 1 contains only qualitative data.</p></disp-quote><p>The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of forebrain-restricted myelin dysfunctions on behavioural tasks that are related to higher cognitive functions. We therefore refrained from any detailed analysis of myelin integrity (TEM analysis, g-ratios etc) given the large number of prior publications by us and others describing the myelin phenotype of PLP null mutant mice (Klugmann et al., 1997; Möbius et al. 2016; Patzig et al. 2016; Rosenbluth et al., 2006, Steyer et al. 2020; Trevisiol et al. 2021). We have no reason to believe that PLP-deficient myelin in forebrain-specific KO mice is qualitatively different from the conventional null allele, and have referred to these earlier studies. Moreover, we have now provided quantification of MBP and PLP immunostainings (New Figure 1 and New Figure 2) and quantifications of western blot (New Figure 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors claim that Plp1 expression is restricted to oligodendrocytes and therefore, the phenotypic differences observed in the conditional knock out mice are caused by the PLP-deficient oligodendrocytes. However, in accordance with another paper by this group published in 2017 and research done by other groups, PLP is not only expressed by oligodendrocytes. Adding a control experiment with a higher magnification colocalization between a neuronal marker and PLP would be needed to assess PLP expression changes in forebrain neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>Neurons and other cells can indeed show trace amounts of Plp1 RNA transcripts. We had therefore conducted an earlier study to specifically investigate the neuropathological consequences of neuronal loss of Plp expression and its possible contribution to the pathology seen in conventional Plp null mice. To this end, we created <italic>Nex-Cre::Plp<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice which recombine only in excitatory neurons of the forebrain (Lueders et al. 2017, PMID: 28836307). We failed to detect any axonopathy or gliosis, rendering the phenotype of <italic>Emx<sup>IRESCre</sup> Plp<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> very unlikely to be caused by neuronal PLP. We think that this prior work which we cited in the current manuscript is convincing evidence against relevance of deleting neuronal PLP expression in the emergence of neuropathology. Moreover, PLP immuno-labeling in our hands (Knockout-validated aa3 anti-PLP antibody) does not show evidence of PLP protein expression in neurons but exclusively expression in myelinated fibers and oligodendrocytes (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, with layer 5 neurons as black ‘holes’ upon PLP immunostaining).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-70792-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The presence of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative markers in mutant mice is interesting, but the authors fail to explain how the forebrain and oligodendrocyte-specific deficits in Plp1 are related to these findings? Is this a cause or consequence of changes in region-specific myelin?</p></disp-quote><p>By genetically inactivating the expression of a myelin protein, one can be certain that neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are secondary effects, caused by a primary absence of a myelin protein. Even an oligodendrocyte-specific <italic>Plp1</italic> null mutant (Lueders et al. 2017) recapitulates all of the phenotypes described in constitutive <italic>Plp1</italic> KOs (Klugmann et al., 1997; Griffiths et al., 1998). Thus, the downstream effects of PLP deficiency are secondary to a primary oligodendrocyte/myelin-linked dysfunction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors emphasize the age-related phenotype and the generation of a new model to study myelin alteration specifically in aged mice, but they do not show any analysis of histology or neuropathology in young adults to claim the phenotype is only seen is aged mice. A histological analysis of young adult brains would be needed to compare phenotypes between ages and claim an age-dependent phenotype. Multiple assessment timepoints are needed here to identify the neurodegenerative onset related to temporal changes in the PLP expression profile.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have investigated by immunofluorescence gliosis also at an earlier time point, i.e.11 months of age (Figure 2). Importantly, in this younger cohort we also detected significant gliosis of the corpus callosum. Gliosis in this mutant is thus not dependent on advanced brain aging although a progression of this phenotype is very likely. Based on these 11 months data, we have removed the qualifier “age-dependent” from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The title of the paper that emphasizes the role of age in the catatonia-executive dysfunction phenotype is not justified by the experiments and the results. First, the authors show catatonia dysfunction in young adults starting at 3 and 5 months in females and males, respectively (Figure 3A,B). Moreover, of the tests performed to evaluate executive function, only 1 was conducted in both young and aged adults (Figure 3E,F). In this particular executive test in which the effect of the age is analyzed, the authors show that males present executive dysfunction when aged, but females exhibit deficit at 6 months but not 20 months. I suggest changing the title and eliminating the emphases of age-related phenotype unless a consistent evaluation and finding of aged-specific changes can be confirmed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer (see also above) and have removed this phrase from the title, and also softened claims related to age throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I greatly appreciate that the authors broke down behavior based on biological sex and applaud them for taking this important variable into consideration. The authors could strengthen their analyses by including this variable in their histological assessment as they have in their behavioral analyses. As is, the paper shows no analysis of neuropathology or histology in females, even if they indicate in statistical methodology that mice of both sexes were used. Considering Plp is an X-linked gene and that the authors show sexual dimorphism in executive function, adding histological analysis in females would be needed to reach the author's conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the essential revisions section above: in our analysis of gliotic reactions and APP+ swellings, we had separately investigated female and male mice, but had merged these data for presentation and quantification. We now present these findings in a sex-specific manner (Figure 2 – supplement 1). Importantly, this did not show any difference for male and female forebrains of PLP cKO mice. We also take this as an indication that the underlying myelin pathology (and number of recombined oligodendrocytes) is the same in male and female mutant mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– As a point of consideration, changes in motor function have been identified in a model of increased myelination specific to the cortico-callosal projections in the corpus callosum and not the cortico-fugal projections (Gibson et al. 2014). As one of the key points of this manuscript is the development of a model in which changes in myelination occur only in the forebrain, including the corpus callosum, in order to isolate executive functioning from motor functioning, how does one reconcile that changes in motor function have been characterized with only changes in the corpus callosum and not cerebellum or spinal cord regions as identified in Gibson et al. 2014. This may be worth discussing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We are aware that motor cortical areas are involved in motor learning skills, which is why we had performed the complex running wheel analysis. Rather than isolating motor phenotypes from executive functioning, the aim of our genetic targeting approach was to uncouple any forebrain-specific (motor) functions from major motor dysfunctions observed in Plp null mice that reflect axonal loss in cerebellum and spinal cord (Griffiths et al., 1998). In our view, the findings by Gibson et al.2014 are, therefore, not in conflict with the data presented in this paper. We have added a respective sentence to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The results are clearly presented and the experimental strategy is powerful. The inclusion of data on the complex running wheel used by other authors to study the effects of loss of oligodendrocyte generation was a nice addition, as the lack of phenotype on the wheel due to the conditional knockout enables an interesting comparison with the results of other laboratories.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her positive comments on our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A significant weakness, though, is that the authors have not distinguished the effects of loss of myelin integrity and inflammation. As they showed beautifully in a recent JCI paper, inhibiting inflammation using a drug (PLX5622) administered in the chow can ameliorate phenotypes thought to be due directly to myelin loss. Although the results presented here are very important and represent a significant step in our understanding of myelin functions, the paper would certainly be stronger if this additional experiment had been performed so as to tease apart the direct and indirect effects of PLP loss.</p></disp-quote><p>See also Reviewer 1, point #2. As correctly pointed out by this reviewer (and cited in our manuscript), we had previously performed microglia depletion experiments in Cnp KO animals, another model of myelin dysfunction (Janova et al., JCI 2018). In these mutants, a novel catatonia-like behavioral phenotype was detected that was driven by secondary microgliosis. It is indeed highly likely that also the shared catatonia-like phenotype of Plp null mutant mice can be ameliorated by microglial depletion.</p><p>However, we feel that duplicating the experimental series in the presence of PLX5622 would exceed the scope of this paper. Most of all, the aim of the present study was to explore in how far forebrain-specific myelin perturbations can cause behavioral consequences in mice (not what the direct and indirect downstream mechanisms are that lead to altered neuronal functions).</p><p>We certainly agree that here the role of secondary microgliosis remains a very interesting aspect that we wish to address in the future, presumably first in conventional PLP KO mice, in which the interaction of altered microglia with the synaptic circuitry needs to be dissected at various levels. Again, we think that the necessary experiments exceed by far the scope of the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Myelin-axon alterations can cause neuronal/axonal dysfunction and neurological disability. The best examples of this are rodent studies that alter myelin protein content without causing demyelination. The best studied example is deletion of the major CNS myelin protein proteolipid protein (PLP). PLP deletions cause a late onset neurodegeneration modelling human spastic paraplegia type 2. Studies of the global PLP deletion has focused on motor disability. These and other studies have led to the concept that myelin maintains axonal integrity. This manuscript asks the question of whether loss of myelin integrity in the forebrain has behavioral consequences. PLP was selectively removed from ventricular zone stem cells of the mouse forebrain. This resulted in an absence of PLP in oligodendrocytes in the prefrontal cortex, corpus callosum and hippocampal fimbria. This data is convincing and well-documented. These mice showed normal motor function and no evidence of spasticity. In contrast, the mice showed late onset deficits in executive function and displayed catatonic-like symptoms. There are two major strengths to this paper. The site specific deletion of PLP from ventricular zone stem cells using the EMZ promotor and the sophisticated behavioral testing.</p><p>A major impact of this paper relate to the role of myelin-axon integrity in ageing. Subtle changes in cortical myelin have been described in the aged primate cortex. MRI abnormalities have also been found in myelinated periventricular white matter in individuals with mild cognitive impairment and individuals with multiple sclerosis. The concept that the axonal dysfunction can be caused by subtle changes in myelin composition therefore are likely to be of clinical importance.</p><p>Pathological characterization was sufficient to support the author's conclusions that axonal integrity is compromised in CNS regions that harbor the EMZ driven PLP KO. The use of light sheet microscopy to chart the distribution of PLP-positive oligodendrocytes is impressive. Can some comment be made about the consistency of this data? How many mice were examined? The pathological data could be enhanced by thicker sections and wider views of the tissue. It would be nice to see how increased GFAP or microglial activation markers correspond to light sheet images of PLP-null oligodendrocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for commending our light sheet microscopic analysis. We agree that the LSM analysis provides a great overall impression of recombination territories in forebrain PLP cKO. Quantifications of LSM can be challenging due to limited antibody penetration, which is why we do not provide quantifications of these datasets. However, in the revised version of main Figure 1 we now provide 2D quantifications of PLP stainings in coronal paraffin slices.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a clearly written manuscript and the data supports the conclusions of the authors. It is among the first papers to report manipulation of a subpopulation of oligodendrocytes. It also provides an animal model with cortical oligodendrocyte and myelin abnormalities in the absence of demyelination. This has implication to axonal degeneration in ageing, MCI and MS. The model and behavioral data are described in detail. A more robust description of the pathological data would enhance the impact of this paper. What is the distribution of activated microglia? Do they reflect the distribution of PLP-null oligodendrocytes? There are other fundamental questions that will need to be addressed. Does the transgene alter the production of other cell types? What causes the apparent atrophy (ventricular enlargement) that was described as obvious? Despite these limitations, the experimental proof-of-concept approach opens an array of possibilities for futures and more detailed studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive evaluation of our manuscript. In the revised version of main Figure 2, we now show overview images of micro- and astrogliosis that should give a better impression of the global distribution of these cell populations. We also included a control area in which Emx-Cre is not expressed during development (striatum). Indeed, glia activation is only seen in brain areas affected by recombination. Interestingly, we could only find significantly increased neuroinflammation in the white matter (corpus callosum) but not in the cortical grey matter although this region is clearly recombined in Emx-Cre-positive animals. Presumably, microglia activation only manifests to the extent that it becomes detectable by immunohistochemistry in heavily myelinated areas, which might also be most affected by myelin dysfunction.</p><p>We have addressed the other points in the response to the essential revisions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
