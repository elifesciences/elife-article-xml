In humans, CASP3 and CASP7 recognize the same consensus motif DxxD, which is present in gasdermin E (GSDME). However, human GSDME is cleaved by CASP3 but not by CASP7. The underlying mechanism of this observation is unclear. In this study, we identified a pyroptotic pufferfish GSDME that was cleaved by both pufferfish CASP3/7 and human CASP3/7. Domain swapping between pufferfish and human CASP and GSDME showed that the GSDME C-terminus and the CASP7 p10 subunit determined the cleavability of GSDME by CASP7. p10 contains a key residue that governs CASP7 substrate discrimination. This key residue is highly conserved in vertebrate CASP3 and in most vertebrate (except mammalian) CASP7. In mammals, the key residue is conserved in non-primates (e.g., mouse) but not in primates. However, mouse CASP7 cleaved human GSDME but not mouse GSDME. These findings revealed the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrate. These results also suggested that mutation-mediated functional alteration of CASP probably enabled the divergence and specialization of different CASP members in the regulation of complex cellular activities in mammals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cell death is essential for an organism to develop and survive as it plays key roles in processes such as embryo development and tissue regeneration. Cell death is also an important form of defence during an infection. A form of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis can be induced in infected cells, which helps to kill the infectious agent as well as alert the immune system to the infection.</p><p>Pyroptosis is driven by Gasdermin E, a protein made up of two domains. At one end of the protein, the ‘N-terminal’ domain punctures holes in cell membranes, which can lead to cell death. At the other end, the ‘C-terminal’ domain inhibits the activity of the N-terminal domain. A family of proteins called caspases activate Gasdermin E by cleaving it, which releases the N-terminal domain from the inhibitory C-terminal domain. In humans, two caspases known as CASP3 and CASP7 recognize a specific sequence of amino acids – the building blocks of proteins – in Gasdermin E. However, only CASP3 is able to cleave the protein.</p><p>After discovering that, unlike in humans, pufferfish Gasdermin E can be cleaved by both CASP3 and CASP7, Xu et al. wanted to investigate the underlying mechanisms behind this difference. Swapping the domains of human and pufferfish Gasdermin E and creating different versions of CASP7 revealed that the C-terminal domain of Gasdermin E and a single amino acid in CASP7 determine whether cleavage is possible. Interestingly, the key amino acid sequence required for cleavage by CASP7 is present in most vertebrate CASP3 and CASP7 proteins. However, it is absent in most mammalian CASP7.</p><p>The findings of Xu et al. suggest that the different activity of human CASP7 and CASP3 is driven by a single amino acid mutation. This change likely played an important role in the process of different CASP proteins evolving to regulate different cellular activities in mammalian cells. This knowledge will be useful for future studies on the evolution and specialization of other closely related proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pufferfish</kwd><kwd>gasdermin E</kwd><kwd>caspase 3</kwd><kwd>pyroptosis</kwd><kwd>caspase 7</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Technology Innovation Project of Laoshan Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LSKJ202203000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004739</institution-id><institution>Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Shuai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>41876175</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Shuai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Taishan Scholar Program of Shandong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018 and 2021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Shuai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functional divergence of caspase 3 and 7 in vertebrate is mediated by key residue mutation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pyroptosis represents a form of programmed cell death that provokes robust inflammatory immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergsbaken et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsuchiya et al., 2019</xref>). Gasdermin (GSDM) serves as the direct executioner of pyroptosis. GSDM forms transmembrane pores to permeabilize the cytoplasmic membrane, which leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and, if these transmembrane pores persist, pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kovacs and Miao, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xia et al., 2021</xref>). Humans have six GSDM (HsGSDM) family members, HsGSDMA-E, and HsPJVK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tamura et al., 2007</xref>). All HsGSDMs (except for HsPJVK) adopt a two-domain architecture, the N-terminal (NT) pore-forming domain and the C-terminal (CT) autoinhibitory domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Schutter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shao, 2021</xref>). Proteolytic cleavage of HsGSDM to remove the autoinhibitory CT domain enables the binding of the lipophilic NT fragment to the cell membrane, where the NT fragments oligomerize and form transmembrane pores to induce osmotic cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kuang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Among the signaling pathways that activate GSDM-mediated pyroptosis, caspase (CASP) 1/4/5/11-mediated GSDMD activation is well documented. In humans, HsGSDMD is specifically cleaved by the inflammatory HsCASP1 through multiple inflammasome signaling pathways. HsCASP4/5 also cleave HsGSDMD in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. After cleavage by HsCASP1/4/5, the pore-forming HsGSDMD-NT fragment becomes unconstrained and triggers pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kayagaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). Structural and biochemical analyses reveal that HsCASP1/4 βIII/βIII’ sheet forms an exosite that interacts with the hydrophobic pocket of HsGSDMD-CT domain, rendering HsGSDMD cleavage independent of CASP recognition of the tetrapeptide motif FLTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>). When the tetrapeptide FLTD is mutated to AAAD, HsCASP1/4 cleavage of HsGSDMD is not affected. The residues that form the hydrophobic pocket of HsGSDMD-CT domain are not conserved in HsGSDME, suggesting that HsGSDME cannot be cleaved by HsCASP1/4 via interaction with an exosite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Actually, human HsGSDME is specifically cleaved by HsCASP3 at the consensus motif DMPD, which is required for HsCASP3-mediated HsGSDME proteolysis. Mutation of either the Asp residue of the DMPD tetrapeptide motif leads to cleavage resistance of HsGSDME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rogers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that HsCASP3-mediated HsGSDME activation paradigm is distinct from that of HsGSDMD. It is intriguing that although HsCASP7 shares the same recognition motif (DxxD) with HsCASP3, HsCASP7 cannot cleave HsGSDME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agniswamy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Slee et al., 2001</xref>). The molecular mechanism underlying the HsCASP3/7 cleavage discrimination of HsGSDME is unknown.</p><p>Historically, HsCASP3 and HsCASP7, which are 54% identical, are known to possess similar structure and share overlapping protein substrate repertoire, and are considered to have functionally redundant roles in regulating cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crawford and Wells, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kumar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shi, 2002</xref>). Both HsCASP3 and HsCASP7 consist of two polypeptide subunits named p20 and p10 (1:1 ratio), which assemble to form active heterotetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Timmer and Salvesen, 2007</xref>). HsCASP3/7 contain highly conserved QACRG and SHG motifs in p20 subunit, and SWR and GSWF motifs in p10 subunit, which participate in the catalytic reaction and substrate binding, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyce et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen, 1997</xref>). In the apoptosis signaling pathway, death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway and mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway ultimately converge to the activation of HsCASP3/7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Budd et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wajant, 2002</xref>). Active HsCASP3/7 cleave a series of protein substrates, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and DNA fragmentation factor 45, which causes chromatin fragmentation and leads to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erener et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wolf et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zheng et al., 1998</xref>). Although HsCASP3 and HsCASP7 exert almost indistinguishable proteolytic specificity to certain polypeptides, there exist functional differences between these two HsCASPs in cleaving some substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brentnall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demon et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, HsCASP3 cleaves Bid much more efficiently than HsCASP7, while HsCASP7 cleaves cochaperone p23 more efficiently than HsCASP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Slee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walsh et al., 2008</xref>). These findings support the notion that HsCASP3 and HsCASP7 are enzymatically similar but functionally non-redundant.</p><p>Different from HsGSDME that is specifically cleaved by HsCASP3, teleost GSDME is cleaved via various modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angosto-Bazarra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yuan et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we identified a functional GSDME (named TrGSDME) from pufferfish (<italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>). We found that TrGSDME was specifically cleaved by both HsCASP3/7 and TrCASP3/7, whereas HsGSDME was cleaved by TrCASP3/7 and HsCASP3, but not by HsCASP7. We examined the underlying mechanism of this observation. We found that the GSDME-CT and the CASP7 p10 were critical for CASP7 cleavage of GSDME. By a series of site-directed mutagenesis, we discovered a previously unrecognized key residue (S234 in HsCASP7) in p10 that was responsible for the discriminative cleavage of HsGSDME by HsCASP7.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pufferfish GSDME is specifically cleaved by both human and fish CASP3/7</title><p>It has long been observed that although human caspase (HsCASP) 3 and 7 share the same consensus recognition motif DxxD, HsCASP3, but not HsCASP7, cleaves human GSDME (HsGSDME) (at the site of DMPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Poreba et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). The underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. In this study, we found that a pufferfish <italic>T. rubripes</italic> GSDME (designated TrGSDME), which belongs to the GSDMEa lineage of teleost GSDME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), was specifically cleaved by both HsCASP3 and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). This intriguing observation promoted us to explore the mechanism of HsCASP7 substrate discrimination. We first examined whether TrGSDME could be cleaved by pufferfish CASP (TrCASP) 3/7. The active forms of TrCASP3/7 were prepared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), both exhibited high proteolytic specificity and activity toward the tetrapeptide DEVD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), which is the conserved recognition motif of HsCASP3/7. When incubated with TrGSDME, both TrCASP3 and TrCASP7 cleaved TrGSDME into the NT and CT fragments, similar to that cleaved by HsCASP3/7, in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). Accordingly, TrCASP3/7-mediated TrGSDME cleavage was inhibited by the CASP3 inhibitor (Z-DEVD-FMK) and the pan-CASP inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Based on the molecular mass of the cleaved NT and CT products, we inferred that the tetrapeptide motif <sup>255</sup>DAVD<sup>258</sup> in the vicinity of the linker region of TrGSDME may be the recognition site of CASP3/7. Indeed, the D255R and D258A mutants of TrGSDME were resistant to TrCASP3/7 and HsCASP3/7 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In humans, GSDME is specifically cleaved by CASP3 at the consensus motif DMPD, but it is not cleaved by CASP7, which recognizes the same DxxD motif. CASP3 cleavage releases the pyroptosis-inducing NT fragment from the association of the inhibitory CT fragment and switches cell death from apoptosis to pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rogers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we found that different from human GSDME, a pufferfish GSDME belonging to the teleost GSDMEa lineage was specifically cleaved by both CASP3 and CASP7 at the site of DAVD to liberate the pyroptosis-inducing NT fragment. In teleost, there generally exist two GSDME orthologs, named GSDMEa and GSDMEb. Comparative study on the functions of GSDMEa and GSDMEb is scarce, and it remains to be explored whether clear physiological roles are played by these two orthologs in fish. As executors of pyroptosis, teleost GSDMEs are activated via different mechanisms. In tongue sole (<italic>Cynoglossus semilaevis</italic>), GSDMEb is preferably cleaved by CASP1 to trigger pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>); in zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), GSDMEb is activated by caspy2 (CASP5 homolog) through the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>). These observations indicate that similar to mammalian GSDMD, teleost GSDMEb is activated by inflammatory CASPs. In contrast, teleost GSDMEa is cleaved mainly by apoptotic CASPs. In zebrafish, GSDMEa is cleaved by CASP3 to generate the pyroptotic NT fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In turbot (<italic>Scophthalmus maximus</italic>), GSDMEa is bi-directionally regulated by CASP3/7, which activate GSDMEa, and CASP6, which inactivates GSDMEa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). In common carp (<italic>Cyprinus carpio haematopterus</italic>), GSDMEa is cleaved by CASP3 and induces pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>). The complicated scenario of GSDME-mediated pyroptosis signaling in fish is likely due to the reason that, unlike mammals that have multiple GSDM members to induce pyroptosis under different conditions, fish have only GSDME to induce pyroptotic cell death. Regulation by different CASPs may represent a mechanism that enables fish GSDME to execute the orders of different pyroptotic signals.</p><p>It is intriguing that, although HsCASP3 and 7 were indistinguishable in proteolysis toward the consensus tetrapeptide, they differed remarkably in the cleavage of HsGSDME and TrGSDME. HsCASP3, but not HsCASP7, cleaved HsGSDME, whereas both HsCASP3 and 7 cleaved TrGSDME at the same site. NT/CT domain swapping between HsGSDME and TrGSDME showed that chimeric GSDMEs containing the TrGSDME-CT domain were cleaved by human as well as pufferfish CASP7 regardless of the source of the NT, whereas chimeric GSDMEs containing the HsGSDME-CT domain were resistant to HsCASP7. These results indicate that the CT domain, which is well accepted to exert an inhibitory effect on the pore-forming NT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shi et al., 2015</xref>), is the target of HsCASP7 discrimination, and hence determines the cleavability of GSDME by HsCASP7. Recently, Wang and Liu studied the molecular mechanism of human GSDMD recognition by CASP1/4 and showed that GSDMD-CT interacted with CASP1/4 exosites through binding to a hydrophobic pocket, which enhanced the recognition by CASP1/4 and contributed to tetrapeptide sequence-independent cleavage of GSDMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>). Different from GSDMD, we found that for TrGSDME, mutation of either the P4 (D255) or P1 (D258) residue of the consensus motif <sup>255</sup>DAVD<sup>258</sup> made it resistant to CASP3/7, implying a lack of DAVD-independent cleavage mechanism. Similarly, a previous study observed that human and mouse GSDME harboring cleavage site (P4 or P1) mutation resisted CASP3 cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). These results suggest that, compared to GSDMD, GSDME has a distinct enzyme–substrate engagement mode that, as demonstrated in the present study, involves GSDME-CT.</p><p>Unlike HsCASP7, which was unable to cleave HsGSDME, TrCASP7 effectively cleaved HsGSDME. The swapping of p20 between HsCASP7 and TrCASP7 revealed that the two catalytic motifs in p20, that is, SHG and QACRG, were not involved in HsCASP7 discrimination on GSDME. SWR and GSWF are known to be responsible for CASP substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Riedl et al., 2001</xref>). However, in our study, we found that these two motifs are conserved in human and pufferfish CASP7, and they had no apparent effect on the substrate discrimination of HsCASP7. By contrast, the chimeric HsCASP7 containing the p10 subunit of TrCASP7 acquired the ability to cleave HsGSDME, indicating an important role of p10. By a series of residue swapping and mutation analyses, we discovered that the residue in the position of 245 (in TrCASP7) or 234 (in HsCASP7) of the p10 subunit was the key that determined CASP7 cleavage of HsGSDME. Sequence analysis revealed that N245 is highly conserved in the CASP7 of teleost, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. In contrast, this Asn residue was changed to Ser in the CASP7 of mammals, especially primates, resulting in divergence of CASP7 from CASP3 in substrate recognition and cleavage. Since, unlike non-mammalian vertebrates, mammals possess multiple pyroptotic GSDM members (GSDMA, B, C, D, and E), the functional divergence of CASP7 from CASP3 may have occurred as a result of specific and non-redundant regulation of programmed cell death mediated by different executor molecules. One of the physiological consequences is that CASP7 frees itself from the GSDME-mediated pathway and thus is able to be engaged in other cellular processes. Another physiological consequence is that GSDME activation is limited to CASP3 cleavage, thus restricting GSDME activity to situations more specific, such as that inducing CASP3 activation. More physiological consequences of CASP3/7 divergence in GSDME activation need to be explored in future studies. With the exception of primates, the conserved Asn is present in a large number of mammals, including mice. Mouse CASP7 was able to cleave HsGSDME, further supporting the importance of the Asn in CASP7 recognition and cleavage. The inability of mouse CASP7 to cleave mouse GSDME is consistent with a previous report that CASP7 deletion had little effect on mouse GSDME-mediated pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sarhan et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggest mutually independent evolution of GSDME and CASP7 in mice, which likely has distanced GSDME and CASP7 from each other. Similarly, human CASP7 and GSDME may also have undergone independent evolution, which leads to the disengagement of GSDME from the substrate relationship with CASP7.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified a teleost GSDME that can be cleaved by fish and human CASP3/7 to trigger pyroptosis. The GSDME-CT domain and the CASP7 p10 subunit are critical in the determination of CASP7 cleavage of GSDME. Within the p10 subunit, a single residue plays a key role in CASP7 substrate recognition and cleavage. Our results reveal the molecular basis of the functional divergence of CASP7 and CASP3, and suggest separate evolutions of CASP7 and GSDME in mammals. These findings add new insights into CASP-regulated GSDME activation in lower and higher vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

The authors could also test whether the human CASP7 S234N mutation affects substrate preference beyond human GSDME by testing cleavage of mouse GSDME and other CASP3 and CASP7 substrates in this mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>(1) The physiological relevance was discussed in the revised manuscript (lines 328-340). Our study revealed the molecular mechanism underlying the divergence of CASP3- and CASP7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrate. One of the physiological consequences is that in humans, CASP7 no longer directly participates in GSDME-mediated cell death, which enables CASP7 to be engaged in other cellular processes. Another physiological consequence is that GSDME activation is limited to CASP3 cleavage, thus restricting GSDME activity to situations more specific, such as that inducing CASP3 activation. The divergence and specialization of the physiological functions of different CASPs are consistent with and possibly conducive to the development of refined regulations of the sophisticated human GSDM pathways, which are executed by multiple GSDM members (A , B, C, D, and E), rather than by GSDME solely in teleost, such as Takifugu. More physiological consequences of CASP3/7 divergence in GSDME activation need to be explored in future studies.</p><p>With respect to the reviewer’s suggestion of assessing GSDME cleavage by the human CASP7 S234N mutant in response to triggers such as etoposide or VSV: (i) CASP7 S234N is a creation of our study, not a natural human product, hence its response to CASP7 triggers cannot happen under normal physiological conditions except in the case of application, such as medical application, which is not the aim of our study. (ii) CASP3/7 activators (such as raptinal) induced robust activation of the endogenous CASP3 (Heimer et al., Cell Death Dis. 2019;10:556) and CASP7 (Author response image 1, below) in human cells. Since CASP3 is the natural activator of GSDME, the presence of the triggers inevitably activates GSDME via CASP3. Hence, under this condition, it will be difficult to examine the effect of CASP7 S234N.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>HsCASP7 activation by raptinal.</title><p>HEK293T cells were transfected with the empty vector (-), or the vector expressing HsCASP7 or HsCASP7-S234N for 24 h.

The results showed that HsCASP7 and HsCASP7-S234N exhibited similar cleavage capacities. Figure 5-figure supplement 1 and lines 212-214.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It would also be interesting to examine the GSDME structure in different species to gain insight into the nature of mouse GSDME, which cannot be cleaved by either mouse or human CASP7.</p></disp-quote><p>Because the three-dimensional structure of GSDME is not solved, we are unable to explore the structural mechanism underlying the GSDME cleavage by caspase. Since our results showed that the C-terminal domain was essential for caspase-mediated cleavage of GSDME, it is likely that the C-terminal domain of mouse GSDME may possess some specific features that render it to resist mouse and human CASP7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The evolutionary analysis does not explain why mammalian CASP7 evolved independently to acquire an amino acid change (N234 to S234) in the substrate-binding motif. Since it is difficult to experimentally identify why a functional divergence occurs, it would be beneficial for the authors to speculate on how CASP7 may have acquired functional divergence in mammals; potentially this occurred because of functional redundancies in cell death pathways, for example.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, a speculation was added. Lines 328-340.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) For the recombinant proteins produced for these analyses, it would be helpful to know whether size-exclusion chromatography was used to purify these proteins and whether these purified proteins are soluble.

Performing protein ID to confirm that the detected bands belong to the respective proteins would be beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>The recombinant proteins in this study are soluble and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Size-exclusion chromatography was not used in protein purification.</p><p>For the SDS-PAGE in Figure 4-figure supplement 1B and C (Figure S1B and C in the previous submission), the multiple bands are most likely due to the activation cleavage of the TrCASP7 and HsCASP7 variants, which can result in multiple bands, including p10 and p20. According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the cleaved p10 was verified by immunoblotting. Figure 4-figure supplement 1B and C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) For Figures 3C and 4A, it would be helpful to mention what parameters or PDB files were used to attribute these secondary structural features to the proteins. In particular, in Figure 3C, residues 261-266 are displayed as a β-strand; however, the well-known α-model represents this region as a loop. Providing the parameters used for these callouts could explain this difference.</p></disp-quote><p>For Figure 3C, in the revised manuscript, we used the structure of mouse GSDMA3 (PDB: 5b5r) for the structural analysis of HsGSDME.

The sequence information was shown in Table 1 and Table 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) For clarity, it would help if the authors provided additional rationale for the selection of residues for mutagenesis, such as selecting Q276, D278, and H283 as exosite residues, when the CASP7 PDB structures (4jr2, 3ibf, and 1k86) suggest that these residues are enriched with loop elements rather than the β sheets expected to facilitate substrate recognition in exosites for caspases (PMID: 32109412). It is possible that the inability to form β-sheets around these positions might indicate the absence of an exosite in CASP7, which further supports the functional effect of the exosite mutations performed.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the suggestion, the rationale for the selection of residues for mutagenesis was added (lines 216-222). Unlike the exosite in HsCASP1/4, which is located in a β sheet, the Q276, D278, and H283 of HsCASP7 are located in a loop region (Figure 5-figure supplement 2), which may explain the mutation results and the absence of an exosite in HsCASP7 as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors wanted to address the differential processing of GSDME by caspase 3 and 7, finding that while in humans GSDME is only processed by CASP3, Takifugu GSDME, and other mammalian can be processed by CASP3 and 7.
