kinesins, but it is poorly understood which kinesins are present on particular cargos, what their contributions are and whether they act simultaneously on the same cargo. Here, we show that Rab6-positive secretory vesicles are transported from the Golgi apparatus to the cell periphery by kinesin-1 KIF5B and kinesin-3 KIF13B, which determine the location of secretion events. KIF5B plays a dominant role, whereas KIF13B helps Rab6 vesicles to reach freshly polymerized microtubule ends, to which KIF5B binds poorly, likely because its cofactors, MAP7-family proteins, are slow in populating these ends. Sub-pixel localization demonstrated that during microtubule plus-end directed transport, both kinesins localize to the vesicle front and can be engaged on the same vesicle. When vesicles reverse direction, KIF13B relocates to the middle of the vesicle, while KIF5B shifts to the back, suggesting that KIF5B but not KIF13B undergoes a tug-of-war with a minus-end directed motor.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>kinesin</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>vesicle transport</kwd><kwd>Rab6</kwd><kwd>MAP7</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Synergy grant 609822</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akhmanova</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Consolidator grant 819219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kapitein</surname><given-names>Lukas C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALW Open Program grant 824.15.017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akhmanova</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IEF fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Maud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STW grant OTP13391</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meijering</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Serra-Marques</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The function and distribution of kinesin motors on exocytotic vesicles is dissected and visualized through a combination of gene knockout experiments, high-resolution microscopy and advanced data analysis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intracellular transport is driven by the collective activity of multiple motors. Transport toward microtubule (MT) plus ends depends on several kinesin families, whereas minus-end directed movement in animal cells is mostly driven by cytoplasmic dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhmanova and Hammer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirokawa and Tanaka, 2015</xref>). Different types of kinesins can participate in transporting the same cargo, but for many cellular organelles it is currently unclear which motors contribute to motility, what their specific roles are and whether different types of motors can be engaged in transport simultaneously. Furthermore, a common feature of many cellular cargos is their bidirectional transport along MTs, and it is well established that both kinesins and dynein can operate on the same cargo. Motors of opposite polarity can engage in a tug-of-war, be switched on and off in a coordinated fashion or even depend on each other for motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hancock, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Welte, 2004</xref>). Distinguishing these mechanisms requires the detection of motor activity on cellular cargo, which in many situations proved to be highly challenging.</p><p>Carriers of constitutive secretion represent a convenient and functionally important cellular model to study intracellular transport. Members of the plus-end directed kinesin-1 family (KIF5A/B/C) and kinesin-3 (KIF13A, KIF13B) have been implicated in the transport of Golgi-derived carriers to the cell surface in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Astanina and Jacob, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burgo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jaulin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakagawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamada et al., 2014</xref>). In both constitutive and inducible secretion assays in mammalian cells, exocytotic carriers positive for different exocytotic cargos, such as NPY or temperature sensitive VSV-G, can be readily labeled with the small GTPases Rab6 and Rab8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grigoriev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grigoriev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jasmin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miserey-Lenkei et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wakana et al., 2012</xref>). Recent work conclusively demonstrated that the majority of post-Golgi carriers, irrespective of the marker used, are positive for Rab6, which appears to be a general regulator of post-Golgi secretion and thus represents an excellent marker for secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fourriere et al., 2019</xref>). It was further shown that cytoplasmic dynein drives transport of Rab6-positive membranes to MT minus ends, whereas kinesin-1 KIF5B and the kinesin-3 family members KIF1B and KIF1C have been implicated in the plus-end directed motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grigoriev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matanis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schlager et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Short et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wanschers et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, KIF1C was shown to interact with Rab6 directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). However, siRNA-mediated co-depletion of KIF5B, KIF1B and KIF1C was not sufficient to block MT plus-end directed movement of Rab6 vesicles in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>), and it is thus possible that additional kinesins are involved. For example, it has been proposed that the Golgi-derived carriers named CARTS (carriers of the TGN to the cell surface), which are labeled with Rab6, Rab8 and the protein cargo pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor (PAUF) are driven by the mitotic kinesin-5 family member KIF11/Eg5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferenz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wakana et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wakana et al., 2013</xref>), but the exact contribution of this motor requires further clarification.</p><p>Another important question concerns the specific roles of different kinesins on the same cargo. An increasing body of evidence suggests that different kinesins can preferentially bind to specific MT tracks, and the presence of different kinesins on the same cargo might thus help these cargos to navigate heterogeneous MT networks. For example, kinesin-1 shows a strong preference for more stable MT populations enriched in acetylated and detyrosinated tubulin, whereas kinesin-3 prefers dynamic, tyrosinated MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guardia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Konishi and Setou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liao and Gundersen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lipka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tas et al., 2017</xref>). These kinesins also require different MT-associated proteins (MAPs) for their activity: kinesin-1 critically depends on MAP7 family proteins whereas the activity of kinesin-3 is stimulated by doublecortin and doublecortin-like kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaudhary et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hooikaas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lipka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Métivier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Monroy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pan et al., 2019</xref>). Whether and how the MAP-kinesin cross-talk contributes to motor selectivity is currently unknown.</p><p>In addition to kinesin preferences for specific tracks, other differences in the properties of the motors can affect their collective behaviors. In vitro and cellular studies have shown that kinesin-3 motors are faster than kinesin-1, but detach more easily from MTs, and therefore, when the two motors are combined in vitro, kinesin-1 predominates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arpağ et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arpağ et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Norris et al., 2014</xref>). In cells, the situation is more complex, because the presence of MAPs and post-translational tubulin modifications can affect MT-motor interaction and thus determine which motor will dominate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gumy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Norris et al., 2014</xref>). It was also proposed that in situations where kinesin-1 is dominant, kinesin-3 can enhance overall transport efficiency by preventing cargo detachment from MTs and helping to navigate around obstacles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arpağ et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Norris et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, much of what is known about motor preferences for specific tracks and the details of their individual and collective properties is based on the observation of kinesin rigor mutants or kinesin fragments, either unloaded or recruited to artificial cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arpağ et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arpağ et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guardia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kapitein et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Norris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tas et al., 2017</xref>), whereas much less is known about the behavior of motors attached to endogenous cargo by their natural adaptors.</p><p>Here, by using gene knockout and rescue experiments, we dissected the composition and behavior of the motor machinery responsible for the transport of secretory vesicles from the Golgi complex to the cell surface. We showed that the transport of Rab6/PAUF vesicles to the cell periphery relies on kinesin-1 KIF5B and kinesin-3 KIF13B. In the absence of both kinesins, the efficiency of secretion was not perturbed, but exocytotic vesicles fused with the plasma membrane close to the Golgi and not at the cell periphery. KIF5B plays a dominant role in the secretory vesicle transport, and this transport is also strongly affected by the depletion of its co-factors, MAP7 family members. MAP7 proteins are more abundant on perinuclear MTs, likely because freshly polymerized MT ends, which are enriched at the cell periphery, are populated by these MAPs with some delay. Accordingly, KIF5B shows less activity on newly grown MT segments compared to the older MT lattices. In contrast, KIF13B can reach newly grown MT ends efficiently and contributes to the transport of Rab6 vesicles to these ends.</p><p>Rab6 vesicle transport in kinesin knockout cells could be rescued by fluorescently tagged versions of KIF5B and KIF13B. High-resolution imaging of these kinesins on moving vesicles showed that when only one type of kinesin was present, it was enriched at the front of a vesicle moving to the cell periphery. When the two kinesins were present on a vesicle simultaneously, the faster KIF13B was located in front of the slower KIF5B. When vesicles reversed direction, KIF13B re-located to the vesicle center, whereas KIF5B was positioned at the back, suggesting that KIF5B but not KIF13B undergoes some mechanical competition with dynein. Our work thus provides insight into the spatial regulation and function of multimotor assemblies during bidirectional cargo transport.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Kinesin-3 KIF13B associates with Rab6-positive secretory vesicles</title><p>To image secretory carriers, we used the small GTPase Rab6, which was shown to be a highly robust and ubiquitous marker of exocytotic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fourriere et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grigoriev et al., 2007</xref>).

We analyzed the colocalization between the CARTS cargo protein, PAUF-mRFP and Rab6 and found that they indeed colocalized both in fixed cells stained for endogenous Rab6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and also in live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Only a sub-population of Rab6-positive vesicles contained PAUF (~60% and 50% in fixed and live cells, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggests that Rab6 vesicles may serve multiple exocytotic routes, with PAUF utilizing one of these routes. In line with this view, in secretion assays, less than 20% of PAUF vesicles contained the classic secretion marker, the temperature-sensitive VSV-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wakana et al., 2012</xref>), while a high degree of colocalization of VSV-G and Rab6 has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grigoriev et al., 2007</xref>).

However, PAUF colocalized with KIF13B, as 50.7 ± 22.3% of PAUF-mRFP-positive vesicles were labeled with GFP-KIF13B (determined from 10 cells), and kymograph analysis of PAUF/Rab6-positive vesicles clearly showed that they move together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

By performing fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, we observed that GFP-KIF13B does not exchange on exocytotic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), similar to what we have previously observed for Rab6 and Rab8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grigoriev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grigoriev et al., 2011</xref>).

KIF13B contains an N-terminal motor domain (MD), a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, several predicted coiled-coil regions (CC), a MAGUK binding stalk (MBS), two predicted domains of unknown function (DUF3694) and a C-terminal cytoskeleton-associated protein-glycine-rich (CAP-Gly) domain. The region including the MBS, a coiled-coil and the DUF3694 domains (607–1623) was necessary and sufficient for the binding to Rab6 vesicles, whereas the CAP-Gly domain and the motor domain were dispensable for the binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>).

We generated gene knockout cell lines lacking KIF5B, KIF13B, KIF5B and KIF13B together (KIF5B/KIF13B-KO), or KIF5B, KIF13B, KIF1B and KIF1C (4X-KO), and observed that the silencing of these kinesin genes led to the loss of the respective proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Endosomes showed increased perinuclear clustering, particularly in the 4X-KO cells, and their number appeared reduced in this cell line, although we cannot exclude that this effect was due to the fact that strongly clustered endosomes are more difficult to count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>).

Due to the very high Rab6 fluorescence signal, the Golgi area was manually excluded from analysis. Trajectories of individual Rab6 vesicles obtained through this analysis (termed here vesicle ‘tracks’) consisted of alternating periods of diffusive ‘jiggling’ movement and persistent directional motion, which we attributed to the active motor-driven transport along MTs. From complete vesicle tracks we extracted the segments of directional movement (here termed ‘runs’) using the velocity vector as a directional correlation measure, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katrukha et al., 2017</xref>). Such processive runs represented less than 10% of the total vesicle motility; a detailed analysis of the share of processive movements in different conditions is discussed below. We compared the average number of vesicle runs in control and in the different knockout cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In KIF13B-KO cells, the number of vesicle runs was very similar to control. Since some compensatory changes could have occurred during cell line selection of the clonal line, we also included in the analysis the population of cells that were used for KIF13B-KO clone selection (KIF13B-KO mixed population). These cells were transfected with a vector co-expressing a puromycin resistance gene, the single guide RNA sequence specific for KIF13B and Cas9, subjected to puromycin selection for 2 days and left to recover for 5 days before analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; ‘KIF13B-KO mixed’). Also these cells did not show a major reduction in the number of runs, similar to KIF13B knockout clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). In contrast, a very strong reduction in the number of runs was observed in the KIF5B-KO cells. Interestingly, the double knockout of KIF5B and KIF13B (KIF5B/KIF13B-KO) had a synergistic effect, as the number of Rab6 vesicle runs was reduced compared to the single KIF5B-KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). These results indicate that both kinesins cooperate in the transport of Rab6 vesicles, with KIF5B being the major player. This is also in line with our previous observations showing that siRNA-mediated depletion of KIF5B had a strong impact on the post-Golgi transport of Rab6 vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grigoriev et al., 2007</xref>). The 4X-KO cells did not show a stronger reduction in the number of runs compared to the double KIF5B/KIF13B-KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting that KIF1B and KIF1C are not sufficient for Rab6 vesicle transport.</p><p>Next, we performed rescue experiments using the 4X-KO cells. We re-expressed in these cells KIF5B, KIF13B, a combination of KIF1B and KIF1C, or Eg5/KIF11, and analyzed Rab6 vesicle motility. Expression of KIF5B restored the number of vesicle runs to values similar to control, and the same was observed when KIF13B was re-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). It has been previously shown that the knockdown of kinesin-1 heavy chain reduces the levels of kinesin light chains (KLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Using immunofluorescence cell staining and Western blotting, we confirmed this observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). KLC levels were restored by transiently re-expressing KIF5B-GFP in the KIF5B-KO line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Interestingly, simultaneous re-expression of KIF1B and KIF1C did not rescue Rab6 vesicle motility in 4X-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Importantly, these kinesins were functional, as their expression could rescue the localization of Rab11-positive endosomes: compared to control cells, the distribution of Rab11 carriers was strongly shifted toward the Golgi area in the 4X-KO cells, and this phenotype was reversed upon simultaneous re-expression of KIF1B and KIF1C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Furthermore, expression of Eg5 in the 4X-KO did not restore vesicle movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>), consistent with our observations that Eg5 does not localize to Rab6-positive vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). In agreement with these data, the number of vesicle runs was not affected by siRNA-mediated depletion of Eg5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E,F</xref>). Thus, these data indicate that Eg5 and KIF1B/1C make no major contribution to the motility of Rab6 vesicles.</p><p>The data described above show that the number of processive Rab6 vesicle runs in HeLa cells depends on two motors, KIF5B and KIF13B. To get a more complete picture of vesicle motility in all the analyzed conditions, we investigated the share of processive runs compared to total Rab6 vesicle movements. We found that in all cases the percentage of tracks containing runs was below 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), and, as could be expected, it strongly correlated with the absolute number of vesicle runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,F</xref>). A similar trend was observed when the total duration of processive motility was analyzed as a percentage of total vesicle movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). This was due to the fact that the fraction of processive movement inside the tracks that did contain runs remained almost the same for all conditions (on average, one third; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). In all conditions, the duration of tracks that contained runs was consistently longer (on average, six times) than tracks without runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Together, these data indicate that KIF5B and KIF13B drive a large fraction of processive movements of Rab6 vesicles but have no major impact on their diffusive motility. It should be noted, however, that since our analysis is optimized for extracting processive vesicle runs, additional work will be needed for the precise characterization of diffusive vesicle movements, as it is highly sensitive to tracking errors occurring during particle linking between frames.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>KIF5B and KIF13B have different velocities and set the speed range of Rab6 vesicles</title><p>Next, we used automated vesicle tracking to examine how the presence of KIF5B and KIF13B affects different parameters of vesicle movement. Vesicle speeds obtained from the automated analysis were very similar to those determined manually from the analysis of kymographs drawn along Rab6-positive tracks, as we described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grigoriev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Taking this approach, we examined the speed of the residual vesicle movements in different knockout cell lines. While the average Rab6 vesicle speed in KIF13B-KO cell clones and the mixed KIF13B-KO population was mildly but significantly reduced compared to control, the few Rab6 vesicles that still moved in the KIF5B-KO, KIF5B/KIF13B-KO and 4X-KO cells displayed speeds much higher than those in control cells, an effect that was particularly obvious when speeds of all individual tracks rather than average velocities per cell were plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Interestingly, we observed the appearance of vesicles moving with speeds exceeding 3 μm/s, which were very rare in control cells but could be readily detected in KIF5B-KO, KIF5B/KIF13B-KO and 4X-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The residual, faster movements of Rab6 vesicles in cells lacking KIF5B and KIF13B could be driven by another kinesin or by dynein, as our previous work has shown that dynein-dependent Rab6 vesicle movements can occur with velocities of 2–4 μm/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>). We also analyzed other parameters of Rab6 vesicle motility, namely the duration and length of individual vesicle runs. We found that run duration was relatively constant in all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Loss of KIF13B had no significant impact on run length, indicating that this motor does not significantly contribute to the processivity of vesicle movement driven by KIF5B. Interestingly, the residual runs observed in the absence of KIF5B were significantly longer than those in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), possibly reflecting the strong sensitivity of this motor to obstacles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Telley et al., 2009</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>KIF5B and KIF13B have distinct speeds.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis of the mean speed of automatically tracked mCherry-Rab6A-positive vesicles per cell in the indicated conditions. n = 29, 27, 30, 27, 22, 21, 30, 30, 30 and 30 cells, respectively, in two independent experiments for Eg5 and 3 independent experiments in all other conditions.

If only one motor were involved in vesicle movement, one Gaussian curve would be expected to fit the data. However, in most cases, the distributions of vesicle speeds matched much better the sum of two Gaussians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), indicating that there are at least two populations of vesicles with different average speeds per run. In control, there is a slower vesicle population with speed 1.20 ± 0.26 μm/sec (average ± SD), and a faster one with a value of 1.71 ± 0.49 μm/s (average ± SD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). The fraction of higher speed runs was reduced in the clonal and mixed KIF13B-KO cells, while it was increased in the KIF5B-KO and KIF13B rescue of 4X-KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The speed distributions were quite similar in KIF13B-KO cells and in 4X-KO cells rescued with KIF5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, second plot), in line with idea that KIF5B is the major motor on both cases.</p><p>In contrast, Rab6 vesicles in 4X-KO cells rescued by expressing KIF13B moved significantly faster than those in cells rescued with KIF5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). It is important to emphasize that in cells rescued by expressing either KIF5B or KIF13B, vesicle tracks were distributed throughout the whole cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, the observed speed difference could not be explained by differences in cell regions where the movement took place, such as cell thickness or interference with other organelles. However, the observed difference in vesicle speeds can be explained by previous observations showing that KIF13B is a faster motor compared to KIF5B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arpağ et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Norris et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, single-molecule imaging of dimeric motor-containing fragments lacking the cargo binding tails, KIF13B-380-LZ and KIF5B-560, in 4X-KO cells confirmed that KIF13B moves significantly faster than KIF5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To show that this difference is also observed when these kinesins are linked to cargo, we next used the FRB-FKBP chemical dimerization system in combination with rapalog (an analog of rapamycin) to trigger the binding of KIF5B(1-807)-GFP-FRB and/or KIF13B(1-444)-GFP-FRB motor-containing fragments to peroxisomes, which are relatively immobile organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kapitein et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–H</xref>). We used different ratios of KIF5B and KIF13B-expressing plasmids as a way to manipulate the relative motor abundance on peroxisomes and observed that peroxisome speed increased when the KIF5B:KIF13B plasmid ratio decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>), similar to what we described previously for KIF5B and KIF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gumy et al., 2017</xref>). Kymographs of peroxisome movements showed that when the two kinesins were co-expressed, intermediate velocities were observed, suggesting simultaneous engagement or very rapid switching between the two types of motors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). This behavior is different from that previously described for the kinesin-1/kinesin-3 motor pairs connected by a stiff linker, where typically only one of the two kinesins was engaged at a given moment and switching between motors could be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Norris et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, a significant excess of KIF13B-encoding plasmid was needed to shift peroxisome speeds to higher values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>), in agreement with in vitro gliding assays, which indicated that the slower kinesin-1 predominated when combined with kinesin-3 at a 1:1 molar ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arpağ et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Next, we imaged fluorescent fusions of the full-length KIF5B and KIF13B motors in 4X-KO cells. The expression of GFP-tagged kinesins in combination with mCherry-Rab6A in 4X-KO cells allowed us to directly determine the speeds of vesicles driven by a particular motor and also to estimate the number of kinesins present on the vesicles in our rescue experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). By manually measuring the speeds of mCherry-Rab6A labeled vesicles decorated with either GFP-KIF13B or KIF5B-GFP in 4X-KO cells, we again confirmed that KIF13B is the faster motor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). To determine the number of motors present on a vesicle, we used KIF5B-560-GFP, a dimeric KIF5B fragment that lacks the tail and therefore does not bind to cargo, as a fluorescence intensity standard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We observed that approximately 1–2 dimers of KIF5B-GFP and 3–5 dimers of GFP-KIF13B could be detected on the vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Since these experiments were performed with overexpressed full-length kinesins, these data suggest that the maximum number of KIF5B binding sites on Rab6 vesicle is lower than that of KIF13B. However, it is likely that in the endogenous situation the KIF13B abundance is low and the KIF13B binding sites are not saturated. This would explain why overexpressed but not endogenous KIF13B can rescue Rab6 vesicle motility in the absence of KIF5B. This would also explain why Rab6 vesicle speed distributions in KIF5B-KO cells and 4X-KO cells rescued with KIF13B differ: in 4X-KO cells rescued with KIF13B this motor predominates, while in KIF5B-KO cells, the population of vesicles moving with the speed characteristic of KIF13B is relatively small, whereas the other residual movements in these cells are driven by even faster motors such as dynein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>KIF5B and KIF13B colocalize on moving vesicles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Live TIRFM imaging of 4X-KO cells expressing either KIF5B-560-GFP alone or mCherry-Rab6A together with the full-length (FL) KIF5B-GFP or GFP-KIF13B. A single frame and a maximum intensity projection of a KIF5B-560-GFP movie is shown on the left, and single frames illustrating the localization of KIF5B-FL-GFP and GFP-KIF13B-FL on mCherry-Rab6A-labeled vesicles are shown on the right.

We co-expressed GFP-KIF13B or KIF5B-GFP together with mCherry-Rab6A in 4X-KO HeLa cells and imaged vesicle motility using TIRFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). PAUF-mRFP, in combination with GFP-Rab6A, was used as a control of localization of a vesicle marker lacking motor activity.

The alignment of the two fluorescent channels and the sub-pixel correction of chromatic aberrations were performed using a calibration photomask (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Since the average projected distances between KIF13B and Rab6 signals were smaller than those between KIF5B and Rab6 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), it appears that smaller vesicles are generated when the 4X-KO cells are rescued with KIF13B compared to KIF5B. This observation was confirmed when we measured absolute distances between Rab6 and other markers without projecting them on the velocity direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>).Importantly, vesicles detected by imaging PAUF and Rab6, without overexpressing any motors, were in the same size range as those found in 4X-KO cells rescued with KIF5B, whereas vesicles in 4X-KO cells rescued with KIF13B were smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). In addition, more vesicles with larger areas were observed when 4X-KO cells were rescued with KIF5B compared to KIF13B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). These data suggest that KIF5B, which is normally the main motor transporting Rab6 vesicles, is important for controlling vesicle size, a function that cannot be compensated by KIF13B, possibly because it performs less well under hindering load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arpağ et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arpağ et al., 2014</xref>). We could not detect any dependence of the distance between Rab6 and the kinesins on vesicle speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we compared the distribution of KIF5B-GFP and mCherry-KIF13B when they were colocalized on the same moving particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>, green line). Interestingly, in this situation, KIF5B was shifted to the rear compared to KIF13B, which would be consistent with the idea that KIF5B, which is slower and has a lower detachment probability under load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arpağ et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arpağ et al., 2014</xref>), exerts a drag force, whereas the faster KIF13B accumulates at the front of the vesicle. This is consistent with the fact that the average speeds of particles bearing both motors are slower than those transported by kinesin KIF13B alone, but faster than those moved by KIF5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>As the large majority of Rab6 vesicles are transported toward cell periphery and thus MT plus ends, we assumed that most of the displacements we analyzed represent kinesin-driven runs. However, there is a small fraction of Rab6 vesicles that are transported to the MT minus-ends by dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grigoriev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matanis et al., 2002</xref>) and, therefore, we next analyzed in more detail the behavior of kinesins on vesicles moving in the minus-end direction. To identify such runs, we automatically selected trajectories where a vesicle underwent a clear and acute switch of direction, and split such tracks into pairs of runs (for example, run1 and run2 or run2 and run3) where average movement direction was opposite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref> and Methods). We then calculated the projected distance <italic>d</italic> between the kinesin and Rab6 signals for each directional run within the run pair. The run with the higher projected distance <italic>d</italic> was assigned as the forward run, and the other run as the backward run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L,M</xref>). The projected distance between kinesins and Rab6 in the forward runs was positive, as expected, and similar to that observed in the full dataset shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, where the tracks were not selected for the presence of opposite polarity runs. Interestingly, for the backward runs, the average displacement was close to zero for KIF13B (~3.5 nm) and was slightly negative (~ - 34.1 nm) for KIF5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). These data suggest that when a vesicle switches to dynein-driven motility, KIF13B does not undergo any tug-of-war with dynein, whereas KIF5B might be exerting some hindering force. These data would be consistent with the observations that a kinesin-3 is readily detached under force while kinesin-1 is more resistant to force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arpağ et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arpağ et al., 2014</xref>). Overall, our sub-pixel localization analysis suggests that both kinesins can actively engage on the vesicle when it moves toward MT plus end, but only KIF5B can oppose dynein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Kinesin-driven Rab6 vesicle transport spatially regulates secretion in mammalian cells</title><p>We next analyzed the functional importance of kinesin-mediated transport for secretion in HeLa cells.

Now that we have established a system (the 4X-KO line) where Rab6 vesicle motility was dramatically suppressed, we reassessed the impact of kinesin-based transport of post-Golgi vesicles on the secretion levels. We took advantage of the retention using selective hooks (RUSH) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boncompain et al., 2012</xref>) to synchronize secretion. The interaction of SBP-GFP-E-Cadherin with streptavidin-KDEL (Hook) allows for the retention of E-Cadherin-GFP at the ER and its subsequent release for transport toward to the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane upon biotin addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We performed the RUSH assay by overexpressing SBP-GFP-E-Cadherin and streptavidin-KDEL in control or 4X-KO HeLa cells, and induced secretion by adding biotin.

Indeed, live cell imaging showed that MAP7 displays a delay in binding to freshly grown, EB3-positive MT ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>). Also KIF5B followed this localization pattern: the dimeric motor fragment KIF5B-560 was significantly less abundant on EB3-positive MT ends compared to older, EB3-negative MT lattices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>). In contrast, the motor domain containing fragment of KIF13B, KIF13B-380, which was dimerized by fusing it to a leucine zipper, was enriched at the growing MT ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G,H</xref>). Based on these results, we hypothesized that in the absence of KIF13B, Rab6 vesicles will be less efficient in reaching the newly grown, EB3 positive MT ends and found that this was indeed the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I,J</xref>). This effect was obvious in the mixed KIF13B-KO but was less apparent in the clonal KIF13B-KO cell lines, possibly because compensatory changes may have occurred during clone selection. Altogether, our results suggest that the combined action of KIF5B and KIF13B allows Rab6 vesicles to efficiently navigate different MT populations. MAP7 proteins contribute to the spatial regulation of exocytotic vesicle transport by promoting the activation of KIF5B and possibly by inhibiting KIF13B on older MTs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have dissected kinesin-driven transport of Rab6-positive secretory carriers and the behavior of kinesins on these carriers. We showed that in HeLa cells, kinesin-1 KIF5B and kinesin-3 KIF13B are the main motors driving secretory vesicle motility. Rab6 vesicle transport was profoundly perturbed in a knockout cell line lacking KIF5B, KIF13B, KIF1B and KIF1C (4X-KO) and could be restored by re-expression of KIF5B and KIF13B but not KIF1B or KIF1C. KIF5B is the predominant motor driving Rab6 vesicle motility in HeLa cells: its knockout impairs vesicle movement much stronger than that of KIF13B, and the average speed of Rab6 vesicle movement in control cells is more similar to that of KIF5B than of KIF13B. This is likely due to the relatively low abundance of KIF13B in HeLa cells, because when overexpressed, KIF13B alone can restore Rab6 vesicle motility, in line with the previous studies showing that KIF13B and its <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart, Kinesin-73, are super-processive kinesins that can drive long-distance cargo transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huckaba et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Siddiqui and Straube, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Soppina et al., 2014</xref>). Efficient rescue of Rab6 vesicle movement with KIF13B in 4X-KO cells suggests that defective motility of Rab6 vesicles is due to the lack of motors attached to these vesicles rather than indirect effects caused by the lack of KIF5B and its impact on MTs or other organelles.</p><p>Rab6 represents a robust marker of a broad variety of post-Golgi carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fourriere et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grigoriev et al., 2007</xref>).

Indeed, our previous work established the involvement of KIF1A/B/C family in the transport of Rab6-positive carriers in neurons and Vero cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gumy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schlager et al., 2010</xref>). Kinesin recruitment to the vesicles depends on the expression of specific adaptor proteins. KIF5B was recently shown to be bound to different membranes including Rab6 vesicles by the Dopey1-Mon2 complex, which functions as a lipid-regulated cargo-adaptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mahajan et al., 2019</xref>). KIF1C was shown to interact with Rab6-positive membranes directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2015</xref>) and also by associating with a cell-specific adaptor protein BICDR-1, which is absent from HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schlager et al., 2010</xref>). How KIF13B is recruited to Rab6 vesicles is currently unclear, but once recruited, it stays stably attached to the vesicle. Interestingly, our experiments with overexpression of fluorescently tagged kinesins in 4X-KO cells indicate that the number of KIF5B binding sites on a Rab6 vesicle is more limited than that for KIF13B, suggesting that the two kinesins use different adaptors. It is possible that the adaptor complexes for KIF5B and KIF13B on Rab6 vesicles have some overlapping components, similar to lysosomes, where the BORC/Arl8 complex recruits KIF5B through the interaction with SKIP and KLC and binds to kinesin-3 KIF1A/B directly, through the interaction with the coiled-coil domains of the motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guardia et al., 2016</xref>). However, spatial segregation of KIF5B and KIF13B present on the same vesicles (see below) suggests that they are not part of the same molecular complex.</p><p>Performing rescue experiments in kinesin knockout cells allowed us to generate cells where all kinesins driving Rab6 vesicle transport were fluorescently labeled, thus enabling us to study their distribution on cargo. We found that when expressed separately in 4X-KO cells, both KIF5B and KIF13B localized at the front of moving vesicles; however, when the two motors were co-expressed, KIF5B tended to be positioned behind KIF13B on moving particles. This can be explained by the distinct speeds of kinesin-1 and kinesin-3, described in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arpağ et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guedes-Dias et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Soppina et al., 2014</xref>) and confirmed here: KIF13B, being a faster motor, relocates to the front of the vesicle, while KIF5B, being slower, stays behind. The higher resistance of KIF5B to detachment under load, which is thought to be the main determinant of motor behavior in a mixture of motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arpağ et al., 2014</xref>), also likely contributes to this distribution. The reported interaction between KIF5B and the dynein adaptor BICD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grigoriev et al., 2007</xref>) or some additional interactions between KIF5B and the dynein-dynactin complex could in principle control the localization of this kinesin on the vesicle. Importantly, we find that KIF5B tends to move to the rear of the vesicle when it switches directions and is presumably driven to MT minus ends by cytoplasmic dynein. These data are incompatible with the idea that KIF5B and dynein are part of the same protein complexes on secretory vesicles. Our data further suggest that KIF5B, which is attached to the vesicles independently of dynein, is engaged when dynein is driving transport toward the minus ends, and this could also be explained by KIF5B’s resistance to hindering load. Thus, unlike KIF13B, which detaches under hindering load, KIF5B can engage in a tug-of-war with the dynein motor.</p><p>The generation of 4X-KO cells also allowed us to critically test the functional importance of kinesin-mediated transport for constitutive secretion. In line with previous work showing that drug-mediated MT disassembly does not block post-Golgi trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fourriere et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirschberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rindler et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rogalski et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Van De Moortele et al., 1993</xref>), we found that the efficiency of secretion was normal is cells lacking four kinesins. Previous work suggested that kinesin-1 contributes to the generation of Rab6 vesicles by pulling membrane tubules before their fission from the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miserey-Lenkei et al., 2010</xref>). While our data indicate that such contribution is not essential for the formation of secretory carriers, we did find that Rab6 vesicles generated in the presence of KIF13B alone were smaller than those formed when KIF5B was also expressed. As indicated above, KIF5B detaches less readily under load than KIF13B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arpağ et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arpağ et al., 2014</xref>), and could be more efficient in pulling out a longer membrane tube before its fission. We note, however, that the cell area within the immediate vicinity of the Golgi is not visualized optimally by TIRF microscopy and was not included in our analysis. Therefore, additional imaging experiments and analysis would be needed to address the mechanisms of vesicle exit from the Golgi, the contribution of kinesins to this process and the timing of the recruitment of the two kinesins during vesicle movement from the Golgi to the cell periphery. Ideally, this should be done with fluorescently tagged motors expressed from the endogenous locus.</p><p>An obvious function of kinesins in secretory vesicle transport, confirmed by our work, is the control of the spatial distribution of exocytosis events. In HeLa cells, Rab6 vesicles preferentially fuse with the plasma membrane at the cell periphery in the vicinity of focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fourriere et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grigoriev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stehbens et al., 2014</xref>). Exocytosis preferentially occurs at the sites where dynamic MT plus ends are attached to the cell cortex by the complex of CLASPs, LL5β, KANK1 and ELKS, which together with MICAL3 regulates vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grigoriev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lansbergen et al., 2006</xref>). Such spatial organization can contribute to cell migration by directing secretion of new membrane and extracellular matrix proteins to the leading edge of the cell and also by controlling focal adhesion turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schmoranzer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stehbens et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggest that KIF13B, being a minor player in Rab6 vesicle transport in HeLa cells, likely due to its low abundance, nevertheless contributes to the spatial organization of exocytosis by bringing the vesicles to the tips of dynamic MTs. Cargo unloading at dynamic MT ends could be a general property of kinesin-3 family members, as it was also recently proposed for KIF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guedes-Dias et al., 2019</xref>). KIF5B, which strongly dominates Rab6 vesicle transport, is in contrast restricted to the older, more stable MT population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guardia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tas et al., 2017</xref>). The underlying mechanisms of kinesin-1 selectivity are complex, and might involve the ability of the motor to regulate the properties of the tracks on which it walks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shima et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, KIF5B shows a very strong dependence on MAP7 family members, which control both kinesin recruitment to the MT and its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hooikaas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Monroy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pan et al., 2019</xref>). MAP7 and its homologues are more abundant on older MTs, apparently because of their slow association with growing MTs. In COS7 cells, where MTs are more dynamic than in the HeLa cells studied here, overexpressed GFP-MAP7 was reported to form a sharp boundary along the MT shaft, associated with the end of the stable MT segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tymanskyj and Ma, 2019</xref>). It can be expected that in cells with highly dynamic MTs, Rab6 transport to MT plus ends will be more dependent on kinesin-3 family members. Interestingly, since KIF13B expression is able to rescue Rab6 vesicle transport in the absence of KIF5B, and the distribution of MAP7 family members is not affected by KIF5B loss, it appears that KIF13B can work well not only on freshly polymerized but also on older, MAP7-positive MTs, even though the motility of kinesin-3 has been shown to be negatively affected by MAP7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Monroy et al., 2020</xref>). The expression of MAP7 proteins in HeLa cells is thus sufficient to support transport by kinesin-1 but not to hinder KIF13B activity. Alternatively, additional MAPs promoting kinesin-3 motility may allow KIF13B to move on MTs in spite of the presence of MAP7 family members.</p><p>To summarize, our work demonstrates how the cooperation of two different kinesins promotes efficient cargo transport along complex MT networks. Furthermore, our study shows that direct visualization of motors on moving cargo, which in the future could be extended to cargo adaptors, provides insight into the motor activity and can be used to study the relationships between different players during bi-directional multimotor MT-dependent transport.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs, antibodies, and reagents</title><p>GFP-Rab6A construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matanis et al., 2002</xref>), GFP-Eg5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>), pßactin-PEX3-mRFP and KIF5B(1-807)-GFP-FRB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kapitein et al., 2010b</xref>), GFP-Rab11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoogenraad et al., 2010</xref>), NPY-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schlager et al., 2010</xref>), KIF13B(1-444)-GFP-FRB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lipka et al., 2016</xref>), KIF13A-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schou et al., 2017</xref>) and FKBP-mCherry-Rab6A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>) were described previously.

Golgi area was manually excluded from the analysis. For this analysis, only tracks of 20 or more frames were considered. A segment was assigned to be a directional run if the cosine of angle between all two consecutive velocity vectors was above 0.6 and it lasted more than six frames. If inside such a segment there were more than three consecutive displacements of one pixel or less per frame, at this point the segment was further split into two. Duration and length of each directional run was extracted and its speed was calculated using the complementary SAID plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). We recorded the location of each run inside the corresponding track and used this information to calculate statistics on fractions of processive movement per track or duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H,I</xref>).

Based on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/feature-detection">feature detections</ext-link> we made sub-pixel channel alignment and non-linear registration using B-spline transform implemented in our Detection of Molecules ImageJ plugin and described earlier (version 1.1.6, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ekatrukha/DoM_Utrecht">https://github.com/ekatrukha/DoM_Utrecht</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chazeau et al., 2016</xref>).

We used SimpleTracker routine by Jean-Yves Tinevez (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.github.com/tinevez/simpletracker">https://www.github.com/tinevez/simpletracker</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jean-Yves, 2019</xref>), implementing nearest neighbor search with a distance threshold of 8 pixels (0.52 µm) to assemble ‘short’ two frame tracks. Linked detections were considered colocalized, and for each detection average <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> coordinates between two channels were calculated and stored. For each colocalization detection, we kept records of the original coordinates in each channel. On the next step, we used those averaged coordinates to assemble tracks of colocalized particles over the duration of the whole movie using the same SimpleTracker routine with a distance threshold of 10 pixels (0.65 µm) and the maximum number of gap closing frames equal to 5. From those tracks we extracted segments of persistent directional movement (runs) as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katrukha et al., 2017</xref>). In short, for each track, an array of instant velocity vectors was generated as a difference between two positions of a vesicle in two consecutive frames divided by the time between frames. A cosine of the angle between two consecutive velocity vectors was used as a directional correlation measure. For every trajectory we filtered segments where the value of cosine was above defined threshold. To find runs we used the lower threshold value of 0.6, corresponding to an approximately 100° cone facing in the direction of movement. Only runs longer than 0.3 s and with displacement above 0.5 µm were considered. For the directional filtering of GFP-KIF13B/KIF5B-GFP and mCherry-Rab6A pairs, we used coordinates of mCherry-Rab6A. For PAUF-mRFP and GFP-Rab6A pair we used GFP-Rab6A, and for KIF5B-GFP and mCherry-KIF13B pair we used averaged coordinates. The projected distance was calculated as a dot product between the velocity vector and the vector from the cargo to the motor, divided by the length of the velocity vector.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Analysis of opposite polarity runs</title><p>For each directional movement segment with colocalizing signals of the two markers, we first calculated the average velocity vector <italic>v<sub>i</sub></italic>, coordinates of the center of mass and the average value of the projected distance. For trajectories with more than one run we listed all possible different run pairs. For each pair we calculated the cosine between average velocity vectors. If the cosine value was below −0.6 (i.e. angle between the velocity vectors was larger than 125 degrees), we considered these runs to have opposite polarity. As an additional constraint, we only considered pairs where the distance between the centers of mass was smaller than 1 µm. The run with the larger average projected distance was considered the ‘forward’ run, while the other one was assigned to be the ‘backward’ run.</p><p>All raw and segmented tracks and corresponding MATLAB source code used for analysis are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5177636.v1">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5177636.v1</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>FRAP analysis</title><p>To measure the KIF13B turnover on moving Rab6 vesicles, GFP-Rab6A stably expressing cells were transfected with mCherry-KIF13B.

Using FRAP-on-Fly option of iLas software we photobleached mCherry-KIF13B with a 561 laser (100%) in a ~ 0.5 µm circle area surrounding a moving vesicle. Keeping unaffected green signal of GFP-Rab6A as a reference, we measured the intensities of both GFP-Rab6A and mCherry-KIF13B in ~0.5 µm circle area of a vesicle over time after bleaching.

cell biological, and cutting-edge imaging techniques, this paper defines the individual and cooperative roles of the microtubule motors, kinesin-1 and kinesin-3, in vesicle transport. Although multiple motor populations exist on the same cargo, how distinct motors compete and cooperate to ensure efficient transport are open questions. By precisely analyzing motor position on Rab6 vesicles, this study helps to elucidate the contribution of these different kinesin motor classes to controlling vesicle size, driving regional transport, and opposing dynein in a tug-of-war scenario, thus providing new insights into multimotor cargo transport.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Concerted action of kinesins KIF5B and KIF13B promotes efficient secretory vesicle transport to microtubule plus ends&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Serra-Marques, Martin et al. investigate the individual and cooperative roles of specific kinesins in transporting Rab6 secretory vesicles in HeLa cells using CRISPR and live-cell imaging. They find that both KIF5B and KIF13B cooperate in transporting Rab6 vesicles, but Eg5 and other kinesin-3s (KIF1B and KIF1C) are dispensable for Rab6 vesicle transport. They show that both KIF5B and KIF13B localize to these vesicles and coordinate their activities such that KIF5B is the main driver of the cargos on older, MAP7-decorated microtubules, and KIF13B takes over as the main transporter on freshly-polymerized microtubule ends that are largely devoid of MAP7. Interestingly, their data also indicate that KIF5B is important for controlling Rab6 vesicle size, which KIF13B cannot rescue. By analyzing subpixel localization of the motors, they find that the motors localize to the front of the vesicle when driving transport, but upon directional cargo switching, KIF5B localizes to the back of the vesicle when opposing dynein. Overall, this paper provides substantial insight into motor cooperation of cargo transport and clarifies the contribution of these distinct classes of motors during Rab6 vesicle transport.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The metrics used to quantify motility are sensitive to tracking errors and uncertainty. The authors quantify the number of runs (Figure 2D, F; Figure 7C) and the average speed (Figure 3A, B, D, E, H). The number of runs is sensitive to linking errors in tracking. A single, long trajectory is often misrepresented as multiple shorter trajectories. These linking errors are sensitive to small differences in the signal-to-noise ratio between experiments and conditions, and the set of tracking parameters used. The average speed is reported only for the long, processive runs (tracks&gt;20 frames, segments&lt;6 frames with velocity vector correlation &gt;0.6). For many vesicular cargoes, these long runs represent &lt;10% of the total motility. In the 4X-KO cells, it is expected there is very little processive motility, yet the average speed is higher than in control cells. Frame-to-frame velocities are often over-estimated due to the tracking uncertainty. Metrics like mean-squared displacement are less sensitive to tracking errors, and the velocity of the processive segments can be determined from the mean-squared displacement (see for example Chugh et al., 2018, Biophys. J.). The authors should also report either the average velocity of the entire run (including pauses), or the fraction of time represented by the processive segments to aid in interpreting the velocity data.</p><p>2) The authors show that transient expression of either KIF13B or KIF5B partially rescues Rab6 motility in 4X-KO cells and that knock-out of KIF13B and KIF5B have an additive effect. They also analyze two vesicles where KIF13B and KIF5B co-localize on the same vesicle. The authors conclude that KIF13B and KIF5B cooperate to transport Rab6 vesicles. However, the nature of this cooperation is unclear. Are the motors recruited sequentially to the vesicles, or at the same time? Is there a subset of vesicles enriched for KIF13B and a subset enriched for KIF5B? Is motor recruitment dependent on localization in the cell? These open questions should be addressed in the Discussion.</p><p>3) The imaging and tracking of fluorescently-labeled kinesins in cells as shown in Figure 4 is impressive. This is often challenging as kinesin-3 forms bright accumulations at the cell periphery and there is a large soluble pool of motors, making it difficult to image individual vesicles. The authors should provide additional details on how they addressed these challenges. Control experiments to assess crosstalk between fluorescence images would increase confidence in the colocalization results.</p><p>4) In Figure 5, it is very interesting that only KIF5B opposes dynein. It would be informative to determine which kinesin was engaged on the Rab6 vesicle before the switch to the retrograde direction. Can the authors analyze the velocity of the run right before the switch to the retrograde direction? If the velocity corresponds with KIF5B (the one example provided seems to show a slow run prior to the switch), this could indicate that KIF5B opposes dynein more actively because KIF5B was the motor that was engaged at the time of the switch. Or if the velocity corresponds with KIF13B, this could indicate that KIF5B becomes specifically engaged upon a direction reversal. In any case, an analysis of the speed distributions before the switch would be provide insight into vesicle movement and motor engagement before the change in direction.</p><p>5) In Figure 8G, the tracks for KIF13B-380 motility are difficult to see, which is surprising as KIF13B has been shown to be a superprocessive motor. Is this construct a dimer? If not, do the authors interpret the data as a high binding affinity of the monomer for new microtubules and if so, do they have any speculation on what could be the molecular mechanism? It appears as if KIF13B-380 and EB3 colocalize at the plus ends for a period of time before both are lost but then quickly replenished. Is this common?</p><p>6) In general, the reviewers were interested in the localization and velocity of KIF5B vs. KIF13B cargo runs. One reviewer pointed out that in Figure 2E, it seems like about half of the KIF5B events start at or near the Golgi whereas most of the KIF13B events are away from the Golgi? Did the authors find this to be generally true or just apparent in these example images? Furthermore, the results in Figure 8 suggest a potential switch from KIF5B to KIF13B motor engagement upon a change in lattice/MAP7 distribution. Is the velocity of Rab6 vesicles different on central vs. peripheral microtubules? For example, in Figure 4E, are the two examples in different regions of the cell? Do the authors think the intermediate speeds are a result of the motors switching roles? Additional analysis and discussion would strengthen the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61302.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The metrics used to quantify motility are sensitive to tracking errors and uncertainty.

The detection and linking of vesicles have been performed using our previously published tracking method (Chenouard et al., 2014, Nature Methods, PMID: 24441936). Our linking method uses multi-frame data association, taking into account detections from four subsequent image frames in order to extend and create a trajectory at any given time. This allows for dealing with temporal disappearance of particles (missing detections) for 1-2 frames and avoiding creation of breaks in longer trajectories. The method is robust to noise, spurious and missing detections and had been fully evaluated in the aforementioned paper (Chenouard et al., 2014) showing excellent performance compared to other tracking methods.</p><p>Having the trajectories describing the behavior of each particle, the track segmentation method had been applied to split each trajectory into a sequence of smaller parts (tracklets) describing processive runs and pieces of undirected (diffusive) motion. The algorithm that we used was validated earlier on an artificial dataset (please see Supplementary Figure 2E in Katrukha et al., 2017). The chosen parameters were in the range where the algorithm provided less than 10% of false positives. Since the quantified and reported changes in the number of runs are six-fold (Figure 2D, F), we are quite certain that this estimated error (inherent to all automatic image analysis methods) does not affect our conclusions. Moreover, it is consistent with visual observations and manual analysis of representative videos.</p><p>Further, we agree that frame-to-frame velocities are often somewhat over-estimated due to the tracking uncertainty. We are aware of such overestimation which is very difficult to avoid. In our case, we estimated (using a Monte Carlo simulation) that such overestimation will positively bias the average not more than 3-6%. Since we focus not on the absolute values of velocities, but rather on the comparison between different conditions, such biasing will be present in all estimates of average velocity and will not affect the presented conclusions.</p><p>The usage of mean square displacement (MSD) to analyze trajectories containing both periods of processive runs and diffusive motion is confusing, since it represents average value over whole trajectories, resulting in the MSD slope which is in the range of 1.5 (i.e. between 1, diffusive and 2, processive; please see Figure 2C in Katrukha et al., 2017). Therefore, initial segmentation of trajectories is necessary, as it was performed in the paper by Chugh et al. (Chugh et al., 2018, Biophysical Journal, PMID: 30021112; please see Figure 2E in that paper), suggested by the reviewer. In this paper the authors used an SCI algorithm, which is very similar to our analysis, relying on temporal correlations of velocities. Indeed, MSD analysis of only processive segments is less sensitive to tracking errors, but it reports an average velocity of the whole population of runs. This method is well suited if one would expect monodisperse velocity distribution (the case in Chugh et al., where single motor trajectories are analyzed). If there are subpopulations with different speeds (as we observed for Rab6 by manual kymograph analysis), this information will be averaged out. Therefore, we used histogram/distribution representations for our speed data, which in our opinion represents these data better.</p><p>Finally, we fully agree with the reviewers that the fractions of processive/diffusive motion should be reported. In the revised version, we have added new plots (new Figure 2G-I, Figure 2—figure supplement 2G) illustrating these data for different conditions. Our data fully support the reviewer’s statement that processive runs represent less than 10% of total vesicle motility (new Figure 2G). As could be expected, the total time vesicles spent in processive motion and the percentage of trajectories containing processive runs strongly depended on the presence of the motors (new Figure 2H, I). However, within trajectories that did have processive segments, the percentage of processive movement was similar (new Figure 2I).</p><p>We note that while our analysis is geared towards identification and characterization of processive runs (which was verified manually), analysis of diffusive movements poses additional challenges and is even more sensitive to linking errors. Therefore, we do not make any strong quantitative conclusions about the exact percentage and the properties of diffusive vesicle movements, and their detailed studies will require additional analytic efforts.</p><p>In addition, we made publicly available all raw and segmented trajectories, along with corresponding code, by sharing them in Figshare repository. It opens an opportunity for interested researchers to inspect and re-analyze our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors show that transient expression of either KIF13B or KIF5B partially rescues Rab6 motility in 4X-KO cells and that knock-out of KIF13B and KIF5B have an additive effect.

Since KIF13B can compensate for the absence of KIF5B, it can be recruited to the vesicle when it emerges from the Golgi apparatus. However, in normal cells, KIF5B likely plays a more prominent role in pulling the vesicles from the Golgi, as Rab6 vesicles generated in the presence of KIF5B are larger (Figure 5I). We show in Figure 1G, H that KIF13B does not exchange on the vesicle and stays on the vesicle until it fuses with the plasma membrane. These data suggest that once recruited, KIF13B stays bound to the vesicle. Obtaining such data for KIF5B is more problematic because fewer copies of this motor are typically recruited to the vesicle (Figure 4B) and its signal is therefore weaker. Further research with endogenously tagged motors and highly sensitive imaging approaches will be needed to address the important open questions raised by the reviewer. We have added these points to the second and fourth paragraphs of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The imaging and tracking of fluorescently-labeled kinesins in cells as shown in Figure 4 is impressive.

We have little cross-talk between red and green channels, but channel cross talk in the three-color images shown in Figure 4E was indeed a potential concern. To address this potential issue, we performed the appropriate controls and added a new figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We conclude that we can reliably simultaneously detect blue, green and red channels without significant cross-talk on our microscope setup.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 5, it is very interesting that only KIF5B opposes dynein.

KIF13B-380 does show processive motility, although this is difficult to see close to the outermost microtubule tip as the motor tends to accumulate there.

To automatically track the vesicles, we had to manually exclude the Golgi area. Moreover, only processive and not complete tracks are shown. Therefore, no conclusions can be made from these data on the vesicle exit from the Golgi.

As can be seen in Figure 8B (grey curve), vesicle speed remains relatively constant along the cell radius in control HeLa cells. We note, however, that our previous work has shown that in these cells microtubules are quite stable even at the cell periphery, due to the high activity of the CLASP-containing cortical microtubule stabilization complex (Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2005, Journal of Cell Biology, PMID: 15631994; van der Vaart et al., 2013, Developmental Cell, PMID: 24120883). We therefore hypothesized that changes in vesicle speed distribution along the cell radius would be more obvious in cells with highly dynamic microtubule networks and performed a preliminary experiment in MRC5 human lung fibroblasts, which have a very sparse and dynamic microtubule cytoskeleton (Splinter et al., 2012). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>, we indeed found that vesicles move faster at the cell periphery. Even though these data are suggestive, characterization of this additional cell model goes beyond the scope of the current study, and we prefer not to include them in the manuscript. However, since this paper is part of preprint review and our responses will be published on bioRxiv, the data will be available to the community.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61302-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In Figure 4E, the two examples are from different cells, and both recorded at the cell periphery.

Additional analysis and discussion would strengthen the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Presence of intermediate speeds of cargos driven by multiple motors of two types is most clear in Figure 3F-H, where multiple and different ratios of KIF5B and KIF13B motors are recruited to peroxisomes. As can be seen in Figure 3G, the kymographs in these conditions are “smooth” and no evidence of motor switching can be detected at this spatiotemporal resolution. On the other hand, it has been previously beautifully shown by the Verhey lab that when artificial cargos are driven by just two motor molecules of different nature, switching does occur (Norris et al., 2014). This point is emphasized in the third paragraph of the subsection “KIF5B and KIF13B have different velocities and set the speed range of Rab6 vesicles”. These data suggest that motors working in teams show different properties, and more detailed biophysical analysis will be needed to understand them.</p></body></sub-article></article>
