dysregulated choroidal neovascularization (CNV) as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Intraocular fluid screening of 234 AMD patients identified high levels of IL-4. The purpose of this study was to determine the functional role of IL-4 in CNV formation using murine CNV model. Our results indicate that the IL-4/IL-4 receptors (IL4Rs) controlled tube formation and global proangiogenic responses of bone marrow cells. CCR2<sup>+</sup> bone marrow cells were recruited to form very early CNV lesions. IL-4 rapidly induces CCL2, which enhances recruitment of CCR2<sup>+</sup> bone marrow cells. This in vivo communication, like quorum-sensing, was followed by the induction of IL-4 by the bone marrow cells during the formation of mature CNVs. For CNV development, IL-4 in bone marrow cells are critically required, and IL-4 directly promotes CNV formation mainly by IL-4R. The IL-4/IL-4Rα axis contributes to pathological angiogenesis through communications with bone marrow cells leading to retinal degeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>age-related macular degeneration</kwd><kwd>choroidal neovascularization</kwd><kwd>IL-4</kwd><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP16K15733</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baba</surname><given-names>Takashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP25670733</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baba</surname><given-names>Takashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The IL-4/IL-4Rα axis directory promotes pathological angiogenesis through communications with bone marrow cells leading to neovascular age-related macular degeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which develops in elderly individuals and is a major cause of visual impairments in developed countries. In the early stages of AMD, lipoprotein deposits called drusen accumulate in the subretinal space between the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Drusen are associated with the degeneration of the RPE which then leads to a dysfunction or loss of the photoreceptors. Choroidal (CNVs) develop in the subretinal space, and the CNVs lead to degeneration of the photoreceptor cells, infiltration by inflammatory cells, activation of microglia, and ganglion cell loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Copland et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The pathology of AMD is coupled with senescence-associated para-inflammation, which is characterized by the secretion of IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, and CX3CL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sasaki et al., 2010</xref>). Of these, CCL2 plays an important role in recruiting bone marrow cells, monocytes, and macrophages to the ocular neovascularizations. In this disease process, the bone marrow plays an important role by supplying new vascular endothelial cells and macrophages to the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the bone marrow plays a key role in the repair of damaged tissues.</p><p>The M1 macrophages are functionally classified as pro-inflammatory, and the M2 macrophages are classified as anti-inflammatory, and both types are recruited to damaged tissues. The M2 macrophages are induced by IL-4, and it has been suggested that they have disease-regulating functions as opposed to the M1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The concept of IL-4 as a regulatory and neuroprotective cytokine is supported by the findings in other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kiyota et al., 2010</xref>) and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chitnis and Weiner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, IL-4 is known to be a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Volpert et al., 1998</xref>), and thus may prevent pathological angiogenesis in eyes with AMD.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to determine whether bone marrow cells and IL-4 protect the photoreceptors from neurodegeneration, and whether they play regulatory roles in eyes with g AMD. To accomplish this, we first determined the concentration of IL-4 and other inflammatory cytokines in the aqueous humor of the eyes of AMD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sasaki et al., 2012</xref>). We then determined whether IL-4 and bone marrow cells play roles in protecting the eye from abnormal angiogenesis. This was done by functional assays and global transcriptional profiling of bone marrow cells derived from endothelial progenitor cells (EPC).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increased levels of IL-4 in aqueous humor of eyes with AMD and clinical subtypes of AMD</title><p>We first examined the levels of IL-4 and related cytokines in the aqueous humor of human eyes with AMD.

IL-4 is the canonical Th2 cytokine and is secreted by an array of inflammatory cells including macrophages, monocytes, and activated retinal pigment epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leung et al., 2009</xref>). IL-4 is also recognized as a neuroprotective cytokine, and its action is not limited to the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adão-Novaes et al., 2009</xref>). In axotomized retinas, the retinal ganglion cells are severely damaged by nitric oxide synthesis by activated glial cells. IL-4 significantly increases the survival of retinal ganglion cells, and prevents neurodegeneration caused by glial cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koeberle et al., 2004</xref>). In the thapsigargin-induced rod photoreceptor cell death model, IL-4 can completely block the death of the photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adão-Novaes et al., 2009</xref>). During the differentiation of the retina, IL-4 modulates the proliferation of the retinal cells and promotes photoreceptor differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">da Silva et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, a number of studies have shown that IL-4 can inhibit the death of photoreceptors and RGCs.</p><p>IL-4 is a multifaceted cytokine and is known to have anti-angiogenic capabilities. IL-4 inhibits tumor growth by inhibiting angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Volpert et al., 1998</xref>) and also blocks corneal neovascularization induced by basic fibroblast growth factor. Thus, IL-4 can function as an anti-inflammatory cytokine and prevent neuronal death and angiogenesis. However, such properties of IL-4 appear to be context dependent.</p><p>We found that the IL-4 level was significantly elevated in the aqueous humor of patients with AMD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sasaki et al., 2012</xref>). Together with this, our analyses of the bone marrow cells and chimeric mice supports the idea that elevations of IL-4- and IL-4 receptor-bearing cells are associated with the development of abnormal vessels in the lesions of eyes with AMD.</p><p>Although the IL-4/IL-4Rα axis appears neuroprotective in the retina, retinal injury requires a recruitment or activation of cells with regenerative properties for its repair. The bone marrow cells are a major supplier of mesenchymal stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells. However, abnormally activated bone marrow cells by IL-4 in the retina promote pathological angiogenic responses.</p><p>To explain the dysregulated repair process after organ damage, the concept of cell level and organ level quorum sensing has been recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonioli et al., 2018</xref>). Quorum sensing was originally proposed as a phenomenon of bacterial cells, and it was described as a mechanism that senses the environment and integrity of a population of cells. Hair follicle injury sensed by a macrophage-mediated circuit via CCL2 is a well-known example of quorum sensing at the organ level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 2017</xref>). The quorum sensing circuit mediated by microglia-derived CCL2 also appears to operate in new vessel formation in the retina together with a late IL-4 modulator.</p><p>We observed the presence of CD11b in the CNV lesions at 12 hr which would indicate that monocyte/macrophage cells had arrived soon after the beginning of the CNV. In contrast, the induction of IL-4 and IL-4 receptors was delayed and peaked at 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). CCL2 recruits circulating mononuclear cells from the bone marrow, and the retinal pigment epithelial cells and microglial cells are the major sources of the CCL2 cells in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the monocyte/macrophage recruiting signal, including CCL2, appears to be the first signal in the formation of CNVs.</p><p>It was reported that CCL2 is involved in the formation of retinal neovascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sennlaub et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yoshida et al., 2003</xref>). However, the CCL2/CCR2 signals recruit a heterogeneous collection of monocyte/macrophage lineage cells and presumably do not determine their fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grochot-Przeczek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pearson, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Bone marrow-derived cells and macrophages are critical contributors to retinal and choroidal neovascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Higher levels of M1 than M2 type mRNAs were observed in advanced stage AMD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2011</xref>). The M1 macrophages counteract the M2 type by the secretion of interferon-γ. Based on this, the M2 macrophages were considered to play a regulatory role in CNV formation. Consistent with this, Wu et al showed that the M2 type cytokine, IL-4, and conditioned macrophages become the regulatory phenotype to suppress the disease processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wu et al., 2015</xref>).

Thus, the M1/M2 paradigm does not clearly explain how abnormal vessels are formed in AMD lesions or the CNVs of the model mice.</p><p>Wu et al also showed a contradictory role of IL-4 for CNV formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). This was shown using vitreous injection of IL-4 at very high concentration (600 ng/ml). This may cause toxic damage to endothelial cells or recruited cells which may not reflect physiological role of IL-4.</p><p>In the retina, vascular repair and neovascularization are performed largely by circulating EPCs because mature vascular endothelial cells for proliferation are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caballero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grant et al., 2002</xref>). EPCs are present in the bone marrow or are peripheral blood mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rohde et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schatteman and Awad, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schmeisser et al., 2001</xref>), and they can differentiate into endothelial cells as late EPCs and be incorporated into the vasculature system. Alternatively, bone marrow cells will also differentiate into non-endothelial cell lineage and serve as providers of CNV-forming signals.</p><p>In the inductive phase of CNVs, a mobilization of circulating angiogenic cells and monocyte/macrophage lineage cells begins by the early recruitment of IL-4 secreting CD11b<sup>+</sup> bone marrow cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As a late phase phenomenon, the IL-4R<sup>+</sup> bone marrow-derived cells are incorporated into the CNV presumably as late EPCs or non-endothelial lineage cells, together with the resident cell-derived endothelial cells. We propose that the bone marrow-derived cells contribute to both phases using IL-4 as the fate determinant.</p><p>We also noted that the IL-4/IL-4Rα axis is involved in pathologic angiogenesis. For example, IL-4 induces proinflammatory phenotypes and causes vascular leakage or increased turnover of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kotowicz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). IL-4 stimulates human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) cells to induce proinflammatory cytokines including CCL2, VCAM-1, and IL-6, as a signature of global transcriptional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). These responses appear to be a general characteristics of vascular endothelial cells including coronary arterial endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Skaria et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To identify an endothelial lineage, we used CD31 or isolectin staining because CD31 is highly expressed on endothelial cells and is commonly used as an endothelial cell marker. However, CD31 can also be expressed on other lineage cells including T cells, B cells, dendritic cells (DCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clement et al., 2014</xref>), neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Merchand-Reyes et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our data support the idea that bone marrow-derived cells may be able to differentiate into endothelial cells in the CNV lesions. However, whether the endothelial differentiation is complete or bone marrow cells serve as immature or of different lineage was not definitively determined. Importantly, bone marrow-derived cells do play pivotal roles in the CNV formation.</p><p>In conclusion, damages of the retina and choroidal tissue release signals to the bone marrow to repair the vascular damage. This signal induces a recruitment of the bone marrow-derived cells for differentiation into or establishment of new vessels. Calling and/or fate determining signals are governed by IL-4. IL-4 may serve as a therapeutic target to treat this visual disorder.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The nonadherent cells were removed, and the attached cells were cultured for 2 weeks in DME/F-12 supplement with 15% FBS and recombinant GMCSF (10 ng/ml, Peprotec, Rocky Hill, NJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 1998</xref>). Colony forming units were formed and attached at 1 week. To confirm an endothelial cell lineage, the cells were stained with endothelial cell markers including CD31, VCAM-1, and von Willebrand factor. Briefly, cells plated on temperature-responsive dishes (CellSeed, Tokyo, Japan) were non-enzymatically dispersed and stained for FACS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Tube formation assay of endothelial cells and microarray analysis</title><p>To examine the roles played by cytokines in angiogenesis, vascular endothelial cells were assayed for in vitro tube formation as described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeCicco-Skinner et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, bone marrow-derived EPCs or retinal vascular endothelial cells were plated on Matrigel-coated plates with or without recombinant mouse IL-4 (R and D Systems) or recombinant human IL-4 (Peprotec, for human endothelial cells), and the presence of tube networks was quantified by digitization of the photographs by Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA) after 24 hr.</p><p>The gene and the pathway associated with the tube formation were determined by microarray analysis of tube forming EPCs. EPCs derived from <italic>wild type</italic> or <italic>Il4ra<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were plated on Matrigel plates with or without IL-4 (10 ng/ml) to examine for tube formation. The total RNA was extracted using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and analyzed using SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8 × 60K Microarray (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miyazaki et al., 2017</xref>). The microarray data were analyzed using GeneSpring Software with setting of single color array and a fold change cut off of 3 and a p&lt;0.05. A set of the IL-4-induced genes in the bone marrow-derived EPCs was analyzed to identify the canonical pathways and upstream regulators using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA, Qiagen, accessed on 2020/4/5). The transcriptional networks of IL-4-stimulated EPCs were also constructed using IPA and evaluated by the <italic>P</italic> value as likelihood that assembly of the genes in a network could be explained by random chance alone.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</title><p>The supernatants of EPC were assayed with a commercial ELISA kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham MA). The levels of IL-4 and IL-13 in the aqueous humor samples were measured using commercial ELISA kit as described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chono et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sasaki et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data are presented as the means ± standard error of the means (SEMs). The significance of the differences was determined by two-tailed <italic>t</italic> tests, linear mixed-effects regression analysis, or ANOVA with post hoc tests.

A p&lt;0.05 was taken to be significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Dr. Marc E Rothenberg who supplied the animal for the experiments using IL-13 receptor deficient mice.

CNV is vision threatening in age related macular degeneration, commonly seen in the elderly population. They found that the IL-4/IL-4Rα axis contributed to CNV through communications with CCR2<sup>+</sup> bone marrow cells which were recruited to CNV lesions. CCL2 enhanced recruitment of CCR2<sup>+</sup> bone marrow cells.

From this observation, the authors go on to use a series of experimental techniques, both in vitro and in vivo, to suggest that IL-4 is rapidly expressed in experimental laser induced CNV lesions in a mouse model. This occurs in tandem with increases in CCL2 and CCR2 and the authors suggest that IL-4 is critical for the formation of CNV. They go on to show that systemic injection of IL-4 can exacerbate CNV lesions while inhibition of IL-4 can prevent CNV development. Finally, they show, using a series of bone marrow chimeric mice, that IL-4 is critical for CNV development and in its absence (systemically), CNV lesions cannot adequately form. While this study is of interest and the data presented are intriguing, there are numerous issues that need to be addressed that will clarify the datasets and make the study more robust.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In all figure legends n=8-9 eyes (not mice) per group were mentioned for each mouse strain/treatment. However, the description of the laser-induced CNV procedure was unclear, e.g. the number of laser shots per eye, as well as the number of mice per group was not stated. The laser-CNV model can have very large variations (PMID: 24136346; 26161975). Therefore, at least 8-10 mice per group, with 3-4 laser shots per eye have been recommended to obtain reliable results.</p><p>2) Please use scatter plots in all figures.</p><p>3) The authors claim that bone marrow-derived cells were recruited and differentiated into endothelial cells in CNV lesions (Figure 2E). However, isolectin is not a specific endothelial cell marker, as it also stains microglia (PMID: 23413818). As the authors have demonstrated, CCL2 is localized with microglia (Iba1 staining) in CNV lesions (Figure 1C). Therefore, the authors need to use more specific markers for endothelial cells, and for macrophage/microglia to further validate the type of cells that bone marrow-derived cells differentiate into. If it is macrophage/microglia cells, the authors need to re-validate the data in these cells instead of endothelial progenitor cells in Figure 3-4.</p><p>4) In Figure 2E and Figure 5B, the authors showed the co-staining of bone marrow marker and endothelial cell marker and concluded that bone marrow derived cells incorporated into CNV lesion. But those cells may just simply stick on top of the CNV lesion through cell fusion instead of incorporation into CNV endothelium. If the authors can provide Z-stack confocal images to show those cells in same location are also in the same layer, not on top of endothelial cells.</p><p>5) The authors examined how IL-4 affected the differentiation of vascular endothelial progenitor cells from bone marrow cells in Figure 3 by measuring the induction of angiogenesis related factors including CCL2, VEGF, VEGF receptors, angiopoietin-1, endothelial receptor, thrombin receptors, P-selectin, and vascular endothelial cadherin, and found that CCL2 and VEGFR1 were significantly induced upon IL-4 exposure. This experiment was done in cell culture and EPC markers were not used to confirm the cell lineage of EPC. Do IL-4 exposure changes the amounts/levels or timing of differentiation of vascular endothelial progenitor cells from bone marrow cells?</p><p>6) In Figure 1C, the authors showed the colocalization of IL-4 and Iba-1 and concluded that IL-4 was associated mainly with Iba-1-positive retinal microglial cells. Can the authors rule out the possibility of endothelial cells?</p><p>Images in Figure 1B really need a counterstain to show the demarcation of the lesions. For example, an isolectin stain or CD31 stain could be used to highlight the lesion independent of Il-4 or CD11b staining.</p><p>7) Why has a time course not been completed for Iba-1 and CCL2 staining? What does this staining look like at the times of peak IL4 expression? The authors state in the legend hat the Iba1 and CCL2 staining are in the retinal tissue. Was the retina left intact during these flat mounts or was it removed? Are these microglia adhered to the neovascular membrane or are they within the retina?</p><p>8) Figure 2: It would be beneficial to include similar time-points as those outlined in Figure 1A for each of the markers stained for in Figure 2E. As it stands, this only represents what appears to be occurring 2 weeks post laser injury. As this is a temporally developing lesion, it would be important to stain for these components at all other time points listed previously.</p><p>9) Figure 3: In the endothelial progenitors cells stimulated with IL-4 (Figure 3A), CCL2 is not increasing in a dose dependent manner as suggested by the authors, but rather is lower at 100 ng/ml than at 10 ng/ml. How is this explained?</p><p>While the authors show effects of IL-4 on endothelial CCL2 and VEGF mRNA expression, do they have data pertaining to protein expression from these similar experiments?</p><p>10) In Figure 3, it's strange that although IL-13 can induce CCL2 and VEGFR1 expression, inhibition of IL-13 has absolutely no effect on CNV formation as outlined in Figure 2.

CNV is associated with high local levels of IL-4. This study examined the role of IL-4 in CNV formation in a murine model. IL-4/IL-4 receptors (IL4Rs) controlled proangiogenic responses of bone marrow cells. CCR2<sup>+</sup> bone marrow cells were recruited to very early CNV lesions. IL-4 rapidly induces CCL2, which enhances recruitment of CCR2<sup>+</sup> bone marrow cells. For CNV development, IL-4 in bone marrow cells is required, and IL-4 promotes CNV formation. The IL-4/IL-4Rα axis contributes to pathological angiogenesis through communications with bone marrow cells leading to retinal degeneration.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The interactome in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 needs to be simplified as it is almost illegible in its complexity.</p><p>2) The authors still need to do some editing to tone down the conclusion that bone marrow-derived cells differentiated into endothelial cells as the data does not completely support this conclusion. Although the staining with endothelial cell CD31 lends some support, CD31 is expressed not only in vascular endothelial cells but also in T cells, B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophage (PMID: 31732534). Please note this in the text.</p><p>3) In the text, the authors need to change their conclusion after adding CD31 staining in Figure 2: &quot;In the CNV lesion, bone marrow-derived cells (green) were localized to isolectin-positive vascular endothelial cells indicating that the bone marrow-derived cells had differentiated into endothelial cells.&quot; The conclusion needs to be changed to &quot;…CD31-positive…indicating that the bone marrow-derived cells may be able to differentiate into endothelial cells.&quot; and discuss the specificity of CD31 in endothelial cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54257.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In all figure legends n=8-9 eyes (not mice) per group were mentioned for each mouse strain/treatment.
