The role of gene regulatory changes in driving transitions to multicellularity is being increasingly recognized; however, factors influencing gene expression patterns are poorly known in many clades. Here, we compared the developmental transcriptomes of complex multicellular fruiting bodies of eight Agaricomycetes and <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, a closely related human pathogen with a simple morphology. In-depth analysis in <italic>Pleurotus ostreatus</italic> revealed that allele-specific expression, natural antisense transcripts, and developmental gene expression, but not RNA editing or a ‘developmental hourglass,’ act in concert to shape its transcriptome during fruiting body development. We found that transcriptional patterns of genes strongly depend on their evolutionary ages. Young genes showed more developmental and allele-specific expression variation, possibly because of weaker evolutionary constraint, suggestive of nonadaptive expression variance in fruiting bodies. These results prompted us to define a set of conserved genes specifically regulated only during complex morphogenesis by excluding young genes and accounting for deeply conserved ones shared with species showing simple sexual development. Analysis of the resulting gene set revealed evolutionary and functional associations with complex multicellularity, which allowed us to speculate they are involved in complex multicellular morphogenesis of mushroom fruiting bodies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Pleurotus ostreatus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Coprinopsis cinerea</italic></kwd><kwd>developmental hourglass</kwd><kwd>allelic imbalance</kwd><kwd>mushroom-forming fungi</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hungarian National Research, Development, and Innovation Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00052</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagy</surname><given-names>László G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003825</institution-id><institution>Hungarian Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Momentum Program LP2019-13/2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagy</surname><given-names>László G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>758161</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagy</surname><given-names>László G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Allele-specific expression, natural antisense transcripts, and developmental gene expression, but not RNA editing or developmental hourglass, act in concert to shape the transcriptome during the fruiting body formation of complex multicellular fungi.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The emergence of multicellularity has been one of the most influential transitions in evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Knoll, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Smith and Szathmary, 1995</xref>). However, while simple multicellular aggregations evolved several times and evidence is accumulating that these transitions may not have had as many genetic obstacles as originally thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abedin and King, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kiss et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Nagy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2017</xref>), origins of complex multicellularity (CM) seem to be rare evolutionary events. Simple multicellularity refers to cell aggregations, colonies, or filaments, whereas CM comprises three-dimensional (3D) organisms in which not all cells are in direct contact with the environment. CM probably required the evolution of mechanisms for transport, cell adhesion, and complex developmental programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Knoll, 2011</xref>). Diverse studies suggest that, besides the changes in gene content or protein sequence, the evolution of gene expression and genome regulation is also important in the transition to CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">King et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Merényi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Uniquely across life on Earth, fungi show evidence for multiple evolutionary origins of CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Nagy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). CM in fungi, as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Knoll, 2011</xref>, refers to fruiting bodies and some other 3D structures (e.g., sclerotia, ectomycorrhizae; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Nagy et al., 2018</xref>). CM in fungi is restricted to certain stages of the life cycle and starts by the transition from simple hyphal growth to 3D organization, for example, during the development of sexual fruiting bodies. This allows real-time transcriptomic readouts of changes associated with transitions in complexity level, which make fungi an ideal model system to investigate CM. Fungi reach the highest level of multicellular complexity in fruiting bodies of Agaricomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kües and Navarro-González, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Nagy, 2018</xref>), which includes most industrially cultivated edible and medicinal mushrooms. CM fruiting bodies in the Agaricomycetes have been widely studied by transcriptomic approaches; however, the interpretation of transcriptomes has been complicated by the lack of an understanding of the general principles of transcriptome evolution. This has, among other factors, impeded the definition of core CM- and development-related genes and pathways and thus reaching a general synthesis on the genetics of CM in the Agaricomycetes. Recent studies of fruiting body development reported species-specific and conserved genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krizsán et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>), natural antisense transcripts (NATs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Muraguchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ohm et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shao et al., 2017</xref>), allele-specific expression (ASE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gehrmann et al., 2018</xref>), RNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>), small RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lau et al., 2018</xref>), alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krizsán et al., 2019</xref>), chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Vonk and Ohm, 2021</xref>), as well as developmental hourglass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>); however, how widespread these are during and how significant their contributions to fruiting body development are not known.</p><p>Similarly, several genes and cellular processes have been identified in agaricomycete fruiting bodies. Fruiting bodies are composite structures in which structural cell types enclose reproductive ones (basidia, meiospores) into a protective environment. Basidium and spore development are evolutionarily significantly older than CM fruiting bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Virágh et al., 2021</xref>). The genes underlying basidium and spore development show up in developmental transcriptomes and, if not properly accounted for, can blur signals for real CM-related genes. Accordingly, while some hitherto identified genes can be linked to CM functions (e.g., defense of fruiting bodies; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Künzler, 2018</xref>), most fruiting body-expressed genes, including those related to cell wall remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), transcriptional regulation, selective protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krizsán et al., 2019</xref>), or complex secretomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Almási et al., 2019</xref>), could relate either to CM or more general functions.</p><p>One of the main goals of this study was to systematically tease apart the components and driving forces of transcriptome evolution in a CM fungus. To this end, we examined NATs, ASE, and RNA editing in a well-resolved developmental transcriptome of <italic>Pleurotus ostreatus</italic> (oyster mushroom). We found that developmental expression and ASE of a gene strongly correlate with the gene’s evolutionary age. Building on this observation, the second aim of this study was to identify conserved gene families whose expression patterns associate with CM in the Agaricomycetes. For this, we compared the transcriptomes of eight CM fungi and that of a species with simple sexual development (<italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>). The gene age-related stratification of developmental transcriptomes was prevalent across all examined species; however, these were not compatible with developmental hourglass concept as postulated for animals. Nevertheless, the evolutionary conservation of gene expression allowed the separation of genes related to general sexual processes from ones restricted to CM species, providing functional hypotheses for genes potentially linked to sculpting CM fruiting bodies. These data will help to understand both complex multicellular and simple sexual morphogenesis in Basidiomycete fungi.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overview of new RNA-seq data</title><p>We present highly resolved developmental transcriptome data for <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> (oyster mushroom), one of the three most widely cultured species worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>), as well as for <italic>Pterula gracilis</italic>, a closely related species with a simple fruiting body morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In <italic>P. ostreatus,</italic> we sampled six developmental stages and up to four tissue types within a stage, whereas in <italic>Pt. gracilis</italic>, tissues could not be separated; therefore, we sampled four developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). Strand-specific RNA-seq yielded 15.9–34.0 million reads per sample (Dryad: Table D1). Multidimensional scaling of the normalized transcriptome data accurately identified sample groups with biological replicates being tightly positioned together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Fruiting body samples were grouped in two main groups, the early (primordia and young fruiting bodies) and mature fruiting bodies, irrespective of the tissue types.

However, they showed very little conservation across species, which potentially stems from fast evolution and/or recent origins. It has been proposed that NATs can arise from random promoters as transcriptional noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lloréns-Rico et al., 2016</xref>), a possibility that may be true for several or most, but probably not for all, NATs in <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> and <italic>Pt. gracilis</italic>. The cryptic nature of NATs hardly allows functional inferences to be made (e.g., based on correlated expression with sense genes, see Appendix 2), yet their recent origins and expression patterns suggest that they may be a source of developmental innovation at small timescales (Appendix 2).</p><p>To understand the composition of developmental transcriptomes, we sorted all protein coding genes (including developmentally expressed ones) using a phylostratigraphic approach, in which gene ages are assigned based on the set of species that possess clear orthologs (see Materials and methods). We found that developmental transcriptomes showed a clear gene age patterns: they are dominated by old and young genes in all species, creating ‘U’-shaped distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This shape simply mirrors the genome-wide gene age distribution, indicating that the genomes of the examined species are dominated by conserved and young genes. If we statistically corrected for these U-shaped gene age distributions, we found that genes displayed an enrichment of developmental expression (at FC &gt; 4) among young genes in most species (Fisher’s exact test, FDR-corrected p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that young genes have a disproportionately high share among developmentally expressed ones in fruiting bodies. This could be either because these young genes are needed for sculpting fruiting body morphologies or because in young genes neutrally arising expression variation (i.e., transcriptional noise) is better tolerated than in conserved ones and leads to patterns we recognize as developmental expression.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Proportion of developmentally expressed (DR &gt;4 fold change [FC]) genes in different gene ages.</title><p>* represents significant differences p-value&lt;0.05 (Fisher’s exact test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction).

TAI calculations weigh phylostratigraphic patterns by expression level, thus providing a weighted view of the contribution of young and old genes to the transcriptome. This way, TAIs link gene ages to the developmental hourglass concept, which has been proposed to explain the incorporation of genetic novelty into the developmental programs of CM eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Domazet-Lošo and Tautz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Drost et al., 2017</xref>), including fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>). The hourglass concept posits that evolutionarily older genes are expressed at mid-development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Domazet-Lošo and Tautz, 2010</xref>) while the alternative ‘early conservation’ model implies that old genes are expressed early in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Piasecka et al., 2013</xref>). Fungi do not display developmental transitions (e.g., phylotypic stage, mid-developmental transition) similar to those of metazoans, but they have a complex developmental program, and it has been proposed that the hourglass phenomenon would arise in any species with a sufficiently complex development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Domazet-Lošo et al., 2017</xref>). In fungi, the emergence of fruiting body primordia on vegetative mycelia comprises the largest developmental transition; dimensions change from fractal-like in mycelia to 3D in fruiting bodies, which necessitates turning on several traits for CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Nagy et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, the largest transcriptomic reprogramming (e.g., in terms of differentially or developmentally expressed genes) was reported for this transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krizsán et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sipos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Muraguchi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To test if a developmental hourglass can be found in fungi, we analyzed the transcriptomes of the nine species based on TAIs (see Materials and methods).

Hydrophobins and cerato-platanins are cell surface proteins that confer hydrophobicity to hyphae and are completely missing from the genome of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, probably as a consequence of the adaptation to a primarily yeast-like lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Nagy et al., 2014</xref>).

We also detected a large number of conserved unannotated genes (172 orthogroups) among CM-specific orthogroups.

These genes are conserved across Agaricomycetes, but do not contain any known conserved protein motifs. Functional speculations are hardly possible for the vast majority of unannotated orthogroups, yet their propensity among CM-specific genes underscores the still cryptic nature of CM development in fungi.

We detected evidence for widespread developmental expression of genes, ASE imbalance between parental monokaryons, NATs, but not for RNA editing or the developmental hourglass. We found that the detected phenomena affect genes of various evolutionary ages and speeds to different extents. For example, developmental expression and ASE were most pronounced among evolutionarily young genes. On the other hand, NATs showed no conservation across species, suggesting that they evolve at a high rate. These observations allow us to speculate that the complex interplay of these processes in the transcriptome may provide multiple gears for transcriptome evolution that probably facilitates the incorporation of evolutionary innovations into fruiting body development of Agaricomycetes.</p><p>The availability of the genomes of both parental monokaryons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alfaro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Riley et al., 2014</xref>), as well as new strand-specific RNA-seq data, allowed bioinformatic deconvolution of RNA editing, ASE, and antisense transcription in the <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> transcriptome. We found virtually no evidence for RNA editing, whereas ASE was abundant, which supports a previous report of ASE in CM fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gehrmann et al., 2018</xref>). RNA editing has been recently reported in the Agaricomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>); however, in contrast to the Ascomycota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Teichert et al., 2017</xref>), it displayed no clear-cut enrichment of A-to-I-compatible variants in three previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Teichert, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>) or in this study. Rather, our final candidate RNA-editing sites merely alluded to potential polyA site- and/or read alignment inaccuracies, leading us to conclude that RNA editing is not abundant in <italic>P. ostreatus</italic>.</p><p>On the other hand, ASE was detected in thousands of genes in <italic>P. ostreatus</italic>. In a previous study on <italic>A. bisporus,</italic> ASE was interpreted as a regulated and adaptive mechanism that could, for example, aid the division of labor between nuclei in a dikaryotic hyphal cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gehrmann et al., 2018</xref>). We found that in <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> ASE is characteristic of young genes and likely arises from promoter divergence, which creates a cellular environment with divergent <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory alleles but identical <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory elements. At the same time, young genes are known to be under weaker evolutionary constraint than conserved ones, raising the possibility that ASE might arise neutrally in the transcriptome. This would be consistent with the neutral model of expression evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fay and Wittkopp, 2008</xref>) and nonadaptive explanations, such as leaky regulation or transcriptional noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Khan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Shih and Fay, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wainer-Katsir and Linial, 2019</xref>). Under this interpretation, ASE may be a tolerated, rather than an adaptive phenomenon in agaricomycete fungi. However, even if neutral at the level of the individual, ASE may generate useful gene expression variation that can serve as substrate for adaptive evolution (even for developmental functions), similar to how transcription from random promoters can facilitate de novo gene birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Van Oss and Carvunis, 2019</xref>). Indeed, we detected ASE for several fast-evolving development-related genes, such as hydrophobins or the putatively defense-related dikaritin-synthesis family. ASE may have important implications in mushroom breeding, where intraspecific hybrids (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gaitán-Hernández and Salmones, 2008</xref>) harboring <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory alleles with various levels of divergence may show differences in industrially relevant traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gehrmann et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>As in the case of ASE, young genes might display more expression variance and noise across development, whereas genes with conserved developmental expression more likely provide clues about key CM functions. Fruiting bodies integrate several ancient processes, such as mitosis/meiosis and sporulation, which are conserved across all organisms and fungi, respectively, but distinct from CM morphogenesis. These considerations led us to design analyses that remove both young and very ancient genes. These helped us distinguish conserved genes related to simple sexual development from those characteristic of only CM species. This may also help establishing a minimal model of sexual development (e.g., for pathogens like <italic>C. neoformans</italic>) in the Basidiomycota, which include several genes previously considered specifically expressed in fruiting bodies. Notable examples include fasciclins, which have been implicated in cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Nagy et al., 2018</xref>), and the <italic>PriA</italic> family of secreted cell surface proteins (including <italic>C. neoformans</italic> cfl1 and dha1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gyawali et al., 2017</xref>) with unknown function. On the other hand, this strategy yielded a focused set of 868 orthogroups that comprised genes developmentally expressed only in CM species not in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. We speculate that these genes contain those related to CM morphogenesis, although this will need to be verified by functional studies in the future. Indeed, CM-specific orthogroups identified regulatory genes reported in mushrooms (e.g., hom1, fst3, fst4, wc1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kamada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Ohm et al., 2011</xref>) but also novel ones, such as a velvet factor that is widely conserved in Agaricomycetes and showed stipe-specific expression in CM species. We anticipate that these orthogroups will comprise a valuable resource for functional studies of CM morphogenesis in fungi that, with continuous developments of genetic engineering methods, will make it possible to address the developmental roles of these genes at scale.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Pleurotus ostreatus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N001</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CETC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CECT-20600</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wild-type dikaryotic strain</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Pterula gracilis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CBS 309.79</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CBS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CBS 309.79</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wild-type dikaryotic strain</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Growth condition, sampling, and RNA-sequencing</title><p>For fruiting the dikaryotic strain N001 (CECT-20600) of <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> (recently interpreted as <italic>P. cf. floridanus;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Li et al., 2019</xref>), we first prepared spawn by inoculating sterilized rye and incubating for 10 days.

This strategy was stricter than the abovementioned orthogroup definition and was required to obtain functionally highly similar protein sets for comparing developmentally expressed genes. Proteins of each species were searched against the proteomes of other eight species using the RBH module of MMseqs2 with an e-value cutoff of 1e<sup>-5</sup>. To remove spurious reciprocal best hits, we excluded a protein from the RBH group if its bit score was at least three times lower than the mean bit score of other hits of that query (self-hit excluded) and it shared &lt;50% of its hits with those of the query (RBH_MMSeq.R). The orthogroups (one gene per species) obtained this way comprised considerably more focused gene sets than the approach used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krizsán et al., 2019</xref>.</p><p>Orthogroups, which show developmentally dynamic expression with FC &gt; 2 in at least four species, and with proportion ≥ 0.5, are considered hereafter as conserved developmental orthogroups.

We considered an orthogroup as ‘shared orthogroup’ if the <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> ortholog showed at least FC &gt; 2 developmental expression, while we considered it as ‘CM-specific’ if the <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> ortholog was missing or did not show developmental regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Annotation of genes and gene families</title><p>We detected conserved domains in proteins using InterProScan-5.47–82.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jones et al., 2014</xref>, IPRsimpcomp.R).

A custom pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) was constructed to first classify mismatches either as candidates for ‘RNA editing’' or ‘allele-specific.’ Then, these mismatches were analyzed further in more specialized pipelines. First, we hard trimmed 10–10 nucleotides (nt) from both the 3′ and 5′ end of already quality trimmed reads to decrease the impact of sequencing errors during variant calling. A two-round STAR alignment was performed against both parental genomes (PC15 and PC9) as references, with the abovementioned parameters. Variants were identified with find_edit.awk script excluding bases with a Phred quality value below 30. Nucleotides differing the same way from both parental alleles were considered technical errors (caused by PCR amplification, sequencing, or alignment), somatic mutations, or RNA editing. Therefore, such mismatches were transferred to the RNA editing-specific pipeline. In contrast, variants that differed only from one of the parental genomes were attributed to ASE. The first part of the pipeline yielded the lists of variants that were further analyzed either in the RNA editing-specific pipeline or in ASE pipeline, as follows.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Pipeline of RNA editing and allele-specific expression annotation.</title><p>Names of scripts available in Dryad (doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org.10.5061/dryad.5qfttdz5m">https://doi.org.10.5061/dryad.5qfttdz5m</ext-link>) are displayed next to process boxes.

All reads were assigned to the parental genome to which it exhibited a smaller Hamming distance (Hd = number of SNPs). We assigned a read as indecisive if (i) Hd &gt; 1 from both reference genomes, (ii) Hd &gt; 15 from any of the reference genomes (too divergent read), or (iii) if the Hd was equal to both parental genomes. FPKM values were calculated as described above.</p><p>To describe the relative expression between the two parental nuclei (AS ratio), the number of PC15 reads was divided by the sum of parental-specific reads (PC15 + PC9) for each gene (g) in each sample (s): <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mn>15</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mn>15</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mn>9</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula> . An AS ratio close to 1 means dominant expression from the PC15 nucleus, whereas an AS ratio close to 0 means dominant expression from the PC9 nucleus. An AS ratio ~0.5 indicates equal expression from both nuclei. AS ratios were considered equal (set to 0.5) if (i) the expression was too low (FPKM &lt; 2), (ii) the number of decisive reads was &lt;16, and (iii) the proportion of indecisive reads was greater than 80%. We calculated two further measures, chromosome read ratio (CRR) and nuclear read ratio (NRR) introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gehrmann et al., 2018</xref>, which represent the FPKM values of PC15 nucleus divided by the FPKM values of PC9 summed over chromosomes, and over all genes, respectively.</p><p>We identified genes with twofold (S2) and fourfold (S4) shifted expression between the two nuclei at AS cutoff values of AS &lt; 0.31 or AS &gt; 0.68 (corresponding to 5% quantile of all AS ratio values) and AS &lt; 0.2 or AS &gt; 0.8, respectively. For passing through, these filters and geometric means of replicates had to reach the upper limits (0.68 or 0.8) for PC15-specific ASE or less than lower limits (0.31 or 0.2) for PC9-specific ASE.</p><p>In order to understand how ASE may arise mechanistically, we compared putative promoters of ASE genes among parents, defined as the region from spanning 1000 nt upstream to 200 nt downstream of the transcription start site. Differences between the two parental regions were expressed as percent identity. For this analysis, the meanwhile released, improved version of PC9 was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). Protein sequences of parents were aligned with PRANK and an ML distance was calculated under WAG model (dist.ml function from phangorn R package; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Schliep, 2011</xref>). Gene pairs with putative promoters &lt;75% similar or where protein ML distances were &gt;0.5 and alignment coverage &lt;0.7 were removed to avoid potential orthology assignment errors. To identify the strength of selection for these genes, we inferred ω (dN/dS ratios) under two evolutionary models using CodeML, a program from PAML 4.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Yang, 2007</xref>). For this, CDSs from the genomes of species in the Pleurotinae clade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4a</xref>) were extracted using GenomicFeatures packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>). 1:1 orthologs were detected with MMseqs RBH function and codon aligned using –code option of PRANK. Reference tree for CodeML was extracted from the species tree, and ω values were calculated under 1-ratio (M0) model assuming that ω has been constant throughout the tree and free‐ratio model (fb) allowing an independent ω for each branch in the tree. For statistical comparisons, the Kruskal–Wallis rank-sum test with Nemenyi post hoc test or paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Fisher’s exact test were implemented in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">R Development Core Team, 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Resources, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Software, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Resources, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Software, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Literature-collected developmental genes in <italic>Coprinopsis cinerea</italic> and <italic>Pleurotus</italic> sp.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-71348-supp1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>InterPro domain enrichment analysis for genes with allele-specific expression (S2 and S4) among all IPR annotated genes.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-71348-supp2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Conserved 1:1 ortholog groups.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-71348-supp3-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Species that were used for transcriptomic analysis and for species tree.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-71348-supp4-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Gene Ontology enrichment for complex multicellularity (CM)-specific and shared orthologs.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-71348-supp5-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-71348-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Raw RNA-Seq reads have been deposited to NCBI's GEO archive (GSE176181).

sec-type="appendix"><title>Identification of gene clusters</title><p>Genes contributing to the same phenotype can occasionally be found clustered together in fungal genomes. Because such clustering is predicted to both facilitate gene co-expression and maintain linkage over long periods of evolutionary time, we tested whether any developmentally expressed genes were physically clustered together more often than expected by chance, and whether any of these clusters were conserved across species. Furthermore, since many secondary metabolites encoded by gene clusters play a role in development, we tested if any of these developmentally expressed gene clusters might overlap with predicted biosynthetic gene clusters in eight Basidiomycota species, including <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> and <italic>Pt. gracilis</italic> (Dryad: Table D2). We first designated all developmentally expressed genes separated by six or less intervening genes as candidate clusters. We then calculated the probability of observing each cluster using a binomial test, where expected cluster size was estimated assuming that developmentally expressed genes are randomly distributed in the genome. Clusters with a probability of observation &lt;0.01 were designated clustering ‘hotspots.’ We checked hotspots for overlap with predicted biosynthetic gene clusters using de novo antiSMASH v5 annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Medema et al., 2011</xref>). Conservation of hotspots between different fungal species was assessed by BLASTp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) using two metrics: percent gene content similarity, which is the number of genes in the query hotspot that are also clustered together in the target genome; and percent FDBR similarity, which is the number of developmentally expressed genes in the query hotspot that are also developmentally expressed and clustered together in the target genome.</p></sec><sec id="s8" sec-type="appendix"><title>Developmental gene clusters are not conserved</title><p>Having established that the developmental hourglass may not apply to fungi, we next asked if we can find evidence in fungi for the physical clustering of developmental genes in the genome, a characteristic of several key genes involved in animal pattern formation. Certain fungal genes, such as those encoding secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways, are well known to cluster physically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Keller, 2019</xref>), whereas similar traits for developmental genes have not yet been investigated. We found evidence for the occasional grouping of developmentally expressed genes into hotspots in the genomes (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>, Dryad: Table D2). Altogether 153 hotspots were detected in eight genomes; however, most of these were species-specific and not conserved across species (e.g., the luciferase cluster in the bioluminescent <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ke et al., 2020</xref>). Surprisingly, most hotspots did not overlap with predicted biosynthetic gene clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/00181/figures#fig7s1">—figure</ext-link> 2</xref>).

For de novo transcript assembly, quality filtered reads were first mapped to the reference genome using STAR_2.6.1a_08–27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Veeneman et al., 2016</xref>). After identifying splice sites, a second mapping was performed. StringTie version 2.0.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Pertea et al., 2015</xref>) was used to generate a genome-guided de novo transcriptome assembly and annotation (NATextractor.R). Transcripts shorter than 200 nt or supported by &lt;5 reads in a single sample were excluded. Output GTF files from each sample were merged, compared to the reference annotation with gffcompare v0.11.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Pertea and Pertea, 2020</xref>), and transcripts with exonic overlap on the opposite strand (i.e., antisense; class_code x) were retained.

We continued the analysis with only those variants that had ≥3 supporting reads, mapped to both reference genomes, and the total read support did not differ more than five times between the two parental mappings in order to avoid signal coming purely from the differential mapping to the two reference genomes (e.g., erroneous alignment). Further, we removed variants where read coverage was &lt;10, a single variant was supported by &lt;3 reads, or the proportion of the variant was below 0.1% in order to reduce the effect of technical errors, but retain editing sites. Because erroneous alignment around splice sites can produce variants indistinguishable from editing events, we discarded variants in which multiple sites with mismatches grouped within 3 nt distance of each other and in which the proportion of gaps exceeded 80% of the read coverage. After this step, we kept only variants that were present in at least two biological replicates. In addition, for a variant to be considered an RNA editing site, it had to be significantly more frequent across all samples (Wilcoxon rank-sum test with p&lt;0.01) than any other nucleotide at that site (except reference). Finally, we considered a site an RNA editing site if the geometric mean of its frequencies across the three replicates exceeded 1%. Relative to the editing site, –3 upstream and +3 downstream surrounding sequences were extracted with rtracklayer package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lawrence et al., 2009</xref>) and motifs were searched with the seqlogo package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bembom and Ivanek, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s12" sec-type="appendix"><title>RNA editing is not abundant in fruiting body transcriptomes</title><p>In the RNA editing pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), 627,093 of the 1,999,221 input variants remained after filtering for extreme low frequency (&lt;0.1%). We chose this permissive threshold (as opposed to 1/3/10% in other protocols; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>) to avoid discarding any signal in the early steps. As many as 546,790 sites were located in gene regions, of which 346,105 possibly corresponded to erroneous mapping around splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1</xref>), while 218,685 were retained for further analysis. Surprisingly, only 1.2% of these (2701 sites) were consistent between at least two of the three biological replicates. After eliminating potential sequencing errors (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p-value&lt;0.01), we obtained 1179 variants. Requiring at least 1% mean variant frequency in at least one stage left 332 potential RNA editing sites, with 6–62 in each variant type (Dryad: Table D5).

However, because 69% (20 of 29) of these were within ±20 nt from the 3′ end of the last exon of genes, we think that adenine enrichment corresponds to the polyadenylation sequence.

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, including Luis F Larrondo as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jason Stajich (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript needs to better integrate and streamline the analyses to clarify the paper's main question. For example, as indicated by REV#2, a clear message about what types of transcripts are linked to multicellularity is missing: instead of just mentioning DEGs in critical stages, more context is needed regarding the ones playing a key role in development and how they are regulated.</p><p>2) An in-depth analysis of the most relevant genes and pathways is necessary. While one could think of experimental validation (i.e. knocking out/ overexpressing candidate genes), taking in consideration that the paper has a main evolutionary context, a more in-depth analysis of genes/regulatory motifs/pathways and a better description of the associated gene programs could be an alternative. Likewise, they need to better elaborate some connections between sections of the manuscript (i.e. hourglass model and ASE), and provide case examples for other key aspects of the manuscript (i.e point 4 by REV#3)</p><p>3) The reviewers suggested that some of the data should be removed from the manuscript as it does not clearly contribute to the main point that is trying to make. This also applies to supplementary data. Moreover, they indicated that there is a very large number of supplementary files (tables and figures), where the presented data is not always clearly described. The authors should more finely curate what is included, removing data that is not essential.</p><p>4) Several of the sections need to be restructured (paying attention on how/when Figure panels are cited), condensed (i.e. non coding RNA) or shortened/removed (RNA editing). Other sections need to be better explained (i.e. related to conde present in Dyad). See also other Figure restructuring suggestions (REV#4).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall the manuscript is complex, and may be hard to follow for a general audience, which precludes grasping its overall message. Yet, the work raises some relevant observations that are of interest to colleagues working on fungi as well as other organisms exhibiting complex multicellularity. Particularly, the data appears to downplay the developmental hourglass concept that had been amply proposed in animals and plants, and lately also in fungi. Importantly, in the study by Merényi et al., some of the examined fungi revealed profiles compatible with a developmental hourglass (P. ostreatus, M. kentingensis and A. bisporus), whereas the other datasets argued otherwise, Thus, it will be interesting to see what future studies by this and other groups show regarding the mechanisms incorporating genetic novelty in developmental programs such as complex multicellularity.</p><p>Line 42: &quot;Recent research suggests&quot;</p><p>Replace by &quot;Diverse studies suggest&quot;</p><p>Line 57: &quot;This has impeded a general synthesis on the genetics of CM in fungi&quot;</p><p>Try to rephrase, or expand, this phrase.</p><p>Figure 2: &quot;(d) percent sequence identity&quot;</p><p>Please check legend/figure Y axis</p><p>Line 218: &quot;At the same time, they are significantly underrepresented in the three oldest age categories&quot;</p><p>The analysis fails to include the behavior of one of the oldest gene groups (4), which has by far the lowest level of ASE expression.</p><p>Line 215: &quot;ASE genes showed a strong and significant overrepresentation in the three youngest gene ages&quot;.</p><p>Examination of the data does not seem to reflect that, as group 20 has a rather low ASE representation. On the other hand, other young groups (17, 18, and 19) appear to better match that description.</p><p>Line 229: &quot;The strongest overrepresentation of ASE genes can be observed among developmentally expressed genes that arose in the last common ancestor of Pleurotus (gene age 18)&quot;</p><p>The circle size of group 18 is by far the smallest one, indicating a small number of proteins included in such group. Would the authors care to comment?</p><p>The paragraph starting in Line 247: &quot;In P. ostreatus we identified 166 NATs (8.1%) that showed at least 2-fold higher expression in all fruiting body stages than in vegetative mycelium, comparatively more than genes (4.8%). Such transcripts may regulate the transition from simple multicellularity in VM to complex multicellularity in FB, one of the most significant transcriptomic reprogramming events in the fungal life cycle (Krizsán et al., 2019). Kim et al. (2018) found a similar proportion (21.3%, 547 of 2,574) of lncRNA that might have a role in sexual development of Fusarium graminearum&quot;.</p><p>This phrase is somehow confusing: the authors specify 8.1%, and then they comment that 21.3% is a similar proportion.</p><p>The paragraph starting in Line 247:</p><p>This may be a misleading comparison as they are paralleling their analyses on NATs to lncRNAs (which only in some cases may correspond to antisense RNAs).</p><p>Line 249: &quot;comparatively more than genes (4.8%)&quot;</p><p>Genes?

Therefore, it becomes confusing to distinguish when the authors are exclusively taking about NATs and when they are not.</p><p>Line 411: &quot;We found that in P. ostreatus ASE is characteristic of young genes and likely arises from promoter divergence, which creates a cellular environment with divergent cis regulatory alleles but identical trans-regulatory elements&quot;.</p><p>This is an interesting observation and hypothesis. As the authors analyses includes promoter divergence, the discussion (or even the results) would benefit from a couple of clear examples. Although there is rather scarce information of cis-trans pairs specificity in filamentous fungi (even less in basidiomycetes), this can be inferred for closely related DNA Binding Domains (DBDs) (see i.e. 25215497 or 31742324)</p><p>Line 440: &quot;Our strategy also identified regulatory genes which are developmentally expressed only in CM species, including certain transcription factors reported in mushrooms (e.g. hom1, fst3, fst4, wc1)&quot;</p><p>While these examples are highlighted in the discussion, they are not clearly described in the Results section. This should be emended, particularly as it would help to bring down to earth some of the general results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I found it difficult to find the main message of the paper in the data. The authors carry out extensive bioinformatic analyses of their RNA-Seq data, and go further to categorize different types of transcripts than most work, however while documenting the levels of these different transcript types there did not emerge a clear message about what types of transcripts are linked to multicellularity. There is context that is missing about the genes not just differentially expressed in the stages but those that are known to play a key role in development and how they are regulated.</p><p>The message would be more clear if the authors streamlined the manuscript to focus on their main findings. There are a very large number of supplementary table and figure files, and the data presented is not always clearly described. The authors should more finely curate what is included, removing data that is not essential (as it is not described or described only very briefly, such as the lack of clustering of differentially expressed genes, and shorten those that are reporting negative results, such as the section on RNA editing).</p><p>There is also more context needed in explaining the stages that were sampled (see comments below) and how regulation differs between stages. From Figure 1, VM appears to be very different from the others, a higher TAI and the low expression of meiotic genes. How can the transcriptional changes be related back to the cellular or multicellular structure of these stages?</p><p>There appear to be conflicting data assessing a developmental hourglass, first in Figure S5 (line 112-113) that rejects a general hourglass using the TAI and then support for an hourglass through analysis of gene age (line 294-7, Figure 4b). How can these results be understood together?</p><p>Overall, it was difficult to assess the likely importance and certainty of the predictions of the antisense transcripts. The whole section (234-282) describes a thorough analysis of these transcripts, however the low conservation raises questions of whether the majority are transcriptional noise. Without more support for a role for these transcripts, perhaps focusing on those that are the most highly expressed, this section seems preliminary and should be condensed.</p><p>There were major issues with data presentation that the authors need to address. First, many figure panels were discussed out of order, leading to confusion when looking through each figure while reading the text. The authors should consider reordering panels and splitting figures so that the flow is smoother. For example, the text refers to Figure 2c, then back to Figure 1, then Figure 2d , Figure 2e, followed by Figure 2b, with Figure 2A never discussed. Second, there are callouts for panels that are missing or incorrect. There is no panel 1d (line 115, perhaps this refers to one of the two panels under 1b?) or 4g (line 319), and the callouts for many of the panels of Figure 4 appear incorrect (for example 4c at lines 295 and 298 appears to refer to 4b, 4c at line 309 appears to refer to 4d). Figure S19 is clipped (parts a and b) in the pdf version provided for review. I recommend adding a main figure panel of the species tree of the transcriptomes compared with inferred CM node transitions highlighted; many analyses in the paper are in the context of the species tree and this should be shown more clearly in a main figure. Figure 3, which has the species tree however too small to view, has a different issue of appearing to make a fairly straightforward point low conservation of ASE with the exception of one species comparison, however the different scale between the two panels does not support direct comparisons to sense transcripts, and it is difficult to understand why the figure is shown if there is not a larger point about types of sense transcripts that are highly conserved. Based on this I would recommend Figure 3 be moved to the supplement.</p><p>Line 102: The differential expression analysis needs to be described in full in the methods (line 502 only references an earlier paper). Currently there is no context to understand what comparisons were used to define the developmentally expressed genes. Please also clarify how Pt is &quot;within the range reported&quot; earlier as the 4FC value appears an outlier in Figure S4.</p><p>Lines 108-109: This introduction of stages would benefit from more detain as to the major transitions vs growth points sampled.</p><p>Line 112: A. ostoye appears to have a pattern very similar to A. bisporus- how were hourglass patterns defined, and were the sampling conditions likely to have contributed to some species not showing this pattern?</p><p>Line 113: Figure 1b needs a more detailed legend, possibly split into 2 panels.

Please also clarify the genome used as a reference including the source of the data (ie accession).</p><p>L159: While the GO terms reported here are found in some versions of the tables/figure, they do not appear to be the most significant results and are lost in some comparisons (ie the tab of only FBDR4 in Table S5). There needs to be more context here of the overall patterns to avoid selective reporting, and also clearer guidance for how to interpret the different results shown in the multiple analyses in Tables S5-6.</p><p>Line 216; Explain how gene age is calculated (methods and Figure 2b legend). While three of the youngest appear highly over-represented for ASE, that does not appear to be the case for gene age 20. Are stages 4 and 20 under-represented by based on the species tree (ie v few genes in these sets)?</p><p>Line 312-3: There appears to be some circular logic here, as shared orthogroups would by definition pre-date all species. Please clarify.</p><p>Line 315-7: These gene categories are difficult to match to the figure.</p><p>Line 365: Is C. neoformans the only low complexity species available for comparison in this data set? Some gene losses may more relate to the specialization of these species as human pathogens and notably smaller gene sets compared with many Basidiomycetes.</p><p>In the MDS plots (FiguresS3, S7, S20), it is difficult to clearly see how replicates are clustered. Can the authors add a data point for each measurement and offset the names so that they overlap less. It would also be helpful to comment more on the relationships of samples that appear to overlap, ie whether they are from closely related developmental stages or samples.</p><p>The authors have deposited the RNA-Seq data in the GEO and also made code available on Dryad. Connecting to Dryad, to see what was there, I was surprised by how much code they have made available as this isn't clearly described in the methods section. It would be helpful for readers to call out more specifically code that is available in Dryad (for example, referring to a &quot;custom awk script&quot; at line 623).</p><p>The authors reference using 109 genomes from the JGI genome portal. Are all of these public without restrictions or approved for use in this study? JGI has recently raised concerns with use of some of their data that was under use restrictions.</p><p>There are two references that are not correctly formatted as they have no source, Alexa et al. and Bembom et al.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 1 the highest level of transcriptome conservation coincided with mitotic/meiotic gene upregulation.

Nevertheless, there are still some aspects that need additional modification to avoid overstatements, as some of the analyses lead to interesting speculations which are not necessarily bulletproof conclusions. To turn the former in the latter one would need experimental validation. Nevertheless, that would be a daunting task considering the characteristics of the fungi under study. The alternative is to tone down what may be presented as conclusions and present them more as speculations (i.e. the datasets strongly suggest… the analyses allow us to speculate that…).</p><p>1. For example, reviewer 3 indicates: &quot;The identification of CM-related genes does not include experimental validation (either partial or indirect). The proposed list is therefore speculative, and any evolutionary inference is dependent on the validity of this CM-related gene candidates. I acknowledge validation can be seen as follow up work, in which case I would urge the authors not to overstate the validity of their candidate list'. Related to that, Rev#2 also indicates the lack of in depth-analysis of the relevant proposed genes.</p><p>2. Likewise, some aspects of the text may need to be better connected/ presented. Indeed, even though the datasets on global expression are extremely interesting a main point of the manuscript on how gene age, NATs and ASE contribute to CM still needs to be better explained.</p><p>3. Along the same lines, it is important not to generalize the impact of the fungi as they may or may not be applicable to CM in all fungi (basidiomycetes, etc).</p><p>Regarding the data on PWM, the authors may be correct that there is too much noise in the current data to consider including it at some point. Nevertheless, such analyses, complemented with reporter systems and evaluating the different alleles' promoters may be an interesting future study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed the points raised in the prior review and made major updates to the manuscript that have improved the clarity of the main findings. In my view, the only area not addressed in depth concerns the summary comment 2, recommending that &quot; an in-depth analysis of the most relevant genes and pathways is necessary&quot;. The authors have added some additional detail on gene functions and homologs, however this seems limited, and the authors note that this is in part due to the lack of prior predictive functional information for such developmental genes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this revised manuscript, Merenyi et al. have provided very useful new elements of context and logic to clarify the rationale of their study. I appreciated very much making the list of CM gene candidates explicit and the comments on a number of molecular functions that may be relevant. There has been an effort to connect pieces of the study together that allowed me to get a better view of the overall reasoning and implications of the work. Nevertheless, I believe there is a need to further clarify the overall study objectives and logic, and to avoid overstatements.</p><p>Indeed, I still find the study objectives fuzzy and the logic somewhat confusing. L77-79 states &quot;The goal of this study was to systematically tease apart the components and driving forces of transcriptome evolution in CM fungi and to identify conserved CM-related genes in the Agaricomycetes&quot;, L60-66: &quot;how species-specific and conserved genes, long non-coding RNA, natural antisense transcripts, allele specific expression, small RNA, […] contribute to CM is not known&quot;. In the response to reviewers' comments: &quot;one of the novel aspects of our manuscript is the identification of a very specific set of candidate genes&quot;. In my view these are incompletely met in this manuscript for the following reasons.</p><p>1. The identification of CM-related genes does not include experimental validation (either partial or indirect). The proposed list is therefore speculative, and any evolutionary inference is dependent on the validity of this CM-related gene candidates. I acknowledge validation can be seen as follow up work, in which case I would urge the authors not to overstate the validity of their candidate list.</p><p>2. The distinction between CM gene candidates and sexual development genes comes at the end of the Results section with the comparison with C. neoformans, after evolutionary/conservation analyses are presented: While CM-gene candidates are identified in the section L524 and on (&quot;To distinguish genes related to basic sexual processes […] from those related to CM&quot;), some analyses are presumably targeted to CM gene candidates earlier in the manuscript, such as L166 (&quot;To examine how these young genes contribute to the CM transcriptome&quot;), L194 (&quot;young genes […] do not have a uniform contribution to CM development&quot;), L288 (&quot;These examples highlighted the importance of allele specific expression in generating expression variance in CM-related genes&quot;). With an aim to study evolutionary/conservation patterns in CM genes, I would have expected the identification of CM genes to be reported first.</p><p>From the response to previous reviewers' comments, I understand that the TAI pattern and NAT occurrence are not significantly different between CM gene candidates and sexual development genes, while ASE is characteristic for young genes regardless of their putative involvement in CM. Although global patterns are interesting, how gene age, NATs and ASE contribute to CM therefore remains elusive to me.</p><p>3. In a number of places, the authors tend to generalize their findings to multiple fungal lineages while some of the analysis only include one or two species (P. ostreatus and Pt. gracilis). For instance, L77 &quot;the components […] of transcriptome evolution in CM fungi&quot; such as NATs and ASE are studied in P. ostreatus and Pt. gracilis and generalization to CM fungi might be premature. L22-25 &quot;We here reveal that allele-specific expression, natural antisense transcripts […] act in concert to shape the transcriptome of complex multicellular fruiting bodies of fungi&quot; is in fact shown for P. ostreatus only. In the title &quot;the transcriptional landscape of sexual morphogenesis&quot; has been studied mostly in P. ostratus and may not generalize to &quot;multicellular fungi&quot;. Given the diverse patterns revealed by the TAI analysis encompassing multiple species, whether the ASE and RNA editing patterns are &quot;general principles&quot; (L213) remains speculative.</p><p>4. The &quot;predictive value&quot; of the study put forward in the title and abstract is confusing to me. e.g. L25 &quot;evolutionary age predicts, to a large extent, the behaviour of a gene in the CM transcriptome&quot;, it is not completely clear to me what can be predicted. I am rather used to see the term &quot;predict&quot; used in relation to a formal model the performances of which are quantitatively evaluated. Generally speaking, the connection between the manuscript title, the proposed study objectives and major findings from the work is quite cryptic to me.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71348.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript needs to better integrate and streamline the analyses to clarify the paper's main question. For example, as indicated by REV#2, a clear message about what types of transcripts are linked to multicellularity is missing: instead of just mentioning DEGs in critical stages, more context is needed regarding the ones playing a key role in development and how they are regulated.</p></disp-quote><p>We reworked the manuscript to highlight the main messages better and in the revised version provide more context on multicellularity-related transcripts in the sections on ASE and sexual and CM development (see lines 272-288, 615-626, 631-638 and Figure 5, Figure 8 figure supplement 1). We highlighted development-related transcription factors, hydrophobins and other genes associated with multicellularity in fungi. We also note that the genetic bases of multicellular development are very poorly known in the Basidiomycota, as a consequence, the vast majority of genes in conserved orthogroups are new predictions without functional verification at the moment. Therefore, we interpret these results conservatively in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) An in-depth analysis of the most relevant genes and pathways is necessary. While one could think of experimental validation (i.e. knocking out/ overexpressing candidate genes), taking in consideration that the paper has a main evolutionary context, a more in-depth analysis of genes/regulatory motifs/pathways and a better description of the associated gene programs could be an alternative. Likewise, they need to better elaborate some connections between sections of the manuscript (i.e. hourglass model and ASE), and provide case examples for other key aspects of the manuscript (i.e point 4 by REV#3)</p></disp-quote><p>We reworked the text to better connect parts of the manuscript and highlight logical connections better. We also placed more emphasis on the in-depth analysis of genes related to complex multicellularity (see lines 615-626, 631-638), including case examples. We note, however, that current functional characterizations (e.g. GO/KEGG systems) of fungal genes hardly extend to developmental/complexity related aspects. Therefore, in-depth analyses of multicellularity-related genes are possible only for a quite limited set of genes, whereas inclusive and systematic analyses are impossible at the moment, because key developmental pathways are not known (unlike in the Ascomycota). This is an inherent challenge for mushroom developmental biology, and we hope that our current work contributes to closing this gap in knowledge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reviewers suggested that some of the data should be removed from the manuscript as it does not clearly contribute to the main point that is trying to make. This also applies to supplementary data. Moreover, they indicated that there is a very large number of supplementary files (tables and figures), where the presented data is not always clearly described. The authors should more finely curate what is included, removing data that is not essential.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the manuscript was trying to achieve too much and in the revised version we removed several sections (e.g. developmental gene clusters -&gt; Appendix 1; Natural antisense transcripts -&gt; Appendix 2 and RNA editing -&gt; Appendix 3) and reconsidered the content of the supplementary data carefully (merged Figure S9-10, Table S5-6, Table S8-9, Table S10-11, removed: Figure S8, S11 moved to Dryad Figure S29 Table S1-4, S7, condensed: Figure S28, Figure S26).

Yet, the work raises some relevant observations that are of interest to colleagues working on fungi as well as other organisms exhibiting complex multicellularity. Particularly, the data appears to downplay the developmental hourglass concept that had been amply proposed in animals and plants, and lately also in fungi. Importantly, in the study by Merényi et al., some of the examined fungi revealed profiles compatible with a developmental hourglass (P. ostreatus, M. kentingensis and A. bisporus), whereas the other datasets argued otherwise, Thus, it will be interesting to see what future studies by this and other groups show regarding the mechanisms incorporating genetic novelty in developmental programs such as complex multicellularity.</p><p>Line 42: &quot;Recent research suggests&quot;.</p><p>Replace by &quot;Diverse studies suggest&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 57: “This has impeded a general synthesis on the genetics of CM in fungi”.</p><p>Try to rephrase, or expand, this phrase.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: &quot;(d) percent sequence identity&quot;.</p><p>Please check legend/figure Y axis.</p></disp-quote><p>Y axis corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 218: “At the same time, they are significantly underrepresented in the three oldest age categories”.</p><p>The analysis fails to include the behavior of one of the oldest gene groups (4), which has by far the lowest level of ASE expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment, we included age group 4 (which shows the strongest underrepresentation) in the discussion now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 215: &quot;ASE genes showed a strong and significant overrepresentation in the three youngest gene ages&quot;.</p><p>Examination of the data does not seem to reflect that, as group 20 has a rather low ASE representation. On the other hand, other young groups (17, 18, and 19) appear to better match that description.</p></disp-quote><p>We updated this part. After rerunning the analysis, we find that in fact, age group 20 also aligns with the trendline. The difference comes from a simple change in the analysis method: in our previous analysis, we treated all genes that did not show clear allele-specific expression (based on AS&lt;0.31 or AS&gt;0.68 L1010-1014) as equally expressed (EE), whereas in the new analysis we only consider a gene EE if its expression high enough to decide that the expression between alleles is significantly non-different (0.31 &lt; AS &lt;0.68). This way, although overall we analyzed fewer genes (some genes were lost because they became neither significantly EE nor ASE), but the analysis is conceptually more sound and the patterns are clearer. The explanation why gene age 20 showed the highest change, is that gene age 20 contained the most of those genes that we excluded because of the minimal expression requirement. We updated the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 229: &quot;The strongest overrepresentation of ASE genes can be observed among developmentally expressed genes that arose in the last common ancestor of Pleurotus (gene age 18)&quot;.</p><p>The circle size of group 18 is by far the smallest one, indicating a small number of proteins included in such group.

The authors carry out extensive bioinformatic analyses of their RNA-Seq data, and go further to categorize different types of transcripts than most work, however while documenting the levels of these different transcript types there did not emerge a clear message about what types of transcripts are linked to multicellularity. There is context that is missing about the genes not just differentially expressed in the stages but those that are known to play a key role in development and how they are regulated.</p><p>The message would be more clear if the authors streamlined the manuscript to focus on their main findings. There are a very large number of supplementary table and figure files, and the data presented is not always clearly described. The authors should more finely curate what is included, removing data that is not essential (as it is not described or described only very briefly, such as the lack of clustering of differentially expressed genes, and shorten those that are reporting negative results, such as the section on RNA editing).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s suggestions and have made structural changes to the manuscript to improve the storyline. The main message of the paper is that gene age determines, to a large extent, transcriptomic patterns (first half of ms, NATs, ASE, gene age distributions) and that correcting for this phenomenon helped identifying a narrowed set of genes that might be responsible for sculpting complex multicellular fruiting bodies. In the revised version we highlight these broad conclusions even more. We shortened parts that are circumstantial to the main story and reorganized supplemental data. We also provide more context on the link between transcripts/genes and multicellularity, although we note that this is very poorly known in fungi and one of the novel aspects of our manuscript is the identification of a very specific set of candidate genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is also more context needed in explaining the stages that were sampled (see comments below) and how regulation differs between stages. From Figure 1, VM appears to be very different from the others, a higher TAI and the low expression of meiotic genes. How can the transcriptional changes be related back to the cellular or multicellular structure of these stages?</p></disp-quote><p>Since the specific stages we use are only interesting to mycologists, we prefer to explain the sampled stages in more detail in the Methods section, where we added more details on the sampled stages (see lines 1481-1488). Due to the shortage of information on complex multicellularity in fungi and in general in functional annotations of genes outside the major model organisms (mostly <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Sch. pombe), it is impossible to speculate on broad differences in regulation between VM and fruiting bodies, or on what gene functions might contribute to the high TAI values in vegetative mycelia. Vegetative mycelia is composed mostly of non-dividing cells and is focused on nutrient acquisition and translocation towards the fruiting body, whereas in fruiting bodies active cell proliferation and differentiation takes place. Considering that the emergence of fruiting bodies is a major transcripitional reprogramming event, it is possible that likewise genome-wide regulatory changes (e.g. in chromatin-regulation or -accessibility, changes in histone code) also happen, however, we currently don't have any information on that. Vonk and Ohm (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33854169/) recently provided an example on histone 3 lysine 4 methylation, which showed that dikaryon formation is indeed associated with changes to histone methylation. The field would need more of this kind of study (e.g. with ATAC-Seq, DNAse-Seq), before we can confidently discuss the modes of gene expression regulation in different stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There appear to be conflicting data assessing a developmental hourglass, first in Figure S5 (line 112-113) that rejects a general hourglass using the TAI and then support for an hourglass through analysis of gene age (line 294-7, Figure 4b). How can these results be understood together?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a misunderstanding by the Reviewer. On line 294-297 we refer to the age distribution of genes in the genome, which is not an assessment of the developmental hourglass. In the case of developmental hourglass, the ‘waist’ is caused by young genes being expressed in early and late but not intermediate phases of development. The paragraph on lines 294-7 (and corresponding previous figure S26, now Figure 2) talks about gene ages, where the ‘waist’ is caused by the scarcity of genes in intermediate gene age categories. Every organism has a lot of ancient and a lot of young genes, which is a characteristic of nearly all species. The reviewer is right in that these gene ages are indeed used in the TAI calculations for the developmental hourglass, but are not equal to those. We made a note on this in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, it was difficult to assess the likely importance and certainty of the predictions of the antisense transcripts. The whole section (234-282) describes a thorough analysis of these transcripts, however the low conservation raises questions of whether the majority are transcriptional noise. Without more support for a role for these transcripts, perhaps focusing on those that are the most highly expressed, this section seems preliminary and should be condensed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the antisense transcription is hard to link to multicellularity. Therefore, we moved this section to the supplement. The observation that they show dynamic expression patterns provides some evidence, although it is true, as we pointed out in the manuscript, that a fraction of them may also be transcriptional noise. Based on the structure, length, and expression profile of the detected NATs (see Appendix 2), however, we can exclude the possibility that they are all transcriptional noise, probably several of them are involved in regulating multicellular events. To check this, we reanalyzed the expression dynamics of NATs under a stricter parameter set, essentially excluding all samples with &lt;20 FPKM (instead of 4 in the original analysis). This exercise should work against transcripts that arise from transcriptional noise. We found that the proportions changed, but developmentally regulated NATs were not completely eliminated: 31.9% of NATs are developmentally regulated (57.4% when FPKM&lt;4 is the cutoff). Our results are supported by literature data where there is clear evidence for a developmental role of certain NATs (and lncRNA), although in all cases, these are only based on individual case studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There were major issues with data presentation that the authors need to address. First, many figure panels were discussed out of order, leading to confusion when looking through each figure while reading the text. The authors should consider reordering panels and splitting figures so that the flow is smoother. For example, the text refers to Figure 2c, then back to Figure 1, then Figure 2d, Figure 2e, followed by Figure 2b, with Figure 2A never discussed. Second, there are callouts for panels that are missing or incorrect. There is no panel 1d (line 115, perhaps this refers to one of the two panels under 1b?) or 4g (line 319), and the callouts for many of the panels of Figure 4 appear incorrect (for example 4c at lines 295 and 298 appears to refer to 4b, 4c at line 309 appears to refer to 4d). Figure S19 is clipped (parts a and b in the pdf version provided for review).</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected these mistakes, thanks for noting them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I recommend adding a main figure panel of the species tree of the transcriptomes compared with inferred CM node transitions highlighted; many analyses in the paper are in the context of the species tree and this should be shown more clearly in a main figure. Figure 3, which has the species tree however too small to view, has a different issue of appearing to make a fairly straightforward point low conservation of ASE with the exception of one species comparison, however the different scale between the two panels does not support direct comparisons to sense transcripts, and it is difficult to understand why the figure is shown if there is not a larger point about types of sense transcripts that are highly conserved. Based on this I would recommend Figure 3 be moved to the supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions. We added a species tree to Figure 1 where we marked the emergence of complex multicellularity according to Merenyi et al. 2020 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32191325/ ) and an example for gene age numbering.

Our sampling covers the entire developmental trajectory of each species, so we think that if there was a high conservation time point during development we would have caught it using our samples. Although some species have fewer time points (e.g. Pt. gracilis), this reflects the simplicity of their development, so we think our sampling is complete in these cases too. In accordance with this, to our best knowledge, sampling conditions have not yet been described in the literature to interfere with the detection of hourglass patterns. Therefore, we are confident that species in which we did not detect an hourglass-shaped TAI profile indeed do not show this, should a different sampling regime be applied.</p><p>We note that in the revised manuscript we transitioned from a phylostratum-based TAI calculation (i.e. phylostrata numbered based on node numbers) to a sequential numbering of phylostrata (1,2,3…20), which caused slight differences in the TAI profiles, but the overall message did not change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 113: Figure 1b needs a more detailed legend, possibly split into 2 panels.

We updated the Mann-Kendall analysis part of ms. After rerunning the analysis, we find that in fact, age group 20 also aligns with the trendline. The difference comes from a simple change in the analysis method: in our previous analysis, we treated all genes that did not show clear allele-specific expression (based on AS&lt;0.31 or AS&gt;0.68 L234) as equally expressed (EE), whereas in the new analysis we only consider a gene EE if its expression high enough to decide that the expression between alleles is significantly non-different from equal (0.31 &lt; AS &lt;0.68). This way, although overall we analyzed fewer genes (some genes were lost because they became neither significantly EE nor ASE), but the analysis is conceptually more sound and the inferred patterns are nicer. The explanation why gene age 20 showed the highest change, is that gene age 20 contained the most of those genes that we excluded because of the minimal expression requirement. We updated the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 312-3: There appears to be some circular logic here, as shared orthogroups would by definition pre-date all species.

We find that TAI plots without mitotic/meiotic genes retained the hourglass pattern for P. ostreatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). After several attempts to identify a well-delimited gene group that drives the hourglass pattern (using filters for specifically U-shaped genes, interacting L-shaped and reverse L-shaped genes, removing oldest, youngest genes, specific functional categories, etc.) we came to the conclusion that we cannot pinpoint a single gene group that drives this pattern. Rather, its appears that signal for the hourglass-shape is diffuse among all genes of P. ostreatus. We note here also that, because P. ostreatus is an exception rather than a rule among the 9 examined Agaricomycetes, we do not devote too much space to deciphering driving forces of its hourglass pattern. Rather, we interpret the overall results that simply because fungal CM development is so different from that of animals and plants, the hourglass (or the early-conservation) model does not apply for fungi.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Transcriptome Age Index for only meiotic genes and without them of <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> separately.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71348-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Developmental gene clusters – I found the identification of hotspots not very clear and not very convincing- This section is short and does not seem very useful for the argument of the paper.

To turn the former in the latter one would need experimental validation. Nevertheless, that would be a daunting task considering the characteristics of the fungi under study.

In my view, the only area not addressed in depth concerns the summary comment 2, recommending that &quot; an in-depth analysis of the most relevant genes and pathways is necessary&quot;. The authors have added some additional detail on gene functions and homologs, however this seems limited, and the authors note that this is in part due to the lack of prior predictive functional information for such developmental genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive comments. Indeed, functional knowledge on Basidiomycota developmental biology is too scanty to perform an in-depth functional characterization of the genes we identified. As a workaround to demonstrate the relevance of developmentally expressed genes to complex multicellularity, we performed a validation analysis (see lines 151-155 and Supplementary File 1).

I appreciated very much making the list of CM gene candidates explicit and the comments on a number of molecular functions that may be relevant. There has been an effort to connect pieces of the study together that allowed me to get a better view of the overall reasoning and implications of the work. Nevertheless, I believe there is a need to further clarify the overall study objectives and logic, and to avoid overstatements.</p><p>Indeed, I still find the study objectives fuzzy and the logic somewhat confusing. L77-79 states &quot;The goal of this study was to systematically tease apart the components and driving forces of transcriptome evolution in CM fungi and to identify conserved CM-related genes in the Agaricomycetes&quot;, L60-66: &quot;how species-specific and conserved genes, long non-coding RNA, natural antisense transcripts, allele specific expression, small RNA, […] contribute to CM is not known&quot;. In the response to reviewers' comments: &quot;one of the novel aspects of our manuscript is the identification of a very specific set of candidate genes&quot;. In my view these are incompletely met in this manuscript for the following reasons.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate pointing out these shortcomings and rephrased several parts of the manuscript to clarify our objectives and logic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

The distinction between CM gene candidates and sexual development genes comes at the end of the Results section with the comparison with C. neoformans, after evolutionary/conservation analyses are presented: While CM-gene candidates are identified in the section L524 and on (&quot;To distinguish genes related to basic sexual processes […] from those related to CM&quot;), some analyses are presumably targeted to CM gene candidates earlier in the manuscript, such as L166 (&quot;To examine how these young genes contribute to the CM transcriptome&quot;), L194 (&quot;young genes […] do not have a uniform contribution to CM development&quot;), L288 (&quot;These examples highlighted the importance of allele specific expression in generating expression variance in CM-related genes&quot;). With an aim to study evolutionary/conservation patterns in CM genes, I would have expected the identification of CM genes to be reported first.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for drawing our attention on this confusing word usage. We think the root of this inclarity was improper usage of terms in the ms. In the first part of the manuscript we always referred to the developmentally expressed genes of P. ostreatus (or P.gracilis), while in the second part we refer to conserved ortholog groups which show shared sexual-development related or CM-specific expression. To avoid confusion, we clarified the terminology in the first part of the ms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From the response to previous reviewers' comments, I understand that the TAI pattern and NAT occurrence are not significantly different between CM gene candidates and sexual development genes, while ASE is characteristic for young genes regardless of their putative involvement in CM.

In a number of places, the authors tend to generalize their findings to multiple fungal lineages while some of the analysis only include one or two species (P. ostreatus and Pt. gracilis). For instance, L77 &quot;the components […] of transcriptome evolution in CM fungi&quot; such as NATs and ASE are studied in P. ostreatus and Pt. gracilis and generalization to CM fungi might be premature. L22-25 &quot;We here reveal that allele-specific expression, natural antisense transcripts […] act in concert to shape the transcriptome of complex multicellular fruiting bodies of fungi&quot; is in fact shown for P. ostreatus only. In the title &quot;the transcriptional landscape of sexual morphogenesis&quot; has been studied mostly in P. ostratus and may not generalize to &quot;multicellular fungi&quot;. Given the diverse patterns revealed by the TAI analysis encompassing multiple species, whether the ASE and RNA editing patterns are &quot;general principles&quot; (L213) remains speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the title, revised the abstract and the manuscript to avoid unsupported generalizations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The &quot;predictive value&quot; of the study put forward in the title and abstract is confusing to me. e.g. L25 &quot;evolutionary age predicts, to a large extent, the behaviour of a gene in the CM transcriptome&quot;, it is not completely clear to me what can be predicted. I am rather used to see the term &quot;predict&quot; used in relation to a formal model the performances of which are quantitatively evaluated. Generally speaking, the connection between the manuscript title, the proposed study objectives and major findings from the work is quite cryptic to me.</p></disp-quote><p>We rewrote the abstract and the title, and in the new version of the manuscript we removed the term ‘predict’.</p></body></sub-article></article>
