transcription factors. Whether extrinsic factors maintain the diversity of states across the QSC pool remains unknown. The muscle fiber is a multinucleated syncytium that serves as a niche to QSCs, raising the possibility that the muscle fiber regulates the diversity of states across the QSC pool. Here, we show that the muscle fiber maintains a continuum of quiescent states, through a gradient of Notch ligand, Dll4, produced by the fiber and captured by QSCs. The abundance of Dll4 captured by the QSC correlates with the protein levels of the stem cell (SC) identity marker, Pax7. Niche-specific loss of Dll4 decreases QSC diversity and shifts the continuum to cell states that are biased toward more proliferative and committed fates. We reveal that fiber-derived Mindbomb1 (Mib1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase activates Dll4 and controls the heterogeneous levels of Dll4. In response to injury, with a Dll4-replenished niche, the normal continuum and diversity of the SC pool is restored, demonstrating bidirectionality within the SC continuum. Our data show that a post-translational mechanism controls heterogeneity of Notch ligands in a multinucleated niche cell to maintain a continuum of metastable states within the SC pool during tissue homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>muscle</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>niche</kwd><kwd>cell states</kwd><kwd>heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>metastable</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR060868</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brack</surname><given-names>Andrew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR061002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brack</surname><given-names>Andrew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR076252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brack</surname><given-names>Andrew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32AR067594</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eliazer</surname><given-names>Susan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 DK063720</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brack</surname><given-names>Andrew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10 1S10OD021822-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brack</surname><given-names>Andrew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A gradient of Mib1-Dll4 within multinucleated muscle fibers maintains a continuum of metastable states within the muscle stem cell pool during tissue homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adult muscle stem cells (SCs) are essential for muscle tissue repair. Subsets of the SC pool are endowed with self-renewal potential and others are restricted to differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rocheteau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakkalakal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Scaramozza et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zammit et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Olguin and Olwin, 2004</xref>). This is consistent with a unidirectional and hierarchical relationship between SCs. Intrinsic and extrinsic cues regulate cell fate decisions of activated SCs to self-renew or differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dumont et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuang et al., 2008</xref>). Due to low muscle tissue turnover, SCs exist predominantly in a quiescent state for the majority of adult life. Through single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and transgenic reporter mice it is appreciated that the quiescent muscle stem cell (QSC) pool is molecularly and phenotypically heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DellâOrso et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Micheli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakkalakal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rocheteau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kimmel et al., 2020</xref>). These different cell states enable SCs to exhibit functional heterogeneity in response to activation and injury cues. It is not known how these diverse states are maintained across the QSC pool. SC quiescence is actively maintained by paracrine-acting cues from the muscle fiber, serving as a niche cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bischoff, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eliazer et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast to niche cells across many SC compartments, each muscle fiber is a multinucleated syncytium, that exhibits transcriptional diversity across the myonuclei to provide spatial control for specialized functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Petrany et al., 2020</xref>).

We find no consistent pattern of Dll4 protein along the fibers. Therefore, Dll4 spatial distribution does not map to these known anatomically defined regions of freshly isolated single muscle fibers. In addition, fewer than 10% of fibers are exclusively Dll4<sup>High</sup> or Dll4<sup>low</sup>, suggesting SC diversity is coordinated in a fiber-autonomous manner. Dll4 expression was also variable in regions devoid of SCs, suggesting the presence of an SC does not dictate Dll4 levels along muscle fibers. Instead, the intensity of Dll4 captured by SCs and the Pax7 expression correlated with the level of Dll4 expression along the muscle fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, spatial heterogeneity and levels of niche-derived Dll4 are coupled with a continuum of diverse molecular SC states that are biased to different phenotypic fates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Niche-derived Dll4 maintains SC diversity</title><p>To determine if Dll4 from the muscle fiber controlled SC diversity, we deleted <italic>Dll4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hozumi et al., 2008</xref>) specifically in the adult muscle fibers using a tamoxifen (tmx)-inducible human ACTA<italic>-CreMer</italic> mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McCarthy et al., 2012</xref>) (transgenic mice are herein called as MF-<italic>Dll4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

This argues against differential notch activity to explain the differences in SC loss phenotypes.</p><p>A decrease in SC diversity, number and Pax7 levels can be explained by a loss of Pax7<sup>high</sup> SCs (due to apoptosis or fusion), or a shift in the continuum toward a more committed fusion-competent state, followed by fusion of SCs expressing the lowest levels of Pax7. qRT-PCR on QSCs from control and MF-<italic>Dll4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> revealed a decrease in <italic>Pax7</italic> (SC marker) and an increase in <italic>Myod</italic> (activation marker) and <italic>Myog</italic> (differentiation marker) transcripts (Figure 5B).

This diversity and plasticity are important in the event of an injury, so that all the SCs are not equally lost to activation or differentiation. This continuum is actively maintained in uninjured muscle by the heterogeneous pattern (and levels) of Dll4 and Mib1 on the muscle fibers. Depletion of Dll4 and Mib1 in muscle fibers causes a contraction of the SC continuum toward more homogeneous committed states.</p><p>The spatial localization of the different factors in the cytoplasm of a single multinucleated cell governs the cell state of the SC pool. Expression of Wnt4 along the fiber is ubiquitous, thereby inhibiting proliferation of all SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eliazer et al., 2019</xref>). The heterogeneous expression of Dll4 within the muscle fiber allows the maintenance of a continuum of differentiated states, with SCs in a region of low Dll4 expression are primed to proliferate and differentiate when subjected to injury in vivo or exposed to mitogen in vitro.</p><p>Although snRNA sequencing shows transcriptional heterogeneity within the myonuclei of single muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Petrany et al., 2020</xref>), we show that the transcripts of Dll4 are uniformly expressed along the muscle fiber and the protein expression is heterogeneous. This highlights the importance of protein heterogeneity within single muscle fibers. The varied expression of Dll4 is established by the E3 ligase, Mib1 that adds ubiquitin groups to Dll4 and activates them by a process of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koo, 2007</xref>). The formation of endosomes might play a role in clustering the Dll4 ligand to present them to the adjacent receptors on the QSCs.</p><p>Previous work has shown that Mib1 is essential in postnatal developing muscle to convert proliferating SCs into a quiescent state. Sex hormones activate Notch signaling pathway during puberty, thereby driving SCs into quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we show a different function of Mib1 in adult muscle under homeostatic conditions. In adult muscle fibers, Mib1 regulates the spatial expression and levels of Dll4, and is required to maintain a gradient of commitment states within the QSC pool.</p><p>The deletion of <italic>Mib1</italic> or <italic>Dll4</italic> within the fiber resulted in a 50% diminution of the SC pool, whereas, deletion of <italic>Rbpj</italic> in adult SCs displayed a more robust depletion (&gt;95%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bjornson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mourikis et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that Rbpj might have targets other than the Notch signaling pathway. Deletion of <italic>Rbpj</italic> in SCs also caused the SC pool to precociously differentiate. We propose that SCs sit along a continuum dictated by the levels of fiber-derived Dll4. Disruption of Dll4 and Mib1 levels in the muscle fiber repositions the SCs along the continuum, biasing cell fate outcomes of the whole population.</p><p>Notch ligands added to SCs in vitro promoted quiescence of myoblasts at the expense of differentiation, but did not restore stemness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakai et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, quiescence is not equivalent to stemness; consistent with the observations that only subsets of QSCs possess self-renewal potential in transplantation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rocheteau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sacco et al., 2008</xref>). These data also raise the possibility that Notch signaling directly regulates differentiation potential of a QSC rather than direct regulation of the quiescent state.</p><p>scRNA-seq on cells from regenerating muscle suggests that Dll1 is expressed in a subset of differentiating, Myogenin<sup>+</sup> cells and is important for self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yartseva et al., 2020</xref>). Dll1 expressed in activated and differentiated myogenic cells regulates the self-renewal of neighboring myogenic cells through a process of lateral inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). In vitro experiments using co-culture of primary myoblasts with 3T3 cells overexpressing Dll4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Low et al., 2018</xref>), or with endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Verma et al., 2018</xref>) suggests the importance of the Notch ligand Dll4 in self-renewal at the expense of differentiation. We posit that in the presence of extrinsic cues that drive cell cycle exit (quiescence or differentiation) cells will be fated to quiescence (self-renewal) or differentiation based on location along a continuum. Notch signaling maintains cells in metastable states competent for a return to quiescence.</p><p>Using a low-dose tamoxifen strategy, we were able to demonstrate that decreasing Dll4 shifted the continuum toward commitment, without any change in SC number in the absence of injury. Therefore, QSC pool exists in a series of metastable states that is under the control of niche-derived Dll4. Prior work demonstrated that SCs with low levels of Pax7 are less competent for self-renewal in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rocheteau et al., 2012</xref>). Based on the decrease in Pax7 levels after Dll4 depletion from the niche, we predicted a diminution of the SC pool in response to injury. Instead, the number of SCs and Pax7 levels was increased after injury; restoring them back to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H, I</xref>). This demonstrates a level of plasticity and bidirectional flow of SCs along the continuum to allow the reequilibrium of metastable states after tissue repair is complete. This interpretation is only possible because we developed an approach that allows for the transient loss of Dll4 in the niche prior to injury.</p><p>In the future, it will be interesting to investigate how distinct niche factors that control quiescence versus commitment are coordinated. Our findings provide proof-of-principle for niche-based strategies to modify the fate potential of SCs while residing in a quiescent state.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice were housed and maintained in accordance with the guidelines of the Laboratory Animal Research Center (LARC) of University of California, San Francisco.

The fibers are then rehydrated with a series of decreasing concentrations of methanol and PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 followed by protease digestion, hybridization of the RNA probe, amplification of signal and conjugation with fluorophore.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantitative PCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from single muscle fibers (from EDL muscle), or SCs using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. The RNA was DNAse treated using Turbo DNA free kit (Life Technologies). cDNA was synthesized from RNA using the Superscript First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed in triplicates from 5 ng of RNA per reaction using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR Super Mix-UDG w/ROX (Invitrogen) on a ViiA7 qPCR detection system (Life Technologies). All reactions for RT-qPCR were performed using the following conditions: 50Â°C for 2 min, 95Â°C for 2 min, 40 cycles of a two-step reaction of denaturation at 95Â°C for 15 min, and annealing at 60Â°C for 30 s. The mean Ct values from triplicates were used in the comparative 2<sup>âÎÎCt</sup> method. To analyze the expression of Notch ligands on the adult muscle fiber, 2<sup>âÎCt</sup> method was used. The results were normalized to GAPDH mRNA controls. The primers used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Microarray</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from single muscle fibers of the EDL muscle from postnatal day 3 (p3), postnatal day 7 (p7), and adult mouse hindlimb using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The processing of RNA, hybridization, and analysis is previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eliazer et al., 2019</xref>). The expression values for Notch ligands are log2 transformed and listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>The density maps for Pax7 and Ddx6 intensity were drawn using R. The variance of Pax7 and Ddx6 intensity levels across the SC pool is calculated as the square of standard deviation. The statistical details of experiments can be found in the figure legends. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. No animal was excluded from analysis. All data are represented as mean Â± standard error of the mean. Significance was calculated using the two-tailed unpaired Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-tests (GraphPad Prism 7). The number of replicates (<italic>n</italic>) for each experiment is indicated in the figure legends. Differences were considered statistically different at p &lt; 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Robert S. Krauss (Reviewer #1); Bradley B Olwin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Eliazer et al. report that the Notch ligand Dll4 produced by myobers regulates the fate of muscle stem cells. Identification of such stem cell niche factors is important, and the results are interesting and beneficial to the field. The conclusion that heterogeneous distribution of Dll4 on myofibers maintains a continuum of muscle stem cell fates is, however, not sufficiently supported by the data and therefore premature. While some additional experimentation is asked for, this and most other comments by the reviewers can be addressed by alterations to the text.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Changes to the text are necessary to temper the conclusion that Dll4 signals to maintain a continuum of SC fates and raise alternative interpretations to the data. Additionally, prior work demonstrating that Pax7 protein levels are variable and that the level of Pax7 affects satellite cell fate has been published and specific early papers should be cited (Zammit, JCB 2004; and Olguin, Dev Bio 2004). The title should also be reworded to reflect these changes. Please see the individual reviews for more specific comments on how to address this issue.</p><p>2) <italic>Mib1</italic> regulates multiple Notch ligands. Could <italic>Mib1</italic> deletion affect Notch ligands other than Dll4 that are also expressed by myofibers? This can be addressed by IF of single myofibers for additional Notch ligands reported in Figure S2B.</p><p>3) Expression of Notch pathway target genes should be examined in satellite cells from control and MF-Dll4 mice by qRT-PCR. This will presumably validate Dll4's expected role in maintaining quiescence-promoting Notch signaling and help address the observation that the MF-Dll4 phenotype is less pronounced than the satellite cell-specific RBP-J knockout phenotype.</p><p>4) Additional changes to the text are requested in the comments from individual reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Given the known role of Dll4 as a Notch ligand, it is highly likely that the non-autonomous SC phenotypes are a consequence of reduced Notch pathway activity in these cells. It is important to show that reduced Notch pathway activity has actually occurred. I suggest that the authors FACS sort SCs from control and MF-Dll4 mice and measure the levels of Notch target genes by qRT-PCR. This technique was used in the paper, and a number of validated Notch target genes in SCs have been published.</p><p>2. The conclusions that the amount of Dll4 surrounding individual SCs correlates with Pax7 levels, and that the distribution of Pax7 levels is left-shifted in the absence of Dll4 in fibers, are convincing. High Pax7 levels, as measured with a Pax7-nGFP transgene, have been reported to correlate with greater SC dormancy (Rocheteau et al.). However, the various cells measured in this paper were tested in vitro and not in vivo for true stem cell activity, including self-renewal. Therefore, the conclusion about Dll4 controlling &quot;a continuum of quiescent cell states ranging from deep quiescent, non-committed states to more committed states&quot; (lines 238-239 in the Discussion) seems too strong. Simply tempering the conclusion would suffice.</p><p>3. Figure S1 and Materials and methods: Figure S1D shows that Pax7-nGFP(High) cells incorporate EdU less efficiently than the (Medium) or (Low) cells. A very small percentage of cells overall incorporated EdU. The legend say the cells were in plating medium (10% horse serum) but the Methods section says they were in growth medium (20% FBS plus FGF2). Which is correct? The low percentage of EdU+ cells is more consistent with the former. If so, have the authors tried the latter?</p><p>4. Figure 4 and lines 155-163: Numbers of SCs on single fibers from control and MF-Dll4 mice are similar after culture for 48 hr in 10% serum-containing medium (Figure 4E). Based on the Methods section, I assume this is 10% horse serum (which is mitogen poor), rather than growth medium. The authors conclude that there was compensatory cell proliferation of remaining MF-Dll4 SCs, as there are fewer of these at 30 hr. However, the SC numbers at 48 hr average 5-6 per EDL fiber, which is a typical number found associated with freshly isolated EDL fibers. After 30 hr, the numbers are similar (there are slightly fewer SCs on MF-Dll4 fibers but the difference is small â about one SC per fiber less, on average). It seems to me that there may be very little cell proliferation occurring at all on these fibers, consistent with use of horse serum (if that is indeed the case). It would also be consistent with the published in vivo phenotype of mice lacking RBP-J in SCs. RBP-J-null SCs often incorporate EdU but withdraw from the cell cycle prior to dividing, express myogenin, and precociously differentiate. This phenotype seems more consistent with the data on MF-Dll4 SCs in Figures 4B-F, and would further link the similarity between loss of fiber Dll4 and loss of Notch signaling in SCs.</p><p>5. Figure 5: The area of high <italic>Mib1</italic> protein seems wide relative to the intensity of Dll4 around SCs but still correlates with Pax7 levels in &quot;adjacent&quot; SCs. What area defines &quot;adjacent&quot;?</p><p>6. The textbook view of <italic>Mib1</italic> is that it monoubiquitylates Notch ligands in complex with Notch, leading to ligand endocytosis and Notch receptor activation. In this case, it also seems to play a major role in overall Dll4 localization. It would be worth citing another example of this, as it is not always the case (see for example, Cell Reports 19, 351-363, 2017).</p><p>7. Lines 264-265: Because the MF-Dll4 phenotype is less pronounced than the SC RBP-J knockout phenotype, the authors suggest that RBP-J may have targets other than the Notch pathway. Doesn't it seem more likely that Dll4 is not the only relevant Notch ligand produced by the fiber? Figure S2B shows similar levels of mRNA for additional Notch ligands ae expressed by fibers. The experiment requested in comment 1 will help here too. If reduction of Notch target gene expression is incomplete in MF-Dll4 SCs (relative to that reported with RBP-J removal from SCs), it would be consistent with additional ligands playing a role. If reduction of Notch target gene expression was similar between the two, it would be more consistent with an additional role for RBP-J.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. A conclusive demonstration demonstration that spatial distribution of Dll4 and <italic>Mib1</italic> in myofibers regulate diversity of MuSC state is lacking. While the authors show that such diverse spatial distribution of the two of factors exist in myofibers, that data that they are responsible for determining MuSC heterogeneity are correlative. While genetic deletion of Dll4 or <italic>Mib1</italic> in myofibers resulted in a loss of MuSC diversity and premature activation, this approach complete deletes expression of the proteins, it does not modulate the diversity of Dll4 protein distribution on the myofiber. The resulting effect is that MuSC are prematurely activated due to loss of Dll4-mediated Notch signaling, but it is unclear if this is due to loss of spatial distribution of the proteins as suggested by the authors.</p><p>2. Mib regulates multiple Notch ligands. Does <italic>Mib1</italic> deletion affects other Notch ligands, beyond Dll4, in myofibers?</p><p>3. The authors state &quot;Dll4 expression was also variable in regions devoid of SCs, suggesting the presence of a SC does not dictate Dll4 levels along muscle fibers&quot;. What is the frequency of Dll4 diversity independent of MuSC? Is it a rare event or is as frequent as the one correlated to the presence of MuSC on the myofiber?</p><p>4. While the authors found no correlation with the distance from the NMJ, this does not necessarily mean that there is no correlation with anatomically defined regions of the myofiber. in vivo, different regions of the myofiber are exposed to different local microenvironments, thus it cannot be rule out the possibility that such a correlation exists with other anatomical locations, that are lost upon myofiber isolation from the tissue.</p><p>5. Distinction between Dll4 on myofiber and Dll4 captured by MuSC: it would be useful if the authors would include in the methods how they distinguish Dll4 on myofiber from the Dll4 captured by MuSC.</p><p>6. In Figures 3I, 4K and S5J, it would be useful to include representative image of tissue sections, to support the quantification shown.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>If the authors widen their potential interpretations and do not argue that Dll4 regulates the relative levels of Pax7, I would be open to publishing without additional experiments. The primary observations are highly interesting and I feel the data are over interpreted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68180.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Eliazer et al. report that the Notch ligand Dll4 produced by myobers regulates the fate of muscle stem cells.

We show in this manuscript that the heterogeneous distribution of Dll4 on the muscle fibers maintain stem cell diversity as a continuum of stem cell states (based on Pax7 and Ddx6 levels), that are biased to differential cell fates. What has been shown so far in the literature is the presence of Pax7<sup>high</sup> and Pax7<sup>low</sup> states. We show in this manuscript that there is a range of cell states from high to low based on two different stem cell markers Pax7 and Ddx6 and these states are maintained by the levels of Dll4 in the muscle fiber.</p><p>We have now performed an additional experiment where we manipulate the levels of Dll4 on the fibers by reducing the amount of tamoxifen that is given to the mice. Reducing the levels of Dll4 on the fibers, not completely deleting it, causes a leftward shift (or reduction) in the continuum of quiescent stem cell states (Figure 4-) without a diminution of stem cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Changes to the text are necessary to temper the conclusion that Dll4 signals to maintain a continuum of SC fates and raise alternative interpretations to the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tempered some of the conclusions and discussed alternative interpretations.

Notch reporter levels decreased to below detectable levels in Dll4 null muscle (Figure 3I). Therefore, Dll4 acts non-autonomously to regulate Notch signaling in SCs during homeostasis. Moreover, Dll4 is likely the dominant source of Notch ligands. Therefore, the residual levels of Notch signaling does not explain the milder phenotypes in the two niche depletion models (Dll4 and <italic>Mib1</italic>) compared to SC-specific Rbpj deletion.

The conclusions that the amount of Dll4 surrounding individual SCs correlates with Pax7 levels, and that the distribution of Pax7 levels is left-shifted in the absence of Dll4 in fibers, are convincing. High Pax7 levels, as measured with a Pax7-nGFP transgene, have been reported to correlate with greater SC dormancy (Rocheteau et al.). However, the various cells measured in this paper were tested in vitro and not in vivo for true stem cell activity, including self-renewal. Therefore, the conclusion about Dll4 controlling &quot;a continuum of quiescent cell states ranging from deep quiescent, non-committed states to more committed states&quot; (lines 238-239 in the Discussion) seems too strong. Simply tempering the conclusion would suffice.</p></disp-quote><p>We were careful to not discuss self-renewal potential of the SC subsets because we did not perform the necessary experiments. However, we do clearly show that there is a continuum of states existing in a linear relationship between Pax7 and Ddx6 levels (Figure 1D). This is evidence of a continuum of different states. We used these two markers based on previous work showing their expression is high in quiescent states and decreased early during activation (Crist, C. G., et al., 2012; Zammit, P. S., et al., 2006). In addition, we provide complementary evidence that cell cycle activation rate (S-phase entry) and subsequent induction of Myogenin is related to Pax7 levels at time of isolation (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). These data mirror what was demonstrated by Rocheteau, P., et al., 2012. We have modified this sentence to âOur results provide the first direct demonstration of a Notch ligand from a specific cell type that is critical to maintain a continuum of states within the QSC poolâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The Pax7-nGFP high, medium and low expressers were plated in growth medium (Hamâs F10 media containing 20% FBS and 5ng/ml FGF2). We have corrected the text in the figure legend. In addition, we have repeated the experiment with cells in culture for a longer time-point: 60h. This experiment shows that quiescent SCs sit on a continuum in a linear relationship between Pax7 expression and the time to reach S-phase when activated. This readout is often used as a surrogate for depth of quiescence (Tajbakhsh, Rando and Brack labs). Pax7-nGFP low expressers are faster to enter cycle, followed by the medium and then high GFP expressers. While the Pax7 high and low data was anticipated based on Rocheteau, P., et al., 2012, the Pax7 mid fraction was not examined in their work. Therefore, our work demonstrates a continuum based on Pax7 levels and other quiescent state markers. This new data replaces the previous figure (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

This is consistent with the increased fraction of EdU+/SCs during this window. We have reconfigured the data to help with the comparison (Figure 5C- 5D, Figure 5âfigure supplement 1). If the results mimicked Rbpj, there would be a significant difference in SC number between control and null after 48 hours in culture. Therefore, deletion of Dll4 from the niche does not phenocopy SC deletion of Rbpj.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Hence, it is not possible to analyze Notch ligand expression after <italic>Mib1</italic> deletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors state &quot;Dll4 expression was also variable in regions devoid of SCs, suggesting the presence of a SC does not dictate Dll4 levels along muscle fibers&quot;. What is the frequency of Dll4 diversity independent of MuSC? Is it a rare event or is as frequent as the one correlated to the presence of MuSC on the myofiber?</p></disp-quote><p>A similar range of values and variability is observed in non-MuSC regions. We have stated this in the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. While the authors found no correlation with the distance from the NMJ, this does not necessarily mean that there is no correlation with anatomically defined regions of the myofiber. in vivo, different regions of the myofiber are exposed to different local microenvironments, thus it cannot be rule out the possibility that such a correlation exists with other anatomical locations, that are lost upon myofiber isolation from the tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree with the reviewer. In this manuscript, we focused on the NMJ and MTJ due to their well-defined positions and markers. We have re-written this to be more explicit: We find no consistent pattern of Dll4 protein along the fibers. Therefore, Dll4 spatial distribution does not map to these known anatomically defined regions of freshly-isolated single muscle fibers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Distinction between Dll4 on myofiber and Dll4 captured by MuSC: it would be useful if the authors would include in the methods how they distinguish Dll4 on myofiber from the Dll4 captured by MuSC.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer recommendation. The methods are now included in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figures 3I, 4K and S5J, it would be useful to include representative image of tissue sections, to support the quantification shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included representative images of Pax7 (SC) and laminin (basal lamina) stains in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
