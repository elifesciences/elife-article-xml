clinicopathological-based risk stratification cannot predict LNM accurately. In this study, we detected proteins in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples from 143 LNM-negative and 78 LNM-positive patients with T1 CRC and revealed changes in molecular and biological pathways by label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and established classifiers for predicting LNM in T1 CRC. An effective 55-proteins prediction model was built by machine learning and validated in a training cohort (N=132) and two validation cohorts (VC1, N=42; VC2, N=47), achieved an impressive AUC of 1.00 in the training cohort, 0.96 in VC1 and 0.93 in VC2, respectively. We further built a simplified classifier with nine proteins, and achieved an AUC of 0.824. The simplified classifier was performed excellently in two external validation cohorts. The expression patterns of 13 proteins were confirmed by immunohistochemistry, and the IHC score of five proteins was used to build an IHC predict model with an AUC of 0.825. RHOT2 silence significantly enhanced migration and invasion of colon cancer cells. Our study explored the mechanism of metastasis in T1 CRC and can be used to facilitate the individualized prediction of LNM in patients with T1 CRC, which may provide a guidance for clinical practice in T1 CRC.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most patients with early-stage colorectal cancer can be treated with a minimally invasive procedure. Surgeons use a flexible tool to remove precancerous or cancerous cells, cutting the risk of death from colorectal cancer in half. But a small number of early-stage colorectal cancer patients are at risk of their cancer spreading to the lymph nodes. These patients need more extensive surgery. Clinicians use risk stratification tools to decide which patients need more extensive surgery.</p><p>Unfortunately, the existing risk stratification tools are not very accurate. The current approach, which analyzes colon tissue for cancerous changes, classifies 70% to 80% of early-stage colorectal cancer patients as high risk for cancer spread. But only about 8% to 16% of patients in the high risk group have lymph node metastasis. As a result, many patients undergo unnecessary, invasive surgery.</p><p>Zhuang, Zhuang, Chen, Qin, et al. developed a more accurate way to predict which patients are at risk of lymph node metastasis using proteins. In the experiments, the team analyzed the proteins in tumor samples from 143 patients with early colorectal cancer who did not have lymph node metastases and 78 patients with metastases. Zhuang et al. then used machine learning to build a prediction tool that used 55 proteins to identify patients at risk of metastases. The new approach was more accurate than existing tools and simplified versions with only nine or five proteins also performed better than existing tools.</p><p>This work provides preliminary evidence that protein-based models using as few as five proteins can more accurately identify which patients are at risk of metastasis. These models may reduce the number of patients who undergo unnecessary invasive surgery. The experiments also identified potential targets for therapies to prevent or treat lymph metastases. For example, they showed that low levels of the RHOT2 protein predict metastasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T1 colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>lymph nodes

With the introduction of population-based screening programs, a growing number of early invasive CRCs (T1 CRCs) are being diagnosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zauber et al., 2012</xref>). It is estimated that the endoscopic removal of adenomatous polyps can reduce CRC-related mortality by more than 50%. Evidence suggests that ESD (endoscopic submucosal dissection) alone is an effective option for T1 CRC patients, who are at low risk for developing LNM, while more extensive radical surgery after ESD is needed for only high-risk patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikematsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoda et al., 2013</xref>). According to the current clinical treatment guidelines, which rely on a histopathological examination, approximately 70 to 80% of patients are classified as high risk (poor tumor differentiation, lymphatic/vascular invasion, and depth of submucosal invasion &gt;1000 mm). However, the LN status of only 8 to 16% of patients can be accurately predicted by these guidelines; thus, a large number of LNM-negative patients routinely undergo unnecessary additional surgeries, with an associated postoperative mortality rate of 3–6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanaka et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kobayashi et al., 2011</xref>). The contradiction between the high rate of additional surgical resection and the fact that only a few people have LNM is due to the lack of accurate diagnostic methods. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new method that can effectively determine LNM in T1 CRC.</p><p>Recent studies have focused on accurately predicting lymph node metastasis in T1CRCs to provide references for further postoperative treatment of ESD patients. Unfortunately, current research still has limitations. Previously, Ozawa et al., and Kandimalla et al., used the microRNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression dataset of T1 and T2 CRC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as the training cohort to build predictive models, achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.74 and 0.84, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ozawa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kandimalla et al., 2019</xref>). After that, Wada et al., validated these miRNA and mRNA signatures in the blood samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wada et al., 2021</xref>). These studies unraveled a new paradigm for a more adequate risk assessment and identification of patients who are true candidates for endoscopic treatment or radical surgery. However, these retrospective studies have several limitations, less than 10% of T1 colorectal cancer samples had lymph node metastasis, and almost no specimens removed by ESD were included. Most recently, Kudo et al., developed an algorithm to predict LNM in 4073 patients with T1 CRC by clinicopathological characteristics and achieved an AUC of 0.83 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kudo et al., 2021</xref>). The accurate prediction of LNM in T1 CRC is a crucial but difficult challenge for scientists worldwide.</p><p>Proteins, as executors of biological functions, are receiving much research attention. Several recent proteomic studies of CRC defined new protein signatures, molecular subtypes, and metastasis markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vasaikar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mikula et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saleem et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anwaier et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Du et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2022</xref>) and revealed differences in tumorigenesis between right- and left-sided CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yaeger et al., 2018</xref>). However, these studies focused on advanced-stage CRC rather than early-stage CRC, and proteomic studies of T1NxM0 CRC are still lacking. There was a recent proteomic study using 21 T1 and T2 CRC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Steffen et al., 2021</xref>), however, the sample size of the study is limited.</p><p>Here, we assembled three cohorts of patients with or without LNM (a training cohort, an ESD validation cohort, and a prospective validation cohort). A quantitative proteomics approach was used to analyze a total of 221 patients.

To search for druggable targets in LNM-positive T1 CRC, we investigated 84 proteins that were overrepresented in LNM-positive patients and identified 19 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug targets: F13A1, GBA, GNG2, GUCY1B3, STK3, STK4, VWF, etc. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>).

These potential druggable markers might provide insights into new precision medicine for T1NxM0 CRC and further benefit targeted treatment.</p><p>To further explore the biological processes associated with LNM in T1 CRC, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify enriched pathways. The results revealed that only the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway was significantly enriched (adjusted p-value &lt;0.05) in the LNM-positive group, while no significantly enriched pathways in the LNM-negative group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>). We also examined the expression of EMT-related proteins and found that all of them were up-regulated in the LNM-positive group compared to the LNM-negative group (log2FC &gt;0; p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests), with six proteins showing a significant upregulation (log2FC &gt;1), including CAP2, PLOD1, SERPINE2, etc. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>To verify whether these EMT-associated proteins are unique to T1 CRC, we then employed two published in all stages (T1-T4) CRC datasets, and compared the EMT marker expression between the LNM-positive and LNM-negative groups. We found that the EMT markers that were significantly up-regulated (log2FC &gt;1) in the T1 CRC cohort showed no differences in either the CPTAC or mCRC cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). However, when we focused on the early-stage (T1/T2) CRC individuals from the mCRC cohort and compared the EMT marker expression between the LNM-positive and LNM-negative groups, the EMT markers like SERPINE2 and LRP1 were significantly upregulated in both our cohort and the early-stage CRC group from the mCRC cohort (log2FC &gt;1 and p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). Additionally, PLOD2 was also found to be up-regulated in the LNM-positive group in T1/2 patients in the mCRC cohort. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In summary, EMT might play an essential role during the process of LNM of tumor cells in early-CRC.</p><p>As expected, cytoskeletal remodeling proteins are differently expressed between the two groups. Cytoskeletal organization plays an important role in EMT. Cytoskeletal remodeling proteins, including ABI1, SPTA1, SPTB, ANK1, MRPL46, and ITGA2B were down-regulated in patients with LNM compared with those without LNM (log2FC &lt;-1 and p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Previous research has found that loss of ABI1 contributes to tumor progression through regulation of the EMT-WNT pathway. Cytoskeletal remodeling-related pathway (GO: 0003774) was also found to be up-regulated in LNM-negative patients of the mCRC cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The rearrangement of cytoskeletal proteins might also be responsible for LNM in patients with T1 CRC though EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p><p>We employed single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) in 166 significantly different expressed proteins (log2FC &gt;1 or &lt;-1 and p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (identified in at least 30%, log2FC &gt;1 or &lt;−1 and p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Amino acid metabolism pathways, such as ‘valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation’ (hsa00280) and ‘glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism’ (hsa00260), were found to be enriched in the LNM-negative group (adjusted p≤0.05, limma approach), and related proteins (TMLHE, SLC44A2, SHMT1, and EEF1E1) were up-regulated in the LNM-negative group (Log2FC &lt;1, p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). On the other hand, the LNM-positive group mainly expressed lipid metabolism pathways, such as ‘arachidonic acid metabolism’ (hsa00590) and ‘steroid biosynthesis’ (hsa00100), which are known to promote cancer cell proliferation and migration and are involved in the regulation of EMT. In addition, tumor metastasis-related signaling pathways, such as the MAPK and p53 pathways, as well as cellular process categories (NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis), were enriched in LNM-positive patients. Meanwhile, the mTOR signaling pathway was enriched in the LNM-negative group. The MSI-related protein, MLH1, was significantly up-regulated in LNM-positive group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We also performed comparative pathway enrichment analysis of the differential expressed proteins (LNM + vs. LNM−: p-value &lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests) under different observation percentiles (more than 10%, 30%, and 50%). The results show that the main change pathways are similar at different observation percentiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). Overall, these findings suggest that different metabolic pathways and signaling pathways might contribute to LNM in T1 CRC.</p><p>Interestingly, the LNM-positive group was significantly enriched in coagulation cascades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>), which occurred during EMT, and previous studies have indicated that the inhibition of coagulation greatly limits cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gil-Bernabé et al., 2013</xref>). Twelve of the 84 proteins that were elevated in LNM-positive patients (log2FC &gt;1 and p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) were related to coagulation cascades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>), and many of these 12 proteins are known or suspected to be linked to CRC or other cancer metastasis. For instance, CEACAM6 and SERPINE2 are risk genes for colorectal liver metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beauchemin and Arabzadeh, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergeron et al., 2010</xref>). VWF, SHC1, and CAP2 have been reported to be elevated in LNM-positive patients with gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franchini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liebermeister et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2020a</xref>). Moreover, F13A1 and GPC1 are biomarkers for melanoma metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azimi et al., 2014</xref>). Meanwhile, we found the negative correlations between the cytoskeletal remodeling-related proteins and coagulation cascades, for example, the expression of SPTA1 was negatively correlated with seven coagulation cascades-related proteins including CEACAM6, MAGED2, ISLR, GPC1, SHC1, SERPINB8 and GNG2, MRPL46 showed a negative correlation with five coagulation cascades related proteins. ANK1 and SPTB were also found to be negatively correlated with coagulation cascades. Recent studies have shown that cytoskeletal remodeling can affect complement and coagulation pathway activation. SPTA1 and SPTB are components of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton, and defects in these proteins can lead to hemolytic anemia, which can activate the coagulation cascade. MRPL46 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that may play a role in mitochondrial function, which can affect coagulation and inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, unique protein markers specific to T1 CRC were found in this study, that may improve the understanding of LNM in early-stage CRC. EMT pathway was significantly enriched in the LNM-positive group of T1/2 CRC, and EMT-related proteins were found to be specifically up-regulated in the early-stage CRC LNM-positive group compared to the LNM-negative group. We also found differences in metabolic pathways and signaling pathways between the LNM-positive and negative groups, suggesting that different metabolic pathways and signaling pathways may contribute to LNM in T1 CRC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Characterization of mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma</title><p>In agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikematsu et al., 2013</xref>), in our T1 CRC cohort the ratio of LNM was significantly higher in patients with poorly poor differentiated patients (48.6%) compared with well-moderately differentiated patients, in T1 CRC (28.8%) (p=0.004, chi-square test), Mucinous adenocarcinoma patients (55%) also shown a greater tendency to LNM than adenocarcinoma (30.1%) (p=0.004, chi-square test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and mucinous adenocarcinoma was considered to be a significant risk factor of LNM in T1 CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). More than 50% of patients with mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma had LNM in our study. Thus, we divided our cohort into three subgroups: those with well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (DS1, N=149; LNM ratio: 43 of 149), poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (DS2, N=32; LNM ratio: 13 of 32) and mucinous adenocarcinoma (DS3, N=40; LNM ratio: 22 of 40) (p=0.007, chi-square test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). To identify the molecular characteristics of different groups, we determined the significantly changed proteins in each group (identified in at least 30% and p&lt;0.05, Kruskal-Walli’s test across groups with a log2-fold change [log2FC]&gt;1, mean of DS1/DS2/DS3 vs mean of other two groups) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>). As a result, 140 proteins were overexpressed in DS1(log2FC &gt;1, mean of DS1 vs mean of DS2 and DS3; p&lt;0.05, Kruskal-Walli’s test). Further pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the oxidative phosphorylation and TCA cycle pathways were higher in DS1 than in DS2 and DS3 (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In DS2, 178 proteins were highly expressed (log2FC &gt;1, mean of DS2 vs mean of DS1 and DS3; p&lt;0.05, Kruskal-Walli’s test) and enriched in the GTPase activity and Wnt signaling pathways. In DS3, 326 proteins were overexpressed (log2FC &gt;1, mean of DS3 vs mean of DS1 and DS2; p&lt;0.05, Kruskal-Walli’s test), functioning in more aggressive pathways such as ECM organization, cell migration, and vesicle-mediated transport. We also found that DS2 shared some features with the other two groups. For example, a SUMOylation-related pathway was identified in both DS1 and DS2, and both DS2 and DS3 were characterized by elevated levels of the NFkB signaling pathway. In conclusion, oxidative phosphorylation and TCA cycle pathways were enriched in the well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma subgroup, while GTPase activity and Wnt signaling pathways were enriched in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The mucinous adenocarcinoma subgroup was characterized by aggressive pathways such as ECM organization, cell migration, and vesicle-mediated transport.</p><p>We then studied the relationship between the overrepresented proteins according to histological type and LNM-related proteins. Interestingly, we found a significant negative correlation in the mucinous adenocarcinoma group (Pearson correlation coefficient = −0.53, p&lt;0.05) but not in the other two groups, indicating that mucinous adenocarcinoma has a unique LNM mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the colorectal is a lethal cancer with unknown molecular etiology and a high propensity to lymph node metastasis. Previous proteomic studies on mucinous adenocarcinoma have found the proteins associated with treatment response in rectal mucinous adenocarcinoma and mechanisms of metastases in mucinous salivary adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panaccione et al., 2017</xref>). Mucinous adenocarcinoma is a distinct subtype of adenocarcinoma and is characterized by abundant mucinous components. In our data, glycoproteins and related enzymes were overexpressed in the mucinous adenocarcinoma group compared with the nonmucinous adenocarcinoma group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>), indicating that glycoproteins are an important component of mucinous adenocarcinoma.</p><p>To explore the mechanism of LNM in mucinous adenocarcinoma in T1 CRC, we focused on the functions and characterizations of the 326 proteins that were highly expressed in the mucinous adenocarcinoma group. We found that six integrins (ITGA1, ITGAV, ITGA11, ITGA9, ITGB3, and ITGB5) and 11 reported extracellular vesicle (EV) markers (ADIRF, CSPG4, DPP4, ENTPD1, LRG1, PECAM1, PLVAP, RAB25, TMEM2, TTR, and YBX1) were overexpressed in the mucinous adenocarcinoma group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F, G</xref>). Furthermore, proteins involved in the membrane trafficking and/or vesicle transport pathways, such as ARFGAP1, ARRDC1, and TOR1A. and proteins involved in ECM organization, including DDR1, LAMA5, and TTR, were upregulated in mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H</xref>). Next, the composition of the tumor microenvironment in our cohort was studied using xCell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>). The stromal score was significantly higher in mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma than in non-mucinous adenocarcinoma (p&lt;0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test), and the signatures of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and osteoblasts were enriched in mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma; however, pericytes were decreased. The increase in endothelial cells, especially lymphatic endothelial cells, and the decrease in pericytes indicated that in mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma, intratumoral lymphatic vessels rather than blood vessels might increase. Blood vessels are composed of endothelial cells and pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">dela Paz and D’Amore, 2009</xref>), and lymphatic vessels are composed of a monolayer of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baluk et al., 2007</xref>). This suggests that in mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma, the density of intratumoral lymphatic vessels, rather than blood vessels, is increased, and an increase in intratumoral lymphatic vessel density might correlate with LNM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). We employed immunohistochemistry (IHC) to validate observation using commercially available D2-40 (PDPN), a lymphatic endothelial marker, antibodies. Previous studies have shown that PDPN expression correlated with LNM in numerous cancers, especially in early oral squamous cell carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huber et al., 2011</xref>). Immunostaining showed the D2-40 expression in mucinous adenocarcinoma was significantly higher than that in non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, in agreement with the proteomics data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata5">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>). In summary, we hypothesize that mucinous adenocarcinoma impacts the tumor microenvironment through EVs, resulting in an increase in intratumoral lymphatic vessel density, thereby promoting LNM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2K</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Discriminative classifier to identify T1 CRC with LNM</title><p>To discover protein markers that can be used to predict LNM in patients with T1 CRC, we established a classifier that could effectively distinguish LNM to guide clinical decisions for T1 CRC. Among 70 LNM-negative and 62 LNM-positive patients in the training cohort, we identified 407 candidate proteins (identified in at least 30% of samples and p&lt;0.1, Wilcoxon rank-sum test in the training cohort) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>). To determine feature importance (significance of the prediction feature), we employed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression and used the LNM status (negative or positive) to determine the discrimination power of each signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref> and B).

The Youden’s index-derived cutoff was used as the threshold, and the 55-protein classifier yielded 100% sensitivity and specificity, whereas the NCCN guidelines yielded 93.5% sensitivity and 18.6% specificity.

We examined the expression of ABI1, ITPR2, RHOT2, ATAD2, and ISLR in a total of 47 T1 CRC cases (27 LNM-negative patients and 20 in LNM-positive patients). We then evaluated the predictive power of individual proteins to distinguish patients with and without LNM by the AUC. All five differentially expressed proteins, namely, ABI1 (AUC = 0.613), ITPR2 (AUC = 0.651), RHOT2 (AUC = 0.618), ATAD2 (AUC = 0.712), and ISLR (AUC = 0.65), showed good discrimination according to their IHC scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Using binary logistic regression to analyze the results of these proteins, we obtained a 5-protein classifier using the IHC score. The 5-protein IHC classifier achieved an AUC of 0.825 in 47 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>RHOT2 promotes the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells</title><p>It has previously been reported that low levels of ABI1 and high levels of ADAT2 or ISLR, result in an increase in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, migration, and cell invasion in colon cancer. However, whether RHOT2 could affect the LNM in colon cancer remains unclear. RHOT2 was significantly down-regulated (Log2FC = −1.35; p=0.003, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) in LNM-positive patients compared with LNM-negative patients in our T1 CRC cohort. Furthermore, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, the analysis on the basis of the TCGA database suggested that the low level of RHOT2 is related to the low overall survival of patients with colon cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To further ascertain the function of RHOT2 in T1 CRC, the correlations between the expression of RHOT2 and other proteins were calculated in our cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We found 1508 proteins were correlated significantly (p&lt;0.05, Spearman) with RHOT2, and 1354 proteins showed a positive correlation (coefficient &gt;0) with RHOT2, 154 proteins were negatively correlated with RHOT2 (coefficient &lt;0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, when we performed GSEA in RHOT2-associated proteins to identify biological signatures impacted by RHOT2, most of the obtained pathways (p&lt;0.01) showed NES less than 0, which means these pathways were mainly enriched in the RHOT2-negative-correlated group, only ‘mitochondrion’ (GOCC) had a positive correlation. As we know RHOT2 is an important protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fransson et al., 2006</xref>). This result indicates that the involvement of RHOT2 in regulation of mitochondrial function might contribute to the pathogenesis of metastasis in cancer, especially in early-stage CRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). As expected, the RHOT2-negative-correlated group was significantly enriched in EMT (HALLMARK) and complement and coagulation cascade pathways. Proteins up-regulated in LNM-positive group (LNM +vs. LNM-: Log2FC &gt;0; p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) were negatively correlated with RHOT2 (p&lt;0.05, coefficient &lt;0, Spearman), including CAP2, COL6A3, COL6A2, TNC, DPYSL3, PCOLCE, and BGN in pathway EMT; and GUCY1B3, VWF, and F13A1 in pathway complement and coagulation cascades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and L</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). ECM, focal adhesion, and Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) pathways were also enriched in the negative-correlated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Degradation of RHOT2 has already been reported to be associated with DCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). Overall, RHOT2 might play an important role in T1 CRC LNM.</p><p>Then, we detected the RHOT2 expression in human colon cancer cells (SW480, HT29, HCT-116, RKO, DLD1, and LoVo) by western blot and RHOT2 was confirmed to be expressed in all colon cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). Cells were confirmed by STR profiling and the negative results for mycoplasma contamination were ensured by PCR. To investigate the role of RHOT2 in the migration of colon cancer, RHOT2 interference fragments (si-RHOT2#1 and #2) were used in this study. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref> showed that the protein expression of RHOT2 was significantly decreased by si-RNAs, especially si-RHOT2#2. Then, we investigated the effect of RHOT2 in the migration of colon cancer cells. The results of the transwell assay showed that the migration ability of colon cancer cells was significantly increased by si-RHOT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H, I</xref>, Student’s t-test,p&lt;0.05). Low expression level of RHOT2 markedly enhanced the migration ability of colon cancer cells (p&lt;0.05).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we present a comprehensive proteomics study to focus on LNM in patients with T1 CRCs. Using a mass spectrometry-based proteomic technique, we analyzed 221 T1 CRC patients and identified different molecular characteristics between patients with and without LNM. We also uncovered protein characteristics of mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma.</p><p>Based on the T1 CRC proteomics dataset, we developed a high-performing protein signature-based model for predicting LNM, which can aid in making informed decisions regarding additional surgical resection following endoscopic resection of T1 CRC. The protein signatures successfully stratified patients according to their risk of LNM. In the training cohort, 105 candidate protein features were reduced to 55 potential predictors by examining the predictor-outcome association with the LASSO method. Based on these 55 biomarkers, 10-fold cross-validation was applied to the training cohort and generated a ROC curve. The classifier achieved an AUC of 1.00 in the training cohort, which was confirmed in two independent validation cohorts. The 55 protein markers achieved an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.917–1.000) in the ESD validation cohort and 0.933 (95% CI, 0.858–1.000) in the prospectively collected validation cohort. Besides, a simplified model consisting of only 9 proteins, which could effectively identify patients with LNM in T1/2 CRC, was developed and validated on external data.</p><p>In recent years, there have been many studies on LNM in T1 CRC, among which the following studies are representative: in 2021, Shin-Ei Kudo and colleagues developed a machine-learning artificial neural network using data on patients' age and sex, tumor characteristics, and histologic grade to identify patients with T1 CRCs who had LNM, the ANN model outperformed guidelines in identifying high-risk patients who require radical surgery. In 2022, Yinghui Zhao and colleagues conducted genome-wide methylation profiling of T1 CRC specimens and developed a nine-CpG signature that can distinguish LNM-positive versus LNM-negative specimens and pre-treatment biopsies. The signature has the potential to improve the selection of high-risk patients. Also in 2022, Yuma Wada and colleagues developed a blood-based liquid biopsy assay to detect LNM in high-risk submucosal T1 CRCs. Their transcriptomic panel of four miRNAs and five mRNAs showed robust identification of patients with LNM.</p><p>Compared to the above-mentioned studies, in addition to higher predictive accuracy, this study has the following advantages: since the ultimate goal of the project was to precisely identify the LNM in T1 CRC, and to reduce additional surgery after endoscopic resection for LNM-negative patients, we set up a cohort only containing EDS samples to validate our predictive model, and a single-blinded prospective cohort was also used to validate the accuracy of the model. Furthermore, we demonstrated the potential for clinical translation of our study. Based on the proteomic results, we further constructed an effective classifier using five proteins based on their IHC score to optimize our model for clinical use.</p><p>In this study, to ensure the accuracy of the LN status of the enrolled patients, the dissected number of LN in all patients including both surgical resection and ESD was more than 12. However, the longer-term follow-up data, including DFS, PFS, etc., are not available due to limitations in sample collection time and the prognosis of such patients needs to be tracked over long periods of time, and may impact the strength of our conclusions. To address this limitation, we used propensity-score matching to reduce confounding biases in our training cohort. Patients were prospectively enrolled in our validation cohort (VC2), which was designed as a single-blinded prospective study to enhance the rigor and reliability of our findings. Furthermore, the presence of isolated tumor cells (ITCs) or micrometastases (MMs) within regional LN is not considered, due to conventional histopathologic examination cannot detect them. According to previous studies, there were about 5% pT1N0 gastric cancer patients have ITCs in LN, and 10% in pT1Nx CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yonemura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishida et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yasuda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doekhie et al., 2006</xref>). The effect of MMs on prognosis in pT1N0 CRC is still unclear. The present of ITCs/MMs in LN may explain why there are nearly 13% (29 of 221) of LNM-negative patients were classified into high-risk groups by the prediction model in our study. We will continuously follow the prognosis of the patients, and the ITCs/MMs in LN also need to be further validated in the future studies.</p><p>Besides, we found dysregulation of RHOT2 expression can impact LNM in T1 CRC. Although the function of RHOT2 in cancer is still unclear, the expression of its paralog RHOT1 affects metastasis in a variety of tumors, including pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, small cell lung cancer, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, previous studies have found that Myc regulation of mitochondrial trafficking through RHOT1 and RHOT2 enables tumor cell motility and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2019</xref>). In our research, we demonstrate that low expression of RHOT2 was associated with LNM and poor prognosis, and knocking down RHOT1 can significantly increase the migration of CRC cells. The mechanism by which RHOT2 affects CRC LNM is not fully understood, but might involve several pathways. One potential pathway involves the regulation of EMT, a process by which cancer cells acquire invasive properties and become more motile. More analytical studies and experiments are needed in our future research to understand the specific role and mechanism of RHOT2 in the process of tumor metastasis.</p><p>In conclusion, we used proteomic analysis to identify molecular characteristics and develop the high accuracy protein signature-based models for predicting LNM in patients with T1 CRC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patient</title><p>In this study, a training cohort and two independent validation cohorts of consecutive patients who visited the General Surgery Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University (Shanghai, China) were enrolled.

For clinical sample preparation, sections (10 μm thick) from FFPE blocks were macro-dissected, deparaffinized with xylene, and washed with ethanol. The ethanol was removed completely and the sections were left to air-dry. For this purpose, a hematoxylin-stained section of the same tumor was used as a reference. Areas containing 80% or more tumors were examined by pathologists.</p><p>Lysis buffer [0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 M DTT (Sigma, 43815), 1 mM PMSF (Amresco, M145)] was added to the extracted tissues before adding SDS to the solution.

The supernatants were collected, and the protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was added and kept for 2.5 hr at 99 °C with shaking at 1800 rpm. The solution was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. A fourfold volume of acetone was added to the supernatant and kept at –20 °C overnight. Subsequently, the acetone-precipitated proteins were washed three times with cooled acetone. Filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) procedure was used for protein digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wiśniewski et al., 2009</xref>).

The precipitate in the filter was washed three times by adding 200 μL 50 mM NH4HCO3. The precipitate was resuspended in 50 μL 50 mM NH4HCO3. Protein samples underwent trypsin digestion (enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:50 at 37°C for 18–20 hr) in the filter, and then were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 min.

The eluted peptides were ionized under 2 kV and introduced into the mass spectrometer. MS was operated under a data-dependent acquisition mode. For the MS1 Spectra full scan, ions with m/z ranging from 300 to 1400 were acquired by Orbitrap mass analyzer at a high resolution of 120,000. The automatic gain control (AGC) target value was set as 3E+06. The maximal ion injection time was 80ms. MS2 Spectra acquisition was performed in top-speed mode. Precursor ions were selected and fragmented with higher energy collision dissociation with a normalized collision energy of 27%. Fragment ions were analyzed using an ion trap mass analyzer with an AGC target value of 5E+04, with a maximal ion injection time of 20 ms.

The mass tolerances were: 20 ppm for precursor and 50 mmu for product ions collected by Q Exactive HF-X. Up to two missed cleavages were allowed. The database searching considered cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification, and N-acetylation, and oxidation of methionine as variable modifications. Precursor ion score charges were limited to +2, +3, and +4. For the quality control of protein identification, the target-decoy-based strategy was applied to confirm the FDR of both peptide and protein, which was lower than 1%. Percolator was used to obtain the quality value (q-value), validating the FDR (measured by the decoy hits) of every peptide-spectrum match (PSM), which was lower than 1%. Subsequently, all the peptides shorter than seven amino acids were removed. The cutoff ion score for peptide identification was 20. All the PSMs in all fractions were combined to comply with a stringent protein quality control strategy. We employed the parsimony principle and dynamically increased the q-values of both target and decoy peptide sequences until the corresponding protein FDR was less than 1%. Finally, to reduce the false positive rate, the proteins with at least one unique peptide and more than 10<sup>−5</sup> in FOT were selected for further investigation.

Identification results and the raw data from the mzXML file were loaded. Then for each identified peptide, the extracted-ion chromatogram (XIC) was extracted by searching against the MS1 based on its identification information, and the abundance was estimated by calculating the area under the extracted XIC curve. For protein abundance calculation, the nonredundant peptide list was used to assemble proteins following the parsimony principle. The protein abundance was estimated using a traditional label-free, intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schwanhäusser et al., 2011</xref>), which divided the protein abundance (derived from identified peptides’ intensities) by the number of theoretically observable peptides. We built a dynamic regression function based on the commonly identified peptides in tumor samples. According to correlation value R2, Firmiana chose linear or quadratic functions for regression to calculate the retention time (RT) of corresponding hidden peptides, and to check the existence of the XIC based on the m/z and calculated RT. Subsequently, the fraction of total (FOT), a relative quantification value was defined as a protein’s iBAQ divided by the total iBAQ of all identified proteins in one experiment, and was calculated as the normalized abundance of a particular protein among experiments. Finally, the FOT was further multiplied by 10<sup>5</sup> for ease of presentation, and FOTs less than 10<sup>–5</sup> were replaced with 10<sup>–5</sup> to adjust extremely small values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ge et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining</title><p>FFPE tumor blocks were obtained from the Institute of Pathology at the Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University.

All cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Corning Costar) with 10% FBS (Gibco), 100 units of penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Gibco) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with siRNAs (si-RHOT2#1: sense (5'–3'), GCUCAACGCUUUCCAGAAATT; antisense (5'–3'), UUUCUGGAAAGCGUUGAGCTT; si-RHOT2#2: sense(5'–3'), GCGUCUACAAGCACCAUUATT; antisense (5'–3'), UAAUGGUGCUUGUAGACGCTT) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Knockdown efficiency was verified by western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Cell migration analysis</title><p>For the transwell migration assay, 4 × 10<sup>4</sup> serum-starved cells were trypsinized and plated onto an FN-coated upper chamber membrane (8 μm pore filter, Corning Costar, Cat. No. 3422) of a transwell chamber with the corresponding inhibitors. The lower transwell chamber was filled with 2.5% serum containing DMEM. After incubation for 48 hr, the filters were removed, and the cells on the membrane were fixed with methanol. The migrated cells on the underside of the membrane were stained with 0.5% crystal violet. The dye was washed with water, and the cells were examined by microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>The present study was carried out comply with the ethical standards of Helsinki Declaration II.

Please refer to Recommendations to Authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As a nonmass spec expert I can't comment on methods of development of the classifier but the clinical relevance and biomarker testing with training and validation subsets, one of which was prospective as well as the performance characteristics, makes the finding intriguing with clinical relevance with the ability to use IHC as well.</p><p>It was notable, that AUCs were compared using standard clinical features which demonstrated the classifier performed better.</p><p>This was a well-done paper asking clinical useful questions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

The method described in this manuscript is confusing. For example, the proteins were extracted from tissues by Tris-lysis buffer, and the protein concentration was quantified by using Bradford assay.

It might be better published as a resource absent significant additional work.</p><p>In addition to standard genetics, correlation with a common oncogenic driver and tumor suppressor gene alterations would be helpful if available even for a subset of patients. The classifiers are also not tested on other, publicly available datasets, which might include genetics and later-stage patients, and patients with known outcomes to test whether these classifiers predict survival / DFS / PFS, etc.</p><p>The writing generally states that something meets a statistical threshold without stating the direction of change (for example, that there is a significant difference in the rate of metastasis between right and left colon would be better explained that right-sided CRCs metastasized less frequently than left-sided).</p><p>The section that generally describes the data is so general as to be unhelpful. For example in the section from ~317-346, no fold-changes are mentioned, so it is hard to know what something being upregulated or down-regulated means. The findings in coagulation and cytoskeleton are interesting in principle if more detail were present. The sentence &quot;in conclusion, different differentiation statuses and histologic types in T1 CRC indicate specific pathways&quot; is devoid of content.</p><p>The Discussion section is predominantly a summary of key results and would be better used contextualizing the work.</p><p>There is no meaningful difference between the two validation cohorts and they could be merged. The second validation cohort is described almost as if it were a clinical trial, but the data were not used in patient care. Figure 1 Figure Supplement 1 the legend is buried in the bottom corner and should be easier to find.</p><p>In figure 2C, the proteomaps are very pretty but devoid of information.

The authors are suggested to describe more on the relationship between proteomic characterizations of LNM-negative vs LNM-positive groups, mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma with the biomarker exploration.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. We agree with reviewer’s point that the relationship between proteomic characterizations of LNM-negative vs LNM-positive groups should be more described. Here's what we found in addition to our previous analysis (Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p>1) Comparison between our study and previous studies:</p><p>Firstly, we surveyed the published CRC LNM markers revealed in the literature. Among the 44 reported gene or RNA markers, only CTSD, GSTM3, and MX1 were differentially expressed between T1 CRC LNM-negative and LNM-positive patients in our proteomic data (Figure 2A). It indicates that the existing researches, including animal/cell models, gene/RNA related studies, etc., might not reflect the status of lymph node metastasis in T1 CRC. We also compared our data with those of the previous all stage CRC proteomic studies (Nature. 2014; 513:382 and Cancer Cell. 2020; 38:734) (PMID: 25043054, 32888432), 4,634 proteins were found in all three cohorts, whereas 2,577 proteins were detected specifically in our T1 CRC cohort (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). These results suggest that compared with advanced CRC, T1 CRC may have its own unique protein patterns. These markers might improve the understanding of LNM in early-stage CRC.</p><p>2) The role of EMT for T1 CRC LNM:</p><p>To explore the biological processes associated with LNM in T1 CRC, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify enriched pathways. The results revealed that only the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway was significantly enriched (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05) in LNM-positive group, while no significantly enriched pathways in LNM-negative group (Figure 2C). We also examined the expression of EMT-related proteins and found that all of them were upregulated in the LNM-positive group compared to the LNM-negative group (log2FC &gt;0; p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests), with six proteins showing a significant upregulation (log2FC &gt;1), including CAP2, PLOD1, SERPINE2, etc. (Figure 2E).</p><p>Next, we compared the differences in EMT marker expression between the LNM-positive and LNM-negative groups in all stages (T1-T4) CRC dataset. We found that the EMT markers that were significantly upregulated in the T1 CRC cohort showed no differences in either the CPTAC or mCRC cohorts (Figure 2F-H, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C). However, when we focused on the early-stage (T1/T2) CRC individuals from the mCRC cohort and compared the EMT marker expression between the LNM-positive and LNM-negative groups, the EMT markers like SERPINE2 and LRP1 were significantly upregulated in both our cohort and the early-stage CRC group from the mCRC cohort (log2FC &gt;1 and p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Additionally, PLOD2 was also found to be up-regulated in LNM-positive group in T<sub>1/2</sub> patients in mCRC cohort (Figure 2H). In summary, EMT might play an essential role during the process of LNM of tumor cells in early-CRC.</p><p>3) Differences in metabolic pathways between the LNM-positive and negative group:</p><p>We finally employed single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) in 166 significantly different expressed proteins (log2FC &gt; 1 or &lt;-1 and p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Figure 2J). Amino acid metabolism pathways, such as &quot;valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation&quot; (hsa00280) and &quot;glycine, serine and threonine metabolism&quot; (hsa00260), were found to be enriched in the LNM-negative group (adjusted p ≤ 0.05, limma approach), and related proteins (TMLHE, SLC44A2, SHMT1 and EEF1E1) were up-regulated in the LNM-negative group (Log2FC &lt;1, p &lt; 0.05). (Figure 2K). On the other hand, the LNM-positive group mainly expressed lipid metabolism pathways, such as &quot;arachidonic acid metabolism&quot; (hsa00590) and &quot;steroid biosynthesis&quot; (hsa00100), which are known to promote cancer cell proliferation and migration and involved in the regulation of EMT. In addition, tumor metastasis-related signaling pathways, such as the MAPK and p53 pathways, as well as cellular process categories (NK cell mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis), were enriched in LNM-positive patients. Meanwhile, the mTOR signaling pathway was enriched in the LNM-negative group. Overall, these findings suggest that different metabolic pathways and signaling pathways may contribute to LNM in T1 CRC.</p><p>In conclusion, unique protein markers specific to T1 CRC were found in this study, that may improve the understanding of LNM in early-stage CRC. EMT pathway was significantly enriched in the LNM-positive group of T<sub>1/2</sub> CRC, and EMT-related proteins were found to be specifically up-regulated in the early-stage CRC LNM-positive group compared to the LNM-negative group. We also found differences in metabolic pathways and signaling pathways between the LNM-positive and negative groups, suggesting that different metabolic pathways and signaling pathways may contribute to LNM in T1 CRC.</p><p>We refined the analysis as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 in the revision, and we updated the relevant results and description in the “Proteomic Characteristics of the LNM-Negative and LNM-Positive Groups” part of Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. What is the rationale to define a training cohort and two different validation cohorts?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the critical comments. We sincerely apologized for the unclear description of our methodology. Our study aimed to address the clinical problem of whether additional surgical resection is needed after endoscopic resection and to accurately identify the rare but important LNM-positive patients in T1 CRC. To achieve this, we designed a rigorous study with multiple validation cohorts.</p><p>Training cohort:</p><p>The training cohort was a retrospective cohort consisting of 132 patients with LN dissection between June 2008 and October 2019. Due to the low probability of T1CRC LNM (3%-10%), we used propensity-score matching to reduce confounding biases.</p><p>In the training cohort, we established a proteomics-based lymph node metastasis prediction model for the first time, which can accurately predict T1 stage colorectal cancer lymph node metastasis, and is significantly better than the current guidelines.</p><p>Validation cohort 1:</p><p>The purpose of Validation Cohort 1 (VC1) was to validate the clinical applicability of our prediction model. We studied 42 consecutive samples during the same time period with train cohort (June 2008 to October 2019) in VC1. The AUC value of the model is 0.96 in VC1, which reflects the excellent universality of our model. It also verified the feasibility of applying our model to the prediction of lymph node metastasis in patients.</p><p>Validation cohort 2:</p><p>The validation cohort (VC2) is a prospective cohort, which is a unique aspect of our study design. After the model was developed in training cohort and validated in VC1 in the October 2019, we consecutively prospectively enrolled 47 samples over a six-month period (November 2019 to April 2020) in VC2. Importantly, VC2 was a single-blinded study, as we did not know the true pathological status before predicting it with our model.</p><p>To address the reviewer’ comments, we carefully, revised all the detailed descriptions in the “Materials and methods” section with the subtitle “Patient”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors are suggested to utilize additional CRC cohorts reported previously (Nature. 2014; 513:382; Cell. 2019; 177:1035; Cancer Cell. 2020; 38:734) for validating their 9 identified biomarkers.</p></disp-quote><p>According to reviewer’s suggestion, we download the T<sub>1/2</sub> CRC data from Bing Zhang’s (Cancer Cell. 2020, mCRC cohort) and Chen Li’s (Nature. 2014, CPTAC cohort) studies, and validated our 9-protein simplified classifier in these two data sets, respectively.</p><p>Firstly, we screened the data according to our inclusion criteria.

The same cutoff strategies of FDR at protein/peptide level have been widely used in recently published researches (PMID: 34534465, PMID: 33577785). Moreover, to increase reliability, not all identified proteins were used for downstream data analysis.

We agree that genetic testing plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. However, its significance in the lymph node metastasis of early-stage colon cancer is still unclear. In our previous version, we did not perform an examination of genomics due to sample number and size limitations. According to reviewer’s advices, we have collaborated with our pathology colleagues to perform additional genetic testing.

We tested the MSI status by using IHC staining, a commonly used method in CRC MSI status clinical test (PMID: 21497289). The patients showed positive staining of the nuclei of all four MMR proteins were considered as proficient MMR (pMMR)/ microsatellite stable (MSS), and the mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) /microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) cases show the loss of one of the two MLH1/PMS2 or MSH2/MSH6 heterodimers (Materials and methods in the revision) (PMID: 25560596). There were 12 (7%) MSI-H patients in our study, this proportion is consistent with previous reported on metastatic CRC by Federico et al. (6.6%) (PMID: 30865548). For MSI-H patients, there were 16.7% (2 of 12) had LNM, and 39.6% (63 of 159) for MSS patients, the MSS group showed a higher tendency of LNM (Figure 1—figure supplement 1K). Our results are in agreement with the previous studies (PMID: 25510762).

Here, we divided the response into three parts to answer: (1) Describe the data in detail; (2) details of findings in coagulation and cytoskeleton; (3) the sentence &quot;in conclusion……” is devoid of content.</p><p>1) Describe the data in detail:</p><p>The proteome analysis results were uniformly defined as 'up-regulated' or 'down-regulated' based on the measurements from a statistical test (two-sided Student’s t-test/Wilcoxon rank-signed test/ Kruskal-Walli’s test) and the log2 transformed fold change (≥ 1 for upregulation and ≤ -1 for downregulation). According to the reviewer’s advice, we have revised the detailed descriptions of the fold-changes of proteins in the “Result” section. For example:</p><p>“We found that the EMT markers that were significantly up-regulated (log2FC &gt;1) in the T1 CRC cohort showed no differences in either the CPTAC or mCRC cohorts.”</p><p>“We also examined the expression of EMT-related proteins and found that all of them were up-regulated in the LNM-positive group compared to the LNM-negative group (log2FC &gt;0; p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests).”</p><p>“Cytoskeletal remodeling proteins, including ABI1, SPTA1, SPTB, ANK1, MRPL46 and ITGA2B, were down-regulated in patients with LNM compared with those without LNM (log2FC &lt;-1 and p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test).”</p><p>“RHOT2 was significant down-regulated (Log2FC=-1.35; p=0.003, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) in LNM-positive patients compared with LNM-negative patients in our T1 CRC cohort.”</p><p>2) Details of findings in coagulation and cytoskeleton:</p><p>As shown in Figure 2, in our previous analysis, we found the proteins overexpressed by LNM-negative patients were involved in cytoskeletal remodeling (log2FC &lt;-1 and p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), including SPTA1, SPTB, ANK1, MRPL46 and ITGA2B. The cytoskeletal remodeling related pathway (GO:0003774) was found to be up-regulated in LNM-negative patients of mCRC cohort (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). Meanwhile, twelve of the 84 proteins that were elevated in LNM-positive patients (log2FC &gt; 1 and p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) were related to coagulation cascades, including CAP2, CEACAM6, F13A1, GNG2, GPC1, GUCY1B3, ISLR, MAGED2, SERPINE2, SERPINB8, SHC1 and VWF.</p><p>As shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1H, further analysis reveals the relationship between cytoskeletal remodeling and coagulation cascades. As expected, the expression of cytoskeletal remodeling related proteins including SPTA1, SPTB, ANK1 and ITGA2B showed positive correlation in our study (P &lt; 0.05, coefficient &gt;0, Spearman), as did coagulation cascades related proteins. Meanwhile, we found the negative correlations between the cytoskeletal remodeling related proteins and coagulation cascades, for example, the expression of SPTA1 was negative correlated with 7 coagulation cascades related proteins including CEACAM6, MAGED2, ISLR, GPC1, SHC1, SERPINB8 and GNG2, MRPL46 showed a negative correlation with 5 coagulation cascades related proteins. ANK1 and SPTB were also found to be negatively correlated with coagulation cascades. Recent studies have shown that cytoskeletal remodeling can affect complement and coagulation pathway activation. SPTA1 and SPTB are components of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton, and defects in these proteins can lead to hemolytic anemia, which can activate the coagulation cascade. MRPL46 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that may play a role in mitochondrial function, which can affect coagulation and inflammation.</p><p>In conclusion, the alteration of cytoskeletal remodeling and coagulation cascades pathways in T1 CRC and their interaction may affect LNM.</p><p>3) The sentence &quot;in conclusion……” is devoid of content:</p><p>Thanks for the comment.

The mucinous adenocarcinoma subgroup was characterized by aggressive pathways such as ECM organization, cell migration, and vesicle-mediated transport.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Discussion section is predominantly a summary of key results and would be better used contextualizing the work.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for the valuable comments. We apologize for not appropriately contextualizing the “Discussion” section. In the revised manuscript, we rewrite the discussion part as follow:</p><p>“Here, we present a comprehensive proteomic study to focus on LNM in patients with submucosal T1 CRCs. Using a mass spectrometry-based proteomic technique, we analyzed 221 T1 CRC patients and identified different molecular characteristics between patients with and without LNM. We also uncovered protein characteristics of mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma.</p><p>Based on the T1 CRC proteomics dataset, we developed a high-performing protein signature-based model for predicting LNM, which can aid in making informed decisions regarding additional surgical resection following endoscopic resection of T1 CRCs. The protein signatures successfully stratified patients according to their risk of LNM. In the training cohort, 105 candidate protein markers were reduced to 55 potential predictors by examining the predictor-outcome association with the LASSO method. Based on these 55 biomarkers, 10-fold cross-validation was applied to the training cohort and generated an ROC curve. The classifier achieved an AUC of 1.00 in the training cohort, which was confirmed in two independent validation cohorts. The 55 protein markers achieved an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.917 to 1.000) in the ESD validation cohort and 0.933 (95% CI, 0.858 to 1.000) in the prospectively collected validation cohort. Besides, a simplified model consisting of only 9 proteins, which could effectively identify patients with LNM in T<sub>1/2</sub> CRC, was developed and validated on external data.</p><p>In recent years, there have been many studies on LNM in T1 CRC, among which the following studies are representative: in 2021, Shin-Ei Kudo and colleagues developed a machine-learning artificial neural network using data on patients' age and sex, tumor characteristics, and histologic grade to identify patients with T1 CRCs who had LNM, the ANN model outperformed guidelines in identifying high-risk patients who require radical surgery. In 2022, Yinghui Zhao and colleagues conducted genome-wide methylation profiling of T1 CRC specimens and developed a nine-CpG signature that can distinguish LNM-positive versus LNM-negative specimens and pre-treatment biopsies. The signature has potential to improve selection of high-risk patients. Also in 2022, Yuma Wada and colleagues developed a blood-based liquid biopsy assay to detect LNM in high-risk submucosal T1 CRCs. Their transcriptomic panel of 4 miRNAs and 5 mRNAs showed robust identification of patients with LNM. Compared to the above-mentioned studies, in addition to higher predictive accuracy, this study has the following advantages: since the ultimate goal of the project was to precisely identify the LNM in T1 CRC, and to reduce additional surgery after endoscopic resection for LNM-negative patients, we set up a cohort only containing ESD samples to validate our predictive model, and a single-blinded prospective cohort was also used to validate the accuracy of the model. Furthermore, we demonstrated the potential for clinical translation of our study. Base on proteomic result, we further constructed an effective classifier using five proteins based on their IHC score to optimize our model for clinical use.</p><p>In this study, to ensure the accuracy of LN status of the enrolled patients, the dissected number of LN in all patients including both surgical resection and ESD was more than 12. However, the longer-term follow-up data, including DFS, PFS, etc., are not available due to limitations in sample collection time and the prognosis of such patients needs to be tracked over long periods of time, may impact the strength of our conclusions. To address this limitation, we used propensity-score matching to reduce confounding biases in our training cohort. Patients were prospectively enrolled in our validation cohort, which was designed as a single-blinded prospective study to enhance the rigor and reliability of our findings. Furthermore, the presence of isolated tumor cells (ITCs) or micrometastases (MMs) within regional LN are not considered, due to conventional histopathologic examination cannot detected them. According to previous studies, there were about 5% pT1N0 gastric cancer patients have ITCs in LN, and 10% in pT1Nx CRC. The effect of MMs on prognosis in pT1N0 CRC is still unclear. The present of ITCs/MMs in LN may explain why there are nearly 13% (29 of 221) LNM-negative patients were classified into high-risk group by the prediction model in our study. We will continuously follow the prognosis of the patients, and the ITCs/MMs in LN also need to be further validated in the future studies.”</p><p>Besides, we found dysregulation of RHOT2 expression can impact LNM in T1 CRC. Although the function of RHOT2 in cancer is still unclear, the expression of its paralog RHOT1 affects metastasis in a variety of tumors, including pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, small cell lung cancer, etc. In addition, previous studies have found that Myc regulation of mitochondrial trafficking through RHOT1 and RHOT2 enables tumor cell motility and metastasis. In our research, we demonstrated that low expression of RHOT2 was associated with LNM and poor prognosis, and knocking down RHOT1 can significantly increase migration of CRC cells. The mechanism by which RHOT2 affects CRC LNM is not fully understood, but may involve several pathways. One potential pathway involves the regulation of EMT, a process by which cancer cells acquire invasive properties and become more motile. More analytical studies and experiments are needed in our future researches to understand the specific role and mechanism of RHOT2 in the process of tumor metastasis.</p><p>In conclusion, we used proteomic analysis to identify molecular characteristics and develop the high accuracy protein signature-based models for predicting LNM in patients with T1 CRC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is no meaningful difference between the two validation cohorts and they could be merged.

We sincerely apologized for the unclear description of our methodology. Our study aimed to address the clinical problem of whether additional surgical resection is needed after endoscopic resection and to accurately identify the rare but important LNM-positive patients in T1 CRC. To achieve this, we designed a rigorous study with multiple validation cohorts.</p><p>Training cohort:</p><p>The training cohort was a retrospective cohort consisting of 132 patients with LN dissection between June 2008 and October 2019.

It also verified the feasibility of applying our model to the prediction of lymph node metastasis in patients.</p><p>Validation cohort 2:</p><p>The validation cohort (VC2) is a prospective cohort, which is a unique aspect of our study design.

We agree with reviewer’s point that the relationship between proteomic characterizations of LNM-negative vs LNM-positive groups should be more described. Here's what we found in addition to our previous analysis (Figure 2).</p><p>1) Comparison between our study and previous studies:</p><p>Firstly, we surveyed the published CRC LNM markers revealed in the literature. Among the 44 reported gene or RNA markers, only CTSD, GSTM3, and MX1 were differentially expressed between T1 CRC LNM-negative and LNM-positive patients in our proteomic data (Figure 2A). It indicates that the existing researches, including animal/cell models, gene/RNA related studies, etc., might not reflect the status of lymph node metastasis in T1 CRC. We also compared our data with those of the previous all stage CRC proteomic studies (Nature. 2014; 513:382 and Cancer Cell. 2020; 38:734) (PMID: 25043054, 32888432), 4,634 proteins were found in all three cohorts, whereas 2,577 proteins were detected specifically in our T1 CRC cohort (Figure 2B). These results suggest that compared with advanced CRC, T1 CRC may have its own unique protein patterns. These markers might improve the understanding of LNM in early-stage CRC.</p><p>2) The role of EMT for T1 CRC LNM:</p><p>To explore the biological processes associated with LNM in T1 CRC, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify enriched pathways. The results revealed that only the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway was significantly enriched (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05) in LNM-positive group, while no significantly enriched pathways in LNM-negative group (Figure 2C). We also examined the expression of EMT-related proteins and found that all of them were upregulated in the LNM-positive group compared to the LNM-negative group (log2FC &gt;0; p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests), with six proteins showing a significant upregulation (log2FC &gt;1), including CAP2, PLOD1, SERPINE2, etc. (Figure 2D).</p><p>Next, we compared the differences in EMT marker expression between the LNM-positive and LNM-negative groups in all stages (T1-T4) CRC dataset. We found that the EMT markers that were significantly upregulated in the T1 CRC cohort showed no differences in either the CPTAC or mCRC cohorts (Figure 2E-I). However, when we focused on the early-stage (T1/T2) CRC individuals from the mCRC cohort and compared the EMT marker expression between the LNM-positive and LNM-negative groups, we found two markers like SERPINE2 and LRP1, that were significantly upregulated in both our cohort and the early-stage CRC group from the mCRC cohort (log2FC &gt;1 and p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Additionally, PLOD2 was also found to</p><p>be up-regulated in LNM-positive group in T<sub>1/2</sub> patients of mCRC cohort (Figure 2G). In summary, EMT might play an essential role during the process of LNM of tumor cells in early-CRC.</p><p>3) Differences in metabolic and other pathways between the LNM-positive and negative group:</p><p>We finally employed single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) in 166 significantly different expressed proteins (log2FC &gt; 1 or &lt;-1 and p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Figure 2J). Amino acid metabolism pathways, such as &quot;valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation&quot; (hsa00280) and &quot;glycine, serine and threonine metabolism&quot; (hsa00260), were found to be enriched in the LNM-negative group (adjusted p ≤ 0.05, limma approach), and related proteins (TMLHE, SLC44A2, SHMT1 and EEF1E1) were up-regulated in the LNM-negative group (Log2FC &lt;1, p &lt; 0.05). (Figure 2K). On the other hand, the LNM-positive group mainly expressed lipid metabolism pathways, such as &quot;arachidonic acid metabolism&quot; (hsa00590) and &quot;steroid biosynthesis&quot; (hsa00100), which are known to promote cancer cell proliferation and migration and involved in the regulation of EMT. In addition, tumor metastasis-related signaling pathways, such as the MAPK and p53 pathways, as well as cellular process categories (NK cell mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis), were enriched in LNM-positive patients. Meanwhile, the mTOR signaling pathway was enriched in the LNM-negative group. Overall, these findings suggest that different metabolic pathways and signaling pathways may contribute to LNM in T1 CRC.</p><p>In conclusion, unique protein markers specific to T1 CRC were found in this study, that may improve the understanding of LNM in early-stage CRC. EMT pathway was significantly enriched in the LNM-positive group of T<sub>1/2</sub> CRC, and EMT-related proteins were found to be specifically up-regulated in the early-stage CRC LNM-positive group compared to the LNM-negative group. We also found differences in metabolic pathways and signaling pathways between the LNM-positive and negative groups, suggesting that different metabolic pathways and signaling pathways may contribute to LNM in T1 CRC.</p><p>We refined the analysis as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 in the revision, and we updated the relevant results and description in the “Proteomic Characteristics of the LNM-Negative and LNM-Positive Groups</p></body></sub-article></article>
