on the formation of associations between salient events and arbitrary stimuli that predict those events. This is exemplified in cerebellar-dependent delay eyeblink conditioning, where arbitrary cues such as a tone or light act as conditioned stimuli (CSs) that predict aversive sensations at the cornea (unconditioned stimulus [US]). Here, we ask if a similar framework could be applied to another type of cerebellar-dependent sensorimotor learning – sensorimotor adaptation. Models of sensorimotor adaptation posit that the introduction of an environmental perturbation results in an error signal that is used to update an internal model of a sensorimotor map for motor planning. Here, we take a step toward an integrative account of these two forms of cerebellar-dependent learning, examining the relevance of core concepts from associative learning for sensorimotor adaptation. Using a visuomotor adaptation reaching task, we paired movement-related feedback (US) with neutral auditory or visual contextual cues that served as CSs. Trial-by-trial changes in feedforward movement kinematics exhibited three key signatures of associative learning: differential conditioning, sensitivity to the CS-US interval, and compound conditioning. Moreover, after compound conditioning, a robust negative correlation was observed between responses to the two elemental CSs of the compound (i.e. overshadowing), consistent with the additivity principle posited by theories of associative learning. The existence of associative learning effects in sensorimotor adaptation provides a proof-of-concept for linking cerebellar-dependent learning paradigms within a common theoretical framework.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sensorimotor adaptation</kwd><kwd>associative learning</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>forward model</kwd><kwd>context</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS084948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Jordan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1838462</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Jordan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1827550</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Jordan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000006</institution-id><institution>Office of Naval Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N00014-18-1-2873</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Jordan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS116883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ivry</surname><given-names>Richard B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC077091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ivry</surname><given-names>Richard B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Core associative learning phenomena that are observed in studies of eyeblink conditioning are also observed in sensorimotor adaptation, pointing to a common framework for these distinct cerebellar-dependent motor learning processes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensorimotor adaptation refers to the gradual adjustment of movements in response to changes in the environment or body. In laboratory adaptation tasks, the introduction of perturbed sensory feedback results in a sensorimotor prediction error. This error signal is used to update a model of an internal sensorimotor mapping, thus ensuring that the sensorimotor system remains well calibrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wolpert et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wolpert and Ghahramani, 2000</xref>). The integrity of the cerebellum is essential for this form of error-based learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Donchin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Izawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Popa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schlerf et al., 2012</xref>) and is thought to play a key role in generating predictions of future states given the current sensory context.</p><p>Different contexts may call for the use of different sensorimotor mappings. For instance, distinct motor memories should be retrieved when a skilled tennis player prepares to hit a service return on a clay court vs a grass court. A topic of considerable discussion in the adaptation literature centers on the constraints underlying effective contextual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Heald et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dawidowicz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heald et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Howard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Howard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Howard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Karniel and Mussa-Ivaldi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Osu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schween et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sheahan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sheahan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Forano and Franklin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Forano et al., 2021</xref>). Contextual cues are highly effective when the cue is directly relevant to properties of the movement. For example, people can simultaneously adapt to competing sensorimotor perturbations if the current context is established by the movement segment that precedes or follows the perturbed segment of a reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Howard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Howard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sheahan et al., 2016</xref>). In these situations, the contextual cues are hypothesized to be effective because the cues are incorporated into the motor plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Howard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Howard et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Less clear is the efficacy of arbitrary contextual cues, ones that are not directly related to movement. In general, arbitrary cues do not appear to be effective for defining distinct motor memories. For example, participants show large interference between opposing perturbations that are signaled by color cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Howard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Howard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gandolfo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Forano et al., 2021</xref>). This interference can be reduced with multiple days of practice, although even after 10 days of training, residual interference remains on trials immediately following a switch in context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addou et al., 2011</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Osu et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The ineffectiveness of arbitrary contextual cues in shaping sensorimotor adaptation is surprising when one considers another popular model task of cerebellar-dependent sensorimotor learning – delay eyeblink conditioning. In this form of classical conditioning, a sensory cue (conditioned stimulus [CS], e.g. a tone) is repeatedly paired with an aversive event (unconditioned stimulus [US], e.g. an air puff to the cornea). By itself, the aversive event naturally causes an immediate unconditioned response (UR, e.g. an eye blink in response to the air puff). After just a short training period with a reliable CS, organisms as diverse as turtles and humans produce an adaptive conditioned response (CR, e.g. an eye blink that anticipates the aversive air puff). Notably, there is little constraint on the features of the predictive cues. The CR can be readily acquired in response to arbitrary CSs, such as a tone or a light flash. However, there is an important temporal constraint, at least with respect to cerebellar-dependent eyeblink conditioning. The cue must appear before the aversive event, and the two stimuli must be in close temporal proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schneiderman and Gormezano, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Smith et al., 1969</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we set out to re-evaluate the efficacy of arbitrary cues in sensorimotor adaptation, drawing on key theoretical concepts and design features employed in studies of delay eyeblink conditioning. Using a variant of a visuomotor adaptation task, we show that arbitrary stimuli can act as effective contextual cues when a strict temporal relationship is established between those cues and their associated movement-related sensory outcomes. We then take this result a step further by showing that the effect of these arbitrary cues adheres to an established core principle of associative learning – cue additivity. The parallels between adaptation and conditioning observed in our results lay the empirical groundwork for a more parsimonious model of cerebellar-dependent sensorimotor learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our primary goal in the present study was to determine if arbitrary stimuli can serve as effective contextual cues in sensorimotor adaptation. Participants reached from a start location to a target, with movement feedback provided by a cursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In typical adaptation tasks, the onset of the target serves as an imperative for movement initiation. When considered through the lens of classical conditioning, the target appearance could be viewed as a CS given that it is presented just before the sensory feedback (the US) resulting from the movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To test the efficacy of arbitrary cues as CSs, the onset of the tone or light served as the imperative, with the target visible at its fixed location throughout the experimental session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For optimal delay eyeblink conditioning, the interval between the CS and the US is relatively narrow, on the order of 100–500 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schneiderman and Gormezano, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Smith et al., 1969</xref>). By using a neutral stimulus to cue movement initiation, we imposed a tight temporal link between the CS and the US, requiring the participant to initiate the movement within 400 ms of the onset of the imperative. Participants complied with this requirement, exhibiting rapid response times ([mean ± STD]: 293±49.0 ms).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Reaching task. Participants reach from a start location (white circle) to a target (blue dot). Online feedback is provided by a cursor (white dot). The target is displayed in a fixed location for the entire experiment (location varied across participants). After a random delay, a tone or a light (white frame) is presented, serving as the movement imperative. The participant is instructed to move directly to the target. The cue persists until the radial position of the hand reaches the target distance. The hand is not visible during the reach; instead, feedback is provided only by the cursor. (<bold>B</bold>) Components and timing of the reaching task described as conditioning events. The tone and light imperatives serve as conditioned stimuli (CSs), and the cursor feedback is the unconditioned stimulus (US). In our experiments, the radial position of the cursor is aligned with the hand, but the angular position is fixed (‘clamped’), appearing either 15° away from the target (resulting in an error signal) when paired with one of the CS’s (CS+) or at the target when paired with the other CS (CS−). After repeated pairings of the CS+ and US, a conditioned response (CR) develops, leading to an adaptive feedforward movement response in a direction opposite to the rotated feedback. Note that we include an unconditioned response (UR) in the schematic, what we assume is an online, automatic corrective response to the visual error. However, because participants are instructed to move fast, the UR is negligible.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75801-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>A common perturbation technique to elicit sensorimotor adaptation is to introduce a visuomotor rotation, where the movement path of the visual feedback cursor is rotated (about the origin) with respect to the hand’s path. This drives an adaptation process in which the movement heading angle shifts across trials in the direction opposite to the rotated cursor, thus offsetting the error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krakauer et al., 2000</xref>). To continue with our conditioning analogy, the CR would be the movement heading angle elicited by a CS, expressed as a change in heading angle following the pairing of that CS with the visual error, the US (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We note here that the UR in an adaptation task could correspond to an immediate movement correction in response to the perturbation, that is, an ‘online’ correction. Given that we required fast movements to minimize these corrections, this potential form of UR is not observed in our design.</p><p>Rather than rotate the position of the feedback cursor with respect to the actual hand position, we opted to use a visual ‘clamp’ where the cursor followed an invariant path with respect to the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Morehead et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shmuelof et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast to traditional movement-contingent feedback, the clamp method eliminates confounding effects that can come about from strategic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McDougle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kim et al., 2020</xref>), and the size of the error can be controlled on every trial. The participant was fully informed of this manipulation and was instructed to ignore the task-irrelevant cursor and always reach straight to the target. Despite these instructions, participants’ reach angles gradually shift in the direction opposite the error clamp, showing the key signatures of implicit sensorimotor adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Morehead et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tsay et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tsay et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Avraham et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Poh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vandevoorde and Orban de Xivry, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yin and Wei, 2020</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sensorimotor adaptation is modulated by arbitrary sensory cues</title><p>In a standard differential conditioning design, one CS is paired with the US (CS+) and another CS is presented without the US (CS−). Thus, only the CS+ should become associated with the US and result in a CR. To implement this in Experiment 1, we used two arbitrary cues for the CSs – a tone or a light cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). For the CS+ condition, the feedback cursor followed a clamped path that was rotated from the target by 15°. Rather than eliminate the US on CS− trials, we used a 0° clamp in which the feedback cursor always moved directly to the target. Thus, there was always a US on each trial, with the 15° US creating an error signal (paired with the CS+) and the 0° US signaling the absence of error (paired with the CS-).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Experiment 1: differential conditioning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental protocol.

Participants exhibited a marked change in movement direction during this phase, reaching an asymptote of ~15° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The observed rapid adaptation is consistent with previous adaptation studies, particularly those in which the target appears at a single fixed location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bond and Taylor, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Day et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McDougle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McDougle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Poh et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The main analysis centered on trial-by-trial changes in heading angle. The change in heading angle from trial <italic>n−</italic>1 to trial <italic>n</italic> is normally dictated by the feedback experienced in trial <italic>n−</italic>1. Thus, following experience with an error on CS+ trials, participants should show increased adaptation (a positive change in heading angle), and following no error on CS− trials, decreased adaptation (i.e. extinction). We refer to these trial-by-trial changes as the ‘adaptation effect,’ the standard measure of learning in sensorimotor adaptation tasks. There was a robust adaptation effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel). Trial-by-trial changes in reaching direction (Δ heading angle) were significantly affected by the CS presented on the previous trial (F[1, 15]=13.4, p=0.002, BF<sub>10</sub>=41.45, and η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.47) such that the change in heading angle was larger after CS+ trials compared to after CS− trials (mean difference: 1.50°, 95% CI: [0.70° 2.30°]). That is, the error occurring on CS+ trials resulted in learning that carried over to the next trial, whereas the absence of an error on a previous CS− trial resulted in a relative reversion to baseline (extinction). This is the canonical signature of incremental sensorimotor adaptation.</p><p>Importantly, the conditioning framework makes a critical prediction. The CS+ and CS− should differentially modulate the hand’s heading angle on trial <italic>n</italic> itself. That is, the presentation of the light or tone should produce a CR associated with that cue, leading to a difference in heading angle on trials with different cues that is independent of the feedback received on the previous trial. We refer to this as the ‘Pavlovian effect.’ As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> (both panels), the results revealed clear Pavlovian effects during the acquisition phase. The heading angle increased in the direction of adaptation on CS+ trials (i.e. a positive change in heading angle relative to previous trials) and decreased on CS− trials (mean difference: 0.82°, 95% CI: [0.13° 1.51°]; F[1, 15]=5.37, p=0.035, BF<sub>10</sub>=2.89, and η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.26). This effect provides a novel demonstration that arbitrary sensory cues can lawfully influence implicit sensorimotor adaptation.</p><p>We also observed an interaction between CS identity on trials <italic>n−</italic>1 and <italic>n</italic> (F[1, 15]=4.70, p=0.047, BF<sub>10</sub>=2.21, and η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.24). That is, the difference between CS+ and CS− was larger on trials following a CS− (mean: 1.05°, 95% CI: [0.20° 1.89°]) compared to trials following a CS+ (0.58°, [–0.13° 1.30°]). This interaction effect may reflect an asymmetry between the rate of the acquisition and extinction processes once CS-US associations are established. That is, the state following a CS+ trial may be closer to its asymptotic limit than after a CS− trial and is thus more limited in its potential for further change.</p><p>We note that the visual feedback was different on CS+ and CS− trials, with the cursor deviating from the target in the former and moving in a straight line to the target in the latter. This raises the possibility that the heading angle differences on CS+ and CS− trials could be affected by online feedback corrections. This explanation is unlikely given that the movements were quite rapid (mean movement time [MT] ± STD, 103±31.2 ms). To assess the online correction hypothesis more directly, we calculated the difference in heading angle 50 ms after movement initiation and at the radial distance of the target. There was no overall change in heading angle between the time points (–0.32°±2.92°) and no significant difference between CS+ and CS− trials on this metric (mean difference: –0.04°, 95% CI: [–0.19° 0.12°]; t[15]=−0.47, p=0.640, BF<sub>10</sub>=0.28, and <italic>d</italic>=−0.12). Thus, our results appear to pertain exclusively to feedforward learning.</p><p>Following the acquisition phase, participants completed a probe phase in which CS+ and CS− trials were randomly presented in the absence of any visual feedback (no US). This phase provides a clean test for associative learning effects since it removes trial-by-trial effects that arise from the differential feedback given during CS+ and CS− acquisition trials. Here too, we observed a clear Pavlovian effect. Although there was an overall decrease in heading angle across the probe phase (i.e. a partial washout of adaptation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), there was a significant main effect of the CS presented on trial <italic>n</italic> (1.06°, [0.53° 1.59°]; F[1, 15]=15.45, p=0.001, BF<sub>10</sub>=72.15, and η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.51; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), with a relative increase in heading angle on CS+ trials and a decrease on CS− trials.</p><p>Despite the absence of feedback in the probe phase, the change in heading angle on trial <italic>n</italic> (CS+ or CS−) should also depend on the CS presented on trial <italic>n−</italic>1. After an association is formed, the motor state, namely the actual heading angle, fluctuates as a function of the presented CS, decreasing on CS− trials (due to extinction) and increasing on CS+ trials (due to conditioning). As such, the heading angle on a CS+ trial should increase more if it follows a CS− trial than if it follows a CS+ trial. Similarly, the heading angle on a CS− trial should decrease more if it follows a CS+ trial than if it follows a CS− trial. While the data appeared to follow this pattern, there was no main effect of the trial <italic>n−</italic>1 CS (–0.44°, [–1.11° 0.24°]; F[1, 15]=1.61, p=0.224, BF<sub>10</sub>=0.56, and η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.10). This may be because, statistically, the main effect of trial <italic>n−</italic>1 considers consecutive trials with a repeated CS (CS+ that follows CS+, and CS− that follows CS−) where the change in heading angle is minimal. Crucially, the Pavlovian effect (the difference between the change in heading angle on CS+ and CS− trials on trial <italic>n</italic>) should not depend on the previous trial. Consistent with this prediction, the trial <italic>n−</italic>1 CS × trial <italic>n</italic> CS interaction was not significant (F[1, 15]=2.03, p=0.175, BF<sub>10</sub>=0.69, and η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.12).</p><p>The Pavlovian effect did not appear to be driven by explicit awareness of the CS-US contingency. A post-experiment survey was used to classify participants as either aware or unaware of the CS-US associations (see Materials and methods). Participants who reported being aware of the contingencies (N=7) did not show a different Pavlovian effect compared to those who reported being unaware (N=9) in either the acquisition (–0.34°, [–1.90° 1.22°]; t[14]=−0.470, p=0.647, BF<sub>10</sub>=0.46, and <italic>d</italic>=−0.24) or probe (–0.14°, [–1.34° 1.07°]; t[14]=−0.242, p=0.813, BF<sub>10</sub>=0.44, and <italic>d</italic>=−0.12) phases. A similar null effect of awareness on the strength of conditioning has also been reported in studies of human delay eyeblink conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clark and Squire, 1998</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the observed effects of context on implicit sensorimotor adaptation in both the acquisition and probe phases in Experiment 1 are consistent with differential conditioning effects. Feedforward implicit sensorimotor adaptation – here operationalized as a type of CR – was differentially modulated by arbitrary sensory CSs, with a greater response to the CS+, the cue that was paired with a visuomotor error.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The Rescorla-Wagner model for context-dependent sensorimotor adaptation</title><p>One influential model that has been used to describe contextual effects in associative learning tasks is the Rescorla-Wagner model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rescorla and Wagner, 1972</xref>).

The state-space model is broadly similar to the Rescorla-Wagner (e.g. both models share the Markov property, produce exponential-family learning curves, etc.). However, the basic state-space model is unable to account for context effects. Unlike the Rescorla-Wagner model, it does not include parameters that allow the updating of separate states that are associated with distinct contexts. It predicts the change in behavior based on the outcome of the previous trial (i.e. the adaptation effect); it cannot account for variation in heading angle due to the CS on the current trial (i.e. the Pavlovian effect; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, right side).</p><p>To formally compare the Rescorla-Wagner and state-space models in terms of the observed results, we conducted a model comparison by fitting each participant’s time course data with the two models.

The Rescorla-Wagner model not only provides a framework for understanding how associations can be formed with arbitrary stimuli, but it can also capture how the strength of these associations is constrained by the relevance of the cues. For instance, gustatory cues are much more likely to be associated with an internal bodily state (e.g. nausea) than a visual cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garcia and Koelling, 1966</xref>). In the current study, the clamped feedback (the US) is a highly relevant stimulus for reaching; as such, we should expect it to have an immediate strong influence on motor behavior. In contrast, the imperative cues (the tone and light CSs) have no natural relevance for reaching; as such, their contribution to the CR should initially be quite modest but gradually increase with experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To test this prediction, we examined the time course of the adaptation and Pavlovian effects during acquisition using a linear mixed model analysis. As expected, at early stages of acquisition, the adaptation effect emerged rapidly, whereas the contribution of the Pavlovian effect was small. Over experience, the relative contribution of the two effects reversed (type X time bin interaction effect: F[1, 365]=16.7, p&lt;0.001). The Pavlovian effect gradually grew (mean slope: 0.14, 95% CI: [0.04 0.24]) at the expense of the adaptation effect, which eventually exhibited a reduced contribution (–0.15, [–0.25 –0.05]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

These results stand in contrast to previous work showing that arbitrary cues are ineffective for separating competing motor memories (e.g. differential responses to clockwise [CW] and counterclockwise [CCW] rotations). This null result has been taken to reflect the irrelevance of such cues to the motor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gandolfo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Karniel and Mussa-Ivaldi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Howard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Howard et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Why were the arbitrary cues effective in Experiment 1? Inspired by studies of eyeblink conditioning, we opted to impose a strong temporal constraint on the CS-US interval. The contextual cues served as the imperative signals, and we required that the participants respond quickly to the imperative, resulting in a mean CS-US interval of around 300 ms. The timing of events was somewhat more relaxed in prior studies. For example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Howard et al., 2013</xref>, the color cues (which could be seen as CSs for differential conditioning) were presented 1000 ms before the imperative. When adding in the reaction time (RT), the CS-US interval may lie beyond the optimal value for cerebellar-dependent learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brudner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kitazawa et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schneiderman and Gormezano, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Smith et al., 1969</xref>). Thus, the reported ineffectiveness of arbitrary cues in separating motor memories may be related to the failure to meet the temporal requirements for forming associations between these cues and their associated feedback signals.</p><p>In Experiment 2, we tested the hypothesis that extending the temporal interval between arbitrary cues and sensorimotor feedback would attenuate or abolish the Pavlovian effect in visuomotor adaptation. To extend the interval, we opted to have the CSs no longer serve as the movement imperative; rather, a new cue, a color change of the target, served as the imperative signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To extend the CS-US interval, we imposed a delay between the onsets of the CS and the imperative. The mean of the delay was set to 1000 ms, with the actual value selected from a distribution ranging from 800 to 1200 ms to maintain unpredictability of the imperative timing (see Materials and methods for details).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Experiment 2: Pavlovian effect in differential conditioning is abolished when the delay between the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US) is long.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of trial events and their timing.

Here, the visual feedback was eliminated, and the presented imperative was either the original compound CS or just the tone or light alone. We observed a significant Pavlovian effect of CS type on these no-feedback trials (Friedman test: χ<sup>2</sup>[2]=9.82, p=0.007, and W=0.223), with larger changes in heading angles on compound CS trials (median: 0.39°, interquartile range: [–0.05° 0.49°]) relative to the tone-alone (–0.15°, [–0.47° 0.18°], p=0.020) or light-alone (–0.22°, [–0.52° 0.34°]p=0.020) trials, conforming to the first prediction of the additivity principle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>).</p><p>We note that the median trial-by-trial change in heading angle for the tone- and light-alone trials is negative. This is because this measure reflects modulations in behavior around the mean heading angle, and this mean decreases over time due to extinction given the absence of the error feedback. This general trend should also vary for the different CSs depending on their relative salience (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kamin, 1967</xref>). Crucially, the additivity principle posits that there should be a negative correlation between the associative strengths of competing CSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rescorla and Wagner, 1972</xref>). That is, if a strong associative bond is formed between one CS and the US, this will come at the expense of the associative strength accrued by competing CSs (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>) given the capacity limit on associability (<italic>V</italic>). This prediction was strikingly confirmed in an analysis of the heading angle changes on tone- and light-alone trials. Participants who were more sensitive to the tone stimulus were less sensitive to the light stimulus and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, Pearson correlation: <italic>r</italic>=−0.72, p&lt;0.001, and BF<sub>10</sub>=163.2).</p><p>As in Experiments 1–3, since the probe phase of Experiment 4 consisted of different types of CSs presented randomly across trials, the behavior for a given trial should reflect not only the CS on trial <italic>n</italic> but also the motor state on trial <italic>n−1</italic> (which is itself also influenced by the CS on that trial). As a further test of compound conditioning, we pooled the two single-CS conditions to measure the effects of the previous and current CS type (singleton vs compound) on the observed changes in heading angle during the probe phase.

They have yielded a rich empirical foundation in the development of theoretical and neural models of learning and memory, particularly with respect to cerebellar function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Albus, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ito, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Marr, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>). Adaptation has typically been modeled from a control engineering perspective, centered on the idea that changes in behavior are driven by sensory prediction errors that arise when experienced feedback deviates from that predicted by a forward model operating on an efference copy of the motor command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Krakauer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wolpert and Flanagan, 2001</xref>). In contrast, eyeblink conditioning is treated as an associative learning process that can be shaped by arbitrary sensory context cues.</p><p>The present study takes a first step toward a more parsimonious framework that might account for these two canonical forms of cerebellar-dependent motor learning. We were motivated by the apparent paradox concerning whether arbitrary stimuli can act as sufficient contextual cues for the establishment of distinct motor memories during sensorimotor adaptation. In attempting to resolve this paradox, we conceptualized adaptation as analogous to associative learning. Seen from this perspective, we recognized that prior studies failing to observe adaptation in response to arbitrary context cues had not considered the short, precise temporal relationship between these cues and sensorimotor feedback. By modifying a visuomotor adaptation task to conform to timing constraints similar to those required for delay eyeblink conditioning, we showed that adaptation exhibited the hallmarks of both differential conditioning (Experiments 1 and 3) and compound conditioning (Experiment 4). These results provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that pairing neutral stimuli (i.e. tones and lights) with distinct visuomotor outcomes can differentially influence implicit feedforward sensorimotor adaptation in a manner consistent with core principles of associative learning.</p><p>The role of context in sensorimotor adaptation has been the subject of considerable debate, with a large body of empirical studies asking whether different sensory cues are sufficient to ‘tag’ different motor memories. Postural and movement-related variables, such as different lead-in and follow-through movements, are very effective contextual cues and allow participants to respond to interleaved, opposing perturbations with minimal interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Howard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Howard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Howard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sheahan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schween et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, arbitrary visual features, such as color cues, have been generally ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gandolfo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Karniel and Mussa-Ivaldi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Howard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Howard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Krouchev and Kalaska, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Osu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Forano et al., 2021</xref>). To account for this discrepancy, it has been proposed that movement-related cues are dynamically incorporated into the motor state, allowing for the separation of distinct internal models, whereas arbitrary cues are not sufficiently relevant to the motor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Howard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Howard et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we found compelling contextual effects using arbitrary sensory cues. Importantly, like delay eyeblink conditioning, these effects were subject to strong temporal constraint on the interval between the CS and US, similar to what is observed in other forms of cerebellar-dependent sensorimotor learning. Robust differential conditioning behavior was observed when the CS-US interval was short (Experiments 1 and 3); increasing the interval by just ~1000 ms abolished the Pavlovian effect (Experiment 2). These results are also consistent with prior evidence showing that the efficacy of movement-related cues is highly sensitive to timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Howard et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>These temporal constraints are likely built into standard adaptation tasks. The target is a salient stimulus that defines the task goal and movement plan, and its onset usually serves as the imperative for movement initiation. RTs in these tasks are typically below 500 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Avraham et al., 2021</xref>). As such, a tight temporal link is established between target appearance and movement, echoing (perhaps inadvertently) the CS-US temporal constraints essential for cerebellar-dependent conditioning. Under these conditions, the target can be viewed as a highly effective contextual cue.</p><p>More precisely, we propose that it is the movement plan itself that constitutes the primary, strongest CS. While the movement plan and target appearance usually coincide spatially (i.e. people aim to the target), this is not always the case. For example, with a standard visuomotor rotation, participants often deliberately aim away from the target, especially when the perturbation is large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hegele and Heuer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>). Recognizing this ‘re-aimed’ plan as behaving like a CS may provide a parsimonious account of several phenomena. First, generalization of adaptation appears to be centered around the direction of the movement plan, not the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Day et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McDougle et al., 2017</xref>). Speculatively, this mirrors generalization effects seen in eyeblink conditioning, where variations on the learned CS (e.g. altering a tone’s frequency) lead to parametric changes in CR probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Siegel et al., 1968</xref>). These changes produce a similar Gaussian generalization function as that seen in adaptation generalization. Second, even in the absence of distinct contextual movements (e.g. follow-throughs), the mere activation of different motor plans can serve as efficient contextual cues, negating interference effects from opposing perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sheahan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sheahan et al., 2018</xref>). Third, an emphasis on the movement plan is in accord with theoretical models of cerebellar-dependent adaptation, where the prediction that constitutes the basis for the sensory prediction error is computed using an efference copy of the movement intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blakemore et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kawato and Gomi, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>We considered the possibility that the movement plan is a highly salient CS when designing the task. Participants were always moving to a single target location. Studies of motor adaptation commonly use multiple targets that span the entire workspace. However, the use of multiple targets could effectively increase the number of CSs in the task. By the additivity principle, these would compete with the arbitrary tone and light CSs, making it harder to observe their contribution to the Pavlovian effect. In addition, using a single target location allowed us to have the target remain on the screen throughout the entire experiment, eliminating any temporal linkage between the onset of the target and the feedback. While a single target may facilitate the use of simple explicit strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">McDougle and Taylor, 2019</xref>), empirically, there is considerable evidence demonstrating that the clamp method effectively isolates implicit adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Morehead et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tsay et al., 2020c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Avraham et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the Pavlovian effects were similar for the subset of participants who recognized the contingency between the CS and the US as for those who did not (see Results). Thus, while explicit strategies cannot be completely ruled out, we do not believe they significantly drove the observed effects.</p><p>Our focus in this study was on features of sensorimotor adaptation that map onto a CS, US, and CR. The UR in this context could be defined as an automatic action that is immediately triggered by the US, such as an online correction to the perceived error. While there is a rich literature showing the automatic and relatively fast latency of this corrective response (e.g. around 150 ms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carroll et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franklin and Wolpert, 2008</xref>), to isolate feedforward adaptation, we opted to use rapid shooting movements that precluded online corrections (see Results). We recognize that a feedback response potentiated by the perturbation might be utilized for feedforward learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert and Shadmehr, 2016</xref>). However, a UR is not always required for conditioning processes arising from volitional behaviors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cartoni et al., 2016</xref>). Future work is needed to better understand the role of URs within our framework.</p><p>In terms of the feedforward response, there were notable differences in the extent of adaptation across the four experiments. Overall heading angle reached asymptotic values of ~15° in Experiments 1 and 4 and ~25° in Experiments 2 and 3. These differences are likely due to changes in the experimental platform. Experiments 1 and 4 were conducted in our laboratory, using a tablet and digitizing pen setup in which the movements involve arm movements of at least 8 cm. In contrast, Experiments 2 and 3 were conducted via a web-based platform, with each participant using their personal computer with a mouse or a trackpad to produce wrist or finger movements of ~2 cm (depending on the sensitivity of the device). Although basic phenomena of visuomotor adaptation are similar between lab- and web-based platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tsay et al., 2021</xref>), there may be mechanistic differences. For example, with our laboratory setup, the monitor is positioned just above the hand. As such, the stimuli and movement are in parallel planes, and there is a 1:1 correspondence between the distance moved and the extent of the cursor movement. For the web-based platform, the stimuli and movement occur in roughly orthogonal planes, and there is a gain factor such that the cursor movement is larger than the hand movement. We expect that the laboratory setup may be much better suited for providing reliable information concerning proprioception, information that may limit the extent of adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Salomonczyk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tsay et al., 2022</xref>). Given that proprioceptive and visual signals are not aligned in the web-based studies, proprioception may have a reduced effect in limiting adaptation, leading to a higher asymptote.</p><p>To formally relate eyeblink conditioning and adaptation, we implemented the Rescorla-Wagner model, a classic associative learning model that has been widely employed in the classical and operant conditioning literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rescorla and Wagner, 1972</xref>). The success of this model to capture the general features of the current datasets should not be surprising since the model was developed to account for phenomena such as differential conditioning and compound conditioning. Thus, it was somewhat overdetermined that the Rescorla-Wagner model would provide better fits than the standard state-space model in our study, given that the latter cannot capture contextual effects. In theory, a standard state-space model could be modified such that different sensory cues become associated with different independent states to allow for context-dependent learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heald et al., 2018</xref>). However, we emphasize that to account for compound conditioning, and in particular the additivity principle (i.e. overshadowing), a state-space model would essentially have to be transformed into a facsimile of a Rescorla-Wagner model, supporting our key conclusions.</p><p>The Rescorla-Wagner model offers an account of how arbitrary sensory cues, visual targets, and movement plans can serve as CSs for adaptation. There are, however, some notable phenomena in the sensorimotor adaptation literature that are neither accounted for by our application of the Rescorla-Wagner model nor by the basic state-space model. Given the prominent role of the state-space model in the sensorimotor adaptation literature, variants of this model were developed to capture these observations. One such effect is spontaneous recovery, the re-manifestation of a previously adapted state in the absence of error feedback. A variant of the state-space model, one that allows for multiple states with different learning and forgetting rates, can capture spontaneous recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). A second example is the relationship between learning rate and environmental consistency; learning is faster in response to a consistent vs inconsistent perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albert et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avraham et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gonzalez Castro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herzfeld et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hutter and Taylor, 2018</xref>). To account for this effect, the state-space model can be modified to allow the learning rate to vary with experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herzfeld et al., 2014</xref>). A third example is savings upon relearning, where faster adaptation is observed upon a second exposure to the same perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Krakauer et al., 2005</xref>). Studies have modeled savings using multi-rate state-space models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Smith et al., 2006</xref>), learning rate modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herzfeld et al., 2014</xref>), or a combination of these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zarahn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mawase et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>These higher-order phenomena have also been addressed in a new model of sensorimotor learning, one that takes a Bayesian inference approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Heald et al., 2021</xref>). The contextual inference (COIN) model posits that motor adaptation arises from two interacting mechanisms: proper learning, which involves the creation and updating of context-specific memories, and apparent learning, a process of inferring the current context to determine which memory to express (recall). Unlike conventional context-independent models of motor adaptation, the COIN model stresses the importance of the environment in guiding memory retrieval. In one sense, our implementation of the Rescorla-Wagner model follows a similar philosophy. However, it maps to the proper learning component of the COIN model since we assume that the current context is determined by the actual properties of the environment in an all-or-none manner (e.g. the CS presented by the experimenter). The COIN model suggests that spontaneous recovery, consistency effects, and savings may emerge due to contextual inferences; these inferences likely involve cognitive systems related to executive function and non-motor memory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collins and McDougle, 2021</xref>). Consistent with this view, growing evidence shows that these phenomena are, in large degree, the result of strategic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Morehead et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Leow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avraham et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Avraham et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>While the basic Rescorla-Wagner model is unable to account for higher order effects such as spontaneous recovery or savings, we envision that complimenting it with more sophisticated, Bayesian inference models could readily accommodate these phenomena. In fact, models that combine associative mechanisms with some form of a Bayesian inference process that carves the world into distinct contexts have successfully captured a range of complex phenomena in classical conditioning and reinforcement learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collins and Frank, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Courville et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gershman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kruschke, 2008</xref>). We believe that our results lay the foundation for adopting a similar approach to study implicit sensorimotor adaptation and perhaps a more general account that captures the operation and interaction of multiple learning processes.</p><p>Motivated by the cerebellar literature, we limited our focus to delay eyeblink conditioning in considering how associative learning mechanisms can account for contextual effects in sensorimotor adaptation. We recognize that conditioning effects can be much more complex than the behavioral changes that arise from the pairing of two stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rescorla, 1988</xref>). These include associations between a CS and an action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Skinner, 1938</xref>), learning that does not abide by strict timing requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gallistel and Gibbon, 2000</xref>), and other conditioning processes (e.g. trace conditioning) that rely on brain structures outside the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clark et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clark and Squire, 1998</xref>). Multiple learning processes allow the organism to build a comprehensive representation of the world, with the ability to flexibly modify behavior at many levels of control in response to changes in the contingencies between the body and environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McDougle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). Nonetheless, by showing that core constraints of delay eyeblink conditioning are relevant for sensorimotor adaptation, our study may inform a formal framework that looks at these two domains in a more unified manner.</p><p>Although our results highlight principles that address context-dependent sensorimotor adaptation, they do not speak to the error-correcting adaptation algorithm itself. Conventional models of this algorithm focus on the role of forward models in predicting future sensory states and updating motor commands to reduce sensory prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wolpert and Ghahramani, 2000</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hadjiosif et al., 2021</xref>). Associative learning alone does not provide a mechanism for the error-correction process (e.g. the directional change of reaching movements given rotated feedback or the precise timing of an eyeblink response to a predicted air puff). Rather, it describes the association between a contextual cue and a salient event (e.g. shock, reward, etc.). Speculatively, an alternative idea is that sensorimotor adaptation may operate as a lookup table of context-outcome associations learned by a system designed to keep the sensorimotor system calibrated. A model-free conception like this could bring sensorimotor adaptation closer to classical associative models of cerebellar learning and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Albus, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ito, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Marr, 1969</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>166 healthy volunteers (aged 18–35 years; 98 females, 6 identified as ‘other’) participated in either Experiment 1 (N=16), Experiment 2 (N=64), Experiment 3 (N=64), or Experiment 4 (N=22). In Experiments 1 and 4, all participants were right handed, as self-reported and verified with the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. The participants in Experiments 2 and 3 did not complete a handedness inventory, but 108 of them self-reported being right handed, 17 left-handed, and 3 ambidextrous. The sample size for each experiment was set to ensure good statistical power (details provided in the protocol for each experiment). The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of California, Berkeley.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental setup and task</title><p>In Experiments 1 and 4, the participant sat at a custom-made table that housed a horizontally mounted LCD screen (53.2 cm by 30 cm, ASUS), positioned 27 cm above a digitizing tablet (49.3 cm by 32.7 cm, Intuos 4XL; Wacom, Vancouver, WA, USA). The participant held in their right hand a hockey paddle that contained an embedded digitizing stylus. The monitor occluded direct vision of the hand, and the room lights were extinguished to minimize peripheral vision of the arm. Reaching movements were performed by sliding the paddle across the tablet. The sampling rate of the tablet was 200 Hz.</p><p>For Experiments 2 and 3, we used a web-based platform that was created for conducting web-based studies in sensorimotor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tsay et al., 2020b</xref>). Since participants performed the experiment remotely with their personal computer, the test apparatus varied across participants. Based on self-report data, 71 participants used an optical mouse, 55 used a trackpad, and 2 used trackball. Monitor sizes varied between 11 and 30 inches. The sizes of the stimuli were adjusted to the monitor size. Below we refer to the stimuli magnitudes in the lab-based experimental setup (Experiments 1 and 4).</p><p>At the beginning of each trial, a white circle (0.5 cm diameter) appeared at the center of the black screen, indicating the start location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The participant moved the stylus to the start location. Feedback of hand position (i.e. the stylus position) was indicated by a white cursor (0.3 cm diameter), provided only when the hand was within 1 cm of the start location. A single blue target (0.6 cm diameter) was positioned 8 cm from the start location. In most studies of adaptation, the appearance of the target specifies both the movement goal (where to reach) and serves as the imperative (when to reach). From a classical conditioning perspective, the target should constitute a very salient CS given that its onset is temporally contingent with the US, the visual feedback associated with the movement (see below). To eliminate this temporal contingency, the target remained visible at the same location during the entire experiment. For each participant, the target was placed at one of four locations, either 45, 135, 225, and 315°, and this location was counterbalanced across participants.</p><p>The task included the presentation of neutral (non-spatial) CS(s). We used two different CSs, a tone and a light, both of which have no inherent association with the US. The tone CS was a pure sine wave tone with a frequency of 440 Hz. The light CS was a white rectangular frame (39.4 cm × 26.2 cm) that spanned the perimeter of the visual workspace. The large frame was selected to provide a salient visual stimulus but one that would not be confused with the target.</p><p>Depending on the specific experimental protocol and task phase, the CSs could appear alone or together on a trial. In Experiments 1 and 4, the onset of the CS served as the imperative signal, with the participant instructed to rapidly reach directly toward the target, slicing through the target. The onset of the CS occurred following a pseudo-random and predetermined delay after the hand was positioned at the start location. This was done to mitigate predictions regarding the timing of the CS onset. The delay ranged between 800 and 1200 ms (in steps of 100 ms), drawn from a uniform distribution. While the CSs were also presented in Experiments 2 and 3, a different signal was used for the movement imperative (see below). In all experiments, the CS was terminated when the hand reached the radial distance to the target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In delay eyeblink conditioning, learning is optimal when the US is presented 100–500 ms after the CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schneiderman and Gormezano, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Smith et al., 1969</xref>). To minimize the delay between the onset of the CS (or the other imperative cue) and the US, the auditory message ‘start faster’ was played whenever an RT exceeded 400 ms. RT was operationalized as the interval between the imperative onset and the time required for the radial distance of the hand to exceed 1 cm. Pilot work showed that RTs with the variable imperative onset time were always greater than 100 ms; as such, we did not set a minimum RT bound. Given our objective to test the link between feedforward adaptation and classical conditioning, we sought to eliminate online feedback corrections. Participants were instructed to make rapid movements, and the auditory message ‘move faster’ was played whenever MT exceeded 300 ms. The end of the movement was operationalized as the point where the radial distance of the hand reached 8 cm.</p><p>Experiments 2 and 3 were designed to test the hypothesis that the time interval between the arbitrary cues and the sensorimotor feedback is critical for driving Pavlovian effects. To this end, we did not use the CS onset as the imperative signal; rather, we introduced a new cue, a color change of the target from gray to blue, to serve as the imperative signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). The difference between the two experiments was the interval between the onsets of the CS (tone or light) and imperative. In Experiment 2, the imperative was delayed with respect to CS onset, with the delay drawn from a uniform distribution ranging from 800 to 1200 ms (in steps of 100 ms). As such, we added a mean of 1000 ms to the CS-US interval. The delay distribution that we used added variance to the CS-US interval, allowing us to make sure that, like Experiment 1, participants could not anticipate the onset of the imperative. This was important since predictability of the imperative timing could have decreased RTs and thus effectively decrease the delay between the CS and the feedback. We also note that previous evidence from eyeblink conditioning shows that the CR is minimally affected by the variability in the CS-US interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Patterson, 1970</xref>). In Experiment 3, the CS and imperative were simultaneous (similar to the timing in Experiment 1). Trial durations were made comparable between Experiments 2 and 3 by setting the mean interval from the trial onset to the imperative in Experiment 3 to match that of Experiment 2.</p><p>For the US, we used task-irrelevant clamped feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Morehead et al., 2017</xref>). With clamped feedback, the radial position of the visual cursor is matched to the radial position of the hand. However, the angular position of the cursor is fixed. The participant thus controlled the speed and radial distance of the cursor, but not its direction. When designed to produce a prediction error and elicit implicit sensorimotor adaptation, the clamp followed a path that deviated from the target by 15°, with the direction, i.e., CW or CCW, counterbalanced across participants. We also included no-error trials (Experiments 1–3) by presenting clamped feedback that followed a path directly to the target (0° clamp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The nature of the clamp manipulation was described in detail to the participant, and they were explicitly instructed strictly to ignore the feedback, aiming their reach directly toward the target on every trial. These instructions were designed to emphasize that the participant did not control the cursor’s angular position and that they should always attempt to reach directly to the target. The instructions of the task were reinforced by the presentation of short video animations to demonstrate how the CSs would serve as imperative signals, as well as to show the invariant direction of the clamped feedback.</p><p>For the lab-based experiments (Experiments 1 and 4), the experimental software was custom written in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), using the Psychtoolbox package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brainard, 1997</xref>).

During the acquisition phase, clamped feedback was presented on each trial, serving as the US. During the probe phase, the clamped feedback was not presented. In both phases, the participants were instructed to reach straight to the target as soon as the imperative appeared. Note that we opted to not include baseline reaching blocks prior to the start of the acquisition phases to avoid introducing any incidental associations between the baseline feedback and the target, movement plan, and any other contextual variables. For the lab-based Experiments 1 and 4, a break of approximately 1 min was provided in the middle of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Experiments 1–3: differential conditioning</title><p>Experiment 1 (N=16) was designed to test differential conditioning in the context of a sensorimotor adaptation task. The target number of participants was determined based on the effect size (d=0.67) observed for the Pavlovian effect in a pilot study, with a significance level of <italic>α</italic>=0.05 and power of 0.8. Experiments 2 and 3 were designed to test temporal constraints on differential conditioning. Participants (N=64 per experiment, 128 total) were recruited using the crowdsourcing website Prolific (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.prolific.co">www.prolific.co</ext-link>). The minimum sample size for each experiment was determined based on the sample size of Experiment 1 (N=16), where robust Pavlovian effects were observed. However, we have found that data collected with our web-based platform are more variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tsay et al., 2021</xref>). As such, we opted to use a larger sample size, setting our target as 64 participants for each experiment.</p><p>The session consisted of 800 trials: 600 acquisition trials followed by 200 probe trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). One of two CSs (tone or light) was presented on each trial, serving as the imperative for the reaching response. During the acquisition phase, one CS was paired with 15° clamped error feedback (CS+ condition) and the other CS was paired with 0° clamped feedback (CS− condition). Each CS was presented on 50% of the trials, and the assignment of the tone and light to the CS+ and CS− was counterbalanced across participants. During the probe phase, each CS was presented alone on half of the trials, and there was no visual feedback.</p><p>For both the acquisition and probe phases, the CS+ and CS− trials were interleaved in a pseudo-random order that was unique to each participant. To ensure that the participant would not be able to predict the CS type, the generated trial sequence for each participant was assessed to verify that there was no significant lag-1 autocorrelation in the time series. At the end of the experimental session, we assessed whether participants were aware of the contingency between each CS and its associated feedback, asking, ‘did you identify any pattern in the experiment?’ in a free-response survey.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Experiment 4: compound conditioning</title><p>The adaptation task was modified in Experiment 4 (N=22) to provide a test of compound conditioning.

Our main analyses focused on the reach direction (heading angle) and the trial-by-trial changes in heading angle (Δ heading angle). Heading angle was defined by two imaginary lines, one from the start position to the target and the other from the start position to the hand position at maximum movement velocity.</p><p>For all analyses, and to visualize the results, the sign of the heading angle was flipped for participants who experienced a CCW clamp, such that a positive heading angle is in the direction of expected adaptation (i.e. opposite the direction of the perturbed feedback). Moreover, the heading angle on the first acquisition trial was treated as the baseline reaching angle and subtracted from the heading angle on all subsequent trials (We note that the results remain unchanged in terms of statistical comparisons if this baseline subtraction step is omitted.).</p><p>For lab-based experiments (1 and 4), trials in which the heading angle was larger than 100° off from the target, or in which the trial-to-trial change in heading angle was larger than 25°, were considered outliers and not included in the analyses. For web-based experiments (2 and 3), outlier trials were considered trials in which the heading angle was beyond the range of –50–70° off the target, or in which the trial-to-trial change in heading angle was larger than 20°. The criteria for considering outlier trials were determined after visual examination of the time courses of all individuals in each experimental platform (lab-based and web-based). To eliminate biases, the CS was not visible in the trial traces. Outliers constituted 0.03 (Experiment 1), 1.26 (Experiment 2), 1.44 (Experiment 3), and 0.16% (Experiment 4) of the trials in each experiment.</p><p>For the change in heading angle analysis, but not for the presentation of heading angle time courses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8B</xref>), we excluded trials in which the RT exceeded 400 ms and/or MT exceeded 300 ms (Experiment 1: 11% of acquisition trials and 4.3% of probe trials; Experiment 2: 19% of acquisition trials and 16% of probe trials; Experiment 3: 19% of acquisition trials and 15% of probe trials; Experiment 4: 3.4% of acquisition trials and 4.9% of probe trials).</p><p>In Experiments 1–3, the primary analyses examined how the Δ heading angle was influenced by the CS type (CS+ vs CS−), either in terms of the previous trial (<italic>n−</italic>1, adaptation effect) or current trial (<italic>n</italic>, Pavlovian effect). For each participant and phase (acquisition or probe), we calculated the average Δ heading angle for four types of trials: CS+ trials that follow CS+ trials, CS− after CS+, CS+ after CS−, and CS− after CS−. For each phase, a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted with two within-participant independent factors, the CS on trial <italic>n−</italic>1 and the CS on trial <italic>n</italic>, each with two levels, CS+ and CS−. The Δ heading angle was the dependent variable in the two ANOVAs. To examine the dynamics of the adaptation and Pavlovian effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), we binned the heading angle data into epochs of 50 trials. Within each bin, we performed a multiple regression analysis to test whether trial-to-trial changes in heading angle can be predicted from the previous trial CS, the current trial CS, and their interaction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> presents the mean ± SEM regression <italic>β</italic> weights of all simulated time courses for the previous (adaptation effect) and current (Pavlovian effect) predictors. To evaluate statistically the changes in <italic>β</italic> weights for each type of effect across bins, we used a linear mixed model (R statistical package: lmerTest), with type (adaptation and Pavlovian) and bin as fixed effects and participants as random effects.</p><p>To assess whether the Pavlovian effect in Experiment 1 is influenced by the awareness about the contingency between each CS and its respective feedback, we divided the participants based on their responses to the post experiment questionnaire (see Experimental protocol): 7 out of the 16 participants stated the correct contingency between the CS and the visual feedback and were thus considered the ‘aware sub-group.’ The rest of the participants (N=9) reported that they did not identify any pattern related to the CS-US contingency and were considered the ‘unaware sub-group.’ Independent two-sample <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare the Pavlovian effects between these groups during the acquisition and probe phases of the experiment.</p><p>Feedback correction was operationalized as the difference between the heading angle measured at the radial distance to the target and at 50 ms after movement initiation. We estimated the mean and SD of feedback correction across all acquisition trials in all the participants in Experiment 1. In addition, we calculated, for each participant, the mean feedback correction for each of the CS+ and CS− trials and used a paired-sample <italic>t</italic> test to examine within-participant changes in feedback correction between the two trial types.</p><p>In Experiment 4, the analysis focused on the probe phase in which there was no visual feedback. We compared the Δ heading angle in response to the three CSs on trial <italic>n</italic> (compound CS, light alone, tone alone) regardless of the CS presented on trial <italic>n−</italic>1. As the assumption of normality was not met for the distribution of one of the conditions, we used the non-parametric Friedman test, with the Δ heading angle as the dependent variable, and the CS type as the within-participant independent variable.</p><p>The additivity principle of the Rescorla-Wagner model states that the elements of the compound CS will compete with one another for the strength of association with the US (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>).

We set US=0 in all the trials of the probe phase.</p><p>To illustrate the predictions of the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8D</xref>, we chose parameters that result in qualitatively similar effects to the experimental results. For both Experiments 1 and 2, we set <italic>λ</italic> to 15, similar to the observed implicit adaptation asymptotes in these experiments, as well as in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bond and Taylor, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Morehead et al., 2017</xref>). The value of <italic>β</italic> was set to 0.12 (Experiment 1) or 0.02 (Experiment 4), the salience parameter (<italic>α</italic>) for the movement plan CS to 0.99, and both the tone CS and light CS to 0.002 (Experiment 1) or 0.1 (Experiment 4). These divergent salience values are consistent with the assumption that most of the associative strength of the US would be absorbed by the movement plan CS given its central relevance to the task of reaching to a target. The remainder of potential associative strength to the US is thus available for the tone and light CSs.</p><p>To demonstrate how the choice of parameters in the Rescorla-Wagner model influences the predicted Pavlovian effects, we simulated behavior using various combinations of the free parameters. We chose several combinations of values for <italic>β</italic> and <italic>λ</italic>, and, for each combination, a wide range of values for <italic>α<sub>goal</sub>, α<sub>tone</sub></italic> and <italic>α<sub>light</sub></italic> (For simplicity, we constrained <italic>α<sub>tone</sub></italic> and <italic>α<sub>light</sub></italic> to the same value.). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> displays heatmaps resulting from these simulations, with the color of each cell corresponding to the simulated difference in the trial-by-trial change in heading angle between CS+ and CS− trials. In addition, we illustrated that a single-process state-space model, a standard model of sensorimotor adaptation, cannot capture these Pavlovian effects. In this model, the motor state is updated according to the error observed during the previous movement. The parameters of this model determine both the trial-by-trial retention of the previous motor state and the rate of learning from errors (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref> in the Results). For the simulation presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the error was fixed to one of two values during the acquisition phase, either –15° on CS+ trials or 0° on CS− trials, and in the probe phase, it was set to 0° on all trials.</p><p>While the two models share similar features and parameters (e.g. learning rate of an error signal), the additional parameters in the Rescorla-Wagner model allow it to capture the effects of differential and compound conditioning, should these processes be operative in our experiments. For example, in the differential conditioning case, modifying the parameters of the Rescorla-Wagner model could produce changes in the magnitude of both the within-trial ‘Pavlovian’ effects (i.e. the modulation of behavior in response to the current CS, or ‘trial <italic>n</italic>’ effects) and across-trial adaptation effects (i.e. the modulation of behavior in response to the current state of learning, or ‘trial <italic>n−</italic>1’ effects). However, the Rescorla-Wagner model will always yield unique responses to the CS+ and CS− given non-zero salience parameters. In contrast, no combination of the <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> parameters in the state-space model will produce differential responses to the tone and light CSs.</p><p>To simulate the dynamics of the adaptation and Pavlovian effects in differential conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and to compare it to the dynamics observed in the actual data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), we simulated the trial-by-trial change in heading angle during acquisition (600 trials) according to the Rescorla-Wagner model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ3">Equations 1; 3</xref>) and the state-space model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>.) based on the schedules of CS+ and CS− trials that were presented to the participants (16 simulated time courses). For the Rescorla-Wagner model, we used the same parameters values that generated the simulation results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>. For the state-space model, we set the <italic>A</italic> parameter to 0.9 and <italic>B</italic> to 0.12. We then did the same trial-by-trial regression analysis described above for the actual heading angle data (see Data analysis) with the exception that the dependent variable was now the simulated change in heading angle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Model fitting and comparison</title><p>We conducted a post-hoc model comparison analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In this analysis, we fit the Rescorla-Wagner model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ3">Equations 1; 3</xref>) and the standard state-space model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>) to participants’ heading angle time course data of Experiment 1. The two models were fit by minimizing the sum of squared residuals between the measured and modeled movement data, using the MATLAB function fmincon. To avoid local minima, 200 randomized sets of initial parameter values were used during fitting, and the best fit of each model was selected for model comparison. Models were compared using both the sum of squared residuals and the AIC approximated on the residuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaike, 1974</xref>). All free parameters were bound at (0, 1), except for <italic>λ</italic>, which was bounded at (–30, 60). We did not perform model fitting for Experiment 4 since all trials were identical in the acquisition phase. As such, the salience parameters in the Rescorla-Wagner model for the goal, tone, and light are unidentifiable, and both models make indistinguishable behavioral predictions during acquisition.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Senior editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of California, Berkeley (Protocol 2016-02-8439) and adhered to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

In a compelling result, the authors show that by pairing movement-related feedback with conditioning cues in the form of neutral auditory or visual contextual cues can be used to differentiate between sensorimotor perturbations/states. This work nicely integrates multiple literatures surrounding the processes supported by the cerebellum and solves a long-standing puzzle of exactly how and when arbitrary cues can serve to shape motor adaptation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75801.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Taraz</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00jmfr291</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2020.09.14.297143">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.297143v4">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) More evidence for the temporal specificity of results. The authors advance the idea that the key difference between the current results and previous work that has failed to find evidence of associative learning is the temporal relationship between cues and feedback. However, no experimental evidence is provided that this timing is fundamental. There is a need for new data showing the importance of the temporal relationship to support many of the conclusions drawn in the article. (See comments from reviewer 2 below.)</p><p>2) There are many instances of places in the manuscript that lacked clarity and could benefit from more exposition and inclusion of some of the supplementary analyses. These include a better explanation of the task, how the various stimuli (US, CS, etc) map onto the task, the inclusion of Supp. Figure 1 in the main text, and (See comments from both reviewers below.)</p><p>3) More discussion about the models considered and their similarities/differences and their diverging predictions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I recommend writing a clearer explanation of the associative learning approach investigated here and the relationship between standard ways of looking at visuomotor rotation and associative learning and making the notation for the latter clear and concise</p><p>I suspect some of the readers of this article will be more familiar with VR rotation and dynamic learning as less so with classical conditioning. The task could certainly be explained more clearly.</p><p>It would help to have a more explanation of how the current study operates as a standard visuo motor rotation task. Then explain how this is related to a classical conditioning task. There are lots of abbreviations including CS+, CS- etc. it would be helpful to have a table to illustrate the analogous link between conditioning and VR learning.</p><p>Figure 1 could be explained better. Suggest having a bigger schematic of the task since understanding this is key to understanding the article. maybe have it as a single figure</p><p>Simulations of the RW models are carried out. However only their basic formulas are stated (Equations 1 and 2). It would be better to show more details in the methods (by providing the equations) for how precisely experiments 1 and 2 were simulated. pseudocode for explaining simulations would also be nice.</p><p>There is a mention of simple state space models not being able to deal with contextual effects. It would be useful to elaborate on this with reference to the equations that describe these models. It would also be helpful to discuss the differences between RW model and state space models, And also the deficiencies of both.</p><p>Supplementary figures are used. I would suggest it's better to fully explain them and include them as part of the main document.</p><p>The Github supplementary materials appears to be a clone of the author's working directory for simulations of this project and it is also hard to follow. There is of course no need for all this detail, but it's fine to provide it. I would however suggest that the main scripts for critical simulations for Experiments 1 and 2 are made easy to identify and run, if readers wish to do so.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Temporal specificity of results: The authors predict and conclude that the key parameter for observing associative learning when using arbitrary stimuli as contextual cues is the temporal relationship of these cues to the feedback. They provide compelling evidence of associative learning however at present provide no evidence of the importance of this temporal relationship. Considering this is assumed to be the key difference between the current results and previous work who have failed to find an effect, I believe the article requires additional work (maybe by introducing a delay between CS and movement) that examines the importance of this temporal relationship. Providing evidence that the associative learning effect is dependent on the timing between the cue and feedback being between 100-500ms is fundamental to support some conclusions made in the article.</p><p>Exp 1 probe phase results: Whilst not significant (n-1 x n interaction), there seemed to be a clear difference between CS+ trials within the different trial n-1 contexts (Figure 1D). In fact, this difference seems bigger (and as consistent) as the meaningful/significant differences which are focused on. Interestingly, the RW model predicts a clear n-1 x n interaction however it is not discussed why (Figure 1F). To me it seems that the behaviour (at least partially) and model reflect an interaction between trial n-1 and n during probe trials however this is currently not discussed. Could the authors elaborate on this result and include this in the article?</p><p>Magnitude of effect (supplementary S1 figure): Suppl Figure 1 needs to be in the main article as it provides context and some 'raw' data. It would also be beneficial to have in the main article a similar figure but with the CS+ and CS- trial types separated. Suppl Figure 1 is important as it highlights that the conditioning effects are relatively small. This needs to be explained/mentioned in the results i.e., that the differences between CS+ vs CS- (1-degree) are approx. 6% of the total adaptation that occurred (15-degrees). I suppose this is referred to within the final exp 1 analysis (Figure 2B) but its not explicit. Although I believe the results are important, the article currently reads as if these conditioning effects were large when in fact other people might conclude that conditioning had little impact on adaptation (as similar adaptation (approx. 15-degrees) was observed across both contexts (assumed as this is not shown) and performance looks very similar to exp 2 where there was no 0-degree context). There needs to be some acknowledgement of the fact that while these conditioning effects appear meaningful, they were small (with most participants showing less than a 1-degree difference between contexts).</p><p>Exp 2 results: It was unclear to me why the RW model would predict a negative heading angle within the single CS conditions (Figure 3C)? I understand that a weaker conditioning response would be expected due to compound conditioning, but would you not expect this still to be positive? Why would the model predict extinction to occur and why is this seen in the behaviour? The details of this result (and the predictions of the model) are currently not discussed in sufficient/any detail.</p><p>What is the CS (confusion between results and discussion)? Between lines 395-410 the authors describe the primary CS as being the heading angle ('the movement plan itself, rather than the target cue, that constitutes the primary CS'), however in the results (lines 74-96) they describe the CS as being the arbitrary cue ('When considered through the lens of classical conditioning, the arbitrary cues are the conditioned stimuli (CSs)') and the CR being the heading angle ('the conditioned response (CR) would be the movement heading angle elicited by a CS'). As a result of this discrepancy, I found this section of the discussion very confusing (lines 387-410 and then again from line 433). Are the authors saying that sometimes the heading angle/plan is the CS and other times it is the CR…? How does this all align? One can see why a suggestion for a figure showing this mechanism visually is suggested below.</p><p>Link between this work and recent contextual inference model by Heald et al.,: Could the authors provide a more direct comparison between the current work and the contextual inference model by Heald et al., (in discussion)? The authors currently say 'their model suggests that spontaneous recovery and consistency effects emerge due to contextual inferences that likely interact with deliberate changes in explicit strategies' however does this align with the current work? How does contextual inference align/differ with these conditioning mechanisms? In future work, the authors seem to want to explain the phenomena (spontaneous recovery etc) recently explained by this model and I am interested to know whether these are competing explanations or are explaining the same mechanism or are different but complementary?</p><p>Use of supplementary figures: Why did the authors decide to put so much of the important detail into the supplementary? In my opinion, all of this should be in the main article.</p><p>Normality of data and presentation of individual data: There is no mention of any assessment of data normality, was the data normally distributed? In addition, a greater amount of individual data should be shown rather than mean +- SEM.</p><p>Figure to represent conditioning mechanism: I would find it very helpful if an additional figure was added which showed the US, UR, CS and CR visually. I kept forgetting how each of them were proposed to be represented in the task.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75801.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) More evidence for the temporal specificity of results.

We agree that temporal specificity is an important issue given the parallelism we wish to make between adaptation and eyeblink conditioning. We have collected new data to examine this question.</p><p>We designed a new variant of Experiment 1, our differential conditioning experiment. To highlight the change, we provide a schematic comparing the events in Experiment 1 and the new Experiment 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). (The schematic for the new Exp 2 appears in the new Figure 6A in the revision). In Experiment 1, the tone and light CSs served as the imperative signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). By requiring a rapid response to the CS, we created a tight temporal link between the cue (CS) and the movement (and thus also the feedback, the US). In the new experiment (reported as Experiment 2 in the revision), we modified the task such that the movement imperative was signaled by a separate cue, a color change of the target from gray to blue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). This subtle alteration allowed us to impose a delay between the CS onset and imperative cue. The delay was pseudo-randomly drawn from a uniform distribution of values between 800-1,200 ms (in steps of 100 ms). As such, the timing of the imperative was unpredictable (like in Experiment 1), and critically, the delay values were beyond what is typically considered optimal for cerebellar-dependent conditioning. We hypothesized that, like prior studies (e.g., Howard et al. 2012, 2013), the Pavlovian effect (or trial <italic>n</italic> effect) observed with a shorter CS-US interval (i.e., the ~300 ms reaction time; Experiment 1, Figure 2) would now be diminished or undetectable.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Experiment 2: task design (A) The task design of Experiment 1 where the CS (tone or light) was the imperative signal.</title><p>(B) Task design of Experiment 2.

The in-person sample size in Experiment 1 was N=16. For the new experiment, we collected data from 64 participants to maximize power. Our experience is that the data from web-based experiments is more variable than in in-person experiments. This may be due to variation in equipment (for web-based experiments, participants use their own laptops), movement effector (wrist or finger movements using a mouse or a trackpad, respectively), and supervision (instructions are provided through on screen messages) (Tsay et al. 2021, <italic>NBDT</italic>).</p><p>The results supported our hypothesis: We did not detect a significant Pavlovian effect in either the acquisition phase or the probe phase. (The results for the new Exp 2 appears in Figure 6 in the revision).</p><p>Please note that during the acquisition phase, one participant exhibited a negative Pavlovian effect with a value far smaller than the other participants (thus the broken y-axis in the right panel of Figure 6C). We opted to include this participant for two reasons. First, the participant’s data was not excluded by our a priori criteria for removing outliers. Second, the participant’s Pavlovian effect during the probe phase fell within the distribution of scores. Nonetheless, we did conduct a post-hoc analysis in which we excluded this participant. In this analysis, the Pavlovian effect was significant during the acquisition phase ([F(1,62)=4.57, p=0.037, BF<sub>10</sub>=1.18, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.06]) but not during the probe phase test ([F(1,62)=2.39, p=0.127, BF<sub>10</sub>=0.42, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.04]). As noted in the manuscript, the probe phase provides the cleanest assessment of the Pavlovian effect. This is underscored by the Bayes Factor (BF<sub>10</sub>) values. While this value is 2.89 in the acquisition phase of Experiment 1, it rises to 72.15 in the probe phase (the same pattern is seen in Experiment 3, described below).</p><p>In summary, the key takeaway we draw from this new experiment is that increasing the CS-US interval diminishes the efficacy of arbitrary cues in context-dependent motor adaptation. This pattern echoes what has been observed with cerebellar-dependent eyeblink conditioning (Schneiderman and Gormezano 1964, Smith et al. 1969).</p><p>We recognize that in this new experiment, participants no longer needed to attend to the tone and light CSs since these no longer served as the movement imperatives; as such, this may have reduced the salience of these cues. To address this concern, we conducted another new experiment, reported as Experiment 3 in the revised manuscript. The experiment was identical to Experiment 2 (including being web-based) with one key change: The imperative and CS were presented simultaneously (Figure 7A in the revision). Thus, while the new imperative cue was still the explicit “go” signal, there was no added delay between the CS and the imperative. We predicted that this should result in a resurrection of the Pavlovian effects. To match the trial durations of Experiments 2 and 3, we increased the interval between the onset of the trial and onset of the imperative/CS.</p><p>When we eliminated the extended delay between the CS and the US, we again observed robust differential conditioning (Pavlovian) effects, replicating the main pattern of behavior observed in Experiment 1 (Figures 7C, 7D in the revision). Thus, the results of Experiment 3 provide an additional demonstration that arbitrary cues can be associated with distinct sensorimotor outcomes. When considered in light of the results of Experiment 2, we see that this associative capability is subject to temporal constraints. The results of Experiment 3 are especially compelling to us given that participants were not explicitly directed to attend to the tone and light CSs since they no longer served as the imperative.</p><p>The results of both new experiments are now included in the revised manuscript (Figures 6 and 7). In the original manuscript, we had assumed that a relatively short interval between the CS and US was required for the Pavlovian effect. These new data put that assumption to test, with the results providing support for that assumption and for our main conclusions concerning the re-framing of sensorimotor adaptation as a form of conditioning. We think that these additional experiments greatly strengthen the paper, and we thank the reviewers for motivating this further work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There are many instances of places in the manuscript that lacked clarity and could benefit from more exposition and inclusion of some of the supplementary analyses.

By itself, the aversive event naturally causes an immediate unconditioned response (UR, e.g., an eye blink in response to the air puff). After just a short training period with a reliable CS, organisms as diverse as turtles and humans produce an adaptive conditioned response (CR, e.g., an eye blink that anticipates the aversive air puff).”</p><p>and Results sections:</p><p>“In typical adaptation tasks, the onset of the target serves as the imperative for movement initiation. When considered through the lens of classical conditioning, the target appearance could be viewed as a conditioned stimulus (CS) given that it is presented just before the sensory feedback (the unconditioned stimulus, US) resulting from the movement (Figure 1B). To test the efficacy of arbitrary cues as conditioned stimuli, the onset of the tone or light served as the imperative, with the target visible at its fixed location throughout the experimental session (Figure 1B)…”</p><p>“… To continue with our conditioning analogy, the conditioned response (CR) would be the movement heading angle elicited by a CS, expressed as a change in heading angle following the pairing of that CS with the visual error, the US (Figure 1B). We note here that the unconditioned response (UR) in an adaptation task could correspond to an immediate movement correction in response to the perturbation; that is, an “online” correction. Given that we required fast movements to minimize these corrections, this potential form of UR is not observed in our design.”</p><p>In addition, we now have a figure devoted to providing a schematic of the task which includes how the task components could be described in a classical conditioning framework (Figure 1).

They provide compelling evidence of associative learning however at present provide no evidence of the importance of this temporal relationship. Considering this is assumed to be the key difference between the current results and previous work who have failed to find an effect, I believe the article requires additional work (maybe by introducing a delay between CS and movement) that examines the importance of this temporal relationship. Providing evidence that the associative learning effect is dependent on the timing between the cue and feedback being between 100-500ms is fundamental to support some conclusions made in the article.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that we assume the associative phenomena we report are subject to strong temporal constraints. Indeed, this assumption is core to our claim about why prior studies generally failed to find adaptation in response to arbitrary sensory cues. As exemplified by eyeblink conditioning, the strength of the association (at least for many skeletal responses) is highly dependent on the CS-US interval (Schneiderman and Gormezano 1964, Smith et al., 1969). In reviewing previous studies that did not find contextual effects of arbitrary cues on motor adaptation, we saw that the interval between cue onset and movement initiation was around 1,000 ms in some studies, or was uncontrolled in others (Howard et al., 2012, Howard et al., 2013). These conditions are suboptimal for cerebellar-dependent conditioning.</p><p>In the experiments presented in the initial submission, we imposed temporal control by having the CSs act as movement imperatives and enforcing rapid (&lt;400ms) reaction times. In this way, we reduced the CS-US interval to around 300 ms.</p><p>As noted by the reviewer, we did not include a negative control, a condition to show that the Pavlovian effects are absent (or attenuated) when these temporal requirements are not met. To address this concern, we have conducted two new experiments. The details are provided above (Essential Revisions). In brief, we no longer had the CS onset serve as the imperative. Rather, we introduced a new imperative by having the target color change. In this way, we separated the CS and the imperative. For the negative control, we extended the interval between the CS and the imperative signal (to ~1,000 ms). With this delay, Pavlovian effects were no longer observed. We also ran an experiment with the new imperative but now with a CS-US interval similar to that used in the original study. Here the Pavlovian effects were again manifest.</p><p>These new experiments are presented as Experiments 2 and 3 in the revised manuscript. We thank the reviewers and editor for pushing us to run this study—the direct test of the timing constraint provides an important addition to the argument that adaptation can be conceptualized as a form of conditioning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Exp 1 probe phase results: Whilst not significant (n-1 x n interaction), there seemed to be a clear difference between CS+ trials within the different trial n-1 contexts (Figure 1D). In fact, this difference seems bigger (and as consistent) as the meaningful/significant differences which are focused on. Interestingly, the RW model predicts a clear n-1 x n interaction however it is not discussed why (Figure 1F). To me it seems that the behaviour (at least partially) and model reflect an interaction between trial n-1 and n during probe trials however this is currently not discussed. Could the authors elaborate on this result and include this in the article?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted by the reviewer, in the probe phase of Experiment 1, the Pavlovian effect (the difference in heading angle between CS+ and CS- trials on trial n) seems to depend on the CS presented on the previous trial.

When looking at the individual data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B</xref>), one can see that they are quite noisy. Importantly, the results from the probe phase of the new Experiment 3 provide a second test since this is essentially a replication of Experiment 1 but with the new imperative.

We address this general issue in the revised Results section:</p><p>“Despite the absence of feedback in the probe phase, the change in heading angle on trial n (CS+ or CS-) should also depend on the CS presented on trial n-1. After an association is formed, the motor state, namely the actual heading angle, fluctuates as a function of the presented CS, decreasing on CS- trials (due to extinction) and increasing on CS+ trials (due to conditioning). As such, the heading angle on a CS+ trial should increase more if it follows a CS- trial than if it follows a CS+ trial. Similarly, the heading angle on a CS- trial should decrease more if it follows a CS+ trial than if it follows a CS- trial. While the data appeared to follow this pattern, there was no main effect of the trial <italic>n-1</italic> CS {-0.44°, [-1.11° 0.24°]; F(1,15)=1.61, p=0.224, BF<sub>10</sub>=0.56, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.10}. This may be because, statistically, the main effect of trial <italic>n</italic>-1 considers consecutive trials with a repeated CS (CS+ that follows CS+, and CS- that follows CS-) where the change in heading angle is minimal. Crucially, the Pavlovian effect (the difference between the change in heading angle on CS+ and CS- trials on trial n) should not depend on the previous trial.

It would also be beneficial to have in the main article a similar figure but with the CS+ and CS- trial types separated.

This needs to be explained/mentioned in the results i.e., that the differences between CS+ vs CS- (1-degree) are approx. 6% of the total adaptation that occurred (15-degrees). I suppose this is referred to within the final exp 1 analysis (Figure 2B) but its not explicit. Although I believe the results are important, the article currently reads as if these conditioning effects were large when in fact other people might conclude that conditioning had little impact on adaptation (as similar adaptation (approx. 15-degrees) was observed across both contexts (assumed as this is not shown) and performance looks very similar to exp 2 where there was no 0-degree context). There needs to be some acknowledgement of the fact that while these conditioning effects appear meaningful, they were small (with most participants showing less than a 1-degree difference between contexts).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s assessment and now include Figure S1 in the main article.</p><p>When looking at the time course of the heading angle data for CS+ and CS- trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>), the difference between conditions is small.

A more valid comparison is to compare the trial-by-trial Pavlovian (trial n) effect to the trial-by-trial Adaptation (trial n-1) effect observed during the acquisition phase. Such a comparison reveals that the Pavlovian effect is quite large. For example, in Experiment 1, the Pavlovian effects in the acquisition (0.82° on average) and probe (1.06°) phases are 55% and 71% of the Adaptation effect (1.50°), respectively. In sum, while we agree that the primary signal that drives the learning curve is the typical previous trial effect, the Pavlovian effect is also profound.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Exp 2 results: It was unclear to me why the RW model would predict a negative heading angle within the single CS conditions (Figure 3C)? I understand that a weaker conditioning response would be expected due to compound conditioning, but would you not expect this still to be positive? Why would the model predict extinction to occur and why is this seen in the behaviour? The details of this result (and the predictions of the model) are currently not discussed in sufficient/any detail.</p></disp-quote><p>The prediction regarding the negative heading angle is important and we see that the original submission lacked clarity on this point. The negative heading angle for the single CS conditions in Experiment 2 (now Experiment 4) is expected due to a combination of two factors: (1) We focus on trial-by-trial <italic>changes</italic> in heading angle, manifest as variation around the mean of the <italic>actual</italic> heading angle, and (2) the heading angle will decrease during the probe phase due to extinction given the absence of feedback.</p><p>To clarify these points, we added the following:</p><p>“We note that the median trial-by-trial change in heading for the tone-alone and light-alone trials is negative. This is because this measure reflects modulations in behavior around the mean heading angle, and this mean decreases over time due to extinction given the absence of the error feedback. This general trend should also vary for the different CSs depending on their relative salience (Equations 3) (Kamin, 1967). Crucially, the additivity principle posits that there should be a negative correlation between the associative strengths of competing CSs (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972). That is, if a strong associative bond is formed between one CS and the US, this will come at the expense of the associative strength accrued by competing CSs (Equation 3) given the capacity limit on associability (<italic>V</italic>). This prediction was strikingly confirmed in an analysis of the heading angle changes on tone-alone and light-alone trials: Participants who were more sensitive to the tone stimulus were less sensitive to the light stimulus, and <italic>vice versa</italic> (Figure 8E, Pearson correlation: r=-0.72, p&lt;0.001, BF<sub>10</sub>=163.2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the CS (confusion between results and discussion)? Between lines 395-410 the authors describe the primary CS as being the heading angle ('the movement plan itself, rather than the target cue, that constitutes the primary CS'), however in the results (lines 74-96) they describe the CS as being the arbitrary cue ('When considered through the lens of classical conditioning, the arbitrary cues are the conditioned stimuli (CSs)') and the CR being the heading angle ('the conditioned response (CR) would be the movement heading angle elicited by a CS'). As a result of this discrepancy, I found this section of the discussion very confusing (lines 387-410 and then again from line 433). Are the authors saying that sometimes the heading angle/plan is the CS and other times it is the CR…? How does this all align? One can see why a suggestion for a figure showing this mechanism visually is suggested below.</p></disp-quote><p>We now see that the original version was confusing on this issue. To form an analogy between sensorimotor adaptation and classical conditioning, we aimed to illustrate that adaptation to sensorimotor perturbations adheres to key rules of associative learning, including associability with arbitrary cues.</p><p>We opted to use tone and light cues as arbitrary contextual CS since they are often used in classical conditioning paradigms as CSs (e.g., in eyeblink conditioning). These cues are not present in standard sensorimotor adaptation tasks, making it important to consider what other CSs might be present in standard tasks (assuming one wants to consider such tasks as subject to the constraints of associative conditioning). This led to the proposal that the CS in standard adaptation tasks is the movement plan (defined by the position of the target). The movement plan shows features of a conditioned stimulus (e.g., associability and generalization). Moreover, the onset of the target is a salient cue that usually serves as an imperative for movement initiation, thus complying with the timing requirements needed to form an association.</p><p>We expected the movement plan would remain a salient CS in our experiments; indeed, we were concerned that it would overwhelm effects from the tone and/or light CSs. For this reason, we chose to use a single target position, have the target remain on the screen throughout the experiment, and make the light and tone be the imperative signals. In this way, we made these CSs more salient while imposing the timing requirements between these cues and the cursor feedback (and test the latter in new Experiments 2 and 3). We now clarify this point in the <italic>Results</italic> section:</p><p>“When considered through the lens of classical conditioning, the target appearance could be viewed as a conditioned stimulus (CS) given that it is presented just before the sensory feedback (the unconditioned stimulus, US) resulting from the movement (Figure 1B). To test the efficacy of arbitrary cues as conditioned stimuli, the onset of the tone or light served as the imperative, with the target visible at its fixed location throughout the experimental session (Figure 1B).“</p><p>And return to this issue in the <italic>Discussion</italic>:</p><p>“These temporal constraints are likely built into standard adaptation tasks: The target is a salient stimulus that defines the task goal and movement plan, and its onset usually serves as the imperative for movement initiation. RTs in these tasks are typically below 500 ms (Kim et al., 2018, 2019; Avraham et al., 2021). As such, a tight temporal link is established between target appearance and movement, echoing (perhaps inadvertently) the CS-US temporal constraints essential for cerebellar-dependent conditioning. Under these conditions, the target can be viewed as a highly effective contextual cue.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Link between this work and recent contextual inference model by Heald et al.,: Could the authors provide a more direct comparison between the current work and the contextual inference model by Heald et al., (in discussion)? The authors currently say 'their model suggests that spontaneous recovery and consistency effects emerge due to contextual inferences that likely interact with deliberate changes in explicit strategies' however does this align with the current work? How does contextual inference align/differ with these conditioning mechanisms? In future work, the authors seem to want to explain the phenomena (spontaneous recovery etc) recently explained by this model and I am interested to know whether these are competing explanations or are explaining the same mechanism or are different but complementary?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion. We certainly have given considerable thought to how the ideas presented in this paper relate to the contextual inference (COIN) model proposed by Heald and colleagues. The two share a core premise, namely that context has a key role in sensorimotor learning. The Rescorla-Wagner model describes, in a simple way, how associations between contextual cues and sensory outcomes allow the expressions of context-dependent motor memories. This idea is central to the COIN model. One difference between the approaches, however, is in how context is inferred. In the COIN model, context is probabilistic, and it is <italic>inferred</italic> by the learner given their experience with sensorimotor feedback and environmental cues. In our application of RW to adaptation, the context is deterministic – it is specified by the sensory cue presented on a given trial.</p><p>While both models offer accounts for how context or environmental cues could separate memories, they likely differ in terms of the neural systems involved and how they account for some ubiquitous phenomena described in the sensorimotor learning literature (e.g., spontaneous recovery, consistency effects, savings). One complication here stems from the fact that sensorimotor learning, including simple adaptation tasks, entails the operation of multiple learning processes. One distinction is between implicit, automatic processes that maintain the calibration of the sensorimotor map and processes that facilitate learning by changing action plans (e.g., re-aiming), including those that may be volitional and under explicit control. For example, while there are studies claiming that consistency effects and savings are due to implicit changes in sensitivity to motor errors (Herzfeld et al., 2014, Coltman et al., 2019, Albert et al., 2021), a growing body of work suggests that these phenomena primarily reflect the use of explicit strategies (Morehead et al., 2015, Haith et al., 2015, Leow et al., 2019, Schween et al., 2019, Avraham et al., 2020, Avraham et al., 2021).</p><p>In our view, the contextual inference process suggested by Heald and colleagues is most likely associated with the explicit operations that lead to modifications in action plans, and their acquisition is perhaps dependent on the medial temporal lobe memory system (Collins and McDougle 2021; McDougle et al., 2022). By contrast, we have used the clamp method in our studies to limit learning to the implicit adaptation system, asking if and under what constraints is this system sensitive to contextual cues. By adopting a conditioning perspective, we find that some of these phenomena emerge from the relatively simple learning rules of the Rescorla-Wagner model.</p><p>While the specific mechanisms underlying consistency effects and savings in motor adaptation are debatable, we note that we are not arguing that the implicit motor system is <italic>not</italic> involved at all in higher-order effects like spontaneous recovery or interference. Indeed, in a recent study we have reported that in a standard savings design of visuomotor adaptation, the implicit system is actually attenuated upon relearning (Avraham et al., 2021, <italic>PloS Biol</italic>). Interestingly, such attenuated relearning has been reported in other conditioning tasks (e.g., fear conditioning, see Bouton 1986). This attenuation appears to be driven by an interference effect that arises from the feedback experienced during the extinction/unlearning phase after the first phase of adaptation. If feedback is removed during this phase, the attenuation effect is eliminated (Avraham and Ivry, <italic>in preparation</italic>). Along the same lines, spontaneous recovery in fear conditioning is also sensitive to the procedure of extinction and to the context in which it is experienced (Bouton 2002).</p><p>We recognize that the Rescorla-Wagner model, at least in its basic form, is unable to capture various higher–order learning effects. Recent advances in the reinforcement learning literature have shown that the combination of a Rescorla-Wagner like model with a Bayesian inference process, provides one solution. Drawing inspiration from this literature, we believe our study offers an exciting step towards the evolution of a similar integrative approach. Nonetheless, we do not directly address things like spontaneous recovery and savings in the current paper, leaving these issues for future studies.</p><p>We have revised the <italic>Discussion</italic> to address these issues.</p><p>“The Rescorla-Wagner model offers an account of how arbitrary sensory cues, visual targets, and movement plans can serve as CSs for adaptation. There are, however, some notable phenomena in the sensorimotor adaptation literature that are not accounted for by our application of the Rescorla-Wagner model, nor by the basic state-space model. Given the prominent role of the state-space model in the sensorimotor adaptation literature, variants of this model were developed to capture these observations. One such effect is spontaneous recovery, the re-manifestation of a previously adapted state in the absence of error feedback. A variant of the state-space model, one that allows for multiple states with different learning and forgetting rates, can capture spontaneous recovery (Smith et al., 2006). A second example is the relationship between learning rate and environmental consistency; learning is faster in response to a consistent versus inconsistent perturbation (Albert et al., 2021; Avraham et al., 2020; Gonzalez Castro et al., 2014; Herzfeld et al., 2014; Hutter and Taylor, 2018). To account for this effect, the state-space model can be modified to allow the learning rate to vary with experience (Herzfeld et al., 2014). A third example is savings upon relearning, where faster adaptation is observed upon a second exposure to the same perturbation (Huang et al., 2011; Krakauer et al., 2005). Studies have modeled savings using multi-rate state-space models (Smith et al., 2006), learning rate modulation (Herzfeld et al., 2014), or a combination of these factors (Zarahn et al., 2008; Mawase et al., 2014).</p><p>These higher-order phenomena have also been addressed in a new model of sensorimotor learning, one that takes a Bayesian inference approach (Heald et al., 2021). The contextual inference (COIN) model posits that motor adaptation arises from two interacting mechanisms: Proper learning, which involves the creation and updating of context-specific memories, and apparent learning, a process of inferring the current context to determine which memory to express (recall). Unlike conventional context-independent models of motor adaptation, the COIN model stresses the importance of the environment in guiding memory retrieval. In one sense, our implementation of the Rescorla-Wagner model follows a similar philosophy. However, it maps to the proper learning component of the COIN model since we assume that the current context is determined by the actual properties of the environment in an all-or-none manner (e.g., the CS presented by the experimenter). The COIN model suggests that spontaneous recovery, consistency effects and savings may emerge due to contextual inferences; these inferences likely involve cognitive systems related to executive function and nonmotor memory systems (Collins and McDougle, 2021). Consistent with this view, growing evidence show that these phenomena are, in large degree, the result of strategic changes (Haith et al., 2015; Morehead et al., 2015; Leow et al., 2020; Avraham et al., 2020, 2021; Wang et al., 2022).</p><p>While the basic Rescorla-Wagner model is unable to account for higher order effects such as spontaneous recovery or savings, we envision that complimenting it with more sophisticated, Bayesian inference models could readily accommodate these phenomena. In fact, models that combine associative mechanisms with some form of a Bayesian inference process that carves the world into distinct contexts have successfully captured a range of complex phenomena in classical conditioning and reinforcement learning (Collins and Frank, 2013; Courville et al., 2006; Gershman, 2015; Kruschke, 2008). We believe that our results lay the foundation for adopting a similar approach to study implicit sensorimotor adaptation and perhaps a more general account that captures the operation and interaction of multiple learning processes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Use of supplementary figures: Why did the authors decide to put so much of the important detail into the supplementary?
