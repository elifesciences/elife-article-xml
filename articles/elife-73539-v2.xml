Transferrin receptor 1 (Tfr1) mediates cellular iron uptake through endocytosis of iron-loaded transferrin, and its expression increases during osteoclast differentiation. Nonetheless, the precise functions of Tfr1 and Tfr1-mediated iron uptake in osteoclast biology and skeletal homeostasis remain incompletely understood. To investigate the role of Tfr1 in osteoclast lineage cells in vivo and in vitro, we crossed <italic>Tfrc</italic> (encoding Tfr1)-floxed mice with <italic>Lyz2 (LysM)-</italic>Cre and <italic>Cathepsin K</italic> (<italic>Ctsk</italic>)-Cre mice to generate <italic>Tfrc</italic> conditional knockout mice in myeloid osteoclast precursors (Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup>) or differentiated osteoclasts (Tfr1<sup>ΔCtsk</sup>), respectively. Skeletal phenotyping by µCT and histology unveiled a significant increase in trabecular bone mass with normal osteoclast number in long bones of 10-week-old young and 6-month-old adult female but not male Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> mice. Although high trabecular bone volume in long bones was observed in both male and female Tfr1<sup>ΔCtsk</sup> mice, this phenotype was more pronounced in female knockout mice. Consistent with this gender-dependent phenomena, estrogen deficiency induced by ovariectomy decreased trabecular bone mass in Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> mice. Mechanistically, disruption of Tfr1 expression attenuated mitochondrial metabolism and cytoskeletal organization in mature osteoclasts in vitro by attenuating mitochondrial respiration and activation of the Src-Rac1-WAVE regulatory complex axis, respectively, leading to decreased bone resorption with little impact on osteoclast differentiation. These results indicate that Tfr1-mediated iron uptake is specifically required for osteoclast function and is indispensable for bone remodeling in a gender-dependent manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group

in adults are maintained by constant bone remodeling with balanced bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zaidi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Siddiqui and Partridge, 2016</xref>). Under pathological conditions, however, excessive bone resorption caused by either increased number or exaggerated activities of osteoclasts leads to bone loss which is a hallmark of many metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Paget’s disease of bone, periodontal disease, and tumor bone metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mbalaviele et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Novack and Teitelbaum, 2008</xref>). Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells formed by fusion of mononuclear precursors that are differentiated from the monocyte/macrophage lineage of hematopoietic cells. This process is triggered by two indispensable cytokines M-CSF (macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walker, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakashima et al., 2012</xref>). Upon attachment to bone, osteoclasts organize their actin cytoskeleton to form actin-rings that seal the resorptive microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Väänänen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teitelbaum, 2011</xref>). The dissolution of bone minerals and digestion of organic bone matrix mainly type I collagen are executed by hydrochloric acid and acidic hydrolase cathepsin K, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujiwara et al., 2016</xref>). Both osteoclast formation and bone-resorbing activity of mature osteoclasts demand high energy. However, the pathways and molecular mechanisms regulating osteoclast energy metabolism in osteoclasts remain largely unknown.</p><p>Both glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) increase during osteoclast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kubatzky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnett and Orriss, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Indo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2020a</xref>). Osteoclasts contain numerous mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ch’uan, 1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holtrop and King, 1977</xref>). The mitochondrial respiratory complex I and the key mitochondria transcriptional regulator PGC-1β (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1β) are crucial for osteoclast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishii et al., 2009</xref>). Mitochondrial ROS (reactive oxygen species) stimulates osteoclast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Srinivasan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2017</xref>).

Despite the previous finding that Tfr2-deletion in monocytes has no effects on iron homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rishi et al., 2016</xref>), the role of Tfr2 in osteoclast iron uptake and function in vitro and in vivo needs to be further investigated in future.

Loss of Tfr1 in osteoclasts led to a &gt;50% decrease in total intracellular iron content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that Tf-dependent iron uptake contributes remarkably to iron acquirement in mature osteoclasts.

Therefore, by transcriptional upregulation of Tf-dependent iron uptake pathway and concomitant downregulation of iron exporter Fpn, osteoclasts augment their cellular iron level to meet high energy demand during osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption.

At 10-week post-pubertal age, however, trabecular BV/TV (&gt;twofold), Tb.N, and Tb.Th were increased while Tb.Sp was deceased in the distal femurs of female Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> mice compared to controls. The increased trabecular bone mass phenotype in female Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> mice was retained at 6 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-E</xref>). There was no difference in any of the above trabecular bone parameters between control and Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> male mice at either 10 weeks or 6 months age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A–4E</xref>). The trabecular bone mass was significantly higher in male control mice after puberty. Since increased trabecular bone volume only occurred in Tfr1-deficient female mice, the trabecular bone mass of Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> female mice at 10 week and 6 month of ages was similar to age-matched control as well as Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> male mice. No changes in the cortical bone thickness (Cort.Th) were detected by µCT in the mid-shaft of femurs of both male and female Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> mice at all three ages compared to their respective controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4F</xref>). The µCT analysis of tibias showed similar trabecular bone mass increase in female but not male Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> mice (data not shown).

Again, the vertebral bone mass of 6-month-old control and Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> male mice was indistinguishable (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the effects of Tfr1-deletion in osteoclast precursor cells on trabecular bone mass in post-pubertal and adult mice are gender- and site-dependent. To determine if loss of Tfr1 in osteoclasts affects ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss, control and Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> female mice at 4.5 months of age were ovariectomized to mimic human post-menopausal osteoporosis and skeletal phenotype was determined at 6 months of age.

Supporting this hypothesis, we found that Tfr1-deficient osteoclasts resorbed less bone than controls as revealed by the resorption-pit staining on cortical bovine bone slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Tfr1 <sup>ΔCtsk</sup> osteoclasts displayed similar in vitro phenotype as Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> osteoclasts (data not shown).</p><p>Besides regulating iron-uptake, Tfr1 also plays non-canonical roles in regulation of intestinal epithelial homeostasis and mitochondrial morphology and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Senyilmaz et al., 2015</xref>). To determine whether the defects in cytoskeleton organization and resorptive function of Tfr1-deficient osteoclasts were caused by low intracellular iron content, we treated control and Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> osteoclast cultures with increased doses of hemin (ferric chloride heme) and ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), which are transported into cells via heme transporters Hcp1 (encoded by <italic>Slc46a1</italic>) and NTBI transporter Zip14 (encoded by <italic>Slc39a14</italic>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). While 10 µM of hemin slightly stimulated osteoclast spreading, cytoskeleton organization, and bone resorption in control osteoclasts, hemin dose-dependently increased the number of spreading osteoclasts in Tfr1-deficient osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, FAC had no effects on control or Tfr1-deficient osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). At 10 µM concentration, hemin significantly rescued the cytoskeleton organization and bone resorption defects of Tfr1-depleted osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-E</xref>). These results also suggest that heme-uptake, but not NTBI and ferritin pathways, is an alternative iron acquiring route in osteoclasts in the absence of Tfr1. Therefore, both our in vivo and in vitro findings unveil a critical role of Tfr1-mediated cellular iron homeostasis in osteoclast activation/function. It should be noted that even high concentration (10 μM) of hemin can only partially rescue the defects in osteoclast spreading and cytoskeleton organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, C and D</xref>), indicating that osteoclasts have limited alternative iron acquisition pathways in the absence of Tfr1 as in other cells.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>High dose of hemin but not ferric ammonium citrate rescues the phenotypes of Tfr1-deficient osteoclasts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>) TRAP staining and quantification of the number of spreading osteoclasts in control (con) and Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> osteoclast cultures. n=6. scale bar = 10 μm.

As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, the basal mitochondrial respiration is the direct measure of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) attributed to the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). The maximum respiration is induced by incubating cells with the uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP). The ATP-linked respiration is measured by exposing cells to oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATP synthase complex V. The non-mitochondrial respiration, which is the remaining OCR when the ETC activity is completely abolished by a mixture of rotenone/antimycin A. This parameter reflects the portion of cellular respiration by oxygen-consuming enzymes such as NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidases, heme oxygenases, and/or lipoxygenases. The residual OCR after inhibition by oligomycin is the measure of the protons pumped through ETC, which consumes oxygen without generating any ATP (due to inhibited ATP synthase activity by the drug) and is referred to the H<sup>+</sup> leak.

On the other hand, our in vitro supplemental experiment has demonstrated that 17-β estradiol inhibits the mRNA expression of <italic>Tfrc</italic> in mature osteoclasts and synergistically with Tfr1-deficiency attenuates the mRNA expression of <italic>mt-Co1</italic> (encoding the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, mt-Co1), whereas dihydrotestosterone has no effects on Tfr1, Fpn, and mt-Co1 expression in osteoclast lineage cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>). This finding is consistent with our recent published work that estrogen attenuates mitochondrial OXPHOS and ATP production in osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). The tissue- and bone cell type-specific sex differences in mitochondria and the underlying mechanisms in skeletons in both mice and humans need further investigation as recently reported in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chella Krishnan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>It is well established that estrogen-mediated mechanisms play a key role in mediating bone accretion during pubertal growth period. During this developmental period, estrogen is known to exert an anabolic effect on osteoblast besides its well-established role in inhibiting osteoclast functions. However, the loss of estrogen as seen during menopause or due to ovariectomy in adults leads to bone loss primarily due to increased bone resorption. The increased trabecular bone volume of Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> mice is evident at the post-pubertal age of 10 weeks but is not different at the pre-pubertal age of 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), thus suggesting that the skeletal phenotype gets manifested during pubertal and post-pubertal growth periods. While loss of Tfr1 does not affect estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss, the trabecular bone mass of Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> mice is persistently higher than control mice after OVX. The issue of whether the skeletal phenotype in 10-week-old Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> mice is dependent on pubertal increase in estrogen remains to be evaluated by performing OVX at pre-pubertal age of 3 weeks in future.</p><p>Both <italic>Lyz2</italic>-Cre and <italic>Ctsk</italic>-Cre mice are commonly used to conditionally delete the floxed genes at different stages of osteoclast lineage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dallas et al., 2018</xref>). While the <italic>Lyz2</italic>-Cre deletes genes in monocytes of osteoclast precursor cells, it also targets other myeloid cells such as neutrophils and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abram et al., 2014</xref>). Although Nfatc1-deletion by <italic>Mx1</italic>-Cre attenuates osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in mice, Nfatc1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> mice displayed no osteoclast and bone phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aliprantis et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that the deletion efficiency of <italic>Lyz2</italic>-Cre is weaker than <italic>Mx1</italic>-Cre and is allele-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dallas et al., 2018</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clausen et al., 1999</xref>). The <italic>Ctsk</italic>-Cre, especially the <italic>Ctsk</italic>-Cre knock-in line, has been reported to delete genes at the late stages of differentiated osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nakamura et al., 2007</xref>). It should be noticed that the <italic>Ctsk</italic>-Cre has been reported to cause gene-disruption in mesenchymal progenitor cells including periosteal cells and osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruiz et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the differences of skeletal phenotypes between Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> and Tfr1<sup>ΔCtsk</sup> mice might be caused by the in vivo efficacy and the specificity of targeting cells of these two Cre mouse lines.</p><p>The high bone mass observed in Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> and Tfr1<sup>ΔCtsk</sup> mice is more dramatic in the appendicular skeleton (femurs and tibias) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>) than the axial skeleton (vertebras) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">7</xref>). The trabecular bone is more vulnerable to Tfr1-deficiency than the cortical bone. The exact explanation(s) for distinct effects of Tfr1-deficiency on different sites and compartments of bone are not available. Our qPCR result demonstrated that deletion efficiency of Tfr1 gene, <italic>Tfrc</italic>, in vertebra is less than femurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>). It is also likely that the different physical properties, remodeling rate, microenvironment, and the heterogeneous osteoclast subtypes in the distinct sites and compartments of bone may contribute to these site- and compartment-specific phenotypes which have been reported in other genetically modified mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cruz Grecco Teixeira et al., 2016</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sato et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have demonstrated that energy metabolism regulated by Tf11-mediated iron uptake is specifically indispensable for osteoclast activation and function but has little influence on osteoclast differentiation. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishii et al., 2009</xref> have reported that in vitro knockdown of Tfr1 expression in BMM by short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibits osteoclast differentiation. This discrepant finding might be caused by the off-target effects of Tfr1 shRNA on expression of genes essential for osteoclast differentiation or by the distinct effects of short-term Tfr1 downregulation by shRNA vs long-term genetic deletion of Tfr1 on osteoclast lineage cells. In support of our finding, it has been recently reported that deletion of mitochondria coactivator PGC-1β in myeloid osteoclast precursor cells by <italic>Lyz2</italic>-Cre diminishes mitochondrial biogenesis and function in osteoclasts, leading to cytoskeletal disorganization and bone resorption retardation with normal osteoclasts differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, the PGC-1β-stimulated osteoclast cytoskeleton activation is identified to be mediated by GIT1 (G protein coupled receptor kinase 2 interacting protein 1) which has been reported to regulates osteoclast function and bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Menon et al., 2010</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jones and Katan, 2007</xref>). Another report by Nakano et al. has shown that deletion of G-protein Gα<sub>13</sub> in myeloid cells augments mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism in osteoclasts. The gain-of-function of mitochondrial pathway induced by Gα<sub>13</sub>-deletion in osteoclasts promotes actin cytoskeleton dynamic and bone resorption via activation of cytoskeleton regulators c-Src, Pyk2, and RhoA-Rock2. Again, Gα<sub>13</sub>-deletion in osteoclast lineage cells has minimum effects on osteoclastogenesis in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nakano et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, we have unveiled that Tfr1-mediated iron uptake regulates osteoclast cytoskeleton probably via a distinct mechanism. The level of GIT1, Rac1, Cdc42, and Rock2 remains unchanged in Tfr1-null osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). However, the activation of c-Src-Rac1-WRC axis by M-CSF is attenuated and mostly downregulated in the absence of Tfr1, indicating that Tfr1 modulates osteoclast cytoskeleton through promoting the stability of WRC complex. In supporting of this premise, overexpression of Hem1 (also known as Nckap1l) partially rescues the cytoskeletal defects in Tfr1-deficient osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have provided evidence demonstrating that Tfr1-mediated iron uptake is a major iron acquisition pathway in osteoclast lineage cells that differentially regulates trabecular bone remodeling in perpendicular and axial bones of female and male mice. The increased intracellular iron facilitated by Tfr1 is specifically required for osteoclast mitochondrial energy metabolism and cytoskeletal organization.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

After washing with PBS for three times, the bones were stored in PBS with 0.02% sodium azide. The bones were loaded into a 12.3 mm diameter scanning tube and were imaged in a μCT (model μCT40, Scanco Medical). We integrated the scans into 3-D voxel images (1024×1024 pixel matrices for each individual planar stack) and used a Gaussian filter (sigma = 0.8 and support = 1) to reduce signal noise. A threshold of 200 was applied to all scans, at medium resolution (E = 55 kVp, I = 145 μA, and integration time = 200 ms).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Histology and bone histomorphometry</title><p>The left femurs were embedded undecalcified in methyl methacrylate.

A total of 100 µg of proteins in each cell lysate was reduced, alkylated, and digested using filter-aided sample preparation. Tryptic peptides were cleaned by solid phase extraction (SPE), normalized and labeled using a TMTsixplex isobaric Mass Tagging kit. The labeled peptides were cleaned by SPE and mixed. The mixed peptides from each cell culture were separated into 36 fractions on a 100 × 1.0 mm Acquity BEH C18 column (Waters) using an UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) with a 40 min gradient from 99:1 to 60:40 buffer A:B (Buffer A contains 0.5% acetonitrile and 10 mM ammonium hydroxide). Buffer B contains 10 mM ammonium hydroxide in acetonitrile ratio under basic (pH 10) conditions and then consolidated into 13 super-fractions.</p><p>Each super-fraction was then further separated by reverse phase XSelect CSH C18 2.5 mm resin (Waters) on an in-line 150 × 0.075 mm column using an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo). Peptides were eluted using a 60 min gradient from 97:3 to 60:40 buffer A:B ratio. Here, buffer A contains 0.1% formic acid and 0.5% acetonitrile, and buffer B contains 0.1% formic acid and 99.9% acetonitrile. Eluted peptides were ionized by electrospray (2.15 kV) followed by mass spectrometric analysis on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo) using multi-notch MS3 parameters. The mass spectrometry data were acquired using the FTMS (fourier transform mass spectrometer) analyzer in top-speed profile mode at a resolution of 120,000 over a range of 375–1500 m/z. Following CID activation with normalized collision energy of 35.0, MS/MS data were acquired using the ion trap analyzer in centroid mode and normal mass range. Using synchronous precursor selection, up to 10 MS/MS precursors were selected for HCD activation with normalized collision energy of 65.0, followed by acquisition of MS3 reporter ion data using the FTMS analyzer in profile mode at a resolution of 50,000 over a range of 100–500 m/z.</p><p>Proteins were identified and reporter ions quantified by searching the UniprotKB Mouse database using MaxQuant (version 1.6.10.43, Max Planck Institute) with a parent ion tolerance of 3 ppm, a fragment ion tolerance of 0.5 Da, a reporter ion tolerance of 0.001 Da, trypsin/P enzyme with two missed cleavages, variable modifications including oxidation on M and acetyl on protein N-term, and fixed modification of carbamidomethyl on C. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established with less than 1.0% false discovery. Proteins identified only by modified peptides were removed.

On the day of respiratory function measurements, the media in the wells were changed to unbuffered Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 4 mM glutamate and incubated in a non-CO2 incubator for 1 hr at 37°C. Three baseline measurements were acquired before injection of mitochondrial inhibitors or uncouplers. OCR measurements were taken after sequential addition of oligomycin (10 µM), FCCP (5 µM), and rotenone/antimycin A mixture (10 µM).

The in vivo biological replicates are defined as an individual mouse for each experiment. All in vitro data were representatives of individual biological replicates from independent experiments and not technical replicates (repeated measurements of the same sample). For all graphs, data are represented as the mean ± SD. For comparison of two groups, data were analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test. For comparison of more than two groups, data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, and the Bonferroni procedure was used for Tukey comparison. For all statistical tests, the analysis was performed using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA), and a p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Study approval</title><p>All animal protocols and procedures used in animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Long Beach VA Healthcare System, and Loma Linda VA Healthcare System (IACUC #1,685 and #1774).

mechanism of iron-mediated effects on bone, and presents findings of novel significance that are of interest to basic iron biologists, bone biologists, experts in mitochondrial respiration, and endocrinologists. The authors specifically focus on the role of iron deficiency via TFR1 loss in osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast function, demonstrating that cell-selective loss of TFR1 in mature osteoclasts (using Ctsk-Cre mice) leads to decreased osteoclast function and increased bone volume in long bones, especially in female mice, without influencing osteoclastogenesis. In vitro studies confirm an actin cytoskeletal defect and defect in bone resorption in TFR1 null osteoclasts, both partially rescued by heme but not NTBI. Together, these findings contribute to the knowledge in the field, supporting a hypothesis that iron delivered via TF-TFR1 (or heme iron) is essential for osteoclast function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73539.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Ginzburg</surname><given-names>Yelena</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04a9tmd77</institution-id><institution>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Pavlos</surname><given-names>Nathan J</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/047272k79</institution-id><institution>University of Western Australia</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.09.12.459964">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.12.459964v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nathan J Pavlos (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found significant merit in the work. However, the evaluation identified sufficient weaknesses that prevent publication of this work in the present form. The main shortcomings of the presented work include the relatively underdeveloped in vitro data which does not convincingly support the conclusions; the concern that the mouse models result in decreased Ctsk expression which may along at least in part explain the phenotype; the potential of evaluation in an ovarectomized mice and / or mice at different ages to extend the translational potential and underlying mechanism of these findings, respectively; and some degree of evaluation of systemic iron metabolism and erythropoiesis. Specifically, the in vitro data can be extended to more fully explore osteoclastogenesis and in vivo data by experimentally addressing the observed gender disparity and specificity of effect in the trabecular region of long bones.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Some additional questions and clarifications are delineated below.</p><p>1. It is unclear why only or mostly female osteoclast-selective TFR1-null mice exhibit a more robust phenotype, with increased bone mass in long bones. The authors discuss this point in the Discussion section but the proposed experiment, to evaluate whether hepcidin expression is altered in the liver or hepcidin concentration changes in the serum and IHC using anti-FPN1 antibody in osteoclasts or at least cellular iron concentration would be useful to corroborate the hypothesis of estrogen-mediated changes in the hepcidin:ferroportin axis. Do osteoclasts even express FPN1 to make such a hypothesis viable? There is some data on testosterone and hepcidin regulation (Latour Hepatology 2014) that may be worth mentioning or discussing in the setting of the authors hypothesis about differential gender-related results. Finally, are the differences between male and female mice significant in Figure 2? Are these differences in the expected range for male and female mice?</p><p>2. It is similarly unclear why only long bones but not vertebrae reveal these differences. Can the authors speculate and discuss this point in the Discussion section?</p><p>3. The authors suggest that they have effectively excluded an effect from TFR2 on osteoclast function. However, this is inaccurate and needs to be communicated differently. At best, the authors have confirmed what has long been understood that TFR2 serves as an iron sensor rather than importer of iron. This should be restated in all mention of TFR2 in the manuscript. Furthermore, Rauner et al. published an important manuscript looking at the role of TFR2 in bone, demonstrating that TFR2 competes with BMPR for binding BMP2 and TFR2:BMP binding is enhanced in the presence of Fe-TF, together suggesting that presence of iron may favor bone resorption in the presence of TFR2. Something akin to this would benefit the readership and should be included in the manuscript as it pertains to the data on TFR1 here.</p><p>4. Figure 1, Y axis on mRNA expression panels is unclear what the control is. Typically, expectation is of change from baseline (1) in control. Minor: panel for Flvcr2 is missing from legend.</p><p>5. Figure 1 B, what mechanism leads to some cellular iron in TFR1 fl/LysM Cre OC cells? This may be the reason that the results on differentiation are not seen in the current work relative to Ishii et al. 2009. Please explain and include in the Discussion.</p><p>6. Figure 3 A-E is redundant and can be moved to the Supplement. In general, the data on LysM-cre mice is distracting and does not provide substantive contributing information to the main point. Consider moving all LysM-cre data to the supplement to better focus the manuscript.</p><p>7. Figure 3G, the difference in female mice is driven by 3 mice with elevated values; are these 3 mice in any way different from the others? Are they outliers?</p><p>8. Figure 3 states that there is no impact on osteoclast number and bone resorption in mice but while BFR is unchanged in Figure 3J, serum P1NP is increased. How do the authors reconcile this confusing result?</p><p>9. Given the number of figures, it would be worthwhile to consolidate and reorganize to move some additional elements into the supplementary figures. For example, there is no reason in the mind of the reviewer to include both male and female samples in vitro. Especially since there are no visible differences, please move one gender to the supplement.</p><p>10. Figure 6 title suggests that there are no differences in markers of differentiation, e.g. Nfatc1 and Ctsk, but both of these appear to be decreased in f/f;c/c samples, both female but especially male (especially since tubulin appears greater in those samples). Please provide the quantification here.</p><p>11. Figue 12B and 12C do not include control cells with and without Hem1 overexpression. This is important since the mechanism may be completely different and yet additive to yield the observed results. Please edit.</p><p>12. The Introduction is too long and unfocused. Please edit.</p><p>13. The first half of the Discussion is a restating of the results and needs to be re-written to further extend the interpretation of the results without restating them.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a well-written study that examines the role of transferrin receptor 1 in osteoclast function and bone remodelling. The importance of iron homeostasis in bone turnover has gained momentum in recent years, most notably the role of transferrin receptor 2 in osteoblasts (Rauner et al., Nat Med 2019), however the physiological significance of iron and the mechanism(s) responsible for its uptake in osteoclasts remains poorly understood. As such, the present study detailing the physiological role of Tfr1 in osteoclasts would likely be of considerable interest to the field, complementing existing studies in osteoblasts, but also reconciling the physiological contribution of cellular iron handling on the other side of the bone remodelling equation. The strengths of this study lie the multiple osteoclast-specific mouse lines generated to interrogate the role of Tfr1 in both osteoclast-lineage cells and mature osteoclasts along with the suite of complementary cell biological, biochemical and proteomic analyses used to dissect its contribution in osteoclasts. Nonetheless, there remain some weaknesses, particularly concerning the expressivity of the bone phenotype and mechanistic link between Tfr1 and the cytoskeleton that should be considered to strengthen the overall resolve of the conclusions drawn.</p><p>I have the following comments:</p><p>1. The studies conducted on LysoM-Cre mice appear to be well-executed and carefully controlled. The skeletal phenotype is however complex, being restricted to trabeculae of the long bones of female mice, but not the axial skeleton (e.g. vertebrae) at 10-weeks of age. The authors rationalise that the unexpected sexual dimorphism is associated with an intersection between estrogen and iron export, which is reasonable, but they do not offer experimental evidence to support this. Further, the skeletal phenotyping is limited to a single time-point i.e. 10-weeks of age. As such, it would be beneficial if the authors could provide data in older animals to show whether the bone phenotype becomes more pronounced or resolves with age. It would also be useful for the reader if the authors could offer some explanation for the observed site-specific differences in the Discussion e.g. potential differences in osteoclast heterogeneity etc.</p><p>2. Although widely employed as a Cre-transgenic mouse line to conditionally delete target genes in mature osteoclasts there are some caveats that should be considered to avoid over-interpretation of data arising from the cathespin K (Ctsk)-Cre lines. Foremost, this cre-line is known to result in the loss one allele of Ctsk owing to partial replacement the Ctsk locus with Cre in the targeting cassette (Dallas et a., Genetics 2018). Thus, endogenous Ctsk expression is reduced. Considering that deficiency and mutations in Ctsk lead to high bone mass phenotype (Saftig et al., 1997) together with findings that Cstk K-Cre can also lead to unexpected germline deletion of genes (e.g. Winkeler et al., PLos 2012), any data arising from these mice need to be interpreted with a degree of caution. The authors have rightly attempted to control for this using littermates mice on heterozygous KI (Ctsk-Cre/+), which is appropriate although these mice are on a mice mixed background C57BL6/129 which can complicate skeletal phenotypes. Overall, these underlying complexities may account, in part, for the discrepancies observed between the LysoM and Ctsk-cre males and females, with Ctsk-Cre leading to a more pronounced phenotype. As a minimum, these limitations need to be acknowledged and discussed. A minor oversight- for Figure 4B is that the mice sexes are unlabelled in the reconstructed uCT scans.</p><p>3. The in vitro data concerning the potential effects of Tfr1-deficiency on osteoclast different and mitochondrial metabolism are extensive and overall support the conclusion drawn. On the other hand the mechanism linking Tfr1 regulation of the osteoclast cytoskeleton remains largely descriptive and thus is comparatively underdeveloped. While the quantitative proteomics data goes some way to lend support to the notion that loss of Tfr1 leads to a global dysregulation of downstream Tfr1-associated protein pathways including those involved with cytoskeletal signalling/organization, the extent and diversity of proteins affected in osteoclasts &gt;2000 proteins is remarkable. Can the authors please clarify how they arrived at the 1.2-fold threshold for these data. Does the 1.2-fold represent an arbitrary cut-off or does it reflect &gt;1.2 Log2Fold, p&lt;0.05? To validate these proteomic data the authors hone in on hem1 (a component of the Wave regulatory complex, WRC) and show that it partly restores the cytoskeletal spreading defect in Tfr1-deficient osteoclasts. This finding is interesting but would be bolstered by confirmation of a disruption of additional components of the WRC or downstream components such as Arf2/3 which has an established role in OC cytoskeletal organization in osteoclasts (Hurst et al., JBMR 2009). Considering the well-established roles of B3-integrin, c-SRC and Pyk2 in osteoclasts, it would be valuable to corroborate/or discount their direct involvement in these spreading and cytoskeletal defects by independently assessing their expression levels immunoanalytically in Tfr1-deficient osteoclasts.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors state that Tfr1 does not inhibit osteoclast differentiation, but just spreading and resorption. I do not agree with this statement. By &quot;spreading&quot;, do the authors mean &quot;fusion&quot;? I believe in any case that this is part of the differentiation process to a fully mature osteoclast. Also, even though it is stated that osteoclasts have been counted as TRAP-positive and with more than 3 nuclei, I know from experience that it is tricky to identify the nuclei just using TRAP staining, especially in such small cells as presented in Suppl. Figure 9A. I believe it may be more accurate to assess the number of osteoclasts in this case with so many small ones using IF and DAPI staining for the nuclei. Using that, the authors could also count how many osteoclasts have e.g. 3-10 or 10-50 nuclei (giving insights into the fusion process). Finally, I believe more markers for osteoclasts could be used to address this point of fusion/spreading, such as DC-STAMP, SWAP70, or CTSK. In Suppl. Figure 9, e.g., it looks like CtsK expression is reduced in the Tfr1;Lysm-cre mice, although the WB is a bit over-exposed, so it is hard to tell… quantification would be helpful.</p><p>2. It appears that the appendicular skeleton is more affected than the axial skeleton. Did the authors check the expression of Tfr1 in e.g. femoral vs. vertebral bone using immunohistochemistry? Is there a difference in expression pattern that may explain the altered susceptibility of the sites to Tfr1 deletion? Similarly, it would be interesting to check Tfr1 in trabecular vs. cortical bone – as those also seem to be differentially affected.</p><p>3. Along those lines, is the expression of Tfr1 in osteoclasts (bone) lower in young animals compared to adult ones? Could that explain the more severe effects of iron deficiency in adult mice compared to the 3-week-old ones?</p><p>4. The increase in BV/TV in female 10-week-old mice is quite strong (especially in the Ctsk-cre mice). Did the authors detect extramedullary hematopoiesis? Are those mice iron deficient also in the liver? How is their systemic iron levels?</p><p>5. The lack of osteoclast function during Tfr1-deficiency would be beneficial in a more clinical context in e.g. ameliorating bone loss via ovariectomy. I think performing such an experiment (with the Tfr1;Ctsk-cre mice) would add more clinical benefit to the paper.</p><p>6. How do the authors explain that Tfr1 deficiency in osteoclast precursors has less effects than using the Ctsk-cre mice? I would assume that using the Lysm-cre, all osteoclasts – also the later stages – are affected, whereas in the Ctsk-cre, only the mature ones are. Thus, I am not sure why the Lysm-cre don´t also show a stronger effect.</p><p>7. Figure 4: to me, it actually looks like there are fewer osteoclasts in the cKO mice… the number of mice is not that high for histology, which tends to have high standard deviations. Did the authors also check the BFR in those mice? Was it also a bit increased, like in the Lysm-cre mice?</p><p>8. A WB should be shown validating the reduction of OXPHOS complex I-V expression. Similarly, it would be good to show a verification of other key proteins involved in cytoskeletal reorganization that were identified in the proteomic studies.</p><p>9. It is not clear to me how Mitotracker/Mitosox MFI and mitochondrial membrane potential were quantified? Why are there so many dots? How many cells and/or mitochondria were quantified? Was the MFI of each individual cell measured? Please add more details.</p><p>10. The link between Tfr1 and cytoskeleton organization is not quite clear. Is that connection e.g. iron-dependent and/or dependent on non-canonical functions of Tfr1? If iron-dependent, how does iron affect the regulation of WRC/Arp2/3 complex?</p><p>11. I personally think that Suppl. Figure 1 should be included into the main figures as it shows the first mechanistic part. I would rather suggest to potentially combine Figure 1+3 and/or 2+4 (or put parts of them into the supplement).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Transferrin receptor 1-mediated iron uptake regulates bone mass in mice via osteoclast mitochondria and cytoskeleton&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Mone Zaidi (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>While the authors have added a substantive amount of work to significantly improve this manuscript, there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, still a few places that need further explanation, a few pieces of data that do not evidently communicate what the authors claim:</p><p>1) While Ctsk mRNA expression is increased in Tfr1f/f Cre+ mice, protein concentration is decreased. This is unclear and presumptively, the focus is on the protein concentration. It is unclear what this means in total but the authors state that this indicates that Tfr1 deletion in osteoclasts has minimum effect on osteoclast differentiation. This needs to be clarified further in the results and Discussion sections.</p><p>2) Tfr1 loss appears to increase the number of osteoclasts with fewer nuclei and decreased fusion. The authors state that this impacts osteoclast function (decreased) rather than number or differentiation. This is fine as they show good evidence of decreased osteoclast functional endpoints. However, later in the manuscript, osteoblast data is also alluded to but not presented, noting only increased serum P1NP and Runx2 expression (Figure 3 – suppl Figure 2) and a comment suggesting that the phenotype in Tfr1f/f;Lyz2-Cre mice therefore maybe the consequence of altered osteoblast function. The response to Reviewer 1, point #8 is thus confusing and requires further clarification. Perhaps the authors are stating that the altered osteoclast function leads to an altered ability of the osteoclasts to suppress osteoblasts? This should be made clear in the discussion at least as speculation if the data cannot be shown fully. Response to Reviewer 2 point #4 is confusing with circular logic along the same lines.</p><p>3) Figure 6D needs a quantification. The authors state that Tfr1 loss results in decreased energy metabolism but there is no obvious evidence of this in osteoclasts in this figure (maybe BMM are bit more decreased in Tfr1-/- cells). Therefore, it is erroneous to state that is is restored by hemin as there is no evidence of a defect or visually appreciable differences relative to control in any of the wells. Please clarify.</p><p>4) While OVX Tfr1f/f;LysMCre mice exhibit a persistent difference from OVX control, the authors state that the phenotype observed in non-OVX mice is estrogen dependent (page 9, line 227). This is conceptually inaccurate in my understanding as if it were estrogen dependent, the difference would be abrogated after OVX which it is not. It in fact supports the opposite conclusion, that the phenotype is NOT estrogen dependent. Please clarify in discussion.</p><p>5) Figure 9C and 9D demonstrate the effect of Hem1 overexpression. The authors note &quot;rescue&quot; but this is only partial and a more appropriate conclusion would be that other mechanisms of iron delivery can reverse, at least partially, the effect of iron restriction induced by Tfr1 loss.</p><p>6) Unclear if there is a difference between 10uM hemin in control vs. Tfr1-/- cells in Figure 5A, 5C, and 5D. A preserved difference would suggest that there is incomplete rescue even at the highest hemin dose because osteoclasts may not have every option for iron import available in other cells. This is important to expand in the Discussion section.</p><p>7) Figure 9B requires quantification to corroborate the assertions made by the authors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73539.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found significant merit in the work.

We repeated western blotting for Nfatc1 and Cathepsin K and quantified the specific bands of these osteoclast markers by densitometry using NIH Image J software. As demonstrated in the right panels of Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, deletion of Tfr1 had no effects on the protein level of Nfatc1 in osteoclast precursor and mature cells, whereas the level of Cathepsin K in Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> pre- and mature-osteoclasts was slightly decreased compared to control and Tfr1-f/f;c/+ osteoclasts.</p><p>iii. We counted the number of osteoclasts with 3-10, 10-30, and &gt;30 nuclei, respectively. As shown in Figure 4D, the number of osteoclasts with 3-10 nuclei in Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> culture was higher than control and there was no difference in the number of osteoclasts with 10-30 nuclei between control and Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> cultures. Only the number of osteoclasts with &gt; 30 nuclei in Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> culture was lower than control although the mRNA expression of osteoclast fusion gene <italic>Dcstamp</italic> was similar in control and Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> osteoclasts. The exact mechanism(s) of decreased fusion in the late stage of osteoclastogenesis in <italic>Tfr1</italic><sup>ΔlysM</sup> culture need further investigation in future.</p><p>iv. To consolidate the finding from quantitative proteomic results that cellular iron regulates the components of mitochondrial respiration chain, we did immuno-blotting to detect the changes of mitochondrial respiratory complexes in control and Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> monocytes and mature osteoclasts treated with either vehicle or 10μM hemin using a cocktail of antibodies recognizing the representative components of mitochondrial respiratory complex I-V. As shown in Figure 6D, there was an obvious decrease in the mitochondrial complex II and III in Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> monocytes and hemin stimulated the mitochondrial complex I and II in control and Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> osteoclasts, indicating that Tfr1-mediated iron uptake plays an important role in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway.</p><p>v. To identify the mechanisms by which Tfr1 regulates osteoclast WRC complex and cytoskeleton, we examined the activation (phosphorylation) of protein tyrosine kinase c-Src which plays a pivotal role in osteoclast cytoskeleton organization downstream of integrin and M-CSF as well as RANKL signaling pathways in control and Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> osteoclasts. We also assayed the activation of small GTPases Rac1 and Arf1 that are upstream stimulators of WAVE-regulating complex (WRC) in responses to M-CSF and RANKL in control and Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> osteoclasts using GST-pulldown kits from Thermo-Fisher Scientific Inc. As shown in Figure 9B, we found that the phosphorylation of c-Src and the GTP-bound (active form) of Rac1, but not GTP-bound Arf1, stimulated by M-CSF were declined in Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> osteoclasts. In contrast, Tfr1-deficiency had little effects on RANKL-activated c-Src, Rac1, and Arf1 in osteoclasts.</p><p>vi. We repeated the Hem1 overexpression experiment with proper controls suggested by the reviewers. As demonstrated in Figure 9C and 9D, overexpression of HA-tagged Hem1 enhanced the number of activated osteoclasts in control culture and rescued the cytoskeletal defect in Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> osteoclasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The concern that the mouse models result in decreased Ctsk expression which may along at least in part explain the phenotype;</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 4B and 4C, although the mRNA expression of <italic>Ctsk</italic> in Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> pre-osteoclasts and mature osteoclasts detected by qPCR was slightly higher than that in control cells, the quantification of western blots demonstrated that the levels of Ctsk protein in Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> pre- and mature-osteoclasts were slightly decreased compared to control cells. This decreased Ctsk expression might contribute attenuated bone resorption in Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> osteoclasts. It should be pointed out that Ctsk heterozygous mice had no defects in osteoclast function (Gowen, et al., JBMR 1999). The phenotypes of osteoclasts in vitro and skeletal homeostasis in Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> mice are mainly resulted from the decreased energy metabolism and defect in cytoskeleton organization in Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> osteoclasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The potential of evaluation in an ovarectomized mice and / or mice at different ages to extend the translational potential and underlying mechanism of these findings, respectively.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to 10 weeks old post-pubertal mice, we have examined the skeletal phenotypes of 3-weeks-old pre-pubertal and 6 months old sham and ovariectomized control and Tfr1-flox;LysM-Cre mice by μCT.

It is unclear why only or mostly female osteoclast-selective TFR1-null mice exhibit a more robust phenotype, with increased bone mass in long bones. The authors discuss this point in the Discussion section but the proposed experiment, to evaluate whether hepcidin expression is altered in the liver or hepcidin concentration changes in the serum and IHC using anti-FPN1 antibody in osteoclasts or at least cellular iron concentration would be useful to corroborate the hypothesis of estrogen-mediated changes in the hepcidin:ferroportin axis. Do osteoclasts even express FPN1 to make such a hypothesis viable? There is some data on testosterone and hepcidin regulation (Latour Hepatology 2014) that may be worth mentioning or discussing in the setting of the authors hypothesis about differential gender-related results. Finally, are the differences between male and female mice significant in Figure 2? Are these differences in the expected range for male and female mice?</p></disp-quote><p>The serum levels of iron and hepcidin in 10-week-old male and female control and <italic>Tfrc</italic>-flox; <italic>Lyz2</italic>-Cre mice are similar (see Figure 2—figure supplement 3). It is well known that the trabecular bone mass of male mice is higher than their age-matched female mice in the adults. Since Tfr1-deficiency results in significant increase in trabecular bone mass solely in female but not male mice, there is no difference of bone mass between female <italic>Tfrc</italic>-flox;<italic>Lyz2</italic>-Cre mice and male <italic>Tfrc</italic>-flox;<italic>Lyz2</italic>-Cre as well as male control mice. This phenomenon has been added on page 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is similarly unclear why only long bones but not vertebrae reveal these differences. Can the authors speculate and discuss this point in the Discussion section?</p></disp-quote><p>Mouse genetic studies have clearly established that the genetic regulation of peak bone mass development is skeletal site dependent. Thus, it is not surprising that Tfr1 deficiency exerts different effects on the skeletal phenotype of long bones versus vertebra. These differences are discussed in the context of what is known in the literature on osteoclast heterogeneity and genetic regulation of bone development at these two sites on pages 22-23. Our qPCR result demonstrated that deletion efficiency of Tfr1 gene, <italic>Tfrc</italic>, in vertebra is less potent than femurs (Figure 2—figure supplement 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors suggest that they have effectively excluded an effect from TFR2 on osteoclast function. However, this is inaccurate and needs to be communicated differently. At best, the authors have confirmed what has long been understood that TFR2 serves as an iron sensor rather than importer of iron. This should be restated in all mention of TFR2 in the manuscript. Furthermore, Rauner et al. published an important manuscript looking at the role of TFR2 in bone, demonstrating that TFR2 competes with BMPR for binding BMP2 and TFR2:BMP binding is enhanced in the presence of Fe-TF, together suggesting that presence of iron may favor bone resorption in the presence of TFR2. Something akin to this would benefit the readership and should be included in the manuscript as it pertains to the data on TFR1 here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. Although the results in Figure 1B indicate that Tfr1-mediated iron uptake is a major route for iron acquisition in osteoclasts, we did not have direct evidence regarding the effects of Tfr2 on osteoclast iron uptake and function. The statement of “The role of Tfr2 in osteoclast iron uptake and function needs to be further elucidated in the future” has been added in the second paragraph on page 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Please explain and include in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The residual cellular iron in Tfr1-deficient osteoclasts may be obtained through uptake of heme because the heme transporter Hcp1 is up-regulated during osteoclast differentiation and the fact that hemin but not ferric ammonium citrate (FAC, which is absorbed through NTBI) is able to rescue the Tfr1-deficient osteoclast phenotypes (Figure 5). While Ishii et al. reported that knockdown of Tfr1 expression in bone marrow monocytes by short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibits osteoclast differentiation and transferrin promotes osteoclastogenesis in vitro, the treatment of mice with iron chelator has no effects on osteoclast number in vivo. Iron chelator inhibits iron effect totally and not specifically to Tfr1. The use of mice with conditional deletion of Tfr1 gene specifically in osteoclasts to investigate the role of Tfr1 mediated iron transport function in osteoclasts has not been done previously. The information has been added on page 23.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 3 A-E is redundant and can be moved to the Supplement.

The importance of iron homeostasis in bone turnover has gained momentum in recent years, most notably the role of transferrin receptor 2 in osteoblasts (Rauner et al., Nat Med 2019), however the physiological significance of iron and the mechanism(s) responsible for its uptake in osteoclasts remains poorly understood. As such, the present study detailing the physiological role of Tfr1 in osteoclasts would likely be of considerable interest to the field, complementing existing studies in osteoblasts, but also reconciling the physiological contribution of cellular iron handling on the other side of the bone remodelling equation. The strengths of this study lie the multiple osteoclast-specific mouse lines generated to interrogate the role of Tfr1 in both osteoclast-lineage cells and mature osteoclasts along with the suite of complementary cell biological, biochemical and proteomic analyses used to dissect its contribution in osteoclasts. Nonetheless, there remain some weaknesses, particularly concerning the expressivity of the bone phenotype and mechanistic link between Tfr1 and the cytoskeleton that should be considered to strengthen the overall resolve of the conclusions drawn.</p><p>I have the following comments:</p><p>1. The studies conducted on LysoM-Cre mice appear to be well-executed and carefully controlled. The skeletal phenotype is however complex, being restricted to trabeculae of the long bones of female mice, but not the axial skeleton (e.g. vertebrae) at 10-weeks of age. The authors rationalise that the unexpected sexual dimorphism is associated with an intersection between estrogen and iron export, which is reasonable, but they do not offer experimental evidence to support this. Further, the skeletal phenotyping is limited to a single time-point i.e. 10-weeks of age. As such, it would be beneficial if the authors could provide data in older animals to show whether the bone phenotype becomes more pronounced or resolves with age. It would also be useful for the reader if the authors could offer some explanation for the observed site-specific differences in the Discussion e.g. potential differences in osteoclast heterogeneity etc.</p></disp-quote><p>See the reply to #3 in Essential Revisions and the results in new Figure 2 and supplemental Figures 5-6. The explanations for the different phenotypes in trabecular verse cortical bone compartments and in long bone versus vertebra are discussed in the third paragraph on page 22.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Although widely employed as a Cre-transgenic mouse line to conditionally delete target genes in mature osteoclasts there are some caveats that should be considered to avoid over-interpretation of data arising from the cathespin K (Ctsk)-Cre lines. Foremost, this cre-line is known to result in the loss one allele of Ctsk owing to partial replacement the Ctsk locus with Cre in the targeting cassette (Dallas et a., Genetics 2018). Thus, endogenous Ctsk expression is reduced. Considering that deficiency and mutations in Ctsk lead to high bone mass phenotype (Saftig et al., 1997) together with findings that Cstk K-Cre can also lead to unexpected germline deletion of genes (e.g. Winkeler et al., PLos 2012), any data arising from these mice need to be interpreted with a degree of caution. The authors have rightly attempted to control for this using littermates mice on heterozygous KI (Ctsk-Cre/+), which is appropriate although these mice are on a mice mixed background C57BL6/129 which can complicate skeletal phenotypes. Overall, these underlying complexities may account, in part, for the discrepancies observed between the LysoM and Ctsk-cre males and females, with Ctsk-Cre leading to a more pronounced phenotype. As a minimum, these limitations need to be acknowledged and discussed. A minor oversight- for Figure 4B is that the mice sexes are unlabelled in the reconstructed uCT scans.</p></disp-quote><p>The advantages and disadvantages of <italic>Lyz2</italic>(<italic>LysM</italic>)-Cre and <italic>Ctsk</italic>-Cre models and the possible explanations for the different phenotypes between the <italic>Lyz2</italic>-Cre and <italic>Ctsk</italic>-Cre males and females have been added in and discussed in the second paragraph on page 22. See also the reply to the #1 of General Comments of Reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The in vitro data concerning the potential effects of Tfr1-deficiency on osteoclast different and mitochondrial metabolism are extensive and overall support the conclusion drawn. On the other hand the mechanism linking Tfr1 regulation of the osteoclast cytoskeleton remains largely descriptive and thus is comparatively underdeveloped. While the quantitative proteomics data goes some way to lend support to the notion that loss of Tfr1 leads to a global dysregulation of downstream Tfr1-associated protein pathways including those involved with cytoskeletal signalling/organization, the extent and diversity of proteins affected in osteoclasts &gt;2000 proteins is remarkable. Can the authors please clarify how they arrived at the 1.2-fold threshold for these data. Does the 1.2-fold represent an arbitrary cut-off or does it reflect &gt;1.2 Log2Fold, p&lt;0.05? To validate these proteomic data the authors hone in on hem1 (a component of the Wave regulatory complex, WRC) and show that it partly restores the cytoskeletal spreading defect in Tfr1-deficient osteoclasts. This finding is interesting but would be bolstered by confirmation of a disruption of additional components of the WRC or downstream components such as Arf2/3 which has an established role in OC cytoskeletal organization in osteoclasts (Hurst et al., JBMR 2009). Considering the well-established roles of B3-integrin, c-SRC and Pyk2 in osteoclasts, it would be valuable to corroborate/or discount their direct involvement in these spreading and cytoskeletal defects by independently assessing their expression levels immunoanalytically in Tfr1-deficient osteoclasts.</p></disp-quote><p>The advantages and disadvantages of <italic>Lyz2</italic>(<italic>LysM</italic>)-Cre and <italic>Ctsk</italic>-Cre models and the possible explanations for the different phenotypes between the <italic>Lyz2</italic>-Cre and <italic>Ctsk</italic>-Cre males and females have been added in and discussed in the second paragraph on page 22.

The authors state that Tfr1 does not inhibit osteoclast differentiation, but just spreading and resorption. I do not agree with this statement. By &quot;spreading&quot;, do the authors mean &quot;fusion&quot;? I believe in any case that this is part of the differentiation process to a fully mature osteoclast. Also, even though it is stated that osteoclasts have been counted as TRAP-positive and with more than 3 nuclei, I know from experience that it is tricky to identify the nuclei just using TRAP staining, especially in such small cells as presented in Suppl. Figure 9A. I believe it may be more accurate to assess the number of osteoclasts in this case with so many small ones using IF and DAPI staining for the nuclei. Using that, the authors could also count how many osteoclasts have e.g. 3-10 or 10-50 nuclei (giving insights into the fusion process). Finally, I believe more markers for osteoclasts could be used to address this point of fusion/spreading, such as DC-STAMP, SWAP70, or CTSK. In Suppl. Figure 9, e.g., it looks like CtsK expression is reduced in the Tfr1;Lysm-cre mice, although the WB is a bit over-exposed, so it is hard to tell… quantification would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>The word “spreading” is often used to describe the cellular process in which the morphology of multinucleated osteoclasts changes from the irregular-shaped status characterized by scattered distribution of podosomes to a round-shaped status featured by the peripherally localized podosome-belt when osteoclasts are cultured on glass coverslips or plastic culture dishes. Thus, the spreading process in osteoclasts is regulated by cytoskeleton organization. The defects in osteoclast spreading are associated with decreased osteoclast activation and bone resorption. The reviewer’s point is correct that the “fusion” is a part of osteoclast differentiation process where mononuclear osteoclast precursor cells are fused to form multinucleated osteoclasts. This process is regulated by osteoclast fusion genes including DC-Stamp induced by RANKL and Nfatc1.</p><p>In response to the reviewer suggestion, we have now quantitatively measured the mRNA expression of osteoclast marker genes in control and Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> osteoclast precursor and mature cells.

This slight decrease in Ctsk protein level in Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> osteoclasts might be caused by the fewer number of large osteoclasts with &gt; 30 nuclei in Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> culture than in control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It appears that the appendicular skeleton is more affected than the axial skeleton. Did the authors check the expression of Tfr1 in e.g. femoral vs. vertebral bone using immunohistochemistry?

Please add more details.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see “Mitochondrial mass, ROS production, and membrane potential measurements” in the Materials and methods section for detailed methodology. The following information has been added (See grey highlights on page 32).</p><p>The epifluorescent images of 10-15 randomly chosen areas per group (control or knockout) were taken in a blinded fashion. Each area had between 7-15 cells. The images were analyzed with Image J software also in a blinded fashion. The fluorescent intensities of cells were individually measured, and the results were presented as mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) per cell in arbitrary units.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The link between Tfr1 and cytoskeleton organization is not quite clear. Is that connection e.g. iron-dependent and/or dependent on non-canonical functions of Tfr1? If iron-dependent, how does iron affect the regulation of WRC/Arp2/3 complex?</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 5C and 5D, 10μM hemin (ferric chloride heme), which provides iron through the alternative heme uptake in the absence of Tfr1, rescued the cytoskeleton organization defects (podosome-belt formation in osteoclasts cultured on glass coverslips and the actin-ring formation in osteoclasts cultured on bovine cortical bone slices, see also Figure 4D and 4E) in Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> osteoclasts. These results indicate that Tfr1-mediated cellular iron homeostasis regulates osteoclast cytoskeleton organization although we don’t have evidence whether the non-canonical functions of Tfr1 participates this process at the moment. To identify the mechanisms by which Tfr1-mediated iron uptake regulates WRC/Arp2/3 complex, we turned to its upstream activators, the small GTPases Rac1/Arf1 and the protein tyrosine kinase c-Src which plays a central role in activating Rac1 and osteoclast cytoskeleton stimulated by the integrins, M-CSF as well as RANKL. As shown in Figure 9B, we found that the phosphorylation (activation) of c-Src and the GTP-bound (active form) of Rac1 but not GTP-bound Arf1 stimulated by M-CSF were declined in Tfr1<sup>ΔlysM</sup> osteoclasts. In contrast, Tfr1-deficiency had little effects on RANKL-activated c-Src, Rac1, and Arf1 in osteoclasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. I personally think that Suppl. Figure 1 should be included into the main figures as it shows the first mechanistic part. I would rather suggest to potentially combine Figure 1+3 and/or 2+4 (or put parts of them into the supplement).</p></disp-quote><p>The Supplemental Figure 1 has been changed to Figure 1. The previous Figure 1 and Figure 2 are now Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively. We moved previous Figure 3 and Figure 4 into the supplemental Figures. They are now Figure 2—figure supplement 6 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3, respectively.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the authors have added a substantive amount of work to significantly improve this manuscript, there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, still a few places that need further explanation, a few pieces of data that do not evidently communicate what the authors claim:</p><p>1) While Ctsk mRNA expression is increased in Tfr1f/f Cre+ mice, protein concentration is decreased. This is unclear and presumptively, the focus is on the protein concentration. It is unclear what this means in total but the authors state that this indicates that Tfr1 deletion in osteoclasts has minimum effect on osteoclast differentiation. This needs to be clarified further in the results and Discussion sections.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for lack of clarity on the Ctsk mRNA expression and protein data. Cathepsin k is a well-accepted marker of osteoclast activity. Thus, our data on the reduced CTSK protein levels in Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> mice suggest reduced osteoclast activity. The result and conclusion have been revised on page 12 and page 13.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Tfr1 loss appears to increase the number of osteoclasts with fewer nuclei and decreased fusion. The authors state that this impacts osteoclast function (decreased) rather than number or differentiation. This is fine as they show good evidence of decreased osteoclast functional endpoints. However, later in the manuscript, osteoblast data is also alluded to but not presented, noting only increased serum P1NP and Runx2 expression (Figure 3 – suppl Figure 2) and a comment suggesting that the phenotype in Tfr1f/f;Lyz2-Cre mice therefore maybe the consequence of altered osteoblast function. The response to Reviewer 1, point #8 is thus confusing and requires further clarification. Perhaps the authors are stating that the altered osteoclast function leads to an altered ability of the osteoclasts to suppress osteoblasts? This should be made clear in the discussion at least as speculation if the data cannot be shown fully. Response to Reviewer 2 point #4 is confusing with circular logic along the same lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not clearly stating the osteoclast-osteoblast connection to the observed skeletal phenotype. Loss of Tfr1 expression in osteoclasts lead to decreased osteoclast function as shown by reduced CTSK protein levels and osteoclast functional data. Based on what is known about osteoclast-mediated coupling of bone formation, one would predict that the reduced osteoclast activity in Tfr1f/f Cre+ mice should reduce bone formation. By contrast, the increased serum PINP levels and Runx2 expression in these mice suggest increased bone formation. Thus, we don’t have an explanation at present if the increased bone formation is a direct consequence of inhibition of osteoclast activity or by some other mechanisms. Further studies are needed to address this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 6D needs a quantification. The authors state that Tfr1 loss results in decreased energy metabolism but there is no obvious evidence of this in osteoclasts in this figure (maybe BMM are bit more decreased in Tfr1-/- cells). Therefore, it is erroneous to state that is is restored by hemin as there is no evidence of a defect or visually appreciable differences relative to control in any of the wells. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantitative data of Figure 6D is added as Figure 6—figure supplement 1. The results are revised based on this quantification. Although Figure 6D provides complementary evidence for proteomic data (shown in Figure 6B and 6C) by simultaneously demonstrating the changes of mitochondrial respiratory complexes in vehicle and hemin treated control and Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> bone marrow monocytes and osteoclasts, it should point out that the antibody cocktail used in this immunoblotting contains antibodies against only one component of each of five mitochondrial respiratory complexes as indicated in Figure 6D. Thus, the result of Figure 6D could not reflect complete changes of mitochondria in Tfr1-deficient osteoclast lineage cells. This limitation of the assay has been added on page 16. We agree that Figure 6 does not provide strong evidence to support the conclusion that loss of Tfr1 in osteoclasts attenuates energy metabolism. This conclusion is removed to Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) While OVX Tfr1f/f;LysMCre mice exhibit a persistent difference from OVX control, the authors state that the phenotype observed in non-OVX mice is estrogen dependent (page 9, line 227). This is conceptually inaccurate in my understanding as if it were estrogen dependent, the difference would be abrogated after OVX which it is not. It in fact supports the opposite conclusion, that the phenotype is NOT estrogen dependent. Please clarify in discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the OVX data in Figure 2 could not fully support the conclusion that the high trabecular bone mass phenotype in Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> mice is estrogen dependent though showing obvious gender-dependent difference. We revised the results and conclusion in the contest of what we know about estrogen regulation of bone modeling and remodeling during development and in adulthood in the Results and Discussion sections on page 9 and page 23, respectively. It is now well established that estrogen-mediated mechanisms play a key role in mediating bone accretion during pubertal growth period. During this developmental period, estrogen is known to exert an anabolic effect on osteoblast besides its well-established role in inhibiting osteoclast functions. However, the loss of estrogen as seen during menopause or due to ovariectomy in adults lead to bone loss primarily due to increased bone resorption. As shown in Figure 2, trabecular bone volume of Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> mice was increased at the post-pubertal age of 10 weeks but was not different at the prepubertal age of 3 weeks, thus suggesting that the skeletal phenotype gets manifested during pubertal and post-pubertal growth periods. To determine if loss of Tfr1 in osteoclasts affects OVX-induced bone loss, control and Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> mice at 4.5-month of age were ovariectomized to mimic human postmenopausal osteoporosis and skeletal phenotype was determined at 6 months of age. While OVX induced bone loss in Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> mice, the trabecular bone mass of Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> mice was significantly higher than control mice after OVX. While these data suggest that loss of Tfr1 does not affect estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss, the issue of whether the skeletal phenotype in 10-week-old Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> mice is dependent on pubertal increase in estrogen remains to be evaluated by performing OVX at prepubertal age of 3 weeks in future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 9C and 9D demonstrate the effect of Hem1 overexpression. The authors note &quot;rescue&quot; but this is only partial and a more appropriate conclusion would be that other mechanisms of iron delivery can reverse, at least partially, the effect of iron restriction induced by Tfr1 loss.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. We have revised the conclusion to indicate that the rescue is partial and suggest that the other component(s) of the WRC complex or distinct pathways might also be involved in the Tfr1-mediated regulation of osteoclast cytoskeleton in the first paragraph on page 20.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Unclear if there is a difference between 10uM hemin in control vs. Tfr1-/- cells in Figure 5A, 5C, and 5D. A preserved difference would suggest that there is incomplete rescue even at the highest hemin dose because osteoclasts may not have every option for iron import available in other cells. This is important to expand in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. We have added the statistical analysis results of 10uM hemin-treated control vs. Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> cultures in Figure 5A, 5C, and 5D. We have revised the conclusion to indicate that the rescue is partial and there are limited alternative iron acquisition pathways in osteoclasts as in other cells in the first paragraph on page 15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 9B requires quantification to corroborate the assertions made by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantitative data is added as Figure 9—figure supplement 1, and the results and conclusion are revised based on the quantitation in the first and second paragraphs on page 19.</p></body></sub-article></article>
