As with all protein tyrosine phosphatases, the activity of PTPN22 is redox regulated, but if or how such regulation can modulate inflammatory pathways in vivo is not known. To determine this, we created a mouse with a cysteine-to-serine mutation at position 129 in PTPN22 (C129S), a residue proposed to alter the redox regulatory properties of PTPN22 by forming a disulfide with the catalytic C227 residue. The C129S mutant mouse showed a stronger T-cell-dependent inflammatory response and development of T-cell-dependent autoimmune arthritis due to enhanced TCR signaling and activation of T cells, an effect neutralized by a mutation in Ncf1, a component of the NOX2 complex. Activity assays with purified proteins suggest that the functional results can be explained by an increased sensitivity to oxidation of the C129S mutated PTPN22 protein. We also observed that the disulfide of native PTPN22 can be directly reduced by the thioredoxin system, while the C129S mutant lacking this disulfide was less amenable to reductive reactivation. In conclusion, we show that PTPN22 functionally interacts with Ncf1 and is regulated by oxidation via the noncatalytic C129 residue and oxidation-prone PTPN22 leads to increased severity in the development of T-cell-dependent autoimmunity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>PTPN22</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>PTPN22</kwd><kwd>Autoimmunity</kwd><kwd>Redox regulation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holmdahl</surname><given-names>Rikard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006310</institution-id><institution>Swedish Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holmdahl</surname><given-names>Rikard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001729</institution-id><institution>Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holmdahl</surname><given-names>Rikard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hungarian Thematic Excellence Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arnér</surname><given-names>Elias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Investissement d'Avenir</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malissen</surname><given-names>Bernard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PTPN22 function is regulated by reactive oxygen species, and redox regulation of PTPN22 impacts T-cell-dependent autoimmune inflammation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Complex autoimmune diseases affect 4–5% of the human population, and large efforts have been invested in finding the underlying genetic polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ye et al., 2018</xref>). Though a major genetic contribution comes from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, many other loci have also been identified. Two important single-nucleotide polymorphisms have emerged, one located in PTPN22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bottini et al., 2004</xref>), a cytoplasmic class I protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), and the other in NCF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Olsson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olsson et al., 2017</xref>), a component of the NOX2 complex, controlling induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in antigen-presenting cells. Mutations in <italic>Ncf1</italic>, leading to a lower NOX2-dependent ROS response, have been shown to be a major predisposing genetic factor for autoimmune diseases in both mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Olsson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olsson et al., 2017</xref>). PTPN22 is primarily a dominant negative regulator of T cell responsiveness, acting by dephosphorylating important target proteins in the T cell signaling machinery, including LCK, FYN, and ZAP70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bottini and Peterson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stanford and Bottini, 2014</xref>). Studies on PTPN22 have thus far focused on the effects of knocking out the gene or on the autoimmune variant <italic>Ptpn22<sup>R620W</sup></italic>, but with divergent results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carmona and Martín, 2018</xref>). Importantly, however, PTPN22 is likely to be redox regulated. Its activity is, as with other PTPs, dependent upon the integrity of a catalytic active site Cys residue. The reactivity of this cysteine makes it particularly susceptible to oxidation via ROS, leading to concomitant abrogation of PTP activity. Reversible oxidation and reduction of such reactive cysteines has previously been shown to be a regulatory mechanism in signal transduction, regulating important T cell downstream signaling molecules such as NF-KB, NRF2, MAPK, and ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kesarwani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ostman et al., 2011</xref>). Control of redox regulation of PTPs in cells depends upon the balance between inhibitory oxidation of the catalytic Cys residue and its activation by reduction, where the latter is typically maintained by the thioredoxin system. We have now investigated the possibility that redox regulation of PTPN22 could modulate inflammatory pathways in vivo. Interestingly, the PTPN22 catalytic cysteine (C227) has been suggested to form a disulfide bond with another ‘back-door’ cysteine (C129), possibly altering the threshold for irreversible oxidation of C227 and thereby affecting the redox state of the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>). By creating a mouse with a cysteine-to-serine mutation at position 129 in PTPN22 (C129S), we could investigate the possible pathophysiological impact of its redox regulatory properties in vivo. We found that mice with this amino acid replacement developed increased T-cell-dependent inflammatory responses due to enhanced T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, which was dependent on NOX2-produced ROS. This correlated well with findings of a lower overall turnover, higher sensitivity to inhibitory oxidation, and a lower capacity of reductive reactivation by the thioredoxin system of recombinant mutant PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> compared to wild-type PTPN22. These results show that redox regulation of PTPN22 modulates inflammation in vivo, with a lower resistance to oxidation of PTPN22 promoting aggravated disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Recombinant PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> has lower catalytic activity, higher sensitivity to inhibition by oxidation, and lower capacity for reductive reactivation by the thioredoxin system</title><p>To investigate the potential impact of a C129S replacement in the PTPN22 protein, we recombinantly produced the catalytic domain of the corresponding human wild-type PTPN22 and PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> mutant proteins (C129 and catalytic C227 residues have the same numbering in both mouse and human).

We found that addition of 50 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to the pure protein led to inhibition of approximately half the activity after 20 min incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also found that addition of bicarbonate together with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> noticeably potentiated the inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), similar to the properties shown earlier for PTP1B that are likely due to the formation of peroxymonocarbonate that reacts more efficiently than H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with the PTP enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dagnell et al., 2019</xref>). When comparing the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> with that of wild-type PTPN22, we found that the mutant enzyme was clearly more sensitive to inhibition by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than wild-type PTPN22, although it had a lower basal turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The same effect was also seen in the presence of a functional thioredoxin system of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) coupled with thioredoxin (Trx1), but perhaps less so coupled with thioredoxin-related protein of 14 kDa (TRP14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). It should be noted that also PTP1B displays different reactivities with Trx1 and TRP14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dagnell et al., 2021</xref>), which may have physiological importance.</p><p>True regulation of PTPN22 by redox mechanisms should require that the oxidized and thereby inactivated enzyme can be subsequently reactivated by reduction as otherwise an oxidizing step could only represent an irreversible off-switch. Since the thioredoxin system has been previously shown to reactivate phosphatases PTP1B and PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dagnell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dagnell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwertassek et al., 2014</xref>), we next tested this property. We found that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-inactivated PTPN22 species could be reactivated in vitro using either DTT as reductant or the thioredoxin system composed of NADPH together with TrxR1 and Trx1. Interestingly, wild-type PTPN22, but not the PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> mutant, could be directly reactivated by TrxR1 together with NADPH, without inclusion of Trx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Subsequent experiments showed that the effect of TrxR1-dependent reactivation was concentration dependent and that the oxidized forms of wild-type PTPN22 were clearly more amenable to direct reactivation by TrxR1 than those of PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Since the only difference between PTPN22 and PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> is the integrity of the noncatalytic C129 residue, we reasoned that the direct reductive reactivation by TrxR1+ NADPH of wild-type PTPN22, not seen with the PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> mutant, might indicate that TrxR1 can directly reduce the disulfide involving C129 that may be formed in the wild-type PTPN22 enzyme. To assess this possibility, we subjected both forms of the enzyme to oxidative conditions or to reduction by either DTT or TrxR1, and then analyzed the enzymes on a nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Indeed, only PTPN22 but not PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> displayed a second faster migrating form of the protein upon oxidation that disappeared upon reduction with DTT or TrxR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The effect was seen with several concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and DTT treatment could always revert the double band of PTPN22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also found that the reactivation of wild-type PTPN22, with either DTT or the thioredoxin system (TrxR1 alone, or coupled with either Trx1 or TRP14), was always more efficient than that of the mutant PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> enzyme, also in cases where prior oxidation was further potentiated by bicarbonate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>PTPN22 can be reactivated by TrxR1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pre-reduced wild-type (black) or PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> (gray) proteins were treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (1 mM) for 5 min whereupon residual H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was removed by addition of catalase.

TCR signaling induces activation of protein kinase C (PKC)-θ, an essential player in peripheral T cell activation. Compared to wild-type, PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> lymph node cells showed constitutive phosphorylation of Y538 on PKC-θ, independent of TCR stimulation, whereas in wild-type cells phosphorylation increased with TCR stimulation, hinting at higher basal activity of PKC-θ in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To assess how changes in the redox status affect T cell signaling, we used buthionine sulphoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of ɣ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase, which is essential for glutathione synthesis. Treatment with BSO modulates the redox systems in cells by lowering the GSH levels and without directly affecting the thioredoxin system, at least initially before compensatory mechanisms may be activated. Here, it initially reverted the phospho-PKC-θ levels in the mutant to be comparable with wild-type, followed by a slower TCR-activation-dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Next, we investigated how differential signaling was affecting the proteome signature using sorted CD4+ T cells from wild-type and PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> mice.

Significant ROS producers include the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase (NOX) complexes as well as the mitochondrial respiratory chain, modulating responses such as cell growth, death, and immune function under both physiological and pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schieber and Chandel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhong et al., 2018</xref>).

This ROS exposure regulates NFAT activation, IL2 production, and plasticity by both influencing the redox status of kinases involved and through metabolic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kesarwani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Contento et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gelderman et al., 2007</xref>). Reversible cysteine modifications have emerged as a major redox regulatory mechanism important for ERK1/2 phosphorylation, calcium flux, cell growth, and proliferation of naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">García-Santamarina et al., 2014</xref>). Proteins containing cysteine residues, such as PTPs, are particularly susceptible to redox effects in part due to the low pKa value of their active site. Oxidation leads to inhibition of PTP activity, and several PTPs such as Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 and 2 (SHP1/2) and tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTP1B) are well studied in terms of their redox regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ostman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Michalek et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frijhoff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tonks, 2003</xref>). The thioredoxin system is important for its reductive PTP-activating capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dagnell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dóka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dagnell et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>PTPN22 is a PTP expressed in all hematopoietic cells and a known negative regulator of T cell signaling. The R620W variant of PTPN22 has been associated with an increased risk of several autoimmune diseases, amongst them diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. It has been shown to interfere with the binding of PTPN22 to the C-terminal SRC kinase (CSK) affecting downstream signaling. However, whether R620W is a gain-of-function or loss-of-function variant remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bottini and Peterson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stanford and Bottini, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carmona and Martín, 2018</xref>). A possibility for redox regulation of PTPN22 was highlighted by Tsai et al., who discovered an atypical disulfide bond formation between the catalytic cysteine C227 and a ‘back-door’ cysteine C129, as visualized in a crystal structure of the catalytic domain of PTPN22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>). As physiologically relevant oxidative regulation of PTPN22 has thus far not been studied, we decided to mutate C129 into a serine, thereby abrogating the capacity of C129 to contribute to redox regulation of PTPN22, both in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>In our in vitro experiments, PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> showed a lower basal catalytic activity, higher sensitivity to inhibition by oxidation, and a lower capacity for reactivation by the thioredoxin system compared to the wild-type enzyme. The reason behind the initial decrease in activity remains to be studied; the single cysteine-to-serine change may affect the PTPN22 protein conformation or dynamics and crystallography studies would be needed to address this. It should also be noted that the pure PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> migrated slightly slower than wild-type PTPN22, despite the only difference between the two proteins being the single C129 residue. This also suggests an overall effect on protein characteristics by the C129S mutation, which should be studied further. Based on our findings, we propose a model for the redox regulation of PTPN22, with the disulfide bond that can be formed between C227 and C129 protecting the catalytic C227 residue from overoxidation to sulphinic or sulphonic acid. It is also possible that an alternative sulphenylamide motif can be made between the thiol group of the C227 with the peptide bond amine, which can also be reduced by the thioredoxin system, similar to that seen with PTP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dagnell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwertassek et al., 2014</xref>) even if that motif was not seen in the crystal structure of PTPN22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>). This model explains how PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> can still show activity and a certain protection against oxidation and reactivation by the thioredoxin system, but simultaneously be more susceptible to oxidation because the protective disulfide cannot be formed.</p><p>In T cells<italic>,</italic> the PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> mutation led to enhanced T cell activation and proliferation. This was not due to altered PTPN22 expression levels, but rather a consequence of downstream signaling. The PTPN22 targets LCK, Fyn, and Zap70 showed increased phosphorylation, arguing for lower catalytic activity of PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> in vivo and confirming our in vitro findings. In TCR signaling, phosphorylation of PKC-θ is a late-stage event that leads to the activation of transcription factors Nf-Kb, NFAT, and AP-1 controlling T cell functions down the line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). We observed baseline upregulation of p-PKC-θ in PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> T cells, which did not respond to further TCR stimulation. PKC phosphorylation is regulated by germinal center kinase-like kinase (GLK) and LCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brezar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupta et al., 2008</xref>). An increase in LCK phosphorylation as previously observed might therefore be causing increased p-PKC-θ. In an oxidative microenvironment created by BSO treatment, the initial difference in unstimulated cells disappeared and PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> instead showed slower phosphorylation kinetics compared to wild-type. This might be mediated by direct effects of ROS on PKC as it contains several redox-sensitive residues that can lead to PKC inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steinberg, 2015</xref>). Proteomics data further corroborated the enhanced activation state. Interestingly, in the <italic>Ptpn22</italic> mutant, we observed downregulation of CENPF, a cell cycle protein that was shown to be upregulated upon TrxR inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Selenius et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Enhanced T cell activation led to increased inflammation in vivo, and we observed a pronounced skewing towards Th1 responses. A link between PTPN22 and Th1 responses has previously been established; PTPN22<sup>-/-</sup> and PTPN22<sup>R619W</sup> mice accumulate Th1 effector cells in their lymphoid organs with age or upon immune challenge. Th1 expansion in these mice was found to be dependent on LFA-ICAM1 interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sanchez-Blanco et al., 2018</xref>). A collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model produced no visible differences in inflammation in PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> mice, in line with previous data showing that even a complete lack of PTPN22 does not result in significant differences in inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sanchez-Blanco et al., 2018</xref>). An explanation could be that the major pathogenic factor in the CIA model are autoreactive B cells producing pathogenic antibodies, rather than autoreactive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holmdahl et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>In both T-cell-mediated inflammatory models (DTH and GPI) as well as on the Col2-T cell transgenic background, PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> mice displayed higher T cell activity as well as more regulatory T cell markers such as FOXP3 and PD1 (shown for GPI model). A rise in Treg numbers is a measure to combat inflammation, but where they originate from is a matter of discussion. They can originate from the thymus and migrate to the tissue in response to inflammation or result from conversion of CD4+ CD25- naïve T cells in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yadav et al., 2013</xref>). PTPN22 plays an important role in determining TCR signal strength during central tolerance; PTPN22-deficient mice show increased positive selection in the thymus as well as increased Treg numbers both in the thymus and periphery, leading to protection from the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maine et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hasegawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fousteri et al., 2014</xref>). In our study, Treg numbers were comparable between wild-type and PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> thymi, suggesting peripheral induction of Tregs upon inflammation in PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> mice. This may be a consequence of increased IFNɣ production by PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> T cells as studies have also associated FOXP3 induction to Th1 responses; this mechanism links IFNɣ and IL27 with amplifying TGF-b-induced FOXP3 expression via STAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ouaked et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Littringer et al., 2018</xref>). Previous studies have also shown the essential role of PKC-θ in NFAT-dependent FOXP3 expression. PKC-θ<sup>−/−</sup> mice have significantly reduced CD4+ FOXP3+ Tregs in the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupta et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, the rise in Tregs in PTPN22<sup>C129S</sup> mice may be a consequence of the enhanced baseline PKC-θ signaling.</p><p>In summary, our results show how the activity of PTPN22, a gene where a risk variant is associated with autoimmune diseases, can be regulated by ROS through its noncatalytic C129 residue, which is likely to have a major impact on its function in addition to that of merely altered basal turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). It does not exclude additional modifications of other cysteines that have not been specifically addressed here. It has been notoriously difficult to target PTPs in vivo with drug therapies due to the nature of their active sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stanford and Bottini, 2017</xref>), but recent advances in targeting the redox status of T lymphocytes might represent a novel strategy to treat T-cell-driven diseases. Antibody-trapping of the oxidized form of PTP1B, a highly touted drug target for diabetes and obesity, has been shown to increase insulin signaling in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stanford and Bottini, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krishnan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stanford and Bottini, 2017</xref>). It is therefore of importance to study the redox regulatory effects on the T cell machinery and its effects on immune processes. As such, our study contributes to the understanding of redox regulation of PTPN22 and possibly represents a new avenue for targeting PTPN22.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Recombinant expression of PTPN22</title><p>The open-reading frame (ORF) of human PTPN22 catalytic domain (1–303 residues), codon optimized for recombinant expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.

We fully agree that this would improve the study and we have therefore made several attempts to demonstrate this oxidation, or the oxidation state of the active site Cys residue in PTPN22 in situ. However, as we had also expected, it has proven to be technically very challenging (see attached the results of one of the experiments that have been performed). Nevertheless, as the functional consequence of the PTPN22 oxidation and the effect of the C129S mutation is clearly documented in the mouse, using in vivo experiments, we still think it is valid to conclude that the reversible oxidation state of PTPN22 as well as the involvement of the Cys129 residue regulates the function of PTPN22 in vivo, which is the main conclusion of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is an elegant study with ample controls, a clear logic, compelling data, and a model of PTPN22 regulation that fits well into the current understanding of PTP regulation and the role of PTPN22 in TCR signaling.</p><p>I have no concerns with this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer very much for the appreciative words and positive evaluation of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1 – In the Introduction, the sentence &quot;Control of redox regulation of PTPs in cells depends upon the balance between inhibitory oxidation of the catalytic Cys residue and its activation by reduction, where the latter is typically maintained by the thioredoxin system.&quot; Should be tempered since glutathionylation of PTPs has also been reported.</p></disp-quote><p>Clearly glutathionylation can also be important, as could nitrosylation, formation of disulfides, sulfenylamide motifs, or oxidation to sulfinic or sulfonic acid. These potential modifications of the catalytic Cys residue are however all examples of inhibitory oxidation, so we believe that our original statement holds as written.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 – In the Introduction, the sentence &quot;True redox regulation of PTPN22 requires that the fully oxidized and thus inactivated enzyme can be subsequently reactivated by reduction.&quot; Should be clarified. What is the meaning of &quot;true oxidation&quot;? Also, fully oxidized suggests that the enzyme should be terminally oxidized to SO3.</p></disp-quote><p>We here emphasized that true redox regulation requires reversible oxidation/reduction steps, as otherwise complete oxidation would be irreversible and hardly considered a regulatory mechanism (rather an off-switch). Please note that we did not write ”true oxidation”. However, to avoid misunderstanding, we have now clarified the sentence as follows:</p><p>“True regulation of PTPN22 by redox mechanisms should require that the oxidized and thereby inactivated enzyme can be subsequently reactivated by reduction, as otherwise an oxidizing step could only represent an irreversible off-switch.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3 – Since the disulfide between C227 and C129 is based on a published crystal structure, the authors should provide an experimental proof of this disulfide, such as by MS analysis. See: DOI:https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M111899200</p></disp-quote><p>In the cited paper, MS analysis was performed on large quantity of oxidized PTEN (100 µg) obtained by incubating the purified protein for 5 min at room temperature. The identification of reduced and oxidized forms of PTEN in cells was performed by immunoblot analysis and not by mass spectrometry. Given the limitations of the MS technology, it currently doesn’t seem feasible to detect the disulfide between C227 and C129 with mass spectrometry in cellular lysate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4 – Line 143, correct to C129S.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5 – There are some discrepancies between Fig1D,E, in which some protection is provided by Trx1 and Trp14, and Figure 2A, B. Can the authors explain why?</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments in Figure 1D and E show the protective activities of the Trx system proteins towards oxidation and thus inactivation of PTPN22 by addition of H2O2, while Figure 2A and B show the capacity of the Trx system proteins in reactivation of PTPN22 from a previous fully inactivated state. These activities are not comparable, as also discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6 – Line 157, the authors should try to indicate that this is a hypothesis. Using language such as &quot;This would disrupt the proposed mechanism…&quot; would be less forceful.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7 – Reduced NOX2 activity in Figure 3C should be measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We admit that we do not directly show in this paper that the Ncf1m1j mutant mouse is deficient for NOX2 activity. However, this has been documented in numerous other papers and is established, and we have references to such papers. Therefore, we do not think it will add anything to show such data again. We also regularly test these mice for functional ROS activity, and they are also regularly screened for the Ncf1 mutation. We can of course show such data, if required, but it seem to us not meaningful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8 – PTPN22 oxidation should be assessed in Figure 4B.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, demonstrating reversible redox modifications in T cells using our models has proven too technically challenging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9 – PTPN22 has been shown to be expressed in T cells before. In this context, results from 5B are difficult to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 5B serves to show that there is no difference in PTPN22 expression between wildtype and C129S CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The lack of a band in unstimulated conditions is likely due to technical issues as it is well known that T cells have a low basal expression of PTPN22, but which increases upon T cell receptor stimulation. Additionally, though we chose to show expression after 24 hours, PTPN22 kinetics occur rapidly after TCR stimulation such as increased PTPN22 phosphorylation within 1-2 minutes (see Fiorillo et al., J Biol Chem, 2010; Yang et al., Sci. Signal.2020) (8) (9) as well as dephosphorylation of its targets in 2-5 minutes (Hasegawa et al., 2004) (10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10 – Cells used in experiments should also be mentioned in the text since, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are used for PTPN22 immunoblots, spleenocytes for qPCR, lymph node cells for Fyn/Lck and Zap immunoblots.</p></disp-quote><p>This information has now been added to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11 – The results from the BSO experiment need to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the exact mechanisms explaining the effects of BSO are difficult to know and the experiment could be better discussed. For once, our previous statement in the manuscript that said ” Treatment with BSO increases the oxidative burden in cells without directly affecting the thioredoxin system.” was an oversimplification and has now been clarified as follows: ” Treatment with BSO modulates the redox systems in cells by lowering the GSH levels and without directly affecting the thioredoxin system, at least initially before compensatory mechanisms may be activated.”. We have also revised the final sentence in the Results section from ” Thus, PTPN22C129S that is prone to inactivation by oxidation with decreased catalytic activity results in enhanced T cell signaling, which has broad signaling effects that can yield aggravated inflammatory disease.” to ” Thus, PTPN22C129S that is prone to inactivation by oxidation and more resistant to activating reduction, with decreased catalytic activity, triggers enhanced T cell signaling. This suggests that redox regulation of PTPN22 is an important factor in control of inflammation, and that increased oxidation of PTPN22 has broad signaling effects that can yield aggravated inflammatory disease.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12 – In 5 E and F, PEP is used for PTPN22. Please use PTPN22 throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13 – Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the discussion need to be tightened.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree.
