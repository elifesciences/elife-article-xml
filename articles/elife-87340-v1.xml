is a complex metabolic disorder that underlies several human diseases, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms underlying IR development remain poorly understood. Previously we showed that deficiency of coenzyme Q (CoQ) is necessary and sufficient for IR in adipocytes and skeletal muscle (Fazakerley et al., 2018). Here, we provide new insights into the mechanistic connections between cellular alterations associated with IR, including increased ceramides, CoQ deficiency, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. We demonstrate that elevated levels of ceramide in the mitochondria of skeletal muscle cells result in CoQ depletion and loss of mitochondrial respiratory chain components, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and IR. Further, decreasing mitochondrial ceramide levels in vitro and in animal models (mice, C57BL/6J) (under chow and high-fat diet) increased CoQ levels and was protective against IR. CoQ supplementation also rescued ceramide-associated IR. Examination of the mitochondrial proteome from human muscle biopsies revealed a strong correlation between the respirasome system and mitochondrial ceramide as key determinants of insulin sensitivity. Our findings highlight the mitochondrial ceramideâCoQârespiratory chain nexus as a potential foundation of an IR pathway that may also play a critical role in other conditions associated with ceramide accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction, such as heart failure, cancer, and aging. These insights may have important clinical implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of IR and related metabolic disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insulin is the primary hormone responsible for lowering blood glucose, in part, by stimulating glucose transport into muscle and adipose tissue. This is mediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-dependent delivery of insulin-sensitive glucose transporters (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane (PM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hill et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cong et al., 1997</xref>). This process is defective in insulin resistance, a significant risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">James et al., 2021</xref>), heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Riehle and Abel, 2016</xref>), and some types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Leitner et al., 2022</xref>), and so defective GLUT4 translocation represents one of the hallmarks of insulin resistance.</p><p>The development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and adipocytes has been associated with multiple intracellular lesions, including mitochondrial coenzyme Q (CoQ) deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fazakerley et al., 2018a</xref>), accumulation of intracellular lipids such as ceramides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Holland and Summers, 2008</xref>), and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hoehn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fazakerley et al., 2018b</xref>). However, delineating the relative contribution of these lesions to whole-body insulin resistance and their interconnectivity remains a challenge.</p><p>CoQ (CoQ9 in rodents and CoQ10 in humans) is a mitochondrial cofactor and antioxidant synthesized and localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). This cofactor is essential for mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hatefi et al., 1962</xref>), fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frerman, 1988</xref>), and nucleotide biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jones, 1980</xref>). We reported that mitochondrial, but not global, CoQ9 depletion is both necessary and sufficient to induce insulin resistance in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fazakerley et al., 2018a</xref>), suggesting a causal role of CoQ9/10 depletion in insulin resistance. CoQ deficiency can result from primary mutation in the CoQ biosynthetic machinery (named complex Q) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Montini et al., 2008</xref>) or secondary from other cellular defects such as deletion of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">KÃ¼hl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calvo et al., 2020</xref>). Low levels of CoQ10 are associated with human metabolic disease, including diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ates et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">El-ghoroury et al., 2009</xref>), cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zozina et al., 2018</xref>), and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Barcelos and Haas, 2019</xref>). Strikingly, many of these conditions are also associated with loss of OXPHOS and mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">HÃ¸jlund et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diaz-Vegas et al., 2020</xref>). However, it is unclear what causes these mitochondrial defects or if they are mechanistically linked.</p><p>Ceramides belong to the sphingolipid family, and high levels are strongly associated with insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chaurasia and Summers, 2021</xref>). While it has been proposed that ceramides cause insulin resistance by inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Summers et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schubert et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Powell et al., 2003</xref>), there is now considerable evidence that does not support this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fazakerley et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">James et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kono and Barham, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hoehn et al., 2008</xref>). Hence, ceramides may induce insulin resistance by a non-canonical mechanism. The rapid decline of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria in the presence of N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide), a synthetic ceramide analog that can penetrate cells, suggests that ceramides may be responsible for defective mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Paola et al., 2000</xref>). This effect seems to be ceramide-specific as neither diacylglycerides (DAGs) nor triacylglycerides (TAGs) affect mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Perreault et al., 2018</xref>). Recent evidence suggests a link between mitochondrial ceramides and insulin sensitivity, with the observation that reducing mitochondrial, but not global, ceramide in the liver protects against the development of diet-induced insulin resistance and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Perreault et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hammerschmidt et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with this, mitochondrial ceramide levels are more strongly associated with insulin resistance than with whole-tissue ceramide in human skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Perreault et al., 2018</xref>). Despite this association, no direct evidence exists linking mitochondrial ceramides with insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle.</p><p>Here, we describe the linkage between mitochondrial ceramide, CoQ, OXPHOS, and ROS in the etiology of insulin resistance. We show that a strong inverse relationship between mitochondrial CoQ and ceramide levels is intimately linked to the control of cellular insulin sensitivity. For example, increasing mitochondrial ceramide using either chemical or genetic tools, decreased mitochondrial CoQ levels, and induced insulin resistance. Conversely, genetic or pharmacological manipulations that lowered mitochondrial ceramide levels increased CoQ levels and protected against insulin resistance. Increased mitochondrial ceramides also led to a reduction in several OXPHOS components, hindering mitochondrial respiration and elevating mitochondrial ROS in vitro. This was further supported in human skeletal muscle, where we observed a strong association between insulin sensitivity, abundance of OXPHOS, and mitochondrial ceramides. We propose that increased mitochondrial ceramides cause a depletion in various OXPHOS components, leading to mitochondrial malfunction and deficiency in CoQ, resulting in increased ROS and insulin resistance. This provides a significant advance in our understanding of how ceramide causes mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Palmitate induces insulin resistance by increasing ceramides and lowering CoQ9 levels in L6 myotubes</title><p>Lipotoxicity plays a major role in insulin resistance and cardiometabolic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ertunc and Hotamisligil, 2016</xref>). Excess lipids accumulate in insulin target tissues, such as muscle, impairing insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, as well as other metabolic actions of insulin. For this reason, several in vitro models have been employed involving incubation of insulin-sensitive cell types with lipids such as palmitate to mimic lipotoxicity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hoehn et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we have used cell surface GLUT4-HA abundance as the main readout of insulin response. As shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), incubation of L6 myotubes with palmitate (150 Î¼M for 16 hr) reduced the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface by ~30%, consistent with impaired insulin action. Despite this marked defect in GLUT4 translocation, we did not observe any defect in proximal insulin signaling as measured by phosphorylation of Akt or TBC1D4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> â 100 nM insulin; 20 min). Previous studies linking ceramides to defective insulin signaling have utilized the short-chain ceramide analog (C2-ceramide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Summers et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schubert et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Powell et al., 2003</xref>). Intriguingly, we were able to replicate that C2-ceramide inhibited both GLUT4 translocation and Akt phosphorylation in L6 myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâD</xref>). One possibility is that palmitate induces insulin resistance in L6 myotubes via a ceramide-independent pathway. However, this is unlikely as palmitate-induced insulin resistance was prevented by the ceramide biosynthesis inhibitor myriocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and we observed a specific increase in C16-ceramide levels in L6 cells following incubation with palmitate, which was also prevented by myriocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Based on these data, we surmise that C2-ceramide does not faithfully recapitulate physiological insulin resistance, in contrast to that seen with incubation with palmitate.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Palmitate increases ceramides, decreases coenzyme Q (CoQ), and induces insulin resistance in L6 myotubes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation in L6-HA-GLUT4 myotubes exposed to palmitate (150 Î¼M for 16 hr, Palm) or BSA (Control) in the presence of DMSO (Control), myriocin (10 Î¼M for 16 hr), or CoQ9 (10 Î¼M for 16 hr).

To test if CoQ supplementation reversed palmitate-induced insulin resistance, L6 myotubes were co-treated with palmitate plus CoQ9. Addition of CoQ9 had no effect on control cells but overcame insulin resistance in palmitate-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, the protective effect of CoQ9 appears to be downstream of ceramide accumulation, as it had no impact on palmitate-induced ceramide accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Strikingly, both myriocin and CoQ9 reversed insulin resistance, suggesting that there might be an interaction between ceramides and CoQ in the induction of insulin resistance with palmitate in these cells. Moreover, we have previously shown that mitochondrial CoQ is a key determinant of insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fazakerley et al., 2018a</xref>), suggesting that ceramides and CoQ may interact in mitochondria. To explore this link, we next examined the effect of palmitate on mitochondrial CoQ levels. As shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), palmitate lowered mitochondrial CoQ9 abundance by ~40%, and this was prevented with myriocin. To test whether CoQ depletion is downstream of ceramide accumulation, we exposed GLUT4-HA-L6 myotubes to 4-nitrobenzoic acid (4NB) to competitively inhibit 4-hydroxybenzoate:prolyprenyl transferase (Coq2), a limiting step in CoQ9 synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Forsman et al., 2010</xref>). 4NB (2.5 mM for 16 hr) decreased mitochondrial CoQ9 to a similar extent as observed in palmitate-treated myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and generated insulin resistance in GLUT4-HA-L6 myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Notably, 4NB-mediated insulin resistance was prevented by provision of CoQ9, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fazakerley et al., 2018a</xref>). Interestingly, total ceramide abundance was increased in 4NB-treated cells, albeit to a lesser extent than observed with palmitate, without affecting other lipid species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). One possibility is that CoQ directly controls ceramide turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">FernÃ¡ndez-Ayala et al., 2000</xref>). An alternate possibility is that CoQ inside mitochondria is necessary for fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frerman, 1988</xref>) and CoQ depletion triggers lipid overload in the cytoplasm promoting ceramide production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koves et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, increased fatty acid oxidation is protective against insulin resistance in several model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bruce et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">SebastiÃ¡n et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Perdomo et al., 2004</xref>). Future studies are required to determine how CoQ depletion promotes Cer accumulation. Regardless, these data indicate that ceramide and CoQ have a central role in regulating cellular insulin sensitivity.</p><p>Since palmitate treatment can have a number of effects beyond ceramides, we next attempted to increase intracellular ceramides by inhibiting the ceramide degradation pathway. We exposed L6 myotubes to different concentrations of Saclac, an inhibitor of acid ceramidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kao et al., 2019</xref>), for 24 hr. Saclac increases ceramides in L6 cells in a dose-dependent fashion, with the largest effect on C16:0 ceramides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Interestingly, Saclac also promoted accumulation of DAGs, sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P), and sphingosine (SPH), demonstrating the tight interaction between these lipid species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B, C, and E</xref>). Consistent with a role of ceramide in insulin sensitivity, Saclac (10 Î¼M for 24 hr) reduced insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation by 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, vs Control; p&lt;0.001), and this was prevented by myriocin or CoQ9 supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>).

Moreover, this was relatively specific to CoQ as we did not observe any change in mitochondrial mass with Saclac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1EâG</xref>), cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1H</xref>), or DAG abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1I</xref>).

We wanted to determine whether ceramide accumulation specifically in mitochondria is associated with altered CoQ levels and insulin resistance. To achieve this, we employed doxycycline-Tet-On-inducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das et al., 2016</xref>) overexpression of a mitochondrial-targeted sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 5 (mtSMPD5) in GLUT4-HA-L6 cells (GLUT4-HA-L6-mtSMPD5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). SMPD5 is a murine mitochondria-associated enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu et al., 2010</xref>) that hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to produce ceramides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bienias et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, overexpressing mtSMPD5 should specifically increase ceramides within mitochondria and avoid potential nonspecific effects associated with small-molecule inhibitors. As expected, doxycycline induced mitochondrial expression of mtSMPD5, as demonstrated by enrichment of SMPD5 in mitochondria isolated from L6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and this was associated with increased total mitochondrial ceramides to the same extent as observed with palmitate treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), with the largest increase in C16-ceramide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Importantly, mtSMPD5 overexpression did not affect ceramide abundance in the whole-cell lysate nor other lipid species inside mitochondria such as cardiolipin, cholesterol, and DAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A and DâJ</xref>). Intriguingly, mtSMD5 did not affect sphingomyelin levels in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1G</xref>), consistent with exchange between mitochondrial and extra-mitochondrial sphingomyelin pools to compensate for the degradation induced by SMPD5 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feng et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, mtSMPD5 was sufficient to promote insulin resistance in response to submaximal and maximal insulin doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, mtSMPD5 overexpression promoted insulin resistance without affecting Akt phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2FâH</xref>), and no differences in total GLUT4 levels were observed across the treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). We next explored if mitochondrial ceramide-induced insulin resistance was mediated by lowering CoQ within mitochondria. In line with our previous results, mitochondrial CoQ levels were depleted in both palmitate-treated and mtSMPD5-overexpressing cells without any additive effects. This suggests that these strategies to increase ceramides share a common mechanism for inducing CoQ depletion in L6 myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Importantly, CoQ9 supplementation prevented both palmitate- and mtSMPD5-induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), suggesting that CoQ depletion is an essential mediator of insulin resistance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mitochondrial overexpression of SMPD5 induces insulin resistance by lowering CoQ9 in L6 myotubes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of doxycycline-inducible overexpression of mitochondrial-targeted sphingomyelinase 5 (SMPD5).

Using the doxycycline-Tet-On-inducible system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das et al., 2016</xref>), we overexpressed a mitochondrial-targeted acid ceramidase 1 (mtASAH1) in GLUT4-HA-L6 cells (GLUT4-HA-L6-mtASAH1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). ASAH1 degrades ceramides to fatty acid and sphingosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 1999</xref>). Hence, mitochondrial overexpression of ASAH1 was expected to selectively lower ceramides inside mitochondria. Doxycycline increased the abundance of mtASAH1 in the mitochondrial fraction, demonstrating the correct localization of this construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, mtASAH1 induction prevented palmitate-induced mitochondrial ceramide accumulation (total levels and 18:1\16:0 ceramides) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that the enzyme was functioning as expected. Similar to our observations with mtSMD5 overexpression, mtASAH1 did not alter ceramide abundance in the whole-cell lysate or mitochondrial sphingomyelin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A and F</xref>). Notably, mtASAH1 overexpression protected cells from palmitate-induced insulin resistance without affecting basal insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Similar results were observed using insulin-induced glycogen synthesis as an orthologous technique for GLUT4 translocation. These results provide additional evidence highlighting the role of dysfunctional mitochondria in muscle cell glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1K</xref>). Importantly, mtASAH1 overexpression did not rescue insulin sensitivity in cells depleted of CoQ (2.5 mM 4NB for 24 hr), supporting the notion that mitochondrial ceramides are upstream of CoQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Finally, mtASAH1 overexpression increased CoQ levels. In both control and mtASAH1 cells, palmitate induced a depletion of CoQ; however, the levels in palmitate-treated mtASAH1 cells remained similar to control untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). This suggests that the absolute concentration of CoQ is crucial for insulin sensitivity, rather than the relative depletion compared to basal conditions, thus supporting the causal role of mitochondrial ceramide accumulation in reducing CoQ levels in insulin resistance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Mitochondrial overexpression of ASAH1 protects against insulin resistance and increases coenzyme Q (CoQ) levels in L6 myotubes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of doxycycline-inducible overexpression of mitochondrial-targeted acid ceramidase 1 (ASAH1).

Sixty proteins were decreased at 72 hr, and of these 47% were functionally annotated as components of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS; rank 1, 28/135 proteins). Within OXPHOS, we observed a significant depletion of the electron transport chain components (ETC). The ETC is composed of several complexes (complexes IâV, CIâCV). In this dataset, CI (14/15 decreased), CIII (5/6 decreased), and CIV (13/13 decreased) but not CII (0/3 decreased) or CV (3/15 decreased) were depleted after mtSMPD5 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Despite the bulk downregulation of CI, III, and IV, the assembly machinery associated with each complex was either upregulated or unchanged after mtSMPD5 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>), suggesting that mitochondrial ceramides somehow alter ETC stability.

To test this, we evaluated several aspects of mitochondrial function upon mtSMPD5 overexpression. Mitochondrial respiration is broadly considered to be the best measure for describing mitochondrial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diaz-Vegas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brand and Nicholls, 2011</xref>). Respiration was assessed in intact mtSMPD5-L6 myotubes treated with CoQ9 by Seahorse extracellular flux analysis. mtSMPD5 overexpression decreased basal and ATP-linked mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâC</xref>), as well as maximal, proton-leak and non-mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, D, E, and F</xref>), suggesting that mitochondrial ceramides induce a generalized attenuation in mitochondrial function. Notably, we did not observe evidence of energy deficiency in our model (data not shown). Interestingly, CoQ9 supplementation partially recovered basal and ATP-linked mitochondrial respiration, suggesting that part of the mitochondrial defects are induced by CoQ9 depletion. The attenuation in mitochondrial respiration is consistent with a depletion of the ETC subunits observed in our proteomic dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Since mitochondrial respiratory activity is limited by several factors, including nutrient supply, bioenergetic demands, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Krycer et al., 2020</xref>), we tested whether the ETC generally or a specific respiratory complex was affected by mtSMPD5 overexpression. We measured the activity of the respiratory chain by providing substrates for each respiratory chain complex to permeabilized cells and analyzed oxygen consumption. mtSMPD5-overexpressing cells exhibited attenuated mitochondrial respiration irrespective of the substrate provided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5GâL</xref>), supporting the notion that mitochondrial ceramides induce a generalized defect in mitochondrial respiration. In line with defective mitochondrial function, cells with mtSMPD5 overexpression also exhibited increased oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>) measured by the redox-sensitive dye MitoSOX. Interestingly, no difference in mitochondrial membrane potential was observed across conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>).

In skeletal muscle, mitochondrial ceramides have been linked to insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Perreault et al., 2018</xref>); however, to date, no direct link connecting mitochondrial ceramides with insulin resistance has been established. Furthermore, CoQ depletion and defective mitochondria have also been independently associated with insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fazakerley et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Holland and Summers, 2008</xref>). In the current study, we present evidence suggesting that these factors are mechanistically linked inside mitochondria. Our data demonstrate that increased mitochondrial ceramides are both necessary and sufficient to induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. This is likely a function of increased ROS production that results from the specific depletion of the OXPHOS subunits and the concomitant loss of CoQ. Analysis of the human muscle mitochondrial proteome strongly supports mitochondrial ceramide-linked changes in the OXPHOS machinery as major drivers of insulin sensitivity. In this study, we mainly utilized L6 myotubes, which share many important characteristics with primary muscle fibers. Both types of cells exhibit high sensitivity to insulin and respond similarly to maximal doses of insulin, with GLUT4 translocation stimulated between 2 and 4 times over basal levels in response to 100 nM insulin (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">SÃ¡nchez-Aguilera et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rosales-Soto et al., 2020</xref>).

We observed that increased mitochondrial ceramides drive a depletion of mitochondrial CoQ leading to insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), and that reducing mitochondrial ceramide protects against the loss of CoQ and IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These findings align with our earlier observations demonstrating that mice exposed to HFHSD exhibit mitochondrial CoQ depletion in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fazakerley et al., 2018a</xref>). Given that CoQ supplementation is sufficient to overcome ceramide-induced IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), but a reduction in mitochondrial ceramide does not overcome a loss of CoQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), our data support a pathway whereby an increase in mitochondrial ceramides precedes loss of CoQ. Interestingly, inhibition of CoQ synthesis also increased ceramides, suggesting a bidirectionality to the ceramideâCoQ nexus. That said, this effect was modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and we cannot exclude off-target effects of the inhibitor. It is possible that CoQ directly controls ceramide turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">FernÃ¡ndez-Ayala et al., 2000</xref>) or alternatively that CoQ inside mitochondria is necessary for fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frerman, 1988</xref>) and CoQ depletion triggers lipid overload in the cytoplasm promoting ceramide production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koves et al., 2008</xref>). Further studies will be needed to determine how CoQ depletion promotes ceramide accumulation.</p><p>Our proteomics analysis revealed that the loss of CoQ parallels a loss of mitochondrial ETC complexes CI, CIII, and CIV. These are known to form supercomplexes or respirasomes, where ~25â35% of CoQ are localized in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">SchÃ¤gger and Pfeiffer, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calvo et al., 2020</xref>). This bulk downregulation of the respirasome induced by ceramides may lead to CoQ depletion. The observation that both palmitate and SMPD5 overexpression trigger CoQ depletion without additive effects supports the notion that ceramides may trigger the depletion of a specific CoQ9 pool localized within the IMM. Despite the significant impact of ceramide on mitochondrial respiration, we did not observe any indications of cell damage in any of the treatments, suggesting that our models are not explained by toxicity and increased cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2H and J</xref>). While the physiological role of respirasomes is still a subject of discussion, it has been suggested that they may enhance energy generation by optimizing electron flow while reducing production of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lapuente-Brun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Maranzana et al., 2013</xref>), and, therefore, their loss can be predicted to increase ROS generation. The two major mechanisms that might account for the loss of the respirasomes are decreased synthesis or increased degradation. Proteomics data suggests no deficiency in the OXPHOS biosynthetic machinery or assembly proteins and an increase in the machinery for protein import (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, the absence of mRNA downregulation in mtSMPD5-overexpressing cells strongly suggests that at least a portion of the observed protein depletion within CI is attributed to diminished protein stability. It therefore seems reasonable to speculate that the loss of these mitochondrial complexes is driven by increased degradation. Interestingly, pharmacological CIII inhibition leads to respirasome degradation via oxidative stress produced by reverse electron transfer (RET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">GuarÃ¡s et al., 2016</xref>). Since ceramides can directly inhibit CIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gudz et al., 1997</xref>), it is possible that a similar mechanism mediates the effect of ceramides on the respirasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that defective respirasome activity (e.g., induced by ceramides) triggers ROS, which over time depletes respirasome subunits and a stoichiometric CoQ depletion, leading to further ROS production as a consequence. Another possibility is that, because of its highly hydrophobic nature, ceramides impact membrane fluidity promoting a gel/fluid phase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pinto et al., 2011</xref>). These alterations in membrane fluidity could decrease respirasome stability. It is likely that bound lipids stabilize the interactions between the complexes in the respirasome and that this is impaired by ceramides. In fact, bound lipid molecules are observed in the structure of the porcine respirasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wu et al., 2016</xref>) and the isolated bovine CI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wu et al., 2016</xref>) but none of the lipids identified thus far directly bridge different complexes. In order to understand the role of lipids in stabilizing respirasomes and the role of ceramides in such stabilization, higher-resolution structures will be required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mileykovskaya and Dowhan, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The current studies pose a number of key unanswered questions. First, how does ceramide accumulate in mitochondria in insulin resistance? This could involve transfer from a different subcellular compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babiychuk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babiychuk et al., 2008</xref>) or in situ mitochondrial ceramide synthesis. Consistent with the latter, previous studies have suggested that various enzymes involved in ceramide metabolism are specifically found in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bionda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Novgorodov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birbes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">GarcÃ­a-Ruiz et al., 1997</xref>). Notably, CerS1-derived ceramide induces insulin resistance in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Turpin-Nolan et al., 2019</xref>). Although this enzyme has not been reported as a mitochondrial protein, it can be transferred from the endoplasmic reticulum surface to the mitochondria under cellular stress in metabolically active tissues such as muscle and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oleinik et al., 2019</xref>). This provides a potential mechanism where cellular stress, like nutrient overload, may induce transfer of CerS1 to mitochondria, increasing mitochondrial ceramide to trigger insulin resistance.</p><p>A further question is how ceramide regulates insulin sensitivity. We present evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction precedes insulin resistance. However, previous studies have failed to observe changes in mitochondrial morphology, respiration, or ETC components during early stages of insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diaz-Vegas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonnard et al., 2008</xref>). However, in many cases such studies fail to document changes in insulin-dependent glucose metabolism in the same tissue as was used for assessment of mitochondrial function. This is crucial because we and others do not observe impaired insulin action in all muscles from high-fat fed mice for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fazakerley et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hoehn et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, surrogate measures such as insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation may not accurately reflect tissue-specific insulin action as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. Thus, further work is required to clarify some of these inconsistencies. We observed that mitochondrial ceramides were associated with the loss of CoQ, increased production of mitochondrial ROS, and impaired mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fazakerley et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hoehn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fazakerley et al., 2018b</xref>). As discussed above, this is likely a direct result of respirasome depletion. The molecular linkage between ROS production and IR remains unknown. Early studies suggested that ceramides and ROS impaired canonical insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Summers et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schubert et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Powell et al., 2003</xref>); however, our current data do not support this, with the caveat that these were static signaling measures. One possibility is the release of a signaling molecule from the mitochondria that impairs insulin action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Picard and Shirihai, 2022</xref>). The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is an attractive candidate for this release since its activity is increased by mitochondrial ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zorov et al., 2014</xref>) and ceramides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Siskind et al., 2002</xref>). It has been shown that mPTP inhibition protects against insulin resistance in either palmitate- or ceramide-induced L6 myotubes and mice on an HFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Taddeo et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, mPTP deletion in the liver protects against liver steatosis and insulin resistance in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cho et al., 2017</xref>). Strikingly, CoQ is an antioxidant and also an inhibitor of mPTP, suggesting that part of the protective mechanism of CoQ may involve the mPTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Walter et al., 2000</xref>). Because CoQ can accumulate in various intracellular compartments, it is important to consider that its impact on insulin resistance might be due to its overall antioxidant properties rather than being limited to a mitochondrial effect. Excitingly, mtSMPD5 increased the abundance of mPTP-associated proteins, suggesting a role of this pore in ceramide-induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1I</xref>). It is also possible that ceramides generated within mitochondria in SMPD5 cells leak out from the mitochondria into other membranes (e.g., PM and GLUT4 vesicles) affecting other aspects of GLUT4 trafficking and insulin action. However, the observation that ASAH1 overexpression reversed IR without affecting whole-cell ceramides argues against this possibility.</p><p>Ultimately, the significant challenge for the field is the discovery of the unknown factor(s) released from mitochondria that cause insulin resistance, their molecular target(s), and the transduction mechanism(s).</p><p>The observations described above led us to speculate on whether there is a teleological reason for why these mitochondrial perturbations occur and why they drive insulin resistance. Under conditions of stress, nutrient incorporation into the cell needs to be adjusted to keep the balance between energy supply and utilization. In situations where the mitochondrial respirasome is depleted, the mitochondriaâs ability to oxidize nutrients can be easily overwhelmed without a corresponding reduction in nutrient uptake. In this scenario, insulin resistance may be a protective mechanism to prevent mitochondrial nutrient oversupply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hoehn et al., 2009</xref>). Beyond nutrient uptake, the respirasome depletion could also affect the ability of the mitochondria to switch between different energy substrates depending on fuel availability, named âmetabolic inflexibilityâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Galgani and FernÃ¡ndez-Verdejo, 2021</xref>); this mechanism may potentially play a role in the ectopic lipid accumulation seen in individuals with obesity, a condition linked with cardiometabolic disease.</p><p>In summary, our results provide evidence for the existence of a mechanism inside mitochondria connecting ceramides, mitochondrial respiratory complexes, CoQ, and mitochondrial dysfunction as part of a core pathway leading to insulin resistance. We identified that CoQ depletion links ceramides with insulin resistance and define the respirasome as a critical connection between ceramides and mitochondrial dysfunction. While many pieces of the puzzle remain to be solved, identifying the temporal link between ceramide, mitochondrial dysfunction, and CoQ in mitochondria is an important step forward in understanding insulin resistance and other human diseases affecting mitochondrial function.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Lead contact</title><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contacts, David James (David.james@sydney.edu.au) or James Burchfield (James.burchfield@sydney.edu.au).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Materials availability</title><p>This study generated two new molecular tools to overexpress mitochondria-targeted SMPD5 and ASAH1.

Cells were blocked with ice-cold 10% horse serum in PBS for 20 min, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 5 min on ice and 20 min at room temperature. PFA was quenched with 50 mM glycine in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. We measured the accessibility of the HA epitope to an anti-HA antibody (Covance, 16B12) for 1 hr at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with 20 mg/mL goat anti-mouse Alexa-488-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 45 min at room temperature. The determination of total HA-GLUT4 was performed in a separate set of cells following permeabilization with 0.01% saponin (w/v) and anti-HA staining (as above). Each experimental treatment group had its own total HA-GLUT4. A FLuostar Galaxy microplate reader (BMG LABTECH) was used to measure fluorescence (excitation 485 nm/emission 520 nm). Surface HA-GLUT4 was expressed as a fold over control insulin condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-11"><title>Induction of insulin resistance</title><p>To promote insulin resistance, cells were stimulated for 16 hr with 150 Î¼M palmitate-BSA or EtOH-BSA as control.

Mechanistically, however, how intracellular ceramide attenuates insulin action and reduces metabolism is not fully understood. It was suggested that insulin receptor (IR) signaling to PI3-K/AKT is inhibited by elevated intracellular ceramide. However, other studies failed to demonstrate an inhibitory effect of ceramide on PI3K/AKT. More recently, a study was published describing that intracellular localization of diacylglycerols and sphingolipids influences insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function in human skeletal muscle (PMID: 29415895). In the present study, Diaz-Vegas and colleagues used an in vitro system to investigate this topic further and better understand how intracellular ceramide accumulation causes cellular insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulations in cultured myocytes.</p><p>The authors applied multiple methods to achieve this goal. Among these procedures are:</p><p>1. The overexpression of enzymes involved in mitochondrial ceramide synthesis and degradation;</p><p>2. Treatments of myocytes with different pharmacological tools to validate their findings;</p><p>3. Mitochondrial proteomics and lipidomics analyses.</p><p>The effects of these experimental conditions and treatment on intracellular lipids contents, mitochondrial functions, and insulin signaling in myocytes were then evaluated.</p><p>Findings:</p><p>The author's findings indicate that incubation of myocytes with palmitate increases mitochondrial ceramide and reduces the insulin-stimulated GLUT4-HA translocation to the myocyte surface without affecting AKT activation. The elevation in mitochondrial ceramide lowers the coenzyme Q levels e depletes the electron transport chain (ETC) components, impairing mitochondrial respiration. Such mitochondrial dysfunction appears to attenuate the translocation of GLUT4-HA to the plasma membrane of the L6-myotubule. Also, mitochondrial proteomic analysis revealed an association of insulin sensitivity with mitochondrial ceramide and ETC expression levels in human muscle.</p><p>Based on these findings, the authors propose a mechanism whereby the building up of ceramide inside mitochondria depletes CoQ and compromises mitochondrial respiratory complexes, raising ROS. The resulting mitochondrial dysfunction causes insulin resistance in cultured myocytes. They postulate that CoQ depletion links ceramides with insulin resistance and define the respirasome as a critical connection between ceramides and mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p>Relevance and critiques:</p><p>This original study provides direct evidence that mitochondrial ceramide accumulation depletes CoQ and downregulates multiple ETC components in myocytes. Consequently, elevation in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial dysfunctions occur. The authors proposed that such mitochondrial dysregulation attenuates insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane of L6-myotubules. Moreover, mitochondrial ceramide accumulation does not affect insulin action on AKT activation.</p><p>Overall, this is a well-done study, showing that in obesity, elevated mitochondrial ceramide suppresses mitochondrial function and attenuates insulin action on glucose transporter GLUT4 translocation into the myocyte surface. The main conclusion is supported by the results presented. The study also applied multiple methods and described several experiments designed to test the author's central hypothesis.</p><p>Importantly, these new findings shed light on possible cellular mechanisms whereby ectopic fat deposition in skeletal muscle drives insulin resistance and metabolism dysregulation. The results demonstrating that alterations in mitochondrial ceramide are sufficient to attenuate insulin-stimulated GLUT4 trafficking in cultured myocytes are very interesting. Well-done.</p><p>Comments for further discussion and suggestions:</p><p>Although the author's results suggest that higher mitochondrial ceramide levels suppress cellular insulin sensitivity, they rely solely on a partial inhibition (i.e., 30%) of insulin-stimulated GLUT4-HA translocation in L6 myocytes. It would be critical to examine how much the increased mitochondrial ceramide would inhibit insulin-induced glucose uptake in myocytes using radiolabel deoxy-glucose.</p><p>Another important question to be addressed is whether glycogen synthesis is affected in myocytes under these experimental conditions. Results demonstrating reductions in insulin-stimulated glucose transport and glycogen synthesis in myocytes with dysfunctional mitochondria due to ceramide accumulation would further support the author's claim.</p><p>In addition, it would be critical to assess whether the increased mitochondrial ceramide and consequent lowering of energy levels affect all exocytic pathways in L6 myoblasts or just the GLUT4 trafficking. Is the secretory pathway also disrupted under these conditions?</p><p>Additional suggestions:</p><p>â¢ Figure 1: How does increased mitochondrial ceramide affect fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in L6-myocytes? As the accumulation of mitochondrial ceramide inhibits respirasome and mitochondrial activity in vitro, can reduced FAO in vivo, due to high mitochondrial ceramide, accounts for ectopic lipid deposition in skeletal muscle of obese subjects?</p><p>â¢ Figure 2: Although the authors show that mtSMPD5 overexpression does not affect ceramide abundance in whole cell lysate, it would be critical to examine the abundance of this lipid in other cellular membranes and organelles, particularly plasma membrane. What is the effect of mtSMPD5 overexpression on plasma membrane lipids composition? Does that affect GLUT4-containing vesicles fusion into the plasma membrane, possibly due to depletion of v-SNARE or tSNARE?</p><p>â¢ Figure 4: One critical piece of information missing is the effect (if any) of mitochondrial ceramide accumulation on the mRNAs encoding the ETC components affected by this lipid. Although the ETC protein's lower stability may account for the effect of increased ceramide, transcriptional inhibition can't be ruled out without checking the mRNA expression levels for these ETC components.</p><p>In the revised version of their study, the authors nicely addressed all concerns previously raised. The amount of work that went into the revisions is appreciated. All weak points have been properly addressed, and the manuscript has improved substantially.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87340.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary</p><p>The findings reported by Diaz-Vegas et al. extend those described in a previous paper from the same group establishing a role for mitochondrial CoQ depletion in the development of insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissue (Fazakerley, 2018). In this new report, investigators sought to determine whether CoQ depletion contributes to insulin resistance caused by palmitate exposure and/or intracellular ceramide accumulation. To this end, researchers employed a widely used in vitro model of insulin resistance wherein L6 myocytes develop impaired Glut4 translocation upon exposure to palmitate (in this case, 150 uM for 16 hours). This model was combined with a variety of pharmacologic and genetic manipulations aimed at augmenting or inhibiting CoQ biosynthesis and/or ceramide biosynthesis, specifically in mitochondria. This series of experiments produced a valuable and provocative body of evidence positioning CoQ depletion downstream of mitochondrial ceramide accumulation and necessary for both palmitate- and ceramide-induced insulin resistance in L6 myocytes. Investigators concluded that mitochondrial ceramides, CoQ depletion and respiratory dysfunction are part of a core pathway leading to insulin resistance.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The study provides exciting, first-time evidence linking palmitate-induced insulin resistance to ceramide accumulation within the mitochondria and subsequent depletion of CoQ. Ceramide accumulation specifically in mitochondria was found to be necessary and sufficient to cause insulin resistance in cultured L6 myocytes.</p><p>The in vitro experiments featured a set of mitochondrial-targeted genetic manipulations that permitted up/down-regulation of ceramide levels specifically in the mitochondrial compartment. Genetically induced mitochondrial ceramide accumulation led to CoQ depletion, which was accompanied by increased ROS production and diminution of ETC proteins and OXPHOS capacity and impaired insulin action, thereby establishing cause/effect.</p><p>Analysis of mitochondria isolated from human muscle biopsies obtained from individuals with disparate metabolic phenotypes revealed a positive correlation between complex I proteins and insulin sensitivity and a negative correlation with mitochondrial ceramide content. While it is likely that many factors contribute to these correlations, the results support the possibility that the ceramide/CoQ mechanism might be relevant to glucose control in humans.</p><p>Investigators were responsive to the reviewers' queries and critiques and performed additional experiments to bolster the interpretations and conclusions put forth in the manuscript. These included experiments to confirm that mito-targeted SMPD5 does not cause toxicity in L6 myocytes, and further studies using targeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses to investigate the impact of ceramide depletion on CoQ levels in mice fed a high-fat diet and treated with P053 (a selective inhibitor of CerS1). The results were consistent with the in vitro findings.</p><p>Overall, these important findings offer valuable new insights into mechanisms that connect ceramides to insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction, and could inform new therapeutic approaches towards improved glucose control.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>The mechanistic aspect of the work and conclusions put forth rely heavily on studies performed in cultured myocytes, which are highly glycolytic and generally viewed as an imperfect model for studying muscle metabolism and insulin action. Nonetheless, results from the cell culture model are generally convincing and align with the descriptive data from studies in animal models. Overall, the findings provide a strong rationale for moving this line of investigation into mouse gain/loss of function models.</p><p>One caveat of the approach taken is that exposure of cells to palmitate alone is not reflective of in vivo physiology. It would be interesting to know if similar effects on CoQ are observed when cells are exposed to a more physiological mixture of fatty acids that includes a high ratio of palmitate, but better mimics in vivo nutrition.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

acknowledge that in vitro models may not fully recapitulate the complexity of in vivo systems, we believe L6 myotubes are appropriate for studying the mechanisms underlying muscle metabolism and insulin action. L6 myotubes possess many important characteristics relevant to our research, including high insulin sensitivity and a similar mitochondrial respiration sensitivity compared to primary muscle fibres. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated the utility of L6 myotubes as a model for studying insulin sensitivity and metabolism, including our own previous work (PMID: 19805130, 31693893, 19915010) and work of others (PMID:12086937, 29486284, 15193147).</p><p>Importantly, our observations from the L6 myotube model are supported by in vivo data from both mice and humans. Chow (Figure 3J, K) and high-fat fed mice (new data - Supplementary Figure 4 H-I) demonstrated a reduction in mitochondrial Ceramide and an increase in CoQ9. Muscle biopsies from humans showed a strong negative correlation between mitochondrial C18:0 ceramide levels and insulin sensitivity (PMID: 29415895). Further, complex I and IV abundance was strongly correlated with both muscle insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial ceramide (CerC18:0) (Figure 6E, F). This is consistent with our observations in L6 myotubes (Figure 6H, I). These findings support the relevance of our in vitro results to in vivo muscle metabolism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Points from reviewer 1</bold></p><p>1.

L6-myotubes overexpressing the mitochondrial-targeted ASAH1 construct (as described in Fig. 3) were challenged with palmitate and insulin stimulated glycogen synthesis was measured using 14C radiolabeled glucose. As shown below, palmitate suppressed insulin-induced glycogen synthesis, which was effectively prevented by overexpression of ASAH1 (N = 5, * p&lt;0.05) supporting our previous observation using GLUT4 translocation as a readout of insulin sensitivity (Fig. 3).

In addition, it would be critical to assess whether the increased mitochondrial ceramide and consequent lowering of energy levels affect all exocytic pathways in L6 myoblasts or just the GLUT4 trafficking. Is the secretory pathway also disrupted under these conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This is an interesting point raised by the reviewer that is aimed at the next phase of this work, to identify how ceramide induced mitochondrial dysfunction drives insulin resistance. Looking at energy deficiency in more detail as well as general trafficking is part of ongoing work, but given the complexity of this question, it is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Points from reviewer 2</bold></p><p>1. The mechanistic aspect of the work and conclusions put forth rely heavily on studies performed in cultured myocytes, which are highly glycolytic and generally viewed as a poor model for studying muscle metabolism and insulin action. Nonetheless, the findings provide a strong rationale for moving this line of investigation into mouse gain/loss of function models.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We acknowledge that in vitro models may not fully mimic in vivo complexity as described above in the response to the âAssessment noteâ. We have now added to theDiscussion:</p><p>âIn this study, we mainly utilised L6-myotubes, which share many important characteristics with primary muscle fibres. Both types of cells exhibit high sensitivity to insulin and respond similarly to maximal doses of insulin, with GLUT4 translocation stimulated between 2 to 4 times over basal levels in response to 100 nM insulin (as shown in Fig. 1-4 and (46,47)). Additionally, mitochondrial respiration in L6-myotubes has a similar sensitivity to mitochondrial poisons, as observed in primary muscle fibres (as shown in Fig. 5 (48)). Finally, inhibiting ceramide production increases CoQ levels in both L6-myotubes and adult muscle tissue (as shown in Fig. 2-3). Therefore, L6-myotubes possess the necessary metabolic features to investigate the role of mitochondria in insulin resistance, and this relationship is likely applicable to primary muscle fibresâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. One caveat of the approach taken is that exposure of cells to palmitate alone is not reflective of in vivo physiology. It would be interesting to know if similar effects on CoQ are observed when cells are exposed to a more physiological mixture of fatty acids that includes a high ratio of palmitate, but better mimics in vivo nutrition.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We appreciate the reviewer's comment. Previously, we reported that mitochondrial CoQ depletion occurs in skeletal muscle after 14 and 42 days of HFHSD feeding, coinciding with the onset of insulin resistance (PMID: 29402381, see Author response image 1).</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87340-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>These data demonstrated that our in vitro model recapitulates the loss of CoQ in insulin resistance observed in muscle tissue in response to a more physiological mixture of fatty acids. Further, it has been reported that different fatty acids can induce insulin resistance via different mechanisms (PMID:20609972), which would complicate interpretation of the data. Saturated fatty acids such as palmitate increase ceramides in cell-lines and humans, but unsaturated FAs generally do not (PMID: 10446195,14592453,34704121). As such we conclude that palmitate is a cleaner model for studying the effects of ceramide on skeletal muscle function.</p><p>We have added to discussion:</p><p>ââ¦These findings align with our earlier observations demonstrating that mice exposed to HFHSD exhibit mitochondrial CoQ depletion in skeletal muscle (Fazakerley et al. 2018).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. While the utility of targeting SMPD5 to the mitochondria is appreciated, the results in Figure 5 suggest that this manoeuvre caused a rather severe form of mitochondrial dysfunction. This could be more representative of toxicity rather than pathophysiology. It would be helpful to know if these same effects are observed with other manipulations that lower CoQ to a similar degree. If not, the discrepancies should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: As the reviewer suggests many of these lipids can cause cell death (toxicity) if the dose is too high. We have previously found that low levels (0.15 mM) of palmitate were sufficient to trigger insulin resistance without any signs of toxicity (Hoehn, K, PNAS, 19805130). Using a similar approach, we show that mitochondrial membrane potential is maintained in SMPD5 overexpressing cells (Sup. Fig. 2J - and Author response image 2). Given that toxicity is associated with a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (eg., 50uM Saclac; RH panel), these data suggest SMPD5 overexpression is not causing overt toxicity.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87340-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Furthermore, we conducted an overrepresentation analysis of molecular processes within our proteomic data from SMPD5-overexpressing cells.

The following text has been added to the discussion:â...downregulation of the respirasome induced by ceramides may lead to CoQ depletion.Despite the significant impact of ceramide on mitochondrial respiration, we did not observe anyindications of cell damage in any of the treatments, suggesting that our models are not explained by toxicity and increased cell death (Sup.

The conclusions could be strengthened by more extensive studies in mice to assess the interplay between mitochondrial ceramides, CoQ depletion and ETC/mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of a standard diet versus HF diet-induced insulin resistance. Does P053 affect mitochondrial ceramide, ETC protein abundance, mitochondrial function, and muscle insulin sensitivity in the predicted directions?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree with the referee about the importance of performing in vivo studies to corroborate our in vitro data. We have now conducted extensive new studies in mice skeletal muscle using targeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses to investigate the impact of ceramide depletion in CoQ levels in HF-fed mice. Mice were exposed to a HF-fed diet with or without the administration of P053 (selective inhibitor of CerS1) for 5 weeks. As illustrated in Author response image 3, the administration of P053 led to a reduction in ceramide levels (left panel), increase in CoQ levels (middle panel) and a negative correlation between these molecules (right panel), which is consistent with our in vitro findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional suggestions:</p><p>1. Figure 1: How does increased mitochondrial ceramide affect fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in L6-myocytes? As the accumulation of mitochondrial ceramide inhibits respirasome and mitochondrial activity in vitro, can reduce FAO in vivo, due to high mitochondrial ceramide, accounts for ectopic lipid deposition in skeletal muscle of obese subjects?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this intriguing point. We would like to emphasise that Complex II activity is vital for fatty acid oxidation. As shown in Fig. 5H, our results indicate that specifically Complex II mediated respiration was diminished in cells with SMPD5 overexpression, suggesting that ceramides hinder the mitochondria's capability to oxidise lipids. We agree that this mechanism may potentially play a role in the ectopic lipid accumulation seen in individuals with obesity.</p><p>We have added the following text to discussion:</p><p>â...the mitochondria to switch between different energy substrates depending on fuel availability, named âmetabolic Inflexibilityâ...this mechanism may potentially play a role in the ectopic lipid accumulation seen in individuals with obesity, a condition linked with cardio-metabolic disease.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 2: Although the authors show that mtSMPD5 overexpression does not affect ceramide abundance in whole cell lysate, it would be critical to examine the abundance of this lipid in other cellular membranes and organelles, particularly plasma membrane. What is the effect of mtSMPD5 overexpression on plasma membrane lipids composition? Does that affect GLUT4-containing vesicles fusion into the plasma membrane, possibly due to depletion of v-SNARE or tSNARE?Response: While we acknowledge the importance of this point we strongly feel that measuring lipids in purified membranes has its limitations because it is impossible to purify specific membranes without contamination from other kinds of membranes. For example, we have done proteomics on purified plasma membranes from different cell types and we always observe considerable mitochondrial contamination with these membranes (e.g. PMID 21928809). This was the main factor that led us to use the mitochondrial targeting approach.</p></disp-quote><p>Nevertheless we do acknowledge that there is a possibility that ceramides that are produced in the mitochondria in SMPD5 cells could leak out of mitochondria into other membranes and this could influence other aspects of GLUT4 trafficking and insulin action. However, we believe that the studies using mito targeted ASAH mitigate against this problem. Thus, we have now included a statement in the revised manuscript as follows: âIt is also possible that ceramides generated within mitochondria in SMPD5 cells leak out from the mitochondria into other membranes (e.g. PM and Glut4 vesicles) affecting other aspects of Glut4 trafficking and insulin action. However, the observation that ASAH1 overexpression reversed IR without affecting whole cell ceramides argues against this possibility.â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 4: One critical piece of information missing is the effect (if any) of mitochondrial ceramide accumulation on the mRNAs encoding the ETC components affected by this lipid. Although the ETC protein's lower stability may account for the effect of increased ceramide, transcriptional inhibition can't be ruled out without checking the mRNA expression levels for these ETC components.Response: To address this point, we have quantified the mRNA abundance of nine complex I subunits that exhibit downregulation in our proteomic dataset subsequent to mtSMPD5 overexpression (as depicted in Figure 4G).</p></disp-quote><p>Induction of mtSMPD5 expression with doxycycline (Author response image 4 - Left hand panel) had no effect on the mRNA levels of the Complex I subunits (Author response image 4 - right hand panel).. This is consistent with our initial hypothesis that the reduction in electron transport chain (ETC) components, caused by heightened ceramide levels, primarily arises from alterations in protein stability rather than gene expression. While we acknowledge the possibility that certain subunits might be regulated at the transcriptional level, the absence of mRNA downregulation across our data strongly suggests that, at the very least, a portion of the observed protein depletion is attributed to diminished protein stability. We have incorporated this dataset into Supplementary Figure 6J and added the following text to the results:</p><fig id="sa3fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87340-sa3-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>âImportantly, CI downregulation was not associated with reduction in gene expression as shown in Sup.

Figure 3: The authors state that neither palmitate nor mtASAH1 overexpression affected insulin-dependent Akt phosphorylation.

They need to clarify this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have now analysed these data in a manner that preserves the control variance, consistent with the other figures in the manuscript and there is no significant change in Akt phosphorylation in ASAH over-expressing cells.</p><fig id="sa3fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87340-sa3-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The working model links ceramide-induced CoQ depletion to a reduction in ETC proteins and accompanying deficits in OxPhos capacity. The idea that mitochondrial dysfunction necessarily precedes and causes insulin resistance has been heavily debated for years because many animal and human studies have found no overt changes in ETC proteins and/or mitochondrial respiratory capacity during the early phases of insulin resistance. How do the investigators reconcile their work in the context of this controversy?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We acknowledge this controversy in our revised manuscript more clearly now as follows on page 21: âWe present evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction precedes insulin resistance. However, previous studies have failed to observe changes in mitochondrial morphology, respiration or ETC components during early stages of insulin resistance (72). However, in many cases such studies fail to document changes in insulin-dependent glucose metabolism in the same tissue as was used for assessment of mitochondrial function. This is crucial because we and others do not observe impaired insulin action in all muscles from high fat fed mice for example. In addition, surrogate measures such as insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation may not accurately reflect tissue specific insulin action as demonstrated in figure 1C. Thus, further work is required to clarify some of these inconsistencies''.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. While the utility of targeting SMPD5 to the mitochondria is appreciated, the results in Figure 5 suggest that this manoeuvre caused a rather severe form of mitochondrial dysfunction. Is this representative of pathophysiology or toxicity?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We believe we have addressed this in point 3 above (Principal comments, reviewer 1, point 3)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. How did this affect other mitochondrial lipids (e.g. cardiolipin)?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: As shown in the supplementary figure 3, SMPD5 overexpression did not affect other lipids species such as cardiolipin (D-J). We have added to results:</p><p>âImportantly, mtSMPD5 overexpression did not affect ceramide abundance in the whole cell lysate nor other lipid species inside mitochondria such as cardiolipin, cholesterol and DAGs (Sup. Fig. 3 A, D-J)â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Are these severe effects rescued by CoQ supplementation?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have performed additional experiments to address this point. As shown below, mitochondrial ceramide accumulation induced by palmitate was not reversed by CoQ supplementation, as demonstrated in Figure 1F. We have added to results:</p><p>âAddition of CoQ9 had no effect on control cells but overcame insulin resistance in palmitate treated cells (Fig. 1A). Notably, the protective effect of CoQ9 appears to be downstream of ceramide accumulation, as it had no impact on palmitate-induced ceramide accumulation (Fig. 1E-F). Strikingly, both myriocin and CoQ9â¦â</p><p>Additionally, we assessed mitochondrial respiration by using SeaHorse in cells with SMPD5 overexpression treated with or without CoQ supplementation. Our results, depicted below, indicate that CoQ supplementation reversed the ceramide-induced decrease in basal and ATP linked mitochondrial respiration. We have modified Fig.5.</p><fig id="sa3fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 8.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87340-sa3-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We have added to results:</p><p>âRespiration was assessed in intact mtSMPD5-L6 myotubes treated with CoQ9 by Seahorse extracellular flux analysis. mtSMPD5 overexpression decreased basal and ATP-linked mitochondrial respiration (Fig. 5 A, B &amp;C), as well as maximal, proton-leak and non-mitochondrial respiration (Fig. 5 A, D, E &amp; F) suggesting that mitochondrial ceramides induce a generalised attenuation in mitochondrial function. Interestingly, CoQ9 supplementation partially recovered basal and ATP-linked mitochondrial respiration, suggesting that part of the mitochondrial defects are induced by CoQ9 depletion. The attenuation in mitochondrial respiration is consistent with a depletion of the ETC subunits observed in our proteomic dataset (Fig. 4)...â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Are these same effects observed with other manipulations that lower CoQ to a similar degree?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: As mentioned in point 5 (additional suggestions from Reviewer 1), we conducted mitochondrial respiration measurements on HeLa cells treated with Saclac (2 ÂµM and 10 ÂµM) for 24 hours. Our findings showed no signs of mitochondrial respiratory impairments at low doses of Saclac in HeLa cells, despite observing CoQ depletion at this dose (Fig. Sup. 2C). We believe that this variation could be due to the varying sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration/ETC abundance to ceramide-induced CoQ depletion in different cell lines. Alternatively, it is possible that reduced mitochondrial respiration is a secondary event to other mitochondrial/cellular defects such as mitochondrial fragmentation or deficient nutrient transport inside mitochondria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The mitochondrial concentrations of CoQ required to maintain insulin sensitivity in L6 myocytes seem to vary from experiment to experiment. Is it the absolute concentration that matters and/or the change relative to a baseline condition?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This is an excellent observation. The findings indicate that the absolute concentration of CoQ is the determining factor for insulin sensitivity, rather than the relative depletion of CoQ compared to basal conditions. We have added to discussion:âFinally, mtASAH1 overexpression increased CoQ levels. In both control and mtASAH1 cells, palmitate induced a depletion of CoQ, however the levels in palmitate treated mtASAH1 cells remained similar to control untreated cells (Fig. 3I). This suggests that the absolute concentration of CoQ is crucial for insulin sensitivity, rather than the relative depletion compared to basal conditions, thus supporting the causal role of mitochondrial ceramide accumulation in reducing CoQ levels in insulin resistanceâ</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Considering that CoQ has been shown to have antioxidant properties, does the rescue observed after a 16 h treatment require the prolonged exposure, or alternatively, are similar effects observed during short-term exposures (~1-2 h), which might imply a different or additional mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This is an excellent point that we have long considered. The problem is how to address the question in a way that will be definitive and we are concerned that the experiment suggested by the referee will not generate definitive data. A major issue is that CoQ has low solubility and needs to reach the right compartment. As such if short term treatment (as suggested) does not rescue, it would be difficult to make any definite conclusions as this might just be because insufficient CoQ is delivered to mitochondria. Conversely, if short term treatment does rescue this could be either because CoQ does get into mitochondria and regulate ETC or because of its general antioxidant function. So, even if we observe a rescue after 1 hour of incubation with CoQ, it will not clarify whether this is due to the antioxidant effect or simply because 1 hour is adequate to boost mitoCoQ levels. Thus, in our view this experiment might not get us any closer to the answer. Nevertheless, we do feel this is an important point and we have added the following statement to our revised manuscript to acknowledge this: âBecause CoQ can accumulate in various intracellular compartments, it's important to consider that its impact on insulin resistance might be due to its overall antioxidant properties rather than being limited to a mitochondrial effectâ</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In Figure 1, CoQ depletion due to 4NB treatment resulted in increased ceramide levels. Could this be due to impaired palmitate oxidation leading to rerouting of intracellular palmitate to the ceramide pathway? This could be tested using stable isotope tracers.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have added the statement below to the manuscript to address this point. We feel that while an interesting experiment to perform it is somewhat outside of the major focus of this study.</p><p>âOne possibility is that CoQ directly controls ceramide turnover (35). An alternate possibility is that CoQ inside mitochondria is necessary for fatty acid oxidation (12) and CoQ depletion triggers lipid overload in the cytoplasm promoting ceramide production (36). Future studies are required to determine how CoQ depletion promotes Cer accumulation. Regardless, these data indicate that ceramide and CoQ have a central role in regulating cellular insulin sensitivity.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. To a similar point, it would be helpful to know if the C2 ceramide analog is sufficient to cause elevated mito-ceramide and/or CoQ depletion. If not, the results might imply mitochondrial uptake of palmitate is required.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We feel this point is analogous to Point 7 above in that this experiment is not definitive enough to make any clear conclusions as it may or may not work for many different reasons. For example, C2 ceramide may not work simply because it has the wrong chain length.Moreover, it is clear that C2 ceramide has effects that clearly differ from those observed with palmitate most notably the inhibitory effect on Akt signalling. For these reasons we do not agree with the logic of this experiment.</p><p>We have mentioned in the results section:</p><p>âBased on these data we surmise that C2-ceramide does not faithfully recapitulate physiological insulin resistance, in contrast to that seen with incubation with palmitateâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Likewise, does inhibition of CPT1 ameliorate or exacerbate palmitate-induced insulin resistance?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This experiment has been performed by a number of different labs. For instance, muscle specific CPT1 overexpression is protective against high fat diet induced insulin resistance in mice (Bruce C, PMID19073774), CPT1 overexpression protects L6E9 muscle cells from fatty acid-induced insulin resistance (Sebastian D, PMID17062841) and increased beta-oxidation in muscle cells enhances insulin stimulated glucose metabolism and is protective against lipid induced insulin resistance (Perdomo G, PMID15105415). We have now cited all of these studies in our revised manuscript in the discussion: âIn fact, increased fatty acid oxidation is protective against insulin resistance in several model organisms (37â39)â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Does the addition of palmitate to the cells treated with mtSMPD5 further reduce CoQ9 (Figure 2I and 2J)?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This intriguing observation, as highlighted by the referee, has prompted us to conduct additional experiments to investigate the effects of palmitate and SMPD5 overexpression on Coenzyme Q (CoQ) levels in L6 myotubes. As demonstrated in the figures presented below, both palmitate and SMPD5 overexpression independently resulted in the depletion of CoQ9, with no observed additive effects suggesting that they shared a common pathway driving CoQ9 deficiency. One plausible hypothesis is that ceramides may trigger the depletion of a specific CoQ9 pool localised within the inner mitochondrial membrane, likely the pool associated with Complex I (CI) in the Electron Transport Chain (ETC). This hypothesis is supported by previous studies indicating that approximately ~25 - 35 % of CoQ binds to CI (PMID: 33722627) and our data demonstrating that ceramide induces a selective depletion of CI in L6 myotubes (Fig. 4).</p><p>We have added this result to Fig. 2I in the main section.</p><p>We have added to the result section:</p><p>âMitochondrial CoQ levels were depleted in both palmitate-treated and mtSMPD5-overexpressing cells without any additive effects.

Some of the cell-based experiments appear to be underpowered and therefore confidence in the interpretations might benefit from additional repeats. For example, in Figure 3i, it appears that palmitate still causes a substantial reduction of CoQ in the cells treated with mtASAH1, even though mito-ceramide levels are restored to baseline. Please specify if these and other results are representative of multiple cell culture experiments or a single experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa3fig9">Author response image 9</xref> All data were derived from a minimum of 3-4 independent experiments from at least two separate cultures of L6 cells.
