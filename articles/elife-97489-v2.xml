One excitatory input originates from layer 5 of primary motor cortex (M1<sub>L5</sub>), while another arises from the deep cerebellar nuclei (Cb). M1<sub>L5</sub> terminals distribute throughout the motor thalamus and overlap with GABAergic inputs from the basal ganglia output nuclei, the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). In contrast, it is thought that Cb and basal ganglia inputs are segregated. Therefore, we hypothesized that one potential function of the GABAergic inputs from basal ganglia is to selectively inhibit, or gate, excitatory signals from M1<sub>L5</sub> in the motor thalamus. Here, we tested this possibility and determined the circuit organization of mouse (both sexes) motor thalamus using an optogenetic strategy in acute slices. First, we demonstrated the presence of a feedforward transthalamic pathway from M1<sub>L5</sub> through motor thalamus. Importantly, we discovered that GABAergic inputs from the GPi and SNr converge onto single motor thalamic cells with excitatory synapses from M1<sub>L5</sub>. Separately, we also demonstrate that, perhaps unexpectedly, GABAergic GPi and SNr inputs converge with those from the Cb. We interpret these results to indicate that a role of the basal ganglia is to gate the thalamic transmission of M1<sub>L5</sub> and Cb information to cortex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motor thalamus</kwd><kwd>basal ganglia</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>convergence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS094184</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sherman</surname><given-names>S Murray</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A detailed physiological characterization of inputs to the motor thalamus adds nuance to the notion that information from the cerebellum and basal ganglia are segregated and provides a mechanism by which the basal ganglia can gate communication between cortical areas.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia work together to control motor behavior.

These transthalamic pathways appear to be organized in parallel with direct corticocortical connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Theyel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sherman and Guillery, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sherman and Guillery, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sherman, 2016</xref>) and share a common organization across sensory modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miller-Hansen and Sherman, 2022</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether transthalamic pathways also operate in the motor system.</p><p>There are two main GABAergic basal ganglia output nuclei that project to VA/VL: the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sommer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lanciego et al., 2012</xref>). The GPi is a main output of the BG to thalamus found in mammals, but its homolog in rodents is typically called the “entopeduncular nucleus.” To avoid confusion, our use of “GPi” refers to this, even though we work in mice. Given these GABAergic inputs to thalamus, an intriguing possibility is that the basal ganglia intersect excitatory pathways through motor thalamus, providing a substrate by which the basal ganglia can gate information flow to cortex. However, a prevalent notion is that cerebellar and basal ganglia inputs are functionally segregated in the motor thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosch-Bouju et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the traditional view of the basal ganglia projection to motor thalamus is that it is one step within the relatively closed cortical-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop. This notion suggests that direct L5 inputs to motor thalamus might innervate a subpopulation of motor thalamic relays that do not participate in this classical loop.</p><p>There are two main GABAergic basal ganglia output nuclei that project to VA/VL: the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sommer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lanciego et al., 2012</xref>).

First, we confirm the presence of a feedforward transthalamic pathway through the VA/VL segment of mouse motor thalamus. Second, we employed a dual opsin approach and determined that inhibitory afferents from the GPi and SNr to motor thalamus frequently converge on cells receiving excitatory driving inputs from L5 of motor cortex, demonstrating the transthalamic pathway may be gated by the basal ganglia. Finally, we also find functional convergence of inputs to VA/VL from the basal ganglia and cerebellar nuclei (Cb), suggesting these circuits are not wholly segregated. Taken together, our data highlight a role for the basal ganglia in gating the relay of driving excitatory inputs through motor thalamus, determining which information streams reach cortex at any one time.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A feedforward transthalamic pathway through mouse VA/VL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>)</title><p>Higher order sensory thalamic nuclei, like the posterior medial nucleus or pulvinar (also known as the lateral posterior nucleus in rodents), receive robust inputs from cortical L5 and a fraction of these constitute feedforward or feedback transthalamic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Theyel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mo and Sherman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miller-Hansen and Sherman, 2022</xref>). Physiological evidence in VM nucleus of the motor thalamic complex indicates cortico-thalamo-cortical interactions are mainly organized in reciprocal loops, demonstrating only a very limited feedforward transthalamic component from primary to secondary (i.e. anterolateral) motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we used optogenetics to investigate whether a feedforward transthalamic pathway existed in the VA/VL portion of the motor thalamus; i.e., whether excitatory inputs from L5 of primary motor cortex (M1<sub>L5</sub>) impinge on VA/VL relays that project to secondary motor cortex (M2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Specifically, we injected fluororuby into all layers of M2, recorded from retrogradely labeled (i.e. M2-projecting) neurons in VA/VL, and tested each for an M1<sub>L5</sub> input driven by Cre-dependent expression of ChR2 in Rbp4-Cre mice, which expresses Cre recombinase in L5 of cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).

This map corroborates previous findings using anterograde labeling in rodents in several ways. First, we find that the Cb afferents are robust throughout much of motor thalamus but particularly concentrated in the lateral portions of rostral VA/VL, as well as the medial and dorsomedial aspects of caudal VA/VL; Cb afferents also sparsely innervate the rostral VM. Further, we observe that the GPi projection to motor thalamus, at least in comparison to the Cb inputs, is more limited, concentrating in the middle of rostral VA/VL with a proscribed patch in the ventrolateral aspect of VA/VL. In contrast to both of these inputs, we find that the input from M1<sub>L5</sub> is diffuse throughout VA/VL, appearing as coursing axons in large swaths of the region, though terminals do concentrate in VM, ventral VA/VL, and the medial boundary of VA/VL. Rostral to the sections examined, there was little representation from any input, while in more caudal sections (beyond –1.1 AP), GPi terminals are virtually absent, M1<sub>L5</sub> terminals are found primarily in VM, and Cb terminals target ventral VPL and VL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the simultaneous labeling of all three inputs in the same animal(s) reveals a degree of overlap between inputs from GPi and Cb, particularly in the rostral VA/VL and ventrolateral VA/VL in more caudal (approximately –1.0 mm AP from bregma) sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Terminal zones from M1<sub>L5</sub> and Cb overlapped in central and ventral aspects of the VA/VL, while overlap is also likely in the more dorsal aspects where M1<sub>L5</sub> axons diffusely project (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Generally, Cb inputs overlapped with those from GPi laterally and dorsally, while M1<sub>L5</sub> inputs tended to overlap with GPi medially. A quantitative analysis of the convergence between each set of inputs demonstrates that approximately 10% of the M1<sub>L5</sub> and GPi input zones are overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Similarly, between 10% and 20% of the Cb and GPi terminals zones are overlapping between –0.8 and –1.0 AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>GABAergic inputs from GPi converge with glutamatergic inputs from both M1<sub>L5</sub> and Cb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>)</title><p>Having defined the regions of overlap between GPi and M1<sub>L5</sub>, we next tested whether these inputs converge onto single thalamic cells using acute slice physiology in Rbp4 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Our data for these experiments include 62 cells from 14 animals, though we focus on cells receiving at least one input (42/62 cells). We transduced GPi neurons with ChR2-GFP (or, in some animals, Dlx-ChR2 for inhibitory neuron selective expression) and transduced M1<sub>L5</sub> neurons with cre-dependent ChR2-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Since GPi outputs are GABAergic and M1<sub>L5</sub>, glutamatergic, we readily identified their evoked activity on postsynaptic neurons recorded in the motor thalamus using a low-chloride internal pipette solution (5 mM Cl<sup>-</sup> total) and clamping the cell at distinct holding potentials. Specifically, we recorded at a holding potential of –60 mV to accentuate excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) from M1<sub>L5</sub> and at –40 mV for inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) from GPi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To confirm that the inputs were in fact GABAergic or glutamatergic in a subset of recorded cells, we pharmacologically inhibited GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors or ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), respectively. In cells used for representative traces, bath application of gabazine was followed by a washout period to allow recovery of the GABA<sub>A</sub> response, after which DNQX was applied.

There are several potential reasons for the seeming sparsity of cells receiving the inputs of interest, particularly regarding M1<sub>L5</sub>. Several frontal and motor cortical areas project to the motor thalamus, concentrating in distinct subsections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosch-Bouju et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, by focusing our attention (i.e. injections) on M1, we substantially limited the number of thalamic relays potentially receiving an L5 input. Moreover, we targeted our recordings to the terminal overlap zones between any two sets of inputs. As revealed by our anatomical evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), large proportions of motor thalamus are segregated to a single input (e.g. Cb versus SNr), again limiting the connection probability of recorded cells.</p><p>Within the overlap zone, however, the proportion of cells we find with convergent inputs likely reflects an underestimate of the actual numbers, because there are several additional reasons for false negatives; i.e., failure to detect an existing input. For instance, not all projection neurons from basal ganglia or cortex are likely to be transfected with ChR2, especially since many L5 neurons do not express Cre in the Rbp4 mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris et al., 2014</xref>). Also, if topographic alignment is necessary to detect such convergence, it may not have been achieved in all cases. As mentioned above, the topography of cortical projections to motor thalamus may be particularly relevant. Given these caveats, absent a specific percentage, we conclude that a sizable, functionally relevant population of neurons within the overlap zones are gated.

In this study, we have used criteria from our recordings to identify the M1<sub>L5</sub> and Cb inputs to motor thalamus as driver.</p><p>While previous tracing studies in cats and monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rouiller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rouiller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kakei et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kultas-Ilinsky et al., 2003</xref>) showed that L5 of motor cortex projects with large terminals to the motor thalamus, which would indicate drivers, histological studies in monkeys and mice called into question whether large corticothalamic terminals existed in much of motor thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuramoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rovó et al., 2012</xref>). We found here that the M1<sub>L5</sub> inputs to all motor thalamic cells displayed driver characteristics; however, EPSC amplitudes of ChR2-evoked responses from M1<sub>L5</sub> were indeed smaller than those from Cb inputs, which often elicited action potentials (see below). One potential reason for this difference is the degree of convergence among L5 corticothalamic inputs, compared to the first-order pathway from Cb, onto motor thalamic neurons. That is, whereas the total input from Cb or L5 might be equally strong, that from a single cortical area might represent only part of the driving input.</p><p>Prior anatomical data also showed Cb terminals innervating motor thalamic regions co-innervated by the basal ganglia were diffuse and small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deniau et al., 1992</xref>), often characteristic of modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sherman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sherman and Guillery, 2009</xref>). However, we find that all Cb inputs to motor thalamic neurons are drivers, including a fraction of thalamic relays that exhibited smaller evoked EPSCs from Cb. These observations agree with a recent report characterizing Cb inputs across motor thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gornati et al., 2018</xref>), and are in line with the findings that driver synapses can occur from terminals of a wide range of sizes, including smaller ones that overlap with modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petrof and Sherman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prasad et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, while our analysis of synaptic terminal size confirmed sparser Cb innervation of the GPi overlap zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deniau et al., 1992</xref>), we were unable to detect a difference in bouton size between the GPi overlap and non-overlap zones. Collectively, all our data are consistent with Cb inputs being homogeneously drivers. We thus suggest that M1<sub>L5</sub> and Cb inputs to motor thalamus transmit relevant information to be relayed to cortex; though, we also recognize that the GABAergic inputs from GPi and/or SNr are capable of blocking these strong excitatory drives, making future functional studies critical.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Beyond the classical notion of a cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop for motor control</title><p>Our experiments reveal three related insights regarding the relationship between cortex, basal ganglia, and motor thalamus that have important functional implications. We speculate on these below.</p><p>First, the textbook view of the basal ganglia situates it within an information loop from cortex to basal ganglia to thalamus and back to cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kandel et al., 2020</xref>), though updates have been made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haber and Mcfarland, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lanciego et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldberg et al., 2013</xref>). However, our finding that basal ganglia inputs to motor thalamus impinge on relays receiving excitatory, driving input from either M1<sub>L5</sub> or Cb pathways suggests a previously untested function of the basal ganglia—to gate information flow through motor thalamus.</p><p>Motor and frontal cortices are a major source of inputs to, as well as primary targets of, motor thalamic relays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosch-Bouju et al., 2013</xref>). These thalamocortical connections can be reciprocal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosch-Bouju et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Collins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2018</xref>) or non-reciprocal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rouiller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McFarland and Haber, 2002</xref>). Indeed, here we directly demonstrate the presence of a feedforward transthalamic pathway from M1, through VA/VL, to M2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, in areas of the motor thalamus receiving convergent input from cortical L5 and basal ganglia, some fraction of which participates in transthalamic pathways, it is plausible that the basal ganglia can gate excitatory information between cortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). When basal ganglia outputs are active, specific thalamic relays involved in transthalamic information transfer are inhibited. Since cortical areas have both direct and transthalamic connections organized in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sherman and Guillery, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sherman, 2022</xref>), disconnecting the transthalamic excitatory stream allows only the direct, corticocortical pathway to persist. In contrast, when thalamic relays are disinhibited due to upstream inhibition of the GPi or SNr, transthalamic transmission flows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). This would also apply to reciprocal cortico-thalamo-cortical connections (i.e. cortico-thalamocortical loops), which are well represented in regions of motor thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we reason that a potential function of basal ganglia inputs to some fraction of motor thalamic relays is to gate L5 signals, and thereby affect communication between cortical areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Note that this offers a plausible and more detailed neuronal substrate for various ideas that the basal ganglia are involved in action selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Redgrave et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Redgrave et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gaidica et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fiore et al., 2021</xref>). However, we recognize additional experiments in intact animals are required to test this speculation.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The basal ganglia gate information flow between cortical regions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the circuit organization of motor thalamus with respect to cortex and basal ganglia, showing the direct (orange) and transthalamic (blue) pathways through motor thalamus. When basal ganglia projections (red) to motor thalamic relays are active, they potently inhibit (red filled motor thalamic cells) and thereby <italic>gate</italic> transthalamic information flow between cortical regions. In contrast, when basal ganglia inputs to motor thalamus are themselves inhibited (open fill motor thalamic cells), they allow transthalamic information flow between cortical regions, where it may encounter signals from the direct cortico-cortical pathways. Via this gating function, the basal ganglia can regulate which cortical areas are connected by only direct corticocortical pathways, only transthalamic pathways, both, or neither. Importantly, this regulation is dynamic, such that the pattern of connected areas can change over short time scales (see <italic>left,</italic> time T<sub>0</sub>, versus <italic>right,</italic> time T<sub>n</sub>).

That is, our data demonstrate that L5 of primary motor cortex (M1<sub>L5</sub>) drivers innervate cells receiving internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) inputs. Given this organization, M1<sub>L5</sub> neurons could simultaneously disinhibit (via the basal ganglia loop, black arrows) and drive (via the direct corticothalamic projection, blue arrow) motor thalamic relays.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97489-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Second, previous anatomical data suggest a near-complete segregation of inputs from the Cb and basal ganglia to the motor thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and DeVito, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deniau et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sakai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuramoto et al., 2011</xref>) and, while our experiments largely confirm this organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), we also demonstrate that these pathways in fact converge at the single cell level in a subset of motor thalamus. This finding extends prior transsynaptic labeling studies in non-human primates that highlighted an indirect interface between these systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoshi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bostan et al., 2010</xref>) by revealing a direct substrate for their interaction in mice. Interestingly, we find that anatomical overlap in VA/VL between the GPi and Cb inputs is greater than those of SNr and Cb, whereas the overlap shows the reverse for M1<sub>L5</sub> inputs, which overlap more with SNr than with GPi inputs. This suggests potential specialization in the gating functions served by the distinct basal ganglia inputs: perhaps SNr is specialized to gate cortical inputs, while GPi is specialized to gate those from Cb.</p><p>Third, our data advance understanding of basal ganglia function by demonstrating a direct projection from L5 of cortex, the starting point of the classical basal ganglia loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, left), to the endpoint of the loop—motor thalamic relays. In other words, some M1<sub>L5</sub> axonal branches bypass the basal ganglia entirely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, right), which extends previous neuroanatomical data across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mooney and Konishi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farries et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kita and Kita, 2012</xref>). The important aspect here is that absent this evidence, one might have concluded that M1<sub>L5</sub> innervates a discrete subset of motor thalamic relays that do not receive a basal ganglia input, thereby preserving the traditional cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop. Together with the findings that most, if not all, thalamic-projecting M1<sub>L5</sub> neurons branch to innervate the caudoputamen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Economo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>), the intriguing, albeit untested, possibility arises that a single M1<sub>L5</sub> corticofugal neuron can affect motor thalamic activity indirectly through the classical basal ganglia loop (which is disinhibitory) as well as through the direct projection (excitatory). Such an organization has been anticipated in songbirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldberg and Fee, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldberg et al., 2013</xref>). Still, the precise organization of these branches (i.e. whether an M1<sub>L5</sub> neuron can target an individual thalamic relay through both pathways) is unknown. Even more, how signals organized in this fashion ultimately contribute to motor function requires much further experimentation.</p><p>Clear next steps are: (1) to understand how motor thalamus integrates these various inputs is through causal behavioral experiments and (2) to investigate whether the inhibitory gating of transthalamic pathways occurs across higher order thalamic nuclei.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Chicago under protocol #72313.

Each channel, corresponding to either M1<sub>L5</sub> (blue), Cb (red), or GPi (green) for each animal, was analyzed separately. To average the fluorescence across animals in order to achieve a semi-quantitative assessment of terminal zones, the fluorescence values for each pixel within a rectangular region of interest (ROI) that encapsulated the motor thalamus (as well as the area immediately surrounding it) was extracted for each channel. Then, the background fluorescence value (a region of the tissue containing no terminal fluorescence) was subtracted from all pixels. The background-subtracted raw fluorescence values were then averaged across the three mice. An image of the ROI was then reconstructed from the raw fluorescence values by utilizing the ‘text image’ import function in Fiji. A binary mask of the pixels containing terminal fluorescence was generated by thresholding the image at two thresholds: 10% (more stringent) and 20% (less stringent) to generate the input maps for dense and sparse terminal labeling, respectively.

For instance, pixels that were positive for both GPi (green) and Cb (red) inputs were colored yellow (green + red = yellow). Pixels of each color within an ROI encompassing VA/VL of the motor thalamus (i.e. excluding VM) were then counted using the ‘color counter’ plugin in Fiji. The percentage of overlapping pixels was then normalized to the sum of pixels from both inputs (e.g. the number of GPi/Cb overlapped [yellow] pixels was divided by the sum of the number of GPi and Cb pixels).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript provides a detailed examination of the motor thalamus's synaptic architecture, highlighting the convergence of inputs from the motor cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia in a manner that deviates from previously accepted models of segregated input processing. Employing techniques such as anatomical tracing, optogenetics, and electrophysiology, the research uncovers a degree of interconnectivity within these synaptic networks that surpasses earlier understandings. The identification of driver-type synaptic properties from motor cortex and cerebellar inputs presents a compelling case for reevaluating the functional connectivity of the thalamus. Nonetheless, the absence of conclusive evidence for the coalescence of all three inputs on individual thalamic neurons suggests a need for cautious interpretation of the data and points to the necessity for further study.</p><p>For the manuscript to effectively convey its contributions and enhance its impact, the following revisions are essential:</p><p>1) Revised Interpretation of Synaptic Convergence: Amend the discussion of synaptic convergence to more accurately reflect the tentative nature of the findings. The manuscript should articulate that the results infer potential sites of convergence that merit additional research to establish definitively. An adjustment in the narrative might read: &quot;The data indicate potential sites within the motor thalamus where M1L5, Cb, and basal ganglia inputs might converge, setting a course for future inquiries to validate triple convergence.&quot;</p><p>2) Clarified Functional Implications: Restrain the presentation of the integrative roles posited for M1L5 and Cb inputs within the motor thalamus. The narrative should affirm that the hypothesized driver roles of these inputs, as suggested by synaptic characteristics, await empirical confirmation regarding their actual effects on thalamic output.</p><p>3) Addressing discrepancies and providing context: The manuscript should reconcile the differences between the anatomical and functional findings, specifically regarding the overlap of SNr and Cb inputs. It should also provide a clearer explanation for observed synaptic patterns, including a discussion on bouton sizes relative to driver and modulator synapses. This discussion should be placed within the context of existing literature to offer alternative explanations and a comprehensive view of the findings.</p><p>By addressing these points, the authors will enhance the manuscript's contribution to our understanding of the synaptic organization of the motor thalamus.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have undertaken a methodologically robust study integrating anatomical tracing, optogenetics, and electrophysiological recordings to explore the synaptic connectivity within the motor thalamus. However, there are several concerns that need to be addressed to strengthen the conclusions drawn from this research:</p><p>1. The current conclusions regarding the convergence of inputs from M1L5, Cb, and basal ganglia predominantly reflect findings from dual-area stimulation, and the manuscript asserts convergence onto the same motor thalamus neurons. The lack of electrophysiological evidence supporting triple convergence necessitates a more cautious interpretation. The authors are encouraged to revise the text to reflect that the data currently suggest potential sites of convergence and that these observations warrant further investigation. A revised statement might read, &quot;Our findings imply potential convergent sites within the motor thalamus for M1L5, Cb, and basal ganglia inputs; however, additional studies are required to definitively demonstrate triple convergence.&quot; The authors are best positioned to rephrase these sections to both accurately reflect the evidence and maintain the integrity of their findings.</p><p>2. While the manuscript challenges the notion of segregated cerebellar and basal ganglia inputs, the functional implications of this integration are not conclusively demonstrated. It is recommended that the authors review the sections discussing these implications and adjust the text to highlight the preliminary nature of this conceptual map, possibly presenting it as a hypothesis for subsequent research, for example, as a conceptual framework for understanding potential integrative functions within the motor thalamus.</p><p>3. The manuscript proposes that both M1L5 and Cb inputs serve as drivers within the motor thalamus, a claim inferred from synaptic properties. However, this study does not present functional evidence of the effects of these inputs on motor thalamic output. It would be prudent for the authors to clarify that while the synaptic analysis suggests driver-type properties, the actual functional impact requires further investigation. The authors may wish to refine the language in this section to clarify that these are indicative findings requiring further functional validation.</p><p>4. The manuscript would benefit from a broader discussion of the results, including alternative explanations for the observed synaptic patterns. The authors should consider incorporating a section that addresses possible differential interpretations of the data, thus providing a comprehensive view of the findings within the context of existing literature.</p><p>The authors are to be commended for their rigorous approach and the contribution this study makes to the field. Addressing these concerns will undoubtedly enhance the manuscript's impact and provide a clearer understanding of the motor thalamus's synaptic organization.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Please rephrase the following sentence to improve clarity:</p><p>Therefore, we investigated whether a feedforward transthalamic pathway existed in the VA/VL portion of the motor thalamus by probing for optogenetic responses from L5 of primary motor cortex (M1L5) in VA/VL relays projecting to secondary motor cortex (M2)</p><p>Line 79-80: corticothalamic should be replaced with thalamocortical:</p><p>Moreover, the traditional view of the basal ganglia projection to motor thalamus situates it within a cortical-basal ganglia-corticothalamic loop</p><p>Line 108:</p><p>Please specify that this mouse line is a layer 5 specific line.</p><p>Line 178: Typo; 10/62 should be replaced by 10/42 to match the reported percentage!</p><p>Line 208-215: Typo; Figure 4 should be replaced by Figure 5!</p><p>How do the authors explain the discrepancy between the findings of the anatomical (Figure 4) and functional (Figure 5) experiments in terms of the absence and presence of overlapping SNr and Cb inputs in VA/VL, respectively?

We have clarified the abstract to separate discussion of M1L5 and Cb convergence with the basal ganglia. In addition, we have added a similar language to that suggested in the first paragraph of the discussion to better frame that we are only focused on convergence of any two inputs (excitatory and inhibitory). Though we agree future study using alternative methods may be crucial to an understanding of Cb and M1<sub>L5</sub> convergence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Clarified Functional Implications: Restrain the presentation of the integrative roles posited for M1L5 and Cb inputs within the motor thalamus. The narrative should affirm that the hypothesized driver roles of these inputs, as suggested by synaptic characteristics, await empirical confirmation regarding their actual effects on thalamic output.</p></disp-quote><p>With respect, we feel that the interpretation we offer is not unreasonable, although based on the comments, we have softened them and make clearer that these are plausible conclusions and speculations based on the actual data. The driver classification of glutamatergic inputs to thalamus is well established in the literature, and where identified, represents the main source of information to be relayed to cortex (e.g., retinal input to the LGN). Furthermore, transthalamic relays are now an accepted feature of cortical organization, and considerable data points to L5 inputs being a driver input to these circuits. Thus, we argue, it is a reasonable suggestion that a GABAergic input (from GPi or SNr) to relay cells also receiving a L5 input can act to gate the transthalamic circuit involved. The same logic applies to Cb inputs being driver and converging with basal ganglia GABAergic inputs. Still, we recognize that the basal ganglia strongly suppress motor thalamic relays at baseline, and can thereby block strong excitatory signals from these driving inputs. We highlight this distinction in the Discussion (lines 360-362).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Addressing discrepancies and providing context: The manuscript should reconcile the differences between the anatomical and functional findings, specifically regarding the overlap of SNr and Cb inputs. It should also provide a clearer explanation for observed synaptic patterns, including a discussion on bouton sizes relative to driver and modulator synapses. This discussion should be placed within the context of existing literature to offer alternative explanations and a comprehensive view of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this apparent discrepancy between the anatomical and physiological data in the manuscript and have provided a brief explanation below as well (reviewer #2, point 7). Briefly, while the areas of dense terminal innervation of motor thalamus between Cb and SNr are very limited, there is sufficient overlap of sparse terminal fields to account for substantial functional convergence.</p><p>Further, we provide much more background on driver/modulator classification and terminal size significance in both the Results and Discussion sections (see lines 224-236; 327-334; 353-354).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have undertaken a methodologically robust study integrating anatomical tracing, optogenetics, and electrophysiological recordings to explore the synaptic connectivity within the motor thalamus.

We mean to say that the glutamatergic inputs from the Cb appeared to have a different abundance and terminal size depending on whether they were in the basal ganglia overlap zone or in the Cb-only region of motor thalamus. This is the notion from the from Deniau study, which was qualitative. However, we were imprecise in our original presentation. Deniau observed smaller Cb terminals in VM motor thalamus, whereas we focus here on VA/VL.
