exacerbated and persistent inflammation followed by fibrosis. The mechanisms that mediate the magnitude and duration of the inflammatory response and ensuing fibrosis after VML remain understudied, and as such, the development of regenerative therapies has been limited. To address this need, we profiled how lipid mediators, which are potent regulators of the immune response after injury, varied with VML injuries that heal or result in fibrosis. We observed that non-healing VML injuries displayed increased pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and a lack of pro-resolving lipid mediators. Treatment of VML with a pro-resolving lipid mediator synthesized from docosahexaenoic acid, called Maresin 1, ameliorated fibrosis through reduction of neutrophils and macrophages and enhanced recovery of muscle strength. These results expand our knowledge of the dysregulated immune response that develops after VML and identify a novel immuno-regenerative therapeutic modality in Maresin 1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>muscle stem cells</kwd><kwd>immune response</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>lipid mediator</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 AR069620</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilar</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000090</institution-id><institution>Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH2010336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilar</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000090</institution-id><institution>Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH2110491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilar</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>3M Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilar</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000965</institution-id><institution>American Federation for Aging Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilar</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2045977</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilar</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>D20AC0002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilar</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hevolution Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilar</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The treatment of injury from volumetric muscle loss with Maresin 1 reduces inflammation and fibrosis, driving improvements in the recovery of muscle strength.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The acute loss of a large volume of skeletal muscle, or volumetric muscle loss (VML), is a severe type of injury that results in extensive fibrosis and loss of muscle function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garg et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corona et al., 2015</xref>). Despite attempts to use regenerative medicine and tissue engineering approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greising et al., 2019</xref>), VML injuries typically result in sustained inflammation, supplantation of muscle tissue with excessive extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garg et al., 2015a</xref>), and muscle fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greising et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilar et al., 2018</xref>). The cellular and molecular drivers that recruit and program the fibrotic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larouche et al., 2018</xref>) after VML remain understudied. As such, regenerative therapies to restore muscle function after VML have found limited success.</p><p>VML results in incessant invasion and accumulation of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages that normally protect the wound from infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larouche et al., 2018</xref>). The mobilization and infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells are critical both for host defense and the nascent stages of tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tidball, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wosczyna and Rando, 2018</xref>). However, VML drives a dysregulated immune cascade, resulting in increased and prolonged inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larouche et al., 2023</xref>), inadequate removal of debris, adoption of a fibrotic, TGFβ1-secreting phenotype in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chowdary et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Larouche et al., 2022</xref>), and aberrant regenerative dynamics of tissue-resident stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Larouche et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stepien et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, the causative extracellular signaling factors that recruit and condition the pathological immune cell responses have been underexamined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tidball, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Novak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a new class of bioactive signaling factors derived from omega-3 or essential fatty acids called pro-resolving lipid mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Serhan, 2014</xref>) have been discovered to regulate the magnitude and duration of the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Serhan et al., 2008</xref>). These pro-resolving lipid mediators have been shown to restrain the infiltration of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malawista et al., 2008</xref>), augment macrophage polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schmid et al., 2016</xref>) and phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Serhan et al., 2012</xref>), and attenuate pro-inflammatory signaling molecules, such as eicosanoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Serhan and Chiang, 2013</xref>). The balance that develops after VML between classical inflammatory eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid (e.g., prostaglandins and leukotrienes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dennis and Norris, 2015</xref>) and pro-resolving lipid mediators such as resolvins, protectins, and maresins has not been evaluated. Moreover, how many of these lipid mediators contribute to recruitment of immune cell subtypes after VML and concomitant fibrosis requires further understanding.</p><p>Herein, we contrasted VML injuries that heal and restore muscle function with those that result in fibrosis and loss of muscle function. We used metabolipidomics analysis over a time course to assess the changes in the composition of bioactive signaling mediators for VML injuries that regenerate compared to those that result in fibrosis. For degenerative VML injuries, increased pro-inflammatory eicosanoids were detected when compared to VML injuries that heal and no detectable change in pro-resolving mediators. Exogenous administration of a docosahexaenoic acid-derived pro-resolving lipid mediator called Maresin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Serhan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marcon et al., 2013</xref>) after degenerative VML injury was observed to impact resolution trajectory by simultaneously attenuating macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, reducing fibrosis, and promoting muscle regeneration via enhancing muscle stem cell (MuSC) proliferation. These findings suggest pro-resolving lipid mediators can encourage healing of severe muscle trauma and alter the signaling environment to support MuSC-based regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Comparative analysis of VML injuries of varied sizes reveals variations in fibrosis and function</title><p>To establish a framework for understanding how variations in the inflammatory response drive fibrotic scarring and muscle degeneration after VML injury, we administered bilateral VML injuries to the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of adult C57BL/6J mice by delivering full-thickness 1-mm or 2-mm punch biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We extracted muscles at 7 and 14 d post injury (dpi) and observed increased collagen deposition in 2-mm defects when compared to 1-mm defects by Picrosirius red staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, n = 3–4 mice per condition, paired). To determine whether the increases in fibrosis with larger VML defects engendered reductions in maximal tetanic force, we compared 1-mm and 2-mm defects with uninjured muscle at 28 dpi. We found reductions in force output for 2-mm defects when compared to 1-mm and uninjured muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>, n = 6–8 mice per group, unpaired two-way ANOVA), which is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Larouche et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>). Summing these results shows that 2-mm punch biopsy defects to murine TA muscles (degenerative VML injuries) produce fibrotic supplantation and reductions in muscle function, while 1-mm punch biopsy defects (regenerative VML injuries) result in less fibrosis and functionally recover to the same level as uninjured tissues by 28 dpi.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>In vivo comparison of degenerative and regenerative volumetric muscle loss (VML) injuries.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of experiment, whereby young (3 mo) mice were administered 1-mm (administered to left leg) or 2-mm (administered to right leg) biopsy punches to their tibialis anterior muscle to create a VML injury.

We further investigated why stronger enhancements in muscle regeneration were not further enhanced given activation of cAMP and reductions in canonical Wnt by focusing on TGFβ1, which has been shown to attenuate MuSC fusion and becomes dysregulated after VML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Larouche et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Girardi et al., 2021</xref>). We tested whether changes in active TGFβ1 were derived with Maresin 1 treatment after VML using ELISA. We observed slight reductions in active TGFβ1 at 7 dpi in VML-injured muscles treated with Maresin 1 compared to those treated with vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>, n = 3–4 tissues from 3 to 4 mice, unpaired). Integrating these results supports the notion that Maresin 1 positively impacts MuSC proliferation through cAMP, but fusion of MuSCs and associated myofiber repair is not significantly enhanced in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing supports reductions in inflammatory cells and increases in myogenic cells as a result of Maresin 1 administration</title><p>To further probe the impact of Maresin 1 treatment post VML, we performed droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on viable mononucleated cells isolated from vehicle and Maresin 1-treated degenerative VML defects at 7 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, each condition represents a pool of four tissues from four mice).

Consistent with immunohistological stains and flow cytometry, we observed reductions in neutrophils and dendritic cells in addition to increases in endothelial cells and MuSCs for VML-injured tissues treated with Maresin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). MAST differential expression testing further revealed substantially different transcriptional landscapes within cell types across treatments, especially among immune (macrophages, neutrophils, T cells) and myogenic (myonuclei, MuSCs) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Differential gene expression in macrophages treated with Maresin 1 revealed downregulation of inflammatory signaling (<italic>Ly6c2, Hmox1, Ccl2</italic>) and genes associated with fibrosis (<italic>Thbs1, Tgfbi, Mmp9</italic>), consistent with our histological observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Among MuSCs, the predominant gene sets reduced with Maresin 1 treatment were inflammatory (Ccl4, Il1b), including several transcripts related to interferon signaling response (Cxcl10, Cxcl9). Upregulated markers in MuSCs included those associated with myogenic differentiation (Mymk, Myog, Ttn) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

Inadequate understanding of the drivers of these pathological outcomes has reduced the efficacy of many different types of regenerative therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greising et al., 2019</xref>), and, as such, VML repair remains an unmet clinical need. Herein, we established a critical threshold model for VML in murine TA muscles. Consistent with previous observations in an analogous model in the rectus femoris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Larouche et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>), VML defects below a critical size (1 mm) regenerate, while larger VML defects (2 mm) result in long-term increases in fibrosis and reductions in contractile force. Using this model of regenerative and degenerative VML, we performed metabolipidomics analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Markworth et al., 2021a</xref>) over a time course to understand signaling factors that contribute to the observed changes in fibrosis. We detected an imbalance of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids to pro-resolving lipid mediators in degenerative VML injuries, which correlates with our previous observations of sustained inflammation and persistent neutrophil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Larouche et al., 2022</xref>) and macrophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilar et al., 2018</xref>) presence following degenerative VML. To determine whether restoring this balance of pro-inflammatory to pro-resolving lipids impacts regenerative outcomes, we administered a synthetic pro-resolving mediator Maresin 1 to mice following a degenerative VML injury. Administration of Maresin 1 attenuated fibrosis, reduced neutrophil and macrophage abundance, increased MuSC activation, and partially restored muscle force compared to vehicle-treated controls. Summing these results extends our understanding of muscle fibrosis and how targeting extracellular lipids can alter cell dynamics to manipulate this pathological outcome toward muscle regeneration.</p><p>The magnitude and duration of the inflammatory response after muscle injury is a critical determinant of healthy regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tidball, 2017</xref>). After VML, the immune response becomes dysregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larouche et al., 2018</xref>) and contributes to fibrotic scarring. Eicosanoids are principal regulators of inflammation, and we detected increases in pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids such as LTB<sub>4</sub>, PGE<sub>2</sub>, and PGF<sub>2α</sub> as well as other eicosanoid metabolite pathways (5-HETE, 15-HETE) for degenerative VML through all timepoints measured. These results contrasted with detected pro-resolving lipid mediators (RvE3, 8-oxoRvD1, LXA<sub>4</sub>, RvD6, PD1, PDX, and MaR1) that did not vary significantly between regenerative and degenerative VML injuries. Given neutrophils and inflammatory macrophages have been demonstrated to produce pro-inflammatory mediators in injured muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giannakis et al., 2019</xref>), and we have previously shown persistence of neutrophils in degenerative VML for weeks after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Larouche et al., 2022</xref>), these results are consistent with increased and sustained inflammation. Our observations are distinct from muscle injuries with barium chloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schmid et al., 2016</xref>) or cardiotoxin injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giannakis et al., 2019</xref>), where inflammation subsides quickly after injury and pro-resolving lipid mediators increase in abundance. While we observed that pro-resolving lipid mediators are expressed in VML injuries, the level at which these factors are detected did not proportionally increase with injury severity and inflammation. These results suggest that while short bursts of inflammation and transient exposure to eicosanoids such COX-derived PGE<sub>2</sub> may be beneficial for muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bondesen et al., 2004</xref>), longer-term exposure to these signaling factors and concomitant immune dysregulation without balance from pro-resolving lipid mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dort et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Markworth et al., 2021b</xref>) as observed in degenerative VML are detrimental to muscle regeneration.</p><p>The role of macrophage polarization toward a regenerative phenotype in guiding repair outcomes has been well established and is a critical determinant of development and progression of fibrosis versus successful regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang and Zhou, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wynn and Vannella, 2016</xref>). Our results showing disproportional levels of pro-inflammatory to pro-resolving lipids following degenerative VML injury support that macrophages do not generate sufficient pro-resolving lipid mediators after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giannakis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Halade et al., 2018</xref>) and are inhibited from effective transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnold et al., 2007</xref>) toward a regenerative phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chazaud, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hymel et al., 2021</xref>). We recently demonstrated that the sustained inflammation post degenerative VML injury skews macrophage phenotype toward a fibrosis-promoting subtype (<italic>Spp1</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>Trem2</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>C1qc</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>Cd63</italic><sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larouche et al., 2023</xref>). This phenotype has also been observed in other fibrotic outcomes such as cirrhosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ramachandran et al., 2019</xref>) and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jaitin et al., 2019</xref>). Injection of Maresin 1, a 14S-dihydroxyl-containing pro-resolving lipid mediator that is synthesized from fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulnour et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2020</xref>), into degenerative VML-injured muscle reduced macrophage density and collagen deposition. Since fibrosis-promoting macrophages have recently been shown to be regulated by lipid metabolism, these results suggest that Maresin 1 treatment may restore lipid homeostasis and inhibit adoption of a macrophage pathological phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henderson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jung et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deczkowska et al., 2020</xref>). While a deeper understanding of how macrophage phenotype is manipulated by lipid concentration and type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sansbury et al., 2020</xref>) VML remains to be elucidated, our results suggest pro-resolving lipid mediators may have an important role in shaping signaling that promotes macrophage differentiation toward the fibrosis-promoting subtype.</p><p>Maresin 1 signaling is mediated in part via engagement of the LGR6 receptor, which is expressed on numerous stem and progenitor cells, including in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2021</xref>), kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Ineveld et al., 2021</xref>), and mammary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blaas et al., 2016</xref>), and enhances proliferation, migration, and differentiation. In line with this, we observed low but detectable <italic>Lgr6</italic> expression in primary quiescent MuSCs, with strong upregulation during activation suggesting Maresin 1 contributes to regenerative actions of MuSCs after injury by increasing proliferation. In line with this, culture of MuSCs with Maresin 1 resulted in increased proliferation and cAMP signaling. Given canonical Wnt signaling is also a downstream target of LGR6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otto et al., 2008</xref>), we evaluated whether canonical Wnt activity was altered with Maresin 1. We did not find a change in canonical Wnt signaling within MuSCs with treatment of Maresin 1 in vitro, but did observe a strong decrease in canonical Wnt signaling in vivo. This result was consistent with reductions in macrophages and muscle fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larouche et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Naito et al., 2012</xref>) that promote canonical Wnt signaling through Complement. Our findings indicate that repletion of Maresin 1 positively impacts MuSCs directly through engagement of LGR6 and indirectly via alterations from myeloid signaling. However, the regenerative actions of MuSCs are still restrained from fusion due to elevated TGFβ1. We also speculate that alterations in canonical Wnt signaling in MuSCs from Maresin 1 treatment may be derived through differences in their ability to adhere to the matrix, given that β-catenin interacts with multiple cadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berdeaux and Stewart, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yin et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, Maresin 1 treatment may impact other cell types that promote functional recovery such as vasculature, which have been shown to precede myogenesis after VML injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shcherbina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacobsen et al., 2023</xref>). In support of this, our scRNA-seq datasets showed increased recovery of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>).

After 72 hr, cells were either lysed in the plate for RT-qPCR validation of knockdown efficacy, or media was replaced with myoblast media containing EdU for proliferation analysis, or with differentiation media (DMEM containing 5% horse serum and antibiotics). EdU staining was performed after 24 hr in EdU according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Wnt signaling activation was assessed using cells isolated from P7Wnt mice. After 72 hr in differentiation media, cells were washed, stained with Hoechst 33342, and imaged on a Zeiss epifluorescent microscope using a ×20 objective. GFP mean fluorescent intensity among GFP+ DAPI+ cells was quantified using MATLAB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>In vitro P7Wnt mouse validation</title><p>MuSCs were isolated from P7Wnt mice via MACS and expanded in myoblast media.

Animals were euthanized as described above at 7-dpi. TA muscles were pooled from three mice according to treatment, then digested into single-cell suspensions as described above. Labeling with cell multiplexing oligos (CMOs) (10x Genomics) was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Demonstrated Protocol CG000391 Rev B, Protocol 3). Each treatment condition (vehicle and Maresin 1) was labeled with a separate CMO tag. Then equal cell numbers from each sample were pooled, stained with 7-AAD, and FACS-sorted to remove dead cells and debris. Post FACS, 8000 cells were loaded into the 10x Genomics chromium single-cell controller, and single cells were captured into nanoliter-scale gel bead-in-emulsions (GEMs). cDNAs were prepared using the single-cell 3′ protocol as per the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with 26 bases for read1 and 98 × 8 bases for read2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-2"><title>Data processing and analysis</title><p>10x CellRanger v7.0.0 software’s mkfastq and multi command were run with default parameters except expect-cells = 8000. HD5 files were imported into R v.4.2.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>) using the Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otto et al., 2008</xref>) v4.2 package, and genes expressed in less than 200 cells or cells expressing less than three genes were removed. Seurat objects were then merged. Normalization was performed and variable features were identified on each dataset separately prior to integration using Seurat v4. Linear dimensional reduction was performed using RunPCA, followed by FindNeighbors(dims = 1:30) and RunUMAP(32) (dims = 1:30). Clustering was performed using the Louvain unsupervised clustering algorithm at a resolution = 0.1. Cluster marker genes were determined using Seurat’s FindAllMarkers function (only.pos = T, logfc.threshold = 1) to annotate cell types. Differential gene expression across treatments within cell types was performed using MAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacobsen et al., 2023</xref>). Seurat, dittoSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>), EnhancedVolcano, and ggplot2 were used for data visualization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>In situ functional testing</title><p>These procedures are modified from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dellorusso et al., 2001</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of tribromoethanol (250 mg/kg) and supplemental injections given to maintain an adequate level of anesthesia during the procedure. Hindlimb fur was removed with animal clippers. The TA muscle was exposed by removing the overlying skin and outer fasciae. The distal TA tendon was isolated, and the distal half of the TA was freed from adjacent muscles by carefully cutting fasciae without damaging muscle fibers. A 4-0 silk suture was tied around the distal tendon, and the tendon was severed. The animal was then placed on a temperature-controlled platform warmed to maintain body temperature at 37°C. A 25-gauge needle was driven through the knee and immobilized to prevent the knee from moving. The tendon was tied securely to the lever arm of a servomotor via the suture ends (6650LR, Cambridge Technology). A continual drip of saline warmed to 37°C was administered to the TA muscle to maintain temperature. The TA muscle was initially stimulated with 0.2 ms pulses via the peroneal nerve using platinum electrodes. Stimulation voltage and muscle length were adjusted for maximum isometric twitch force (Pt). While held at optimal muscle length (Lo), the muscle was stimulated at increasing frequencies until a maximum force (Po) was reached, typically at 200 Hz, with a 1 min rest period between each tetanic contraction. Subsequently, the same procedure was repeated, but rather than activating the muscle via the peroneal nerve, a cuff electrode was placed around the muscle for stimulation. Muscle length was measured with calipers, based on well-defined anatomical landmarks near the knee and the ankle. Optimum fiber length (Lf) was determined by multiplying Lo by the TA Lf/Lo ratio of 0.6. After the evaluation of isometric force, the TA muscle was removed from the mouse. The tendon and suture were trimmed from the muscle, and the muscle was weighed. Total muscle fiber CSA of TA muscles was calculated by dividing muscle mass by the product of Lf and 1.06 mg/mm<sup>3</sup>, the density of mammalian skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mendez and Keys, 1960</xref>). Specific Po was calculated by dividing Po by CSA. Sample size was determined by power analysis of pilot experiments to achieve 80% power.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>TGFβ1 ELISA</title><p>Muscles were extracted at 7 dpi as described above and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at –80°C. Tissues were thawed in ice-cold PBS, weighed, minced, and homogenized with 30 passes of a Dounce homogenizer in 500 uL of RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher) with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher). Total protein was quantified using a Pierce BCA Assay kit (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Active TGFβ1 was quantified using the mouse TGF beta 1 DuoSet ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbances were measured on a Synergy Neo microplate reader.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>cAMP assay</title><p>Hindlimb muscles were extracted, weighed, and minced using sterile surgical tools.

Primary myoblasts were then cultured in Matrigel-coated 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher #165306), seeding 2500 cells per well (three wells per biological replicate). Cells were incubated with Maresin 1 (10 nM) or vehicle for 24 hr.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Steven Segal (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Both reviewers have responded positively to the novelty and value of your work and its new insights into the roles of lipid mediators in VML injuries. They consider your new data of good quality. They recognize its potential to guide the development of therapeutic interventions promoting tissue repair and recovery. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer (1) has the following general comments:</p><p>Certain aspects of the data are overinterpreted; while some measures appear to have an adequate sample size to make sound conclusions, other measures are likely to lack sufficient statistical power given their variability. Presentation of the results would be strengthened by adhering to consistent terminology and labeling of figures throughout; specific examples are identified in recommendations to the authors. Several of the images used to illustrate differences between treatments are unconvincing because differences are not readily.</p><p>Reviewer (2) raises the following specific issues that require addressing:</p><p>1) The authors use 1mm vs 2mm punch biopsies to create &quot;regenerative&quot; vs &quot;degenerative&quot; injuries in the mouse tibialis anterior muscle. In a key reference (25), the threshold for successful regeneration following a biopsy of the mouse quadriceps muscle was defined as 3 mm; below this value (e.g., 2 mm) regeneration was found to be successful. Does the size of the injury for effective regeneration vary with the size of the muscle?</p><p>2) The authors introduce &quot;dpi&quot; to denote days post-injury. However, this acronym is not used consistently either in the text, figures, or figure captions (see comment 9 below).</p><p>3) The difference between legs in the size of the defect is described in the caption of Figure 2 but the difference is illustrated in Figure 1. Recommend revising the caption to Figure 1 accordingly. The notation used at the top of panel B is inconsistent.</p><p>4) It is not clear when (dpi) some of the data in the figures were obtained. A good example is panels C, E, and F in Figure 3, where time points are given for other panels but not these. Recommend perusal and revision throughout the text and figures (captions) for consistency. It is also not clear why key variables were not measured at respective time points (e.g., collagen deposition at 28 dpi when force was evaluated).</p><p>5) It is not clear which colors represent EdU incorporation or Wnt expression in Figure 4; for those not familiar with respective techniques, it would be helpful to identify these details. A specific concern is that the images in panels B and D are not convincing with respect to illustrating clear differences between 0 and 10 nM Maresin 1 treatment in B, or between Control and Knockdown in D.</p><p>6) An additional concern exemplified by the data in Panels C and E of Figure 4 is the low sample size (n=3), particularly given the variability in the data. There is no mention of tests for statistical power in the manuscript. It is recommended that such tests be applied for each of the variables upon which conclusions are based and the sample size adjusted accordingly to strengthen the conclusions presented to the reader.</p><p>7) In Figure 5, the UMAP plots for Vehicle and Maresin 1 are indistinguishable, making it difficult for the reader to identify the differences indicated in the text. Further, the text describing these data on p.5 indicates that respective conditions represent a pool of 3 tissues from 3 mice. It is not clear how statistics can be performed by comparing one pooled sample vs another pooled sample. It would also be helpful to clarify the timepoint (dpi) for these data in the figure caption.</p><p>8) It is remarkable that what is presented as a statistically significant difference for endothelial cells in Figure 5B is not addressed in the text. A recent study in (10.1186/s13395-023-00313-3) points to angiogenesis (i.e., endothelial cell proliferation) as an integral component of regeneration following a punch biopsy injury.</p><p>9) Panel A in Supplemental Figure 2 is confusing. There are more colors for respective clusters than are indicated on the Y-axis. Per comment 2), there are two different formats used here to identify time points, neither of which is dpi. Recommend revising all figures, captions, and text to use dpi for consistency. It may be helpful to define uninjured as 0 dpi.</p><p>10) Text in the Discussion associated with &quot;at this timepoint&quot; (p.6, paragraph 1, line 18) is confusing. Clarify intent.</p><p>11) Text in the Discussion associated with &quot;did not vary significantly with larger injury sizes&quot; (p.6, paragraph 2, line 8) is confusing. Clarify intent.</p><p>12) In Supplemental Figure 1, Isometric Force is presented as &quot;Tetanus&quot; throughout the range of stimulation frequency in panels A and B. Clarify what is going on at lower frequencies and which values are used in panels C, D, and E. It would also be helpful to clarify why muscle force is evaluated as stimulating the nerve vs the muscle: what do these data tell us?</p><p>13) CD68 is a marker for monocytes as well as macrophages.</p><p>14) Throughout multiple comparisons in the figure panels, is it necessary to include the bars and notation where there are no significant differences (i.e., eliminate those for &quot;ns&quot;).</p><p>Reviewer 2 has the following overall critiques:</p><p>Despite the strengths of the study, some limitations are identified. Specifically, the impact of maresin 1 on macrophage phenotypes (M1/M2) could have been explored in more detail using histological or protein expression analysis. Moreover, additional data are needed to substantiate the claims about increased muscle regeneration. Lastly, the study does not address myofiber innervation, myofiber-type transitions, or motor unit remodeling.</p><p>Reviewer 2 raises the following specific issues for addressing:</p><p>The study also has some weaknesses that should be addressed prior to publication. The manuscript should be revised based on the following comments.</p><p>1. Please normalize the measured isometric torque by either dividing it by the weight of the TA muscle or the animal's body weight. This normalization is important because the torque value can vary with body mass, and normalizing the data to body mass will allow for more accurate comparisons between the experimental groups.</p><p>2. Can you provide the measurements of the biopsy mass that was removed to induce VML injury in each experimental group? This information is crucial for the reproducibility of the VML injury model and to enable comparison of the severity of the resulting injury.</p><p>3. The number of mice used for each experimental group is not mentioned in the methods section. Please mention the number of mice used for each group at each time point. Please also indicate if the injuries were unilateral or bilateral.</p><p>4. The reporting of sample sizes is not consistent. For instance, in Figure 1, it is n=4-5 per group, but in figure 2, it is n=5 mice per injury type and timepoint, and in Figure 4, it is n = 3-4 tissues per condition. Please edit for consistency. Is n=3 mice the same as n=3 tissues?</p><p>5. There are a few issues with the reporting of results that need to be addressed. Firstly, in the caption of figure 3F, the sample size is listed as n=7 mice per group, while in the Results section, a range of 7-11 mice per group is mentioned. This discrepancy needs to be reconciled to ensure accurate reporting of the sample size used in the study.</p><p>6. Secondly, there is some confusion regarding the statistical significance of the results. While the caption of figure 3F suggests a trend (implying p&lt;0.1) for larger eMHC+ myofibers with Maresin 1 treatment, the graph shows an asterisk symbol suggesting p&lt;0.05. It is recommended to double-check the data set to clarify the level of significance and ensure consistency in reporting.</p><p>7. Additionally, based on supplementary figure 3, it appears that there are more eMHC+ myofibers in the control group. Therefore, total counts for the eMHC+ myofibers in the entire section should be provided to better understand the distribution of these fibers among the groups.</p><p>8. Evidence for enhanced in vivo myogenesis is scarce, and eMHC+ myofiber data has inconsistencies in presentation (as mentioned above). Please provide additional data (e.g., percentage of myofibers with displaced nuclei, myofiber counts/cross-sectional area, protein expression of MRFs, increased Pax7+ satellite cell quantity) to better support the claim that maresin 1 is improving myogenesis.</p><p>9. Based on the evidence provided, it appears that maresin 1 is suppressing inflammation and fibrosis, which may be sparing more myofibers from undergoing necrosis in the surrounding musculature. Please discuss this possibility in the manuscript.</p><p>10. Figure 5 presents CD86, IL-1 β, CCR7 etc. as M2 macrophage associated markers, which is incorrect. These markers are indicative of M1 phenotype. Which specific markers were used to indicate the M2 phenotype?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors use 1mm vs 2mm punch biopsies to create &quot;regenerative&quot; vs &quot;degenerative&quot; injuries in the mouse tibialis anterior muscle.

First, we repeated experiments on the canonical Wnt fluorescent reporter in MuSCs (Pax7<sup>CreERT2</sup> – Rosa26<sup>-Tcf/Lef-LSL-H2B-GFP</sup>), as well as performed additional experiments to understand how changes in canonical Wnt signaling are enacted in MuSCs with Maresin 1 treatment. First, we found that treatment of MuSCs with Maresin 1 did not change β catenin levels (new Figure 4D), suggesting that the enhancements in proliferation were not mediated through this signaling pathway. This result is consistent with previous observations that Maresin 1 did not significantly stimulate canonical Wnt in mesenchymal stem cells (Khedgikar et al., Bone 2022 or reference #33). We additionally performed culture of MuSCs that harbor the canonical Wnt fluorescent reporter with or without Wnt3a (a canonical Wnt ligand) and detected increases in the % of GFP+ MuSCs (new Supplemental Figure 5B). Power analyses were performed using data from pilot experiments and sample sizes were set such that a power of 80% was achieved. This is included at the end of the methods subsections for each experiment. The results show that the increase in proliferation of MuSCs by Maresin 1 is not mediated by canonical Wnt but through cyclic AMP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 5, the UMAP plots for Vehicle and Maresin 1 are indistinguishable, making it difficult for the reader to identify the differences indicated in the text. Further, the text describing these data on p.5 indicates that respective conditions represent a pool of 3 tissues from 3 mice. It is not clear how statistics can be performed by comparing one pooled sample vs another pooled sample. It would also be helpful to clarify the timepoint (dpi) for these data in the figure caption.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. We have rearranged the figure to enhance the clarity between treatments and added a notation for the day the samples were isolated. To increase the number of cells sequenced, sample pooling was needed. We have also added an additional sequencing replicate from each condition and increased the number of cells sequenced to enhance our statistical analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It is remarkable that what is presented as a statistically significant difference for endothelial cells in Figure 5B is not addressed in the text. A recent study in (10.1186/s13395-023-00313-3) points to angiogenesis (i.e., endothelial cell proliferation) as an integral component of regeneration following a punch biopsy injury.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree on the importance of angiogenesis and the potential link that our findings might be pointing to. Although specific experiments are needed to further support this claim, which are beyond the scope of this manuscript, we have included the suggested reference and added several lines of interpretation into the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Panel A in Supplemental Figure 2 is confusing. There are more colors for respective clusters than are indicated on the Y-axis. Per comment 2), there are two different formats used here to identify time points, neither of which is dpi. Recommend revising all figures, captions, and text to use dpi for consistency. It may be helpful to define uninjured as 0 dpi.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. The colors of the plots in Supplemental Figure 2A are the same as the colors corresponding to the clusters indicated in the heatmap in Figure 2B. The clusters were determined by DPGP clustering (not size of injury). As noted above, we have revised figures and used the dpi format for all figures and 0 dpi was used instead of uninjured.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Text in the Discussion associated with &quot;at this timepoint&quot; (p.6, paragraph 1, line 18) is confusing. Clarify intent.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer and agree that this sentence is confusing. We have removed this sentence from the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Text in the Discussion associated with &quot;did not vary significantly with larger injury sizes&quot; (p.6, paragraph 2, line 8) is confusing. Clarify intent.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the observation. We have revised this sentence and it now reads:</p><p>“While we observed that pro-resolving lipid mediators are expressed in VML injuries, the level at which these factors are detected did not proportionally increase with the heightened inflammation observed in 2mm injury compared to 1mm injury.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) In Supplemental Figure 1, Isometric Force is presented as &quot;Tetanus&quot; throughout the range of stimulation frequency in panels A and B. Clarify what is going on at lower frequencies and which values are used in panels C, D, and E. It would also be helpful to clarify why muscle force is evaluated as stimulating the nerve vs the muscle: what do these data tell us?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment from the reviewer. We first changed the title of the y-axis in figures in Supplemental Figures 1A-1B to “Isometric Force (mN)”. We described the frequency at which tetanic force was measured in the “In situ functional testing” section of the Methods. This measurement typically was at 200 Hz and this has been added into the figure caption. It is common practice to evaluate nervous and muscle stimulation for functional testing (Dellorusso et al. Journal of Muscle Res. and Cell Motil. 22: 467–475, 2001) before and after injury as an indicator of functonal neurotranmission, i.e. lower force generation elicited with nerve stimulation than with direct muscle stimulation suggests that there are muscle fibers that cannot be activated by nerve stimulation, implicating a neurotransmission defect. It is unknown how innervation levels are restored after VML, and these results show comparable values for force output between neural and muscle stimulation suggesting that functional innervation was fully restored. Further experiments are needed to evaluate how motor endplates change after VML, which is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) CD68 is a marker for monocytes as well as macrophages.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank for the reviewer for this comment. We have amended the text to say monocytes and macrophages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Throughout multiple comparisons in the figure panels, is it necessary to include the bars and notation where there are no significant differences (i.e., eliminate those for &quot;ns&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree. Non-significant labels were removed from all figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 has the following overall critiques:</p><p>Despite the strengths of the study, some limitations are identified. Specifically, the impact of maresin 1 on macrophage phenotypes (M1/M2) could have been explored in more detail using histological or protein expression analysis. Moreover, additional data are needed to substantiate the claims about increased muscle regeneration. Lastly, the study does not address myofiber innervation, myofiber-type transitions, or motor unit remodeling.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions and have performed a more in-depth exploration of macrophage phenotypes through additional scRNA-sequencing analysis. We have also included additional data describing how Maresin 1 impacts muscle stem cells through cyclic AMP. Respectfully, profiling myofiber innervation, motor unit remodeling and myofiber-type transitions are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 raises the following specific issues for addressing:</p><p>The study also has some weaknesses that should be addressed prior to publication. The manuscript should be revised based on the following comments.</p><p>1. Please normalize the measured isometric torque by either dividing it by the weight of the TA muscle or the animal's body weight. This normalization is important because the torque value can vary with body mass, and normalizing the data to body mass will allow for more accurate comparisons between the experimental groups.</p></disp-quote><p>Further details regarding the calculation of the specific force are detailed in the methods section. Briefly, specific force measurement uses muscle mass and muscle length (Lo) to normalize the data (we are not measuring torque). The absolute force and specific force which is normalized are both reported.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Can you provide the measurements of the biopsy mass that was removed to induce VML injury in each experimental group? This information is crucial for the reproducibility of the VML injury model and to enable comparison of the severity of the resulting injury.</p></disp-quote><p>The muscle mass that was removed for the 2mm defects was approximately 6-8mg, representing about 30% of TA muscle mass. We have added this to the methods section describing the injury.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The number of mice used for each experimental group is not mentioned in the methods section. Please mention the number of mice used for each group at each time point. Please also indicate if the injuries were unilateral or bilateral.</p></disp-quote><p>The sample sizes for each experimental group are included in each of the figure legends. Injuries that were bi-lateral have been labeled.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The reporting of sample sizes is not consistent. For instance, in Figure 1, it is n=4-5 per group, but in figure 2, it is n=5 mice per injury type and timepoint, and in Figure 4, it is n = 3-4 tissues per condition. Please edit for consistency. Is n=3 mice the same as n=3 tissues?</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the figure captions to include both numbers of tissues and numbers of mice used for each experiment. The numbers of mice required for each experiment were different based on power analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There are a few issues with the reporting of results that need to be addressed. Firstly, in the caption of figure 3F, the sample size is listed as n=7 mice per group, while in the Results section, a range of 7-11 mice per group is mentioned. This discrepancy needs to be reconciled to ensure accurate reporting of the sample size used in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention and have corrected the sample sizes reported.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Secondly, there is some confusion regarding the statistical significance of the results. While the caption of figure 3F suggests a trend (implying p&lt;0.1) for larger eMHC+ myofibers with Maresin 1 treatment, the graph shows an asterisk symbol suggesting p&lt;0.05. It is recommended to double-check the data set to clarify the level of significance and ensure consistency in reporting.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion and have revised the figure caption to match the figure representation of statistical significance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Additionally, based on supplementary figure 3, it appears that there are more eMHC+ myofibers in the control group. Therefore, total counts for the eMHC+ myofibers in the entire section should be provided to better understand the distribution of these fibers among the groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the observation. We have revised the label and included both count and percentages in the revised supplemental figures. We have also included the count and percentage of centrally located nuclei in the revised supplemental figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Evidence for enhanced in vivo myogenesis is scarce, and eMHC+ myofiber data has inconsistencies in presentation (as mentioned above). Please provide additional data (e.g., percentage of myofibers with displaced nuclei, myofiber counts/cross-sectional area, protein expression of MRFs, increased Pax7+ satellite cell quantity) to better support the claim that maresin 1 is improving myogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have included data for centrally nucleated myofibers in Supplemental Figure 4C, and overall cross-sectional areas of eMyHC fibers. We also performed new experiments using a MuSC fluorescent reporter (Pax7<sup>CreERT2</sup> – Rosa26<sup>-TdTomato</sup>) to further understand changes in muscle regeneration. These results are portrayed in Figure 3F-G and show a small improvement in the size of myofibers that contain TdTomato (and a trend of increased myofiber size shown in Supplemental Information Figure 4). These results agree with the eMyHC data showing small improvements in muscle cross-sectional area as a result of Maresin 1 treatment. Last, we measured gene expression of several MRFs and other regeneration associated genes such as Tmem8c/ Myomaker, Titin (Ttn) and myogenin are plotted in the new Figure 5F, which shows differentially expressed genes in muscle stem cells measured by scRNAseq.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Based on the evidence provided, it appears that maresin 1 is suppressing inflammation and fibrosis, which may be sparing more myofibers from undergoing necrosis in the surrounding musculature. Please discuss this possibility in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and very much agree with this statement. We have added this into the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Figure 5 presents CD86, IL-1 β, CCR7 etc. as M2 macrophage associated markers, which is incorrect. These markers are indicative of M1 phenotype. Which specific markers were used to indicate the M2 phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and we agree that a more comprehensive analysis of macrophage subsets was needed. CD86 and Il1b are poor markers since M2b macrophages and M1 macrophages express both. Il1r2 is primarily expressed by M2a macrophages. We have generated additional scRNA-Seq data and performed a more comprehensive analysis of macrophage phenotypes post Maresin treatment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
