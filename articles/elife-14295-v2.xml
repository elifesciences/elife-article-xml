yet the signaling pathways triggered by stalled elongation complexes are unknown. To investigate these pathways we analyzed the brain of C57BL/6J-<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice in which neuronal elongation complexes are stalled at AGA codons due to deficiencies in a tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>UCU</sub> tRNA and GTPBP2, a mammalian ribosome rescue factor. Increased levels of phosphorylation of eIF2α (Ser51) were detected prior to neurodegeneration in these mice and transcriptome analysis demonstrated activation of ATF4, a key transcription factor in the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Genetic experiments showed that this pathway was activated by the eIF2α kinase, GCN2, in an apparent deacylated tRNA-independent fashion. Further we found that the ISR attenuates neurodegeneration in C57BL/6J-<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, underscoring the importance of cellular and stress context on the outcome of activation of this pathway. These results demonstrate the critical interplay between translation elongation and initiation in regulating neuron survival during cellular stress.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14295.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14295.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14295.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Information stored in DNA is used to make proteins in a two-step process. First, the DNA is copied to make molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid (or messenger RNA for short). Next, machines called ribosomes use the messenger RNAs as templates to assemble chains of amino acids – the building blocks of proteins – in a process called translation. Another type of RNA molecule called transfer RNA carries each amino acid to the ribosomes. If a specific transfer RNA is not available for translation at the right time, the ribosome might stall as it moves along the messenger RNA. At this point, the ribosome needs to be restarted or it will fall off the mRNA without finishing the protein.</p><p>In 2014, a group of researchers reported that certain types of brain cells are very sensitive to ribosome stalling, and tend to die if translation does not continue. A protein called GTPBP2 was shown to play an important role in restarting stalled ribosomes in these cells. Here, Ishimura, Nagy et al. – including some of the researchers from the earlier work – investigated the molecular pathways that ribosome stalling triggers in brain cells using mutant mice that lacked the GTPBP2 protein. The experiments show that ribosome stalling activates an enzyme known as GCN2, which was already known to sense other types of malfunctions in cellular processes.</p><p>Ishimura, Nagy et al. also show that GCN2 triggers stress responses in the cells by activating a communication system called the ATF4 pathway. This pathway protects the cells from damage, and its absence results in more rapid cell deterioration and death. The next challenges are to understand the exact mechanism by which GCN2 senses stalled ribosomes, and to find out how ribosome stalling causes the death of brain cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14295.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14295.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>translation elongation</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>translation initiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS094637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ackerman</surname><given-names>Susan L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ackerman</surname><given-names>Susan L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HG007554</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chuang</surname><given-names>Jeffrey H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activation of the integrated stress response by stalled translation elongation complexes attenuates neurodegeneration, and demonstrates a protective link between a decrease in the rate of translation initiation and defects in translation elongation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein translation cycles through the phases of initiation, elongation, termination, and ribosome recycling. Translation has been thought to be predominantly regulated at the initiation step in which the 40S small ribosome subunit, preloaded with Met-tRNAi, binds to the 5’ end of mRNA. This complex then scans the mRNA for the AUG initiation codon where the 60S large ribosome subunit joins to form the 80S monosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitken and Lorsch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>). A major control point of initiation is the reversible phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which in its active form binds GTP and Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> and delivers the initiator tRNA to the 40S subunit of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baird and Wek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Donnelly et al., 2013</xref>). A variety of stress responses regulate translation initiation by converging on phosphorylation of Ser51 of the α subunit of eIF2, which prevents formation of the ternary complex and thus translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dalton et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to globally repressing translation, phosphorylation of eIF2α also enhances translation of specific mRNAs with open reading frames in their 5’ leaders, such as ATF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vattem and Wek, 2004</xref>). This transcription factor promotes transcription of genes involved in a wide range of adaptive functions including amino acid metabolism, redox control, and translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kilberg et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The eIF2α subunit is the common target of four protein kinases, the activation of which is induced by distinct and specific extracellular and intracellular stresses. PKR-like ER kinase (PERK, EIF2AK3) is generally activated by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ron and Harding, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhao and Ackerman, 2006</xref>). Heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI, EIF2AK1) and protein kinase R (PKR, EIF2AK2) are activated in erythroid cells by heme deprivation and viral infections, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marchal et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, GCN2 (<underline>G</underline>eneral <underline>C</underline>ontrol <underline>N</underline>on-derepressible 2, EIF2AK4) is activated by low intracellular levels of amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castilho et al., 2014</xref>). Amino acid deficiency results in an increase of deacylated tRNA species, which bind the histidyl-tRNA synthetase-related domain of GCN2 and the C-terminus, domains that are essential for GCN2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wek et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhu et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Elongation has recently emerged as a translation phase that is also subject to elaborate regulatory and surveillance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Richter and Coller, 2015</xref>). During elongation the ribosome moves in a codon-dependent fashion down the mRNA while amino acids are cyclically presented to the A site of ribosomes by EF-1/EF-T-bound aminoacylated tRNAs and added to the nascent peptide chain by the formation of peptide bonds. The rate of elongation is a function of ribosome transit rate, i.e. the time the translating ribosome spends on each codon, which is influenced by the secondary structure of the mRNA, nascent peptide:ribosome interactions, as well as codon identity and the availability of properly modified, cognate tRNAs for these codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ishimura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito and Chiba, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koutmou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu and Deutsch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nedialkova and Leidel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Quax et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wen et al., 2008</xref>). Elongation rates are now considered important factors in gene expression that determine the fate of mRNA undergoing translation and the functioning of the nascent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elvekrog and Walter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inada, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Quax et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sherman and Qian, 2013</xref>). Pausing of translating ribosomes can be induced by cellular stress including temperature and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knight et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shalgi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhong et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, misregulation of elongation may contribute to disease pathology resulting in neurological dysfunction such as observed in Fragile X syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Udagawa et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Recently we reported that ribosome stalling is intimately associated with cerebellar and retinal degeneration in the C57BL6/J (B6J)-<italic>nmf205</italic> mutant mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ishimura et al., 2014</xref>). In this mouse model, two mutations are necessary to induce neuron loss: a loss of function mutation (<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup>) in a translational GTPase GTPBP2 (guanosine triphosphate-binding protein 2) and a hypomorphic mutation in the nervous system-specific <italic>n-Tr20 (nTRtct5</italic>) tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>UCU</sub> gene. Ribosomal profiling of cerebella from mice with the <italic>n-Tr20</italic> mutation revealed an increase in ribosome occupancy at AGA codons that dramatically increased in the absence of GTPBP2. These studies demonstrated that GTPBP2 likely functions as a ribosome rescue factor and that ribosome stalling, i.e. abnormally long ribosome transit rates, could lead to neuron death. Recently, a mutation in the <italic>GTPBP2</italic> gene was suggested to underlie cerebellar and retinal degeneration and intellectual disability in humans, supporting an essential role of GTPBP2 in neuronal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaberi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we take advantage of unique mouse models with the <italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutation to assess the signaling events that are triggered by ribosome stalling. We show that GCN2 is activated in the B6J-<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/- </sup>mutant brain in a tRNA<sup>deacyl</sup>-independent manner prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. Activation of this kinase results in eIF2α phosphorylation and induction of ATF4-target genes in the cerebellum and hippocampus of B6J-<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Further, our genetic studies demonstrate that GCN2 activation functions to attenuate neurodegeneration in the B6J-<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain. These results suggest that ribosome stalling activates GCN2 as a previously unknown regulatory mechanism that links the elongation and initiation steps of translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ATF4 target genes are induced in the B6J-<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain</title><p>To begin to elucidate the molecular pathways activated by ribosome stalling, we performed gene expression studies on cerebella isolated from B6J (<italic>n-Tr20</italic>, also known as <italic>nTRtct5</italic>, mutant) and B6J-<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> (<italic>n-Tr20</italic> mutant; <italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> ) mice at 5 weeks of age, a time when many granule cells are undergoing apoptosis in mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Together these data suggest that in addition to attenuating the ISR, loss of <italic>Gcn2</italic> in the B6J-<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum results in upregulation of genes involved in nucleolar function and downregulation of neuron specific genes suggestive of nucleolar dysfunction and neuronal damage, respectively.</p><p>Although there was a difference in levels of p-eIF2α, our RNA-Seq experiments showed no significant changes in gene expression between the cerebellum of B6J and B6J.<italic>Gcn2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). We suspected these changes may be subtle and below the detection limits of these experiments.

GCN2 is also activated by glucose deprivation, proteasome inhibition, and other conditions, many of which also decrease the amino acid pool, though in less obvious ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castilho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jiang and Wek, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2000</xref>). A decrease in the intracellular amino acid pool in turn can lead to increased levels of deacylated tRNA. Competition assays have indicated that aminoacylated tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> binds the enzymatically inactive HisRS-like domain of GCN2 less efficiently than deacylated tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>, suggesting GCN2 preferentially binds uncharged tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dong et al., 2000</xref>). While not as efficient as acylated tRNAs, deacylated tRNA has been demonstrated to enter the A-site of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murchie and Leader, 1978</xref>) where models of GCN2 activation suggest that it is transferred to GCN2, possibly with the assistance of the GCN2 effector protein GCN1 to activate the kinase activity of GCN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marton et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ramirez et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wek et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, our results suggest that ribosome stalling, in the absence of changes in levels of deacylated tRNAs, is sufficient to activate GCN2. We examined tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>UCU</sub> (the corresponding isoacceptor for AGA, the only codon at which we observe stalled ribosomes upon ribosome profiling) and failed to detect changes in uncharged levels of <italic>n-Tr20</italic> isodecoders in B6J-<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutant cerebellum compared with that of B6J. Unprocessed tRNAs have also been shown to activate yeast ATF4, although this appears to occur independently of GCN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qiu et al., 2000</xref>). Thus we tested if ATF4 activation is modulated by cerebellar overexpression of the unprocessed B6J-associated <italic>n-Tr20</italic> tRNA with or without the <italic>Gtpbp2</italic> mutation and found no change in ATF4 activation. Finally, ATF4 activation also occurs in the brains of B6J-<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice in which the <italic>n-Tr20</italic> is entirely deleted and thus no unprocessed tRNA is produced. These results raise the intriguing possibility that ribosome stalling may also contribute to GCN2 activation in other conditions, such as amino acid deprivation, in which like B6J-<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> neurons, lower levels of acylated tRNA are present.</p><p>The exact mechanism for GCN2 activation by ribosome stalling remains unclear. Yeast GCN2 loosely binds to ribosomes via its C-terminus and ribosome association is required for GCN2 activation during amino acid deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Narasimhan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ramirez et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhu and Wek, 1998</xref>). Thus GCN2 activation may occur upon association with stalled ribosomes. However, multiple reports have failed to detect changes in the steady state ribosome association of yeast GCN2 during amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castilho et al., 2014</xref>). Further, studies suggest that association of mouse GCN2 with ribosomes is lower, perhaps due to differences in the structures of yeast and mammalian GCN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2014</xref>). In agreement, we failed to observe changes in the low levels of ribosome-associated GCN2 in the mouse brain of wild type or B6J-<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (Ishimura, unpublished). As an alternative to alterations in ribosome binding, ribosome stalling may activate either cytoplasmic or ribosome-associated positive (e.g., GCN1 or GCN20) or inactivate negative (e.g., Yih1/IMPACT or eEF1A) regulators of GCN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castilho et al., 2014</xref>). Lastly, ribosome stalling could alter cellular amino acid pools via unknown feedback mechanisms that in turn lead to GCN2 activation. Indeed, amino acid scarcity has been reported in cells during proteasome inhibition or after UV treatment, both of which have been shown to activate GCN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Siegel and Swenson, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Suraweera et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Translational reprogramming mediated by the eIF2α kinases is thought to be adaptive during stress by transiently shutting protein synthesis to prevent waste of cellular resources until management of stress has occurred. However recent evidence suggests that under several stress conditions, phospho-eIF2α/ATF4 may facilitate apoptosis. For example, <italic>Atf4</italic>-deficiency reduced oxidative stress-induced neuron death and death of ER-stressed mouse embryonic fibroblasts and β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krokowski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lange et al., 2008</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>Atf4</italic> also attenuated neuronal loss induced by locally applied Aβ peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baleriola et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, reports suggest that increased levels of eIF2α phosphorylation observed in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia and mice with prion disease amplifies neurodegeneration and defects in synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devi and Ohno, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moreno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Radford et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Segev et al., 2015</xref>), although other studies have failed to confirm some of these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Devi and Ohno, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paesler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sadleir et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, we show that GCN2 activation protects neurons against death mediated by ribosome stalling. Deletion of <italic>Gcn2</italic> in B6J-<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice resulted in accelerated progression of cerebellar granule cell death. Furthermore in the hippocampus of B6J-<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup>; <italic>Gcn2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>mice, we observed degeneration of CA1 pyramidal cells that is not observed in B6J-<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup>, suggesting the eIF2α/ATF4 pathway is vital for survival of these neurons during ribosome stalling. Our findings are similar to those found by Harding et al in which induction of ATF4 downstream genes, particularly genes encoding various antioxidant enzymes, attenuated death of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells during amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al., 2003</xref>). Similarly this pathway was shown to be critical for survival of tumor cells under nutrient deprivation conditions and in cultured dopaminergic neurons against toxin-induced cell death. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ye et al., 2010</xref>). These results suggest that the type of stress may influence the response of cells to reduction in initiation. Indeed, under mild amino acid stress conditions (two–five fold decrease in tRNAs) a decrease in initiation has been predicted to also decrease protein production via yeast whole-cell modeling simulations in which ribosomes have been suggested to be rate limiting for protein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shah et al., 2013</xref>). However, under severe amino acid stress, reducing initiation is predicted to have the opposite effect and significantly increase protein production. This latter model suggests that under severe stress, cellular protein production is limited by elongation rather than initiation rates, and reducing the rate of initiation increases the pools of free ribosomes and free tRNAs that correspond to the depleted amino acid. While it is not clear if this model also applies to mammalian cells (and/or neurons) or other types of proteotoxic stress, such alternative consequences on protein production in different stress conditions may account for differential responses upon loss of the eIF2a/ATF pathway. It is tempting to suggest that protection by GCN2 is conferred by phosphorylation of eIF2α and the resulting decrease in the translational burden. However, recent findings have shown that cellular stress can cause downregulation of global translation during cellular stress independently of eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knutsen et al., 2015</xref>), raising the possibility that eIF2α is not necessarily directly causative in ameliorating neuron death in the B6J- <italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> brain.</p><p>Loss of <italic>Gcn2</italic> in the B6J-<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum not only resulted in reduction of eIF2α phosphorylation and attenuated upregulation of ATF4 target genes, but also caused increased expression of genes that regulate nucleolar function, including those involved in ribosome biogenesis and processing of non-coding RNAs. Several of these genes were also upregulated, albeit at lower levels, in the B6J-<italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum suggesting that neurons may sense a deficiency of functional ribosomes and correspondingly activate genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. The failure to decrease protein synthesis via GCN2-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation may result in a further depletion of functional ribosomes necessitating additional compensatory increases in expression of genes controlling nucleolar function. Interestingly, human mutations in genes that control ribosome biogenesis have been shown to induce nucleolar stress and a variety of pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armistead and Triggs-Raine, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Danilova and Gazda, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yelick and Trainor, 2015</xref>). More experiments are necessary to test whether nucleolar stress contributes to death of neurons during conditions of ribosome stalling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>The <italic>Gtpbp2<sup>nmf205</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutant strain was generated by ENU-treatment of C57BL/6J (B6J) mice as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ishimura et al., 2014</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Activation of GCN2 by Ribosome Stalling Links Translation Elongation with Translation Initiation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers recognized the significance of your paper's conclusions in regards to GCN2 activation by mechanism(s) that do not entail uncharged tRNAs and that ribosome stalling activates the ISR via GCN2 to limit neurodegeneration in a mouse model of ribosome stalling. Their views diverged initially in regards to the extent that the genetic arguments put forth in support of the conclusion were sufficient. However, in the consultation that followed the reviewers agreed that a suitably revised paper would be acceptable for publication even without further mechanistic insight into the links between ribosome stalling and GCN2 activation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Given that the papers central conclusions rest on analysis of an imaginatively curated collection of mutant mice, it is important to qualify the conclusions and consider alternative mechanisms by which the combination of the rare allele of tRNA_ARG and the deficiency in GTPBP2 might lead indirectly to canonical activation of GCN2. Of particular note are linkages between GCN2 and stresses that interfere with proteasomes. This could involve recycling of amino acids, and another means of indirect activation of GCN2.</p><p>2) As the role of eIF2α phosphorylation in limiting neurodegeneration is inferred from the phenotype of the GCN2 knockout (but not confirmed by further genetic manipulation of levels of eIF2α phosphorylation), the conclusion relating to the protective role of the ISR should be qualified.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows that the effect of GCN2 deletion on levels of eIF2α phosphorylation is more evident in the B6J reference background than in the B6J-<italic>nmf205<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background. This raises several questions: (a) Why then did the mRNA expression profiling show no differences between these two genotypes? (b) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> suggests involvement of other eIF2α kinases in the B6J-<italic>nmf205<sup>-/-</sup></italic>.

The latter concern is further accentuated by the finding that EIF2AK3/PERK mRNA is elevated in the mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and 4B</xref> are central to the paper's conclusion that tRNA uncharging does not correlate with GCN2 activation in the mutant mice.

We agree that experiments using further genetic or other manipulations of eIF2α phosphorylation levels will be needed in the future to unequivocally establish causality and have modified the Discussion accordingly.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows that the effect of GCN2 deletion on levels of eIF2α phosphorylation is more evident in the B6J reference background than in the B6J-nmf205<sup>-/-</sup> background. This raises several questions: (a) Why then did the mRNA expression profiling show no differences between these two genotypes?</italic></p><p>The reviewers point out that <italic>Gcn2</italic> deletion decreases levels of eIF2α phosphorylation on the B6J background, but gene expression profiles show no differences between the B6J and B6J-<italic>Gcn2<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>cerebellum. To re-analyze relative expression levels with higher precision, we have performed RT-qPCR of the top 10 most upregulated genes in B6J-<italic>nmf205</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum. We found that for several genes the expression in B6J-<italic>Gcn2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum is slightly, but significantly, lower than in the B6J cerebellum. Therefore, it is suggestive that deletion of <italic>Gcn2</italic> in B6J mice results in gene expression changes on a magnitude that is not readily detectable by RNA-Seq. These results are shown in a new figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>(b) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> suggests involvement of other eIF2α kinases in the B6J-nmf205<sup>-/-</sup>.

TRNA levels were decreased in the B6J-<italic>nmf205</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cerebellum as described in the text. However, no difference in the ratio of uncharged to charged tRNA was detected between genotypes. We have included shorter exposures of these blots. These experiments were all done on 3-week-old and not 5-week-old mice to avoid artifacts due to cell death.</p></body></sub-article></article>
