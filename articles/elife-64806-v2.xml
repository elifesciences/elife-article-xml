acid oxidase secreted from immune cells. Recent observations have suggested that IL4i1 is pro-tumorigenic via unknown mechanisms. As IL4i1 has homologs in snake venoms (L-amino acid oxidases [LAAO]), we used comparative approaches to gain insight into the mechanistic basis of how conserved amino acid oxidases regulate cell fate and function. Using mammalian expressed recombinant proteins, we found that venom LAAO kills cells via hydrogen peroxide generation. By contrast, mammalian IL4i1 is non-cytotoxic and instead elicits a cell protective gene expression program inhibiting ferroptotic redox death by generating indole-3-pyruvate (I3P) from tryptophan. I3P suppresses ferroptosis by direct free radical scavenging and through the activation of an anti-oxidative gene expression program. Thus, the pro-tumor effects of IL4i1 are likely mediated by local anti-ferroptotic pathways via aromatic amino acid metabolism, arguing that an IL4i1 inhibitor may modulate tumor cell death pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tryptophan</kwd><kwd>venom</kwd><kwd>ferroptosis</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd><kwd>hydrogen peroxide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB-TRR 127</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linkermann</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Peter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR 2599</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ohnmacht</surname><given-names>Caspar</given-names></name><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Peter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB-TRR 205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linkermann</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Peter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>International Research Training Group</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linkermann</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>324141047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linkermann</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>716718</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linkermann</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OH 282/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linkermann</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>IL4i1 is an amino acid oxidase expressed in the mammalian immune system and snake venoms, which control diametrically opposite cell protection versus cell death pathways, respectively.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most cells of the immune system depend on external supplies of all essential and most non-essential amino acids for proliferation in active immune responses, and for diverse effector functions, such as nitric oxide generation from arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murray, 2016</xref>). Amino acid auxotrophy of immune cells also forms checkpoints whereby distinct amino acid metabolizing enzymes expressed in different cell types control cell proliferation, fate, and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murray, 2016</xref>). These regulated enzymes metabolize arginine (Arginases 1 and 2 and nitric oxide synthase two or iNOS) and tryptophan (indole-2,3-dioxygenases, IDO1 and IDO2). The expression of each enzyme is regulated by diverse external cues, such as cytokines and microbial signaling through toll-like receptors, which restricts their activity to specific phases in immune responses. Because each enzyme can locally deplete essential amino acids, considerable attention has been focused on the role of arginases and IDO enzymes in suppressing access of proliferating T cells to amino acids in tumor microenvironments, a process linked with T cell tolerance and spreading or ‘infectious tolerance’ to abate ongoing T cell-mediated immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cobbold et al., 2009</xref>). Tolerance to malignant cells is a hallmark of cancer, and thus drugs that target arginases and IDO have been produced and tested in the context of immune enhancement of anti-tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Steggerda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Günther et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Another immune-associated enzyme that metabolizes amino acids and linked to immune suppression in cancer is interleukin-4-induced-1 (IL4i1), which was discovered in a screen for IL4-regulated cDNAs in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chu and Paul, 1997</xref>). Unlike arginases and the IDO enzymes, IL4i1 is secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boulland et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting it contributes to immune regulation in the extracellular milieu. IL4i1 is a dimeric FAD-dependent oxidoreductase with considerable similarity to L-amino acid oxidases (LAAOs) in snake venoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murray, 2016</xref>). Mammalian IL4i1 metabolizes L-Phe and other aromatic amino acids to their keto-acid forms with coincident production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ammonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boulland et al., 2007</xref>). However, limited information exists about the enzymology and functions of either IL4i1 or LAAOs, their substrate ranges, kinetics, and the role of downstream metabolites formed from amino acids.</p><p>Venomous snakes are divided into two broad groups: viperids (e.g., vipers, rattlesnakes, bushmasters) and elapids (cobras, taipans, mambas, sea snakes) based on their predation strategies and anatomy. Viperids have retractable fangs and powerful jaws and use large venom volumes to inactivate prey. Elapids have fixed fangs and strike to deliver small but potent venoms. A remarkable finding that emerged from mass spectrometry analysis of many different venoms concerns vast qualitative and quantitative venom protein diversity, even of closely related snake species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tasoulis and Isbister, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Villar-Briones and Aird, 2018</xref>). For example, cobra venoms contain many types of toxins, enzymes, and neurotoxins while viperid venoms are enriched in phospholipases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Suryamohan et al., 2020</xref>). However, all analyzed snake venoms contain a LAAO in different proportions depending on the snake, raising the question of the role of this enzyme in fast-acting venoms.</p><p>Collectively, numerous elements of IL4i1 and LAAO biology remain unresolved. These include the mechanistic basis of the association between IL4i1 and different cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carbonnelle-Puscian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cousin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sadik et al., 2020</xref>), the mode of action of LAAOs in snake venoms, and how this compares to mammalian IL4i1, the cell types that express IL4i1 and relative role of IL4i1-mediated microenvironmental amino acid depletion versus product generation. To illuminate new aspects of IL4i1/LAAO biology, we initiated a comparative study between mammalian expressed recombinant forms of snake (Indian cobra, <italic>Naja naja</italic>) LAAO and mammalian IL4i1. This approach allowed us to establish that snake LAAO is an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>‘bomb’ that rapidly kills mammalian cells. By contrast, IL4i1 also generates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> but is not cell-lethal. Instead, mammalian IL4i1 suppresses cell death by ferroptosis via product generation from L-Trp and L-Tyr. Most significantly, we show that indole-pyruvate (I3P) and 4-hydroxy-phenylpyruvate (4HPP) from L-Trp and L-Tyr, respectively, act as radical scavengers and activate cell protective pathways that suppress ferroptosis. We propose that components of the pro-tumor effects of IL4i1 are linked to local anti-ferroptotic effects on transformed cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Venom LAAO but not mammalian IL4i1 induces cell death in an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent way</title><p>IL4i1 expression and secretion is generally associated with myeloid cells and B cells, the latter of which is the original cell type where IL4i1 was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chu and Paul, 1997</xref>). As viperid and elapid LAAOs are also secreted proteins that accrue in the venom gland and bear strong sequence identity to mammalian IL4i1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and catalyze the same reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we first asked if the cellular biochemistry of snake LAAO would help illuminate the biology of mammalian IL4i1. We expressed the authentic <italic>N. naja</italic> LAAO cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Suryamohan et al., 2020</xref>) in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Following purification and testing the glycosylation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), we added different amounts of the <italic>N. naja</italic> LAAO to HeLa cells and observed them over time by live cell imaging using CellTox Green dye to stain dead cells. The membranes of LAAO-treated HeLa cells began to bleb after ~5 hr, and all cells were dead within 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). To investigate the mechanism of LAAO-mediated cell death we generated a double mutant ‘enzyme-dead’ <italic>N. naja</italic> LAAO by mutating two residues predicted to be in the catalytic domain from inference for the structure of the Malayan pit viper LAAO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pawelek et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moustafa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

Following purification, the enzyme dead <italic>N. naja</italic> LAAO did not induce death of HeLa cells, suggesting that an enzymatic function of LAAOs is responsible for cell toxicity rather than binding to protein(s) associated with HeLa cells that subsequently conveyed a death signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Naja naja</italic> LAAO is cell-lethal via H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Reaction mechanism of L-amino acid oxidases (LAAOs).

Mammalian IL4i1 required concentrations more than 30-fold higher than the <italic>N. naja</italic> LAAO to cause cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Thus, by contrast to snake venom LAAO, it is likely that mediating cytotoxicity is not the main purpose of mammalian IL4i1.

Using an untargeted metabolomics approach, we found human IL4i1 to cause significant increases in indole-3-pyruvate (I3P), 4-hydroxy-phenylpyruvate (4HPP), phenylpyruvate (PP), 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid (KMBA), and 2-oxoarginine (2OA) (from L-Trp, L-Tyr, L-Phe, L-Met, and L-Arg, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

We therefore performed live cell imaging to monitor ferroptosis in HeLa cells induced by erastin (targeting SLC7A11, the cysteine–glutamate exchanger) and RSL3, which inhibits GPX4, required for glutathione-mediated lipid peroxide decomposition. Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) was used as control for ferroptosis protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). We pre-treated or concurrently treated the cells with I3P, 4HPP, or PP, with the expectation that PP could serve as a type of negative control consistent with its limited effect on gene expression in THP-1 cells. Indeed, while PP had no protective effect, we found I3P suppressed ferroptosis in a titratable way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which was accompanied by significantly decreased lipid peroxidation measured with C11-BODIPY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). 4HPP exhibited weaker anti-ferroptotic properties than I3P and required 24 hr pre-incubation to potently protect from RSL3-mediated cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

As described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we found that I3P induced a network of genes involved in the protection from oxidative stress in THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, there is also evidence for I3P acting as a free radical scavenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Politi et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, we tested the radical scavenging activity of the IL4i1 amino acid metabolites PP, 4HPP, and I3P toward the stable radical diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Ascorbic acid and Fer-1, which have been shown to scavenge the DPPH radical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Niki, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>) were used as positive controls at 200 µM. By contrast to PP, we found both, 4HPP and I3P to exhibit radical scavenging properties, with I3P having the highest scavenging potency of the tested IL4i1 metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Thus, the anti-ferroptotic activity could either depend on radical scavenging or the activation of anti-oxidative stress pathways. To unravel these two potential mechanisms of protection we focused on I3P, the most potent anti-ferroptotic metabolite. We hypothesized that a scavenging effect would require the direct presence of I3P, whereas after the induction of a protective gene network I3P would not have to be present anymore at the time point of ferroptosis induction, a concept validated for other ferroptosis inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tang and Tang, 2019</xref>). Therefore, we took advantage of the fluorescent properties of I3P to monitor its presence in the cells using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). After pre-incubating HeLa cells for 24 hr with I3P, an increase in fluorescence measured in the AmCyan channel was observed as compared to cells incubated in control medium. We washed and removed the I3P-containing medium and tracked the decline in intracellular I3P fluorescence over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Four hours after I3P removal, the cells reached fluorescence levels similar to control cells, indicating the deprivation of intracellular I3P. Thus, we asked whether I3P was still protective under this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Strikingly, we found I3P to retain its protective effect toward erastin-induced ferroptosis, but a complete loss of protection from RSL3-mediated cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). These results suggest that I3P uses at least two different modes to protect cells from ferroptosis: (i) free radical scavenging and (ii) the induction of specific protective gene expression. Protection from RSL3 mainly depends on radical scavenging, whereas the persistent protection from erastin after I3P removal, indicates the major involvement of anti-oxidative gene expression under these conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Anti-ferroptotic mechanisms of I3P.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cell-free scavenging activity of 200 µM PP, 4HPP, I3P, ascorbic acid (Asc), and Fer-1 determined by changes in the absorbance at 517 nm of the stable radical DPPH relative to H<sub>2</sub>O control. n = 4 Technical replicates; the graphs are representative for three independent experiments.

To test this concept, we added 1 µg/ml of recombinant WT or K351A mutant, enzymatically inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), murine IL4i1 to DMEM and incubated for 72 hr at 37°C allowing the enzyme to produce its metabolites.

Hierarchical clustering of significantly regulated genes showed concordance of differentially expressed genes in cells treated with I3P or medium containing the WT IL4i1 enzyme, whereas the gene expression in HeLa cells treated with medium containing the enzyme-dead mutant IL4i1 clustered with the untreated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Thus, the enzymatic activity IL4i1 is required for the changes in the gene expression and the generation of I3P seems to be one major factor for the IL4i1-mediated gene expression profile, which is likely enhanced by the additional generation of 4HPP and low levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

In line with our previous findings, we observed this to be linked to a dose-dependent increase in HO-1 and SLC7A11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), which was absent when using the control medium or the K351A mutant enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). To examine whether cells treated with the IL4i1-conditioned medium are protected from ferroptosis, we treated cells with erastin or RSL3 to induce ferroptosis after transferring the medium to the cells. Importantly, whereas the mutant enzyme had no protective effect, WT IL4i1 inhibited ferroptosis in a titratable manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that IL4i1 can create a ferroptosis-suppressive milieu due to its enzymatic activity. To additionally confirm that these effects do not require IL4i1 to bind to any receptor, but the changes in the metabolic environment are sufficient, we used filtration to remove IL4i1 from the conditioned medium before addition to the HeLa cells, which also resulted in upregulation of HO-1 and SLC7A11 and protection from ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Since amino acid concentrations in cell culture medium do not reflect the physiological levels, we verified that the protective effect of IL4i1 was also retained in medium containing human plasma concentrations of amino acids and glucose as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leney-Greene et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>. These data indicate that after IL4i1 is secreted, it generates I3P, 4HPP, and other metabolites that have an autocrine–paracrine anti-ferroptotic effect. Thus, whereas snake venom LAAO quickly generates cytotoxic levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, IL4i1 produces non-lethal amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and amino acid metabolites protecting cells from oxidative ferroptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Therefore, we tested if IL4i1 could also protect cells from LAAO toxicity. As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, we transferred medium pre-incubated for 72 hr with IL4i1 to HeLa cells and added a toxic concentration (1.25 µg/ml; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) of snake venom LAAO. However, IL4i1 could not prevent cells from LAAO toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In concordance with our previous observations regarding ferroptosis protection we confirmed that the venom LAAO does not induce this mode of cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Thus, we speculate that IL4i1 can rather protect from endogenous ROS accumulation, but not from the rapid exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation induced by the venom protein.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results indicate that snake venom LAAOs and mammalian IL4i1 diverged in their functions to kill or protect cells, respectively. We found that a venom LAAO killed mammalian cells via H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation. <italic>N. naja</italic> LAAO oxidized five amino acids to generate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which was lethal to mammalian cells. <italic>N. naja</italic> LAAO was far more potent than its mammalian counterparts, even though the substrate range was almost similar to IL4i1 (with the main exception of L-Leu being metabolized by LAAO). These data are consistent with the notion that venom LAAOs evolved to rapidly metabolize amino acids from their target, and work in concert with other cytotoxic enzymes, such as phospholipases, to increase cell permeability and death in and around the site of envenomation. We note that although LAAOs are almost universal in viperid and elapid venoms, their relative amounts differ remarkably across snake species, consistent with the prey- dependent evolutionary pressure to tailor venom for the target food source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tasoulis and Isbister, 2017</xref>). For example, spitting cobras use directed venom ejection as a defensive strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kazandjian et al., 2021</xref>); whether these snakes retain the same quantities and activities of LAAOs compared to their close cousins, such as <italic>N. naja</italic>, may provide additional insights into venom evolution.</p><p>By contrast to venom LAAOs, we discovered that mammalian IL4i1 protected against death. We found the death protection mechanism of IL4i1 is via suppression of ferroptosis. IL4i1 mediated its anti-ferroptotic activities by overlapping and distinct mechanisms that we speculate synergize in vivo. First, we found that human and mouse IL4i1 are non-cytolytic compared to snake LAAO. Second, the products of the IL4i1 reaction, PP, 4HPP, and I3P induced the hierarchical activation of a gene transcriptional signature linked to networks of cell protective genes, including SLC7A11, CYP1B1, and AKR1C1. PP had almost no detectable effect on expression of the cell protection gene network, while I3P induced a readily identifiable cluster of mRNAs, and 4HPP was intermediate between PP and I3P. Third, IL4i1 is a secreted enzyme and therefore we expect that all the products of the reaction will be made at the same time (though their clearance and downstream metabolism may differ substantially) and could therefore work collectively to activate anti-ferroptotic effects in neighboring cells. Indeed, our media filtration experiments using media treated with IL4i1 and experiments using an enzyme-dead control, argue that the products of the IL4i1 reaction are necessary and sufficient to block ferroptosis in neighboring cells. These experiments additionally argue against a model where IL4i1 binds to other proteins and acts like a cytokine or hormone in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aubatin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Using information from the cell protective gene network induced by IL4i1 metabolites, we speculated that I3P and 4HPP but not PP, may modulate the response to redox stress. We focused on ferroptosis as this pathway is amenable to both activation and suppression by well-defined on-target drugs. We found I3P was highly protective against ferroptotic death induced by both GPX4 (RSL3) or SLC7A11 (erastin) inhibition. 4HPP had an intermediate effect on suppressing ferroptosis, while PP had no modulatory effect, coinciding closely with our RNAseq data showing the distinct magnitude of gene expression by I3P relative to either 4HPP or PP. Ferroptosis can be interrupted by distinct mechanisms leading from modulating cysteine metabolism to form glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stockwell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conrad and Pratt, 2019</xref>), to detoxification of lipid peroxides. In dissecting each key step, we found I3P blocked ferroptosis by at least two distinct mechanisms. First, using a radical scavenging assay and a strategy to load ferroptosis-susceptible cells with I3P and then trace its decay, we observed that I3P has direct free radical scavenging properties. We noted that I3P has previously been shown to be a free radical scavenger in an unrelated system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Politi et al., 1996</xref>). Second, and independent of the radical scavenging properties, I3P induced a cell redox protective gene network, sufficient to prevent erastin-mediated ferroptosis and associated with an increased ratio of reduced GSH. Moreover, especially under erastin-mediated stress conditions, I3P elevated the activation of compensatory gene expression as indicated by increased protein amounts of SLC7A11 and HO-1, two important target genes of anti-oxidative stress pathways. Nevertheless, further studies are required to identify the main conductors of ferroptosis suppression and the upstream transcription pathways. Our RNAseq data from I3P- and IL4i1-treated cells suggest a possible involvement of ATF4 and especially Nrf2 and AhR signaling. Indeed, also a recent study suggested that the AhR was activated by I3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sadik et al., 2020</xref>). Determining the relative contributions of these pathways, however, will require a systematic evaluation in cell systems devoid of each or even combinations of these transcription factors, since there is evidence for the overlap of the pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zgheib et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>So far, very little is known about IL4i1 protein levels in tissues or serum, mainly due to limitations in validated antibodies. Since IL4i1 expression is highly inducible in immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Molinier-Frenkel et al., 2019</xref>), it is possible that inflammatory conditions are required for IL4i1 accumulation. However, a recent study reported serum IL4i1 amounts of up to 300 pg/ml in a mouse leukemia model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sadik et al., 2020</xref>). Given that IL4i1 expression is often associated with tumor-associated myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ramspott et al., 2018</xref>), we speculate that especially in low-perfused tissue environments, such as found in solid tumors, local concentrations of IL4i1 can reach much higher levels, attaining a ng/ml range in which we found IL4i1 to mediate its protective effects. We also note that I3P has previously been detected in plasma at ~80 µM and was speculated to be derived from microbiome tryptophan metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>) and that related microbiota-derived tryptophan metabolites are associated with radio-protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, we were able to demonstrate anti-ferroptotic activity of I3P within this concentration range. Given that the microbiome and IL4i1 activate anti-ferroptosis pathways via I3P and potentially other indoles, one plausible way to account for the pro-tumor effects of IL4i1 and the pathway we discovered herein, is that local IL4i1 production in the tumor microenvironment increases the available I3P (and 4HPP) concentrations, protecting tumor cells from ferroptosis. While no direct evidence for this link exists, yet the association between IL4i1 and cancer is substantial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ramspott et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Molinier-Frenkel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sadik et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we speculate that an inhibitor of IL4i1 may be a useful anti-cancer drug, as it may sensitize cancer cells to ferroptotic death by blocking IL4i1-mediated amino acid metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Doxycycline</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">D9891</td><td valign="top">1 µg/ml</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">PNGaseF</td><td valign="top">New England Biolabs</td><td valign="top">P0704</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Erastin</td><td valign="top">Selleckchem</td><td valign="top">S7242</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">(1S, 3R)-RSL3</td><td valign="top">Selleckchem</td><td valign="top">S8155</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Catalase</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">C1345</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Zinc (II) protoporphyrin IX</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">691550</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Ketoconazole</td><td valign="top">Acros Organics</td><td valign="top">455470010</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Ferrostatin-1</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">SML0583</td><td valign="top">2 µM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Liproxstatin-1</td><td valign="top">Selleckchem</td><td valign="top">S7699</td><td valign="top">1 µM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Indole-3-pyruvic acid</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">I7017</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Sodium phenylpyruvate</td><td valign="top">Alfa Aesar</td><td valign="top">H56767.06</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">114286</td><td valign="top">200 µM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">2,2-Diphenyl-1-pikryl-hydrazyl</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">D9132</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Horse radish peroxidase</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">P8375</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">Recombinant human IL4i1</td><td valign="top">R and D systems</td><td valign="top">5684-AO-020</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">HO-1 siRNA</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">4390824 (S6673)</td><td valign="top">50 nM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence- <break/>based reagent</td><td valign="top">Scrambled siRNA</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">4390843</td><td valign="top">50 nM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Slc7a11 <break/>(rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">12691</td><td valign="top">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-HO-1 <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Enzo</td><td valign="top">ADI-SPA-895</td><td valign="top">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">CellTox Green</td><td valign="top">Promega</td><td valign="top">G8731</td><td valign="top">1:4000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">Amplex UltraRed</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">A36006</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and media</title><p>Cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production was measured over 5 min at 37°C using a CLARIOstar Plus microplate reader (BMG Labtech) at 530 nm excitation and 590 nm emission wavelength.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Untargeted metabolomics</title><p>DMEM containing 10% FBS was incubated for 24 and 72 hr with 1 µg/ml of recombinant human IL4i1. The identical medium without IL4i1 was used as control. All samples were prepared in triplicates and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For analysis, samples were thawed on ice and proteins were precipitated with methanol. Upon centrifugation at 4°C for 10 min at 15,000 rcf, the extracts were transferred to a new tube. 10 μl of each sample were pooled and used as a quality control (QC) sample and the extracts were randomly assigned into the autosampler. Metabolites were separated on an iHILIC-(P) Classic HPLC column (HILICON, 100 × 2.1 mm; 5 µm; 200 Å; equipped with a guard column) with a flow rate of 100 µl/min delivered through an Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The stepwise gradient of HILIC analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wernisch and Pennathur, 2016</xref>) involved starting conditions of 90% A (100% ACN), ramp to 25% B (25 mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate) within 6 min, 2 min hold at 25% B, ramp to 60% B from 8 to 21 min, switch to 80% B at 21.5 min, following by a flushing (21.5–26 min: 80% B) and re-equilibration step (26.1–35 at 10% B). All samples were analyzed by HILIC separation followed by ESI-HRMS in polarity switching mode in the mass range of 70–900 m/z. Sample spectra were acquired by data-dependent high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry on a Q Exactive Focus (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Ionization potential was set to +3.5/−3.0 kV, the sheath gas flow was set to 20, and an auxiliary gas flow of 5 was used. Samples were analyzed in a randomized fashion bracketed by a blank (MeOH: H<sub>2</sub>O; 2:1 v/v) and QC sample for background correction and normalization of the data, respectively. QC samples were additionally measured in confirmation and discovery mode to obtain further MS/MS spectra for identification. The obtained data sets have been processed by compound discoverer (CD) 3.1.0.035 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Our internal database, mzCloud database, and ChemSpider database (BioCyc, HMDB, KEGG) were used for compound annotation. A mass accuracy of 5 ppm was set and for our internal database a retention time window of 0.4 min was considered to compare against authentic standards. Acetonitrile (ACN) HiPerSolv CHROMANORM for HPLC-Supergradient was obtained from VWR Chemicals, methanol Optima LC/MS Grade from Fisher Chemicals, formic acid Suprapur was purchased from Merck, and H<sub>2</sub>O was obtained from a Mili-Q Advantage A10 water purification system (Merck).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>RNA sequencing and analysis</title><p>THP-1 cells were treated in triplicates for 24 hr with 200 µM of PP, 4HPP, or I3P dissolved in RPMI medium. RPMI medium was used as control. HeLa cells were treated in triplicates for 24 hr with DMEM containing 200 µM I3P or DMEM pre-incubated with 1 µg/ml murine IL4i1 (WT or K351A mutant). DMEM medium was used as control.</p><p>RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. mRNA sequencing libraries were prepared with 1 µg of total RNA of each sample using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (E7765, NEB) with NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (E7490, NEB), according to standard manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA and the final library quality controls were performed using Qubit Flex Fluorometer (Q33327, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 2100 Bioanalyzer Instrument (G2939BA, Agilent) before and after library preparation. Paired-end sequencing was performed on Illumina NextSeq 500 (2 × 43 bp reads). The samples were multiplexed and sequenced on one High Output Kit v2.5 to reduce a batch effect. BCL raw data were converted to FASTQ data and demultiplexed by bcl2fastq Conversion Software (Illumina). BAM and bigwig files are generated by STAR alignment and file conversion scripts – bam2wig and wigToBigWig.</p><p>After quality checking using the tool FastQC (v.0.11.7) the files were mapped to the human genome (Genome build GRCh38) downloaded from Ensembl using the star aligner (v. 2.7.3a) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). The mapped files were then quantified on a gene level based on the Ensembl annotations, using the featureCounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liao et al., 2014</xref>) tool from the SubRead package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liao et al., 2013</xref>) (v. 1.4.6-p4).</p><p>Using the DESeq2 package (R 3.6.0, DESeq version 1.26.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>) the count data was normalized by the size factor to estimate the effective library size. After calculating the gene dispersion across all samples, the comparison of each two different conditions resulted in a list of differentially expressed genes for each comparison. A filtering step of removing genes with no reads in at least three samples was used.</p><p>Genes with an adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 were then considered to be differentially expressed for generation of volcano plots. Gene ontology (GO) biological process overrepresentation analysis was computed with the web-based PANTHER tool using Fisher’s exact test and false discovery rate (FDR) calculation. GO term overrepresentation was analyzed for the most significantly I3P-upregulated genes with a p-value cutoff of p&lt;10<sup>−9</sup> using all detected genes from the dataset as the reference.</p><p>Clustering analysis was performed using the Perseus software (version 1.6.14.0). Genes were filtered for protein-coding genes and the reads log2 transformed. Multiple sample testing using ANOVA with an FDR threshold of 0.0001 was conducted and z-scores generated for the significant genes, which were used for hierarchical clustering (Euclidean distance, average linkage) generating a heat map.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software program (version 7, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com">http://www.graphpad.com</ext-link>).

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper identifies and characterizes an unexpected cytoprotective effect for the human L-amino acid oxidase, interleukin-4-induced-1 (IL4i1). Unlike the related snake venom L-amino acid oxidase which robustly generates hydrogen peroxide to induce ferroptotic cell death, the human protein has slower/attenuated activity and produces metabolites that protect cells from ferroptosis, via direct free radical scavenging activity and the transcriptional induction of an anti-ferroptotic cellular response. The study is elegant and the findings are exciting and of broad relevance to ferroptosis and cellular stress responses.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Anti-ferroptotic mechanism of IL4i1-mediated amino acid metabolism&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our policy on revisions we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very interesting story showing that IL4iL, a secreted amino acid oxidase, has anti-ferroptotic properties. Unlike snake venom amino acid oxidases which robustly generate hydrogen peroxide to induce cell death, IL4iL products, including most notably I3P, protect against ferroptosis. IL4iL products have direct free radical scavenging activity and also elicit the induction of an anti-ferroptotic cellular response, in part via induction of HO-1. The authors also suggest that these effects of IL4iL may contribute to its pro-tumoral actions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Can the authors do a genetic experiment to support or refute the protective role of HO-1 induction by I3P, or perhaps attenuate their comments that HO-1 contributes to the protective effects?</p><p>2) Is IL4i1 cytoprotective against snake venom LAOO?</p><p>3) The authors should show their RNAseq data for IL4i1, to enable comparison with the RNA-seq data for I3P.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting story showing that IL4iL, a secreted amino acid oxidase, has anti-ferroptotic properties. Unlike snake venom amino acid oxidases which robustly generate hydrogen peroxide to induce cell death, IL4iL products, including most notably I3P, protect against ferroptosis. IL4iL products have direct free radical scavenging activity and also elicit the induction of an anti-ferroptotic cellular response, in part via induction of HO-1. The authors also suggest that these effects of IL4iL may contribute to its pro-tumoral actions.</p><p>This is a relatively complete story. Below are a few points for the authors' considerations.</p><p>1) The authors could consider using HO-1 knockdown to complement their findings with ZnPP in Figure 5.</p><p>2) Can the authors speculate on why there seems to be different mechanisms of action of I3P against RSL3 and erastin induced ferroptosis?</p><p>3) Can the authors comment more on the expression patterns of IL4iL, other than cancer and a few cell types?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors may want to consider a scenario in which the genes encoding the snake venom LAAO and IL4i1 co-evolved such that one elicits and the other suppresses ferroptosis, respectively. This would be consistent with both proteins having the same core enzymatic activity, with LAAO inducing sufficient levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to kill cells and IL4i1 induces lower levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, not sufficient to kill cells but likely sufficient to trigger a cytoprotective response against higher levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This would be reminiscent of other &quot;desensitisation systems&quot;, where exposure to a sub-lethal dose of a given agonist renders cells, tissues, organs or organisms refractory to a subsequent dosage of the same substance that would otherwise be deleterious, i.e. cytotoxic. These adaptive responses are sometimes referred to as hormesis or accommodation and are based on the activation of evolutionarily conserved cytoprotective programs, similar to the ones put forward by the authors.Related to Figure 1:</p><p>• Is the snake venom LAAO internalised by mammalian cells?</p><p>• Does snake venom LAAO triggers the generation/accumulation of intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>? This could be assessed, for example, using specific intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> probes.</p><p>• Does snake venom LAAO induces ferroptosis? This could be assessed, for example, using different pharmacologic ferroptosis inhibitors.</p><p>• It is intriguing that when mammalian cells express the gene encoding the snake venom LAAO they do not &quot;succumb to their own poison&quot;. Can the authors discuss why this maybe.</p><p>• In the assays shown in F-H, please indicate what the error bars stand for (STD?, SEM?) and whether these reflect variation inherent to technical replicates (N=3) in a representative assay or from averaged data in independent assays. This comment applies to other figures using the same approach.</p><p>Related to Figure 2:</p><p>Similar to the previous comments related to Figure 1:</p><p>• Is IL4i1 internalised by mammalian cells?</p><p>• Does IL4i1 triggers the generation of intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This could be assessed, for example, using specific intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> probes.</p><p>• Is IL4i1 cytoprotective against snake venom LAAO?</p><p>• There is no information on the experimental variation for the data illustrated in Figure 2F.</p><p>• Figure 2F. 1µg/ml of IL4i1 is used to treat the cells. Information on the plasma concentrations of IL4i1 in human or mouse under steady state and inflammatory conditions would be supportive to demonstrate the physiological function of IL4i1.</p><p>Related to Figure 3:</p><p>The authors investigated if the metabolic products of the IL4i1 enzymatic reaction modulate the &quot;cell state&quot;, by performing RNAseq analysis on human THP-1 monocytic cells treated with I3P, 4HPP or PP. For comparison the authors should illustrate their RNAseq data (same format as in A) in cells exposed to IL4i1, further demonstrating the overlap between the profiles of gene expression obtained with I3P and IL4i1.</p><p>Related to Figure 5:</p><p>In Figure 5D, E, cellular cysteine, glutamate content and GSH/GSSG ratio are needed to support the conclusions reached.</p><p>Related to Figure 6:</p><p>• Although there is evidence for the anti-ferroptotic effect of Slc7a11 and Hmox1, the author did not show whether Slc7a11 is required for the protective effect of I3P, which is important to support the conclusions reached.</p><p>• Figure 6—figure supplement 1D, wash-out experiment is needed to exclude the scavenging effect of filtered medium.</p><p>In the assays shown in F-H, please indicate what the error bars stand for (STD?, SEM?) and whether these reflect variation inherent to technical replicates (N=3) in a representative assay or where these relate to averaged data from independent assays. This comment applies to other figures using the same approach.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Congratulations on an exciting paper. I would suggest trying to determine the amino acid concentrations in the cell culture medium you used, and testing the effects of these two enzymes in medium containing natural concentrations of amino acids (the concentrations found in human plasma for example).</p><p>I would also suggest a genetic experiment to support or refute the protective role of HO-1 induction by I3P. I suspect HO-1 does not contribute to the protective effect and that ZnPP suppresses the protective effect of I3P via other mechanisms. Also, I believe that many of the genes induced by I3P in Figure 3C are targets of ATF4, such that knockdown of ATF4 should be informative about the protective effect of many of these.</p><p>Finally, good controls for I3P's protective effects would be tryptophan and indole, as they would have the same indole moiety. I would suggest comparing these side by side.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64806.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Can the authors do a genetic experiment to support or refute the protective role of HO-1 induction by I3P, or perhaps attenuate their comments that HO-1 contributes to the protective effects?</p></disp-quote><p>In the original submission, we observed that the HO-1 inhibitor, ZnPP reversed the anti-ferroptotic effects of I3P. We also used ketoconazol, another HO-1 inhibitor with a distinct chemical structure from ZnPP. Like ZnPP, ketoconazol significantly reduced the protective effect of I3P from erastin-induced ferroptosis (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B, C). Collectively, these data argue that a heme oxygenase plays a key role in the anti-ferroptotic pathway elicited by I3P but did not answer the question of a direct role of HO-1. Next, we performed a siRNA-mediated knockdown of HO-1 to evaluate the specific contribution of HO-1. HO-1 knockdown, which was substantial as validated by immunoblotting (Figure 5—figure supplement 2D), did not interfere with the protective effect of I3P (Figure 5—figure supplement 2E). Thus, we concluded that effect the two HO-1 inhibitors is either (i) mediated by off-target effects of the compounds, (ii) inhibition of HO-2, which is highly expressed at the transcript level in HeLa cells (from our RNAseq data), or (iii) other heme-dependent enzymes (or, of course, combinations of the above). I3P-induced anti-oxidant gene expression includes a complex network and a simultaneous targeting of multiple proteins is necessary to elucidate the protection mechanism. We have therefore modified the description and outcomes of these experiments (Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is IL4i1 cytoprotective against snake venom LAOO?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe the protection of Hela cells from the venom LAAO by medium pre-treated for 72 hr with IL4i1 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1F). Further, the ferroptosis inhibitors ferrostatin-1 and liproxstatin-1 did not protect from LAAO-induced cell death (Figure 6—figure supplement 1G), indicating that the snake venom LAAO does not induce ferroptosis. Thus, mammalian IL4i1 protects cells from ferroptotic cell death but not from the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent cell death caused by the snake venom LAAO, consistent with the differing enzyme kinetics and substrate range we articulated in the initial part of the Results section. We modified the manuscript to incorporate this information (Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should show their RNAseq data for IL4i1, to enable comparison with the RNA-seq data for I3P.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment, we performed a new RNAseq experiment to compare gene expression in HeLa cells incubated in DMEM containing I3P compared with DMEM pre-incubated for 72 hr with either WT or K351A mutant IL4i1. The outcomes of this experiment were remarkably clear and informative. We found almost identical gene expression patterns of untreated cells and cells treated with the K351A mutant IL4i1, while the I3P-treated cells clustered with the WT IL4i1-treated cells (Figure 6A). Also, we found a substantial overlap of the most significantly upregulated genes by I3P and WT IL4i1 treatment (Figure 6B), suggesting that I3P generation contributes to the gene expression changes mediated by IL4i1. These data are described in the Results and added to Figure 6. This experiment substantially extended the conclusions gained from the initial RNAseq data in the first submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a very interesting story showing that IL4iL, a secreted amino acid oxidase, has anti-ferroptotic properties. Unlike snake venom amino acid oxidases which robustly generate hydrogen peroxide to induce cell death, IL4iL products, including most notably I3P, protect against ferroptosis. IL4iL products have direct free radical scavenging activity and also elicit the induction of an anti-ferroptotic cellular response, in part via induction of HO-1. The authors also suggest that these effects of IL4iL may contribute to its pro-tumoral actions.</p><p>This is a relatively complete story. Below are a few points for the authors' considerations.</p><p>1) The authors could consider using HO-1 knockdown to complement their findings with ZnPP in Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Can the authors speculate on why there seems to be different mechanisms of action of I3P against RSL3 and erastin induced ferroptosis?</p></disp-quote><p>We speculate that the requirement for radical scavenging to protect from RSL3 (Figure 5E) is best explained by RSL3 directly targeting GPX4, the enzyme catalyzing the key step in the cellular anti-ferroptosis mechanism(s) (Figure 4A) by detoxifying lipid peroxides. Thus, gene expression increasing anti-oxidative pathways upstream of GPX4, e.g. increase of cysteine import by increased levels of SLC7A11 (Figure 5G) or increased generation of GSH (Figure 5F), do not have protecting effects once GPX4 is blocked. Nevertheless, we do not want to exclude that the scavenging effect could also contribute to the protection from erastin and we clarified this concept in the main text (Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Can the authors comment more on the expression patterns of IL4iL, other than cancer and a few cell types?</p></disp-quote><p>At this point in the evolution of research into IL4i1, we are limited by reagents to directly answer, or even speculate on this issue beyond scRNAseq data. For example, a specific antibody to the mouse IL4i1 for IHC or immunoblotting is not yet available (in unpublished studies, we have tested all commercially available anti-IL4i1 antibodies for mouse and found them to be non-specific). So far, a reporter allele has not yet been described. Nevertheless, our scRNAseq experiments related to other projects indicate that IL4i1 is expressed only in immune cells, and predominantly in myeloid cells. Our conclusions (so far) do not differ from the current literature that we cite in the manuscript. In the future, we hope a highly specific and knockout validated anti-IL4i1 antibody will accelerate research in mouse models, and that reporters will allow us to track IL4i1 in, for example, infection or cancer models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors may want to consider a scenario in which the genes encoding the snake venom LAAO and IL4i1 co-evolved such that one elicits and the other suppresses ferroptosis, respectively. This would be consistent with both proteins having the same core enzymatic activity, with LAAO inducing sufficient levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to kill cells and IL4i1 induces lower levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, not sufficient to kill cells but likely sufficient to trigger a cytoprotective response against higher levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This would be reminiscent of other &quot;desensitisation systems&quot;, where exposure to a sub-lethal dose of a given agonist renders cells, tissues, organs or organisms refractory to a subsequent dosage of the same substance that would otherwise be deleterious, i.e. cytotoxic. These adaptive responses are sometimes referred to as hormesis or accommodation and are based on the activation of evolutionarily conserved cytoprotective programs, similar to the ones put forward by the authors.</p><p>Related to Figure 1:</p><p>• Is the snake venom LAAO internalised by mammalian cells?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question we performed immunoblot analysis of HeLa cells treated for 2 and 4 hr with 1 µg/ml of the recombinant LAAO enzyme.

This suggests that the enzyme is probably not taken up by the cells. Of course, this experiment does not exclude the possibility that IL4i1 is taken up and immediately degraded. Nevertheless, within the limit of the assay, we cannot detect any “cell associated” IL4i1. So far, there is no evidence for an IL4i1 “receptor” and indeed we have little reason to consider such a mechanism is plausible, as all our data using enzyme-dead mutants reported in our manuscript point to IL4i1 functioning as an extracellular amino acid-metabolizing enzyme.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(A) Immunoblotting of LAAO in HeLa cell lysates and supernatant after 2 and 4 hr treatment with 1µg/ml of the recombinant LAAO enzyme.</title><p>(B) ROS quantification in HeLa cells treated for 4 hr with WT and mutant LAAO by flow cytometry using the ROS probe H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA. 200 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was used as a positive control. n=3 biological replicates, the graph is representative for 3 independent experiments.

So far, there is not much data about serum levels of IL4i1, mainly due to the lack of specific detection antibodies (see the point above to reviewer 1 on IL4i1 expression).
