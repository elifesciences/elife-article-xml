behavior. Healthy DA SN neurons show diverse firing patterns in vivo, ranging from slow pacemaker-like activity (1–10 Hz) to transient high-frequency bursts (&lt;100 Hz), interspersed with pauses that can last hundreds of milliseconds. Recent in vivo patch experiments have started to reveal the subthreshold mechanisms underlying this physiological diversity, but the impact of challenges like cell loss on the in vivo activity of adult DA SN neurons, and how these may relate to behavioral disturbances, is still largely unknown. We investigated the in vivo electrophysiological properties of surviving SN DA neurons after partial unilateral 6-OHDA lesions, a single-hit, non-progressive model of neuronal cell loss. We show that mice subjected to this model have an initial motor impairment, measured by asymmetrical rotations in the open field test, which recovered over time. At 3 weeks post-lesion, when open field locomotion was strongly impaired, surviving DA SN neurons showed a compressed in vivo dynamic firing range, characterized by a 10-fold reduction of in vivo burst firing compared to controls. This in vivo phenotype was accompanied by pronounced in vitro pacemaker instability. In contrast, in the chronic post-lesion phase (&gt;2 months), where turning symmetry in open field locomotion had recovered, surviving SN DA neurons displayed the full dynamic range of in vivo firing, including in vivo bursting, similar to controls. The normalized in vivo firing pattern was associated with a twofold acceleration of stable in vitro pacemaking, mediated by Kv4.3 potassium channel downregulation. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a homeostatic pacemaker plasticity mechanism in surviving DA SN neurons after pronounced cell loss.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>potassium channel</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd><kwd>lesion</kwd><kwd>pacemaker</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Dopamine</kwd><kwd>6-OHDA</kwd><kwd>Kv4.3 potassium channel</kwd><kwd>Substantia nigra</kwd><kwd>Pacemaker</kwd><kwd>Homeostasis</kwd><kwd>Intrinsic plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC1451</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roeper</surname><given-names>Jochen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dopamine midbrain neurons surviving a lesion slowly recover their in vivo firing patterns by homeostatic pacemaker acceleration mediated by Kv4.3 channel downregulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) project mainly to the dorsal striatum (DS), where they release DA in an activity-dependent manner, further shaped by additional mechanisms at the distal axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kramer et al., 2022</xref>). The resulting temporal and spatial dynamics of DA release in DS are relevant for multiple functions, including the control of voluntary movements, as evidenced by the cardinal features of Parkinson disease (PD), which is characterized by the death of SN DA neurons. The in vivo activity pattern of healthy SN DA neurons is complex, ranging from slow pacemaker-like activity (1–10 Hz) to transient high-frequency bursts (&lt;100 Hz), and interspersed with pauses that can last hundreds of milliseconds. However, our understanding of and how SN DA neuron electrical activity adapts to cell loss, relevant during aging or PD, is limited.</p><p>We have previously shown that over expression of mutant A53T-α-synuclein induced an age-dependent acceleration of in vivo and in vitro firing frequencies. This was associated with redox-mediated dysfunction of Kv4.3 channels and an upregulation of Kv4.3 expression, potentially representing a homeostatic attempt to regulate pacemaker frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Subramaniam et al., 2014a</xref>). This study, however, left a more fundamental question unanswered: do adult DA SN neurons have the ability for homeostatic regulation of firing pattern in response to challenge? For this purpose, we employed the well-established 6-hydroxy-dopamine (6-OHDA) chemical lesion model in order to induce a unilateral loss of about half of the DA SN neurons. 6-OHDA has been widely used for generating non-progressive loss of DA SN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rubi and Fritschy, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ungerstedt, 1968</xref>). We opted for a unilateral, partial, intrastriatal 6-OHDA model, previously well characterized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bez et al., 2016</xref>. Bez and colleagues, as well as others, demonstrated that these partial 6-OHDA DA lesions are non-progressive and follow a stereotypical time course: an initial damage phase dominated by cell loss, inflammation, and behavioral impairment for about 3 weeks, which is followed by a chronic phase (studied for up to 20 months in mice), characterized by partial behavioral recovery, neurochemical and molecular adaptations, and – to a certain degree – axonal sprouting of remaining DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cenci and Björklund, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kirik et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwarting and Huston, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Winkler et al., 2002</xref>). This framework, with its distinct phases of impairment and subsequent partial functional recovery, provides a well-suited platform to investigate if and how the in vivo firing properties of surviving DA SN neurons change over time. Previous electrophysiological in vivo investigations of viable post-6-OHDA DA neurons have been limited, with only Hollerman and Grace providing a pioneering dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hollerman and Grace, 1990</xref>). They found lesion-size-dependent changes in in vivo firing properties of putative DA neurons in rats, including a decrease of in vivo burst firing occurring 1 week after lesion, with larger lesions exacerbating this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hollerman and Grace, 1990</xref>). Further supporting this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berretta et al., 2005</xref> proposed that early electrophysiological changes in surviving DA neurons may result directly from 6-OHDA toxicity triggering a cascade of cellular events, such as hyperpolarization mediated by K-ATP channel activation. These electrophysiological adaptations occur within a broader neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory timeline in the first 2 weeks post-lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stott and Barker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walsh et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, in this study, investigations are conducted at two distinct time points – both after the stabilization of the early neuroinflammatory response – yet within a phase where behavioral dynamics are still evolving. This approach allows for a more refined analysis of homeostatic plasticity in identified DA SN neurons, capturing adaptations that persist beyond acute neurotoxicity while remaining within a window of functional and compensatory changes.</p><p>Here, we explore the electrophysiological properties, both in vivo and in vitro, of surviving SN DA neurons in an intra-striatal unilateral 6-OHDA lesion mouse model, titrated to about 40% surviving SN DA neurons. We selected two time points for recordings based on the continuous behavioral characterization of the motor phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Early behavioral impairments and long-term adaptations after partial lesion of substantia nigra dopamine neurons</title><p>To characterize electrophysiological properties in surviving and identified SN DA neurons, we employed a C57Bl6N mouse model with a partial 6-OHDA lesion of the nigrostriatal pathway. We explored different 6-OHDA concentrations (0.2–2 µg/µl) and volumes (2 µl and 6 µl), resulting in a range of 0.4–12 µg 6-OHDA to titrate the ipsilateral loss of DA SN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for details). To target 40–50% cell loss, we slowly (250 nl/min) infused 6 µl of 2 µg/µl 6-OHDA into the right DS. For controls, we infused vehicles (ACSF) with the same rate and same volume into the right DS without observing any damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

We also carried out the unbiased stereology for TH-positive SN neurons in the late phase and detected a very similar degree of loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, vehicle: 102.6 ± 7.9%; 6-OHDA: 39.96 ± 3.7%; p=0.0262, Mann–Whitney test). Importantly, these results indicated that SN DA cell loss was non-progressive throughout our observation period of more than 2 months. In addition, we analyzed the axonal compartment of DA midbrain neurons by determining striatal TH-optical densities, both for early and late phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Similar to the midbrain DA cell body counts, we found a stable reduction of about 50% of TH immunosignal in the ipsilateral DS, again normalized to the contralateral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> 21st day – vehicle: 98.4 ± 2.2%; 6-OHDA: 42.5 ± 3.0%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> &gt; 64 days – vehicle: 94.4 ± 2.7%; 6-OHDA: 48.3 ± 3%), both in early and late phase. By comparison, the ventral striatum was only mildly affected (ca. 20% reduction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> 21st day – vehicle: 94.6 ± 2.0%; 6-OHDA: 81.4 ± 3.0%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> &gt; 64 days – vehicle: 97.8 ± 2.0%; 6-OHDA: 75.2 ± 5.0%). In summary and in accordance with previous studies, our model induced stable 60% loss of SN DA neurons, associated with a stable 50% reduction of DS TH-immunoreactivity throughout the entire observation period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cenci and Björklund, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwarting and Huston, 1996</xref>). This stability provided a suitable framework to identify time-dependent homeostatic changes in surviving SN DA neurons.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows the data from continuous behavioral monitoring of unilateral 6-OHDA and vehicle-treated mice before and up to 68 days post-infusion. Based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cenci and Björklund, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwarting and Huston, 1996</xref>), we focused on the dynamics of drug-free spontaneous turning behavior during open field locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left panels). In contrast to vehicle-infused mice, which displayed a stable symmetric ratio (ca. 50%) of ipsi- to contralateral turning throughout the entire experiment, 6-OHDA-infused mice showed a dramatic shift to ipsilateral turning immediately after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right panel). Interestingly, ipsilateral turns occurred in long sequences of up to 40 individual turns, a pattern not observed in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, these turning sequences as well as the overall ipsilateral bias gradually recovered completely over a 2-month post-lesion period (two-way ANOVA, p-value across time p&lt;0.0001, p-value across groups p&lt;0.0001, significant difference between vehicle and 6-OHDA group till day 40, Šídák’s multiple comparisons test). Analysis of turning features, such as diameter or velocity, revealed that the recovered contralateral turns were similar to turns performed by vehicle-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Also, open field locomotion, quantified as total track length per session, recovered almost completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, other motor behavior, the contralateral paw use during spontaneous rearing in the cylinder test, did not show significant recovery throughout the experimental period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (21st post-infusion day: vehicle 38.5 ± 5.2%, 6-OHDA 5.7 ± 1.4%, p&lt;0.0001, Mann–Whitney test; 68th post-infusion day: vehicle 63.7 ± 6.6%, 6-OHDA 3.2 ± 1.8%, p&lt;0.0001, Mann–Whitney test). To test whether the 6-OHDA lesion model at the investigated time points induced an α-synucleinopathy (i.e., α-synuclein aggregations and/or phospho-α-synuclein), we included a multilabeling immunohistochemistry analysis and utilized a viral α-synuclein injection in mice as a positive control group. Notably, no α-synuclein aggregates or phospho-α-synuclein were detected in 6-OHDA-lesioned animals at either time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Finally, repeating the continuous behavioral monitoring and the quantification of TH immunohistochemistry in midbrain and striatum with female C57Bl6N mice, infused with either 6-OHDA or vehicle, showed very similar results and gave no indications for sex differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the functional properties in immunohistochemically identified surviving SN DA neurons, we performed in vivo extracellular recordings combined with juxtacellular neurobiotin (NB) labeling and in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recordings combined with neurobiotin filling for two time points: at an early time point (21st day after lesion, early phase), where a strong turning asymmetry was present, and at a later time period (&gt;64 days post-lesion, late phase) when turning symmetry had recovered.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Surviving SN DA neurons in the early post-6-OHDA phase exhibit impaired firing properties both in vivo and in vitro</title><p>At the early post-6-OHDA phase, we explored the in vivo spontaneous activity of surviving identified SN DA neurons in isoflurane-anesthetized mice using single-unit extracellular recordings combined with juxtacellular neurobiotin labeling and post hoc TH immunohistochemistry (see schema in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows the in vivo extracellular electrical activity (top panel) and identification of a representative SN DA neuron (lower right panel) from a control mouse, 3 weeks after vehicle infusion.

For best comparison, we restricted our analysis to those DA midbrain neurons localized in the medial half of the SN (mSN), where it was possible to sample a sufficient number of surviving and spontaneously active DA neurons after 6-OHDA lesion. In contrast, we only managed to detect a small number of active DA neurons in the lateral SN (lSN), the most vulnerable part of the DA midbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Consequently, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref> compares the group data of surviving mSN DA neurons at early phase between vehicle and 6-OHDA treatment. We detected an about 60% reduction of the mean firing rates for post-6-OHDA mSN DA neurons compared to vehicle-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; vehicle: mean frequency = 7.5 ± 0.9 Hz, 6-OHDA: mean frequency = 4.7 ± 0.6 Hz, p=0.0184, Mann–Whitney test) and no significant differences in overall firing regularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; vehicle: CV = 53.9 ± 7.8%, 6-OHDA: CV = 36.1 ± 3.7%, p=0.1694, Mann–Whitney test). Moreover, we observed a significant 10-fold reduction in burst activity – quantified as the percentage of spikes fired in bursts (SFB) and burst rate – in mSN DA neurons in the 6-OHDA group compared to vehicle controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, vehicle: SFB = 31.2 ± 7.7; 6-OHDA: SFB = 2.2 ± 1.1%; p=0.0032, Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, vehicle: burst rate = 0.34 ± 0.09 Hz, 6-OHDA: burst rate = 0.04 ± 0.02 Hz; p=0.0066, Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test). This reduction was accompanied by a pronounced shift in firing pattern, characterized by a transition from busting to irregular and pacemaker-like activity, as evidenced by the changes in the autocorrelation histogram (ACH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>All other analyzed firing parameters, such as intra-burst firing frequencies, identified no additional differences between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–G</xref>). In summary, we detected a rightward shift to lower firing frequencies with a corresponding compression of the dynamic in vivo firing range in mSN DA neurons surviving the 6-OHDA lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Thus, in addition to DA cell loss, the dysfunction of surviving DA neurons might be a novel contributing factor to the extensive motor impairment observed during the early post-6-OHDA phase. In particular, transient bursts of DA SN neurons have been shown to provide start and stop signals for motor control (see ‘Discussion' for details).</p><p>Burst discharges in DA neurons are orchestrated by the interplay of patterned synaptic inputs with their intrinsic excitability, giving rise to different types of in vivo bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Otomo et al., 2020</xref>). To identify a potential contribution of cell-autonomous changes in intrinsic excitability of surviving mSN DA neurons to their impaired in vivo dynamics, we also studied these cells in vitro in synaptic isolation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> shows a representative, stable, and regular pacemaker activity of an identified mSN DA neuron from a vehicle-infused control (lower right panel), as well as a subthreshold response to hyperpolarizing current injection (lower left panel). In contrast, pacemaker activity of mSN DA neurons post-6-OHDA infusion was unstable and characterized by intermittent periods of action potential failure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, upper panel). However, subthreshold responses were similar to controls (lower right panel). Analogous to the in vivo experiments, all in vitro recorded DA neurons were NB-filled, identified, and mapped, resulting in a similar medial localization of surviving SN DA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). When in vitro pacemaker properties were compared between identified mSN DA neurons from the vehicle and the 6-OHDA groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>), we detected no differences in mean firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>, vehicle: firing rate = 1.7 ± 0.2 Hz, 6-OHDA: firing rate = 2.4 ± 0.3 Hz, p=0.1448, Mann–Whitney test), rebound delays or sag-amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref>, vehicle: rebound delay = 584.9 ± 95.8 ms, 6-OHDA: rebound delay = 429.6 ± 56.1 ms, p=0.1738, Mann–Whitney test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>, vehicle: sag-amplitude=15.3 ± 1.1 mV, 6-OHDA: sag-amplitude=13.5 ± 0.96 mV, p=0.1395, Mann–Whitney test). In contrast, a significant, about fivefold increase in pacemaker irregularity expressed as CV was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>, vehicle: CV = 6.5 ± 0.7%; 6-OHDA: CV = 33.9 ± 5.8; p=0.0007, Mann–Whitney test). Detailed observation of the raw traces revealed that the increased CV was mainly mediated by a combination of intermittent firing failure, similar to the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, and episodes of elevated frequency firing. This pattern was further supported by quantitative analysis, including the ISI distribution histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H</xref>), and the absence of significant differences between membrane voltage during active firing and voltage during pauses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2I</xref>). We also showed that these differences were preserved both in on-cell and whole-cell recordings, indicating the latter did not induce a differential bias in any of the two groups (e.g., different calcium buffering) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F and G</xref>). Finally, other fundamental in vitro electrophysiological parameters, including afterhyperpolarization, action potential width, threshold, spike overshoot, and input resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>), remained unchanged.</p><p>In short, this data demonstrates functional alterations in DA SN neurons surviving 3 weeks after a 6-OHDA infusion. These neurons exhibited a compressed dynamic range, including a 10-fold reduction of in vivo bursting. Furthermore, we observed a fivefold decrease of in vitro cell-autonomous pacemaker stability with intermittent failure of action potential firing. This compromised intrinsic in vitro excitability likely contributes to the 10-fold reduction of high-frequency in vivo firing.</p><p>In order to address the question of whether these altered properties represent stable adaptations or reflect a transient state of damage, we also studied in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology of surviving mSN DA neurons in the late phase after lesion, characterized by partial behavioral recovery of motor functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Surviving mSN DA neurons in the late post-6-OHDA phase display full recovery of the in vivo dynamic range associated with an accelerated in vitro pacemaker</title><p>We recorded and analyzed surviving mSN DA neurons in the late 6-OHDA phase analogous to the early phase (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A/I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A/I</xref>).

Among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–G</xref>), this implies that mean firing frequencies, dynamic ranges, CV, SFB, and burst rates did not differ in chronically surviving mSN DA neurons compared to those in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, vehicle: mean firing rate = 6.9 ± 0.8 Hz; 6-OHDA: mean firing rate = 7.5 ± 1.1 Hz; p=0.6038, Mann–Whitney test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, vehicle: CV = 54.9 ± 12.2%; 6-OHDA: CV = 53.3 ± 12.6%, p&gt;0.9999, Mann–Whitney test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, vehicle: SFB = 20.2 ± 9.1%, 6-OHDA: SFB = 22.2 ± 8.9%, p=0.8784, Mann–Whitney test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, vehicle: burst rate = 0.17 ± 0.08 Hz; 6-OHDA: burst rate = 0.30 ± 0.15 Hz, p=0.4308, Mann–Whitney test).

To resolve this question, we also recorded the in vitro pacemaker properties of the surviving DA mSN neurons in the late post-6-OHDA phase. Here, we found clear evidence for allostatic adaptation of these DA neurons (i.e., the presence of new homeostatic setpoint). When comparing intrinsic pacemaker frequencies, we noticed that late 6-OHDA survivors discharged almost twofold faster compared to vehicle controls (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref> vehicle: firing rate = 1.7 ± 0.2 Hz; 6-OHDA: firing rate = 2.7 ± 0.2 Hz, p=0.0035, Mann–Whitney test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2H</xref>).

Also, the sag components and the rebound delay were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>, vehicle: rebound delay = 512.8 ± 93.8 ms, 6-OHDA: rebound delay = 375.0 ± 58.9 ms, p=0.1994, Mann–Whitney test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref>, vehicle: sag-amplitude=16.4 ± 1.2 mV, 6-OHDA: sag-amplitude=19.1 ± 0.9 mV, p=0.0528, Mann–Whitney test). Other in vitro spike features were also not significantly different between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>). This accelerated pacemaker phenotype was also observed in metabolically intact DA neurons recorded in the on-cell configuration but further accelerated in the whole-cell mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F and G</xref>). This selective pacemaker acceleration by conversion from the on-cell to the whole-cell configuration in the 6-OHDA group might indicate that these surviving neurons might also possess a metabolic factor that dampens the discharge rate. Although we have not carried out further mechanistic studies, altered cytosolic calcium or cyclic nucleotide concentrations might be plausible candidates.</p><p>In summary, functional recovery of the in vivo dynamic firing range of surviving mSN DA neurons was associated with homeostatic plasticity of pacemaking (i.e., an allostatic shift of pacemaker setpoint).

The presence of 1 µM AmmTx3 not only accelerated discharge rates in both identified mSN DA neurons from vehicle- and 6-OHDA-infused mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4BC</xref> for representative cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> for mapping) but, importantly, also eliminated significant rate differences between the two treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, vehicle: mean firing rate = 4.5 ± 0.2 Hz, 6-OHDA: mean firing rate = 4.8 ± 0.3 Hz, p=0.285; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, vehicle: CV = 7.8 ± 1.3%, 6-OHDA: CV = 5.5 ± 0.4%, p=0.2517; both Mann–Whitney test).

Interestingly, when the experiments and analyses were repeated under pharmacological blockade of Kv4.3 channels, a significant increase in firing frequency was observed only in the vehicle group after transitioning from on-cell to whole-cell recordings. This may suggest differences in calcium buffering between the vehicle and 6-OHDA groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

These results substantiated the selective role of reduced Kv4.3 function in causing the accelerated pacemaker in the post-6-OHDA late phase surviving mSN DA neurons. As the reduction of Kv4.3 function might be caused by a number of different mechanisms, including reduced protein expression and/or membrane delivery of Kv4.3 subunits as well as post-translational modifications of existing Kv4.3 channel complexes (e.g., phosphorylation, redox-modification), we decided to assess Kv4.3 protein expression via immunohistochemistry.</p><p>We performed Kv4.3 immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging in vehicle and 6-OHDA-treated mice both on the ipsilateral and contralateral infusion side (see scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

As Kv4.3 channel subunits are expected to be mainly located on the cell membrane, we also investigated whether Kv4.3-immunosignals were differentially distributed across cell compartments. A robust, about 17% reduction of Kv4.3-immunosignals was observed in ipsilateral post-lesional TH-positive neurons both for cell membrane and cytoplasm ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

In summary, these immunohistochemical experiments provided evidence for a reduced expression of Kv4.3 channel proteins in late post-6OHDA mSN DA neurons. Reduced Kv4.3 protein expression is consistent with a reduction of functional Kv4.3 channels in surviving mSN DA neurons as described above and suggests that pacemaker acceleration is mediated by a reduced number of Kv4.3 channels.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Surviving dopamine (DA) substantia nigra (SN) neurons at the late post-6-hydroxy-dopamine (6-OHDA) phase showed lower Kv4.3 channel immunohistochemical signal.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design, illustrating timeline of behavioral assays, followed by multilabeling immunohistochemistry for exploring Kv4.3-channel expression differences after &gt;64 post-infusion days.

Studying these surviving SN DA neurons at two time points, we discovered time-dependent post-6-OHDA-selective differences of firing properties both in vivo and in vitro. Early after the lesion, and coinciding with prominent behavioral impairments, we detected a selective and dramatic (about 10-fold) reduction of in vivo burst firing in identified surviving SN DA neurons. At this early time point, we also found unstable and more irregular in vitro pacemaker activity in these cells, with no differences in mean firing rates, compared to those from vehicle-infused controls.</p><p>Conversely, at a later post-lesion time point (&gt;2 months), when partial motor recovery had occurred, we detected no differences in the in vivo firing range – including high frequency bursts – between surviving SN DA neurons post-6-OHDA and those from vehicle-infused mice. Surprisingly, the in vitro pacemaker rates in post-6-OHDA DA survivors were not only stable but almost twice as fast compared to those from vehicle controls. Finally, we pinpointed functional and protein Kv4.3 channel downregulation as the leading cause for this chronic post-lesional pacemaker acceleration, while the HCN channel function remained relatively stable. Our findings do not rule out additional changes in channel expression and function that are not directly involved (or counterbalancing each other) with regards to frequency and pattern control. Indeed, using an organotypic slice model, Wang and colleagues have identified enhanced bursting and upregulation of SK channels in DA neurons upon chronic 6-OHDA exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In essence, we identified a slow recovery of the dynamic in vivo firing range of surviving post-lesional DA SN neurons, linked to an allostatic acceleration of the intrinsic pacemaker by Kv4.3 channel downregulation.</p><p>Our results suggest a simple homeostatic scheme, where reducing the population size of DA SN neurons by half is at least in part compensated by a twofold increase of pacemaker speed in the remaining half of the DA SN cell population. Given the 10-fold reduction of in vivo bursting in the initial period after the lesion, it further suggests that the pacemaker setpoint rate is coupled to the in vivo high-frequency burst rate in DA mSN neurons. It is possible that a burst-related calcium signal might be detected and integrated over time to control pacemaker rate via, for example, tuning Kv4.3 expression. Recent studies have implicated the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) in coupling bursts to mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>, acting as a calcium sensor for neuronal firing rate homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Katsenelson et al., 2022</xref>). Future mechanistic studies will be necessary to investigate how in vivo bursting and intrinsic pacemaking are coupled in distinct DA subpopulations. It is, however, interesting to note that the very first descriptive study of in vivo SN DA firing patterns had already found a positive correlation between the degree of in vivo burst firing and single spike firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grace and Bunney, 1984a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grace and Bunney, 1984b</xref>). In agreement with this proposal, it was also previously found that an about fourfold reduction of in vivo burst rate via DA-selective NR1 knockout resulted in a scaled reduction of in vivo firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zweifel et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the homeostatic role of flexible Kv4.3 expression identified in this study, we previously identified Kv4.3 channels in SN DA neurons as a pathophysiological target in a transgenic mutant (A53T-SNCA) α-synuclein mouse model (without cell loss) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Subramaniam et al., 2014a</xref>). In this model, we found a pacemaker acceleration caused by oxidative impairment of Kv4.3 channels. However, the activity of SN DA neurons in the α-synuclein model was accelerated also in vivo. Thus, mutant α-synuclein expression also caused a shift of the in vivo firing range of SN DA neurons toward higher frequency. While Kv4.3 subunits were downregulated at the protein level in post-lesional SN DA neurons, mutant α-synuclein-induced oxidative Kv4.3 dysfunction as well as protein upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Subramaniam et al., 2014a</xref>). It will be interesting to test in follow-up studies if and how α-synuclein pathology affects firing and burst rate homeostasis in DA SN neurons.</p><p>Beyond pacemaker adaptations in surviving SN DA neurons, we assume that their chronic in vivo electrophysiological phenotype might also be reshaped by network level plasticity in response to DA depletion.</p><p>Our finding that the mean in vivo discharge rates were not different from controls in the presence of an accelerated intrinsic pacemaker strongly suggests a shift of the synaptic excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance toward more inhibition. Numerous studies have found altered synaptic inhibition in the DA-depleted basal ganglia (recently reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). In particular, Heo and colleagues recently demonstrated a chronic E-I balance shift toward more inhibition across several PD models including 6-OHDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heo et al., 2020</xref>). They identified a substantial contribution of additional GABA synthesis and release from reactive astrocytes in the midbrain. It has also been well-established that basal ganglia GABA neurons fire in more synchronized, hence more effective fashion after DA depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cagnan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Milosevic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Phillips et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tinkhauser et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wichmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Evans et al., 2020</xref>). This has recently been confirmed by elegant in vivo single-cell resolved studies using either gCAMP-based calcium monitoring or in vivo patch-clamp approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ketzef et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sitzia et al., 2020</xref>). The accelerated pacemaker in response to enhanced net inhibition would also be expected within the framework of homeostatic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, we explored a single-hit, non-progressive partial lesion model, which needs to be differentiated from <italic>state-of-the-art</italic> PD rodent models, which develop disease-relevant α-synuclein pathology and show progressive loss of DA SN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thakur et al., 2017</xref>). Second, we do not differentiate between DA SN subtypes. We recently showed that lateral SN DA neurons projecting to DLS possess a distinct in vivo firing phenotype compared to medial SN DA neurons projecting to either DLS or DMS in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farassat et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, recording from lateral DA SN population in lesion models would be important. However, in our current partial 6-OHDA lesion model, these lateral SN DA neurons were too severely lost to allow for more than anecdotal post-lesion electrophysiological analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). A milder version of the current model would be needed to identify their properties and responses to partial lesion. Regarding the surviving DA neuron in the medial SN, we previously showed that they have distinct projection targets, including DLS, DMS, and lateral shell of nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farassat et al., 2019</xref>). In the current study, we have not aimed for identification of axonal projections to avoid potentially confounding effects of additional brain surgery. Nevertheless, this important issue should be addressed in follow-up studies by, for example, molecular subtyping approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heymann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poulin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>). Third, we are aware that in vivo recordings carried out in isoflurane do not display the full dynamic spectrum of DA SN firing compared to awake, freely moving animals (we have discussed the aspect extensively in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farassat et al., 2019</xref>). Fourth, given the descriptive nature of our study, we do define the underlying mechanisms of the early and late changes in electrophysiological phenotypes. To what degree the early and late phenotype are caused by direct 6-OHDA toxicity, persistent damage (e.g., mitochondria), local inflammation and – we believe increasingly – by homeostatic plasticity is not addressed by this study. However, given that the in vivo phenotype recovered 2 month post-lesion, we believe it is legitimate to label the observed in vitro pacemaker adaptation homeostatic.</p><p>Finally, we would like to speculate about the possible implications of our findings for PD. In principle, cell-loss induced pacemaker plasticity, as identified here, might have a dual nature. On one hand, they might render the surviving DA SN neurons more robust in defending their phenotype and function. On the other hand, the allostatic pacemaker acceleration may amplify the innate vulnerability of an already at baseline metabolically and oxidatively challenged neuron type. The latter would be an extension of the ‘stressful pacemaker’ hypothesis of DA vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Surmeier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Surmeier et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Surmeier et al., 2017b</xref>) with its potential clinical implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guzman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liss and Striessnig, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ortner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ortner, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Parkinson Study Group STEADY-PD III Investigators, 2020</xref>).

Prior to the induction of anesthesia, a premedication of 0.2 mg/kg atropine (atropine-sulfate, Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen) was given as an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection to stabilize circulation. Anesthesia was induced in a plastic chamber, which was flooded with 5% isoflurane (Florene, AbbVie Deutschland GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Ludwigshafen, Germany) in pure oxygen (0.4 l/min). For maintenance of anesthesia, isoflurane was delivered through a breathing mask with a flow rate of 0.35 l/min and its concentration was regulated to 1.5–2.2% using an adjustable vaporizer (Uno, Zevenaar, Netherlands). The depth of anesthesia was controlled by testing the toe pinch reflex and the breathing rate (1–2 Hz). Body temperature (36°C) and respiration were constantly monitored. Lidocaine/prilocaine ointment (25 mg/g, Emla creme, AstraZeneca GmbH, 22876 Wedel) was applied prior to surgery and after suturing of the wound as local anesthetics.

For analysis, action potential thresholds (mV) were determined at dV<sub>m</sub>/dt &gt;10 mV/ms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Following in vivo recordings, animals were transcardially perfused, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farassat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schiemann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Subramaniam et al., 2014a</xref>). Fixed brains were sectioned into 60 µm (midbrain) or 100 µm (forebrain) coronal sections using a vibrating microtome (VT1000S, Leica). In vitro slices were fixed in paraformaldehyde after finishing the experiment. Sections were rinsed in PBS and then incubated in blocking solution (0.2 M PBS with 10% horse serum, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.2% BSA). For staining with the polyclonal rabbit α-synuclein phospho S129 antibody, an antigen retrieval protocol was applied prior to blocking: sections were incubated for 30 min at 80°C in sodium citrate buffer. Afterward, the standard histological protocol continued with blocking.</p><p>Sections were incubated in carrier solution (room temperature [RT], overnight) with the following primary antibodies: polyclonal guinea pig anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 1:1000; Synaptic Systems), monoclonal mouse anti-TH (1:1000; Synaptic Systems), or polyclonal rabbit anti-TH (1:1000; Synaptic Systems); mouse anti-Kv4.3 (1:1000, Alomone Labs); polyclonal rabbit α-synuclein phospho S129 (1:200, Abcam), monoclonal rabbit anti-α-synuclein aggregate (MJFR-14-6-4-2) (1:1000, Abcam). In sequence, sections were again washed in PBS and incubated (RT, overnight) with the following secondary antibodies: goat anti-guinea pig 488, goat anti-rabbit 488, goat anti-mouse 488, goat anti-mouse 568, and goat anti-rabbit 568 (all 1:750; Thermo Fisher). Streptavidin AlexaFluor-568 and Streptavidin AlexaFluor-488 (both 1:1000; Invitrogen) were used for identifying neurobiotin-filled cells. Sections were then rinsed in PBS and mounted on slides with fluorescent mounting medium (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>DAB immunocytochemistry</title><p>For DAB (3,3ʼ-diaminobenzidine) staining procedures, a Vectastain ABC Staining Kit (Vector Laboratories) was used. Coronal sections of midbrain (30 μm) areas were cut and rinsed in PBS (3 × 10 min). Similar to previous immunolabeling procedures, unspecific antigen binding sites were blocked by incubation of the sections with blocking solution (60 min, RT). Subsequently, sections were incubated with primary antibody against TH (rabbit anti-TH) overnight, rinsed in PBS (3 × 10 min), and were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies (biotinylated anti-rabbit) for 2 h at RT. In parallel, an avidin-biotin complex (ABC) was formed by pre-incubation of avidin (1:1000) with biotinylated HRP (1:1000) in PBS for 2 h at RT. Sections were rinsed in PBS (3 × 10 min) prior to incubation with ABC solution (60 min, RT). Next, sections were rinsed in PBS (2 × 10 min) and Tris buffer (1 × 10 min). Finally, DAB oxidation was developed by application of 2% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 2% NiCl<sub>2</sub>, and 4% DAB in Tris buffer using a DAB Substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories). NiCl<sub>2</sub> enhances sensitivity and intensity of DAB precipitation product. DAB oxidation was developed for 2–5 min and was stopped with Tris buffer once a specific high-contrast signal was detectable. Sections were rinsed in Tris buffer (3 × 10 min) and transferred onto gelatin-covered slides, air-dried overnight, and dehydrated in consecutive ascending alcohol concentrations (50%, 70%, 90% and 2 × 100%; 10 min each) followed by dehydration in xylol (2 × 100%; 10 min each). Finally, sections were mounted under glass coverslips with hardening mounting medium (Vectamount, Vector Laboratories).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Unbiased stereology measurements</title><p>For quantification of total cell loss, TH-DAB-labeled SN DA neurons were counted using unbiased stereology based on optical dissection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gundersen, 1986</xref>). In coronal sections (30 μm), the region of interest (ROI) was selected based on anatomical landmarks, including the medial lemniscus, which separates SN and adjacent VTA. Stereological counting provides unbiased data based on random, systematic sampling using an optical fractionator. This method involves counting of neurons with an optical dissector, a three-dimensional probe placed through a reference space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gundersen, 1986</xref>). The optical dissector forms a focal plane with a thin depth of field through the selected sections. Objects in the focus of this focal plane are located within the reference section and are counted, while objects outside of the focal plane are not counted. On top of the optical dissector, a counting frame is applied. Counting frames ensure that all neurons have equal probabilities of being selected, regardless of shape, size, orientation, and distribution. To avoid counting capped neurons at the border of a section, an additional guard zone was deployed at the upper and lower borders of each section. DA neurons within the counting frame as well as those crossing the green line (acceptance line) were counted, while DA neurons crossing the red line (rejection line) were excluded. Moreover, only neurons with a detectable nucleus in focus within the optical dissector were counted. For quantification of total cell loss, StereoInvestigator software (V5, MicroBrightField, Colchester, USA) was used in combination with BX61 microscope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). The ROI was selected and marked using a low-magnification objective lens (2×, NA 0.25, Olympus) and 12–30 serial sections of 30 μm thickness were counted, covering the entire caudo-rostral extent of the SN. To count the number of DA neurons in the SN pars compacta, a high-magnification oil-immersion objective lens (100×, NA 1.30, Olympus) (counting frame, 50×50 μm; sampling grid, 125×100 μm) was used. After counting was finished, the total number of neurons was calculated by the software using the formula described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">West, 1993</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Optical density measurements</title><p>Optical density measurements of TH-DAB-labeled striatal sections were performed using ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). Following TH-DAB labeling and TH-immunohistochemistry, images of five coronal sections (100 μm) covering the rostrocaudal axis of the striatum were captured using laser-scanning microscope (Nikon Eclipse90i, Nikon GmbH). Images were grayscale converted and mean gray values of desired striatal areas were encircled and measured. Unspecific mean gray values were measured in a defined cortical area (100 × 100 pixels) that displayed no specific TH signal due to the absence of DA innervation and were subtracted. The ventral edge of lateral ventricles served as an anatomical landmark to separate dorsal and ventral areas. For all animals, the measurement from the ipsilateral to the infusion side was divided by the contralateral side to calculate the relative optical density of the striatum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunohistochemical Kv4.3 channel signal quantification</title><p>A Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope was used for fluorescent signal detection, excitation wavelength of 488 nm for TH-signal and 568 nm for Kv4.3-channel signal. From each animal, four midbrain slices covering the caudal, intermedial, and rostral regions were selected and imaged for overview with ×4 magnification. Then ×60 magnification was used to acquire data from four areas within each SN (four images on the ipsilateral and four images on the contralateral to infusion side). All images were acquired using the same laser and camera settings. Images were exported from Nikon NIS-Elements Advanced Research (version 4.20.03) software as 8-bit TIFF files for quantification. Data was analyzed using custom-made Python 3.0 scripts with matplotlib, numpy, scimage, and scipy modules (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Roeper-Lab/Kovacheva_et_al_2025">https://github.com/Roeper-Lab/Kovacheva_et_al_2025</ext-link>). First, TH immunosignals were converted to a binary image via Otsu-thresholding algorithm to detect TH areas bigger than 400 pixels. Then, the resulting binary image was used as a mask for Kv4.3 channel immunosignal detection. For all ROIs, surface areas and mean Kv.4.3 channel signal intensity were measured. By applying erosion and dilatation algorithms on the ROIs, membrane and cytoplasm areas were segregated, allowing isolation of Kv4.3 channel immunosignal intensity for these cell compartments. Background Kv4.3 channel immunosignal was quantified in TH-immunosignal areas below the Otsu threshold. All data were then grouped according to medio-lateral and ipsi-/contralateral position for both vehicle and 6-OHDA group. Graphs and statistical analysis for this data were performed using Python custom-made scripts (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Roeper-Lab/Kovacheva_et_al_2025">https://github.com/Roeper-Lab/Kovacheva_et_al_2025</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-11-1"><title>Spike train analyses</title><p>Spike timestamps were extracted by thresholding above noise levels with IgorPro 6.02 (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, USA).

Categorical parameters, such as ACH-based firing pattern, were analyzed with the chi-squared test. Statistical significance level was set to p&lt;0.05. All data values are presented as means ± SEM. Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA), MATLAB, and Python. The scatter plots are represented with median or mean ± SEM. The resulting p-values were compared with Bonferroni-corrected α-level or Tukey post hoc comparison. A value of p≤0.05 was considered to be statistically significant; *p≤0.05, **p≤0.005, ***p≤0.0005.

and over 2 months after a 6-OHDA lesion in a Parkinsonism mouse model. They report an important early loss of burst firing and pacemaker stability, followed by a recovery of firing activity and a twofold increase in pacemaking at later stages. These compelling evidences are linked to the downregulation of the Kv4.3 potassium channel. The work provides significant insights into neuronal plasticity and will be of interest to basic neuroscientists and Parkinson's disease researchers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104037.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00f54p054</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Lebowitz</surname><given-names>Joseph J</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/009avj582</institution-id><institution>The Vollum Institute, Oregon Health &amp; Science University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

Behavioral experiments show early post lesion deficits some of which resolve over a period of 60 days. This functional recovery contrasts with the lack of any change in measures of TH expression in the dorsal lateral striatum or an increase in the number of dopamine neurons in the midbrain. Recordings from dopamine neurons both in vivo and in brain slices in the early and late stages after lesion show marked differences in firing rate and pattern. The change in firing rate is particularly evident at the late stage in experiments in brain slice experiments. The firing in vivo is somewhat normalized in lesioned animals but the pacemaker activity in brain slices is very much increased. With the administration of a potassium channel blocker that acts on the transient voltage dependent potassium conductance the firing rate in vehicle and 6OHDA treated neurons was the same. The conclusion is that the potassium conductance is increased in the late stages following 6OHDA lesion. The suggestion might be that this change in dopamine neuron activity may underlie to some degree the partial recovery of movement disorders induced by the lesion.</p><p>Comments</p><p>1. This is a tour de force that examines multiple aspects of the reaction to a partial lesion of dopamine neurons that innervate the dorso-lateral striatum. Examination of the late term plasticity both at the behavioral and electrophysiological levels is a significant contribution that illustrates the remarkable ability of the brain to adjust to trauma.</p><p>2. The identification of dopamine neurons in both in vivo and in vitro recordings is a major strength of this work.</p><p>3. The experiments used to identify the potassium conductance that is decreased after long term recovers are suggestive but may not be the whole story. Figure 3 J and K are very suggestive of a change in that conductance. The experiments in figure 4 however could also be the result of a ceiling effect on the firing rate.</p><p>Given the knowledge that pacemaker activity is the result of multiple conductances working in concert it seems that a strong statement (and even the title) that the homeostatic plasticity is the result of one specific potassium conductance might be a stretch without considerable more work that is not required for this manuscript. A change in the title and a softening of the discussion is all that is required in my opinion.</p><p>4. A thought comment. Although 6OHDA is used as a model for Parkinson's, it is not clear to me that the remarkable work done in this manuscript has any relevance to the disease. It is a superb demonstration of the plasticity of dopamine neurons and perhaps that plasticity plays a role in why the clinical onset of Parkinson's only happens after a near complete loss of dopamine neurons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Kovacheva et al. explored the electrophysiological features (homeostatic plasticity and adaptations) of surviving SN DA neurons at two distinct time points (3 weeks, &gt; 2 months) from a 6-OHDA Parkinsonism mouse model. Using both single unit recording (in vivo) and whole-cell patch clamp recording, the authors report a selective loss of burst firing (in vivo) and pacemaker instability (in vitro) of mSN DA neurons early after lesion (3 weeks). They then show that the firing activity (in vivo) of mSN DA neurons is recovered late after lesion (&gt; 2 months), which is accompanied by 2-fold increase of pacemaking activity (in vitro). They also suggest that this chronic electrophysiological adaptations in surviving mSN DA neurons are mediated by downregulation of Kv4.3 channel.</p><p>Overall, the authors do make a compelling case for homeostatic adaptations of DA neurons in a mouse model of Parkinsonism and focused on functional properties of surviving DA neurons at two distinct time points (3 weeks, &gt; 2 months) after 6-OHDA lesion. Utilizing two different E-phys techniques, they successfully acquired physiological adaptations of surviving DA neurons from very challenging experiments. In addition, data analysis and interpretation are generally reliable and convincing. These findings can be of great interest to researchers studying the physiological alterations of DA neurons in animal PD models. However, considering the previous findings from the same group, the novelty of these findings (physiological changes from a different PD-Parkinsonism model, the same molecular mechanism) is weak and there are several major concerns (clinical relevance, experimental conditions, data interpretation) that undermine the strength of this manuscript.</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>1. The 6-OHDA lesion model the authors used in this manuscript is basically non-progressive, while human Parkinsonism (or PD) is usually progressive. Thus, experimental conditions and outcomes in this model may be quite different from human PD pathology, which seriously limits the interpretation (and translation, clinical relevance) of the results from this manuscript.</p><p>2. Only male mice were used for this study, which also limits translational potential of the findings of this manuscript (there are many papers reporting distinct physiological and molecular alterations of DA neurons in several brain disorders between male and female mice).</p><p>3. The total volume of 6-OHDA injected into a single brain hemisphere (mouse) is extremely large (6 ul). Is this information correct? This can't be right. The usual volume of any solutions (drugs or viruses) injected into a mouse brain is less than 1 ul (sometimes 2 ul). And the speed of injection is also very high (250 nl / min). Considering these two unusual conditions, injection of 6-OHDA or vehicle solutions might nonspecifically affect or damage dorsal striatum (even though the optical density of TH in vehicle-treated mice looks OK).</p><p>4. Figure 1D: When comparing contra/ipsilateral ratio of paw use between vehicle groups (21d vs. &gt; 64d), it looks like that the 2nd vehicle (&gt; 64d) group shows enhanced usage of contralateral paw compared to the 1st vehicle group (21d). Is this statistically significant? Do you think this is some kind of learning effect? Moreover, although approximate, if we normalize the value of 6-OHDA group by each vehicle group at two time points, it seems like that there is a progressive reduction of contra/ipsilateral usage of paw over time by 6-OHDA lesion (approximate calculation, 21d, 5.73/38.5 = 14%; &gt;64d, 3.167/63.67 = 4.97%). If this normalized reduction of paw usage by 6-OHDA lesion is statistically significant between two different times points, can we insist this effect is caused by stable loss of SN DA neurons? And this interpretation can be compatible with the authors' main claims (including behavioral recovery)?</p><p>Figure 2:</p><p>1. Figure 2J-K: The shapes of representative voltage sags seem to be different between vehicle and 6-OHDA groups. Are there any differences in Ih current between vehicle and 6-OHDA groups?</p><p>2. Figure 2J-K: Representative recording traces (AP firing) do not reflect well the mean firing rates of the two groups. Mean firing frequency of 6-OHDA group looks smaller than vehicle group.</p><p>Figure 3:</p><p>1. Figure 3B-C: In the sample recording traces, the firing rate of 6-OHDA group looks higher than that of vehicle group (It is better to replace those sample recording traces). This tendency is also reflected in ISI histogram graph. Most of ISI in spike events are below 0.5 s in 6-OHDA group, while there is a sizable amount of spike events showing ISI above 0.5 s in vehicle group. And this interpretation is quite different from the summary statistics in Figure 3E (no difference between the groups).</p><p>2. Figure 3K and P: The amplitude of voltage sag is significantly increased in 6-OHDA group. Have you checked Ih current of mSN DA neurons in voltage clamp and any change of protein expression of HCN channel?</p><p>3. Line 283: Supple. Figure 7F should be replaced by Supple. Figure 7F and G.</p><p>4. The number of mice used (vehicle group, N = 2 mice) for in vitro whole-cell patch clamp recording is too small.</p><p>Figure 4:</p><p>1. Figure 4A-H: Vehicle-treated (bath-application) groups are missing (at least Vehicle + Vehicle group) in the experiment.</p><p>2. Pharmacological experiment alone is weak to support the claims about molecular mechanism behind the physiological adaptations of SN DA neurons after 6-OHDA lesion. Do you think that overexpression of Kv4.3 can normalize the enhanced firing of DA neurons in 6-OHDA lesion group?</p><p>3. Figure 4J-K: The intensity of background fluorescence by Kv4.3 looks very different between contralateral and ipsilateral sides. This observation is more evident in the magnified images (bottom). In addition, there are more Kv4.3 fluorescence signal outside the DA neuron perimeter in contralateral side than ipsilateral side. Is this interpretation correct? This means that downregulation of Kv4.3 also occurs in other types of neurons surrounding mSN DA neurons in ipsilateral side?</p><p>4. It would be demanding experiments, but down-regulation of Kv4.3 can be further confirmed by other experiments including qPCR or western blot (after isolation of DA neurons)?</p><p>5. What is the nature of n number in Figure 4L-M? Isolated single DA neuron or single ROI from images?</p><p>6. Identified molecular mechanism (Kv4.3) underlying homeostatic adaptations of DA neurons is not surprising (considering the authors' previous findings, Subramaniam et al., 2014a) and does not further provide any new information (how Kv4.3 can be differently regulated in distinct types of PD models or what molecular signaling leads to down-regulation of Kv4.3 in 6-OHDA lesion model, etc.). This limitation weakens the impact of the findings provided in this manuscript.</p><p>Figure S1:</p><p>- Figure S1A-B: Given the optical density of TH signal in the representative low magnification images, the injection site of 6-OHDA is very dorsal even in the dorsal striatum. Thus, it is likely that mSN DA neurons survived because they were less exposed to 6-OHDA from the beginning. Is this interpretation right or wrong? If this is the case, those live mSN DA neurons might have been just less affected by 6-OHDA.</p><p>- Figure S1A-B: If we compare two sample images (6-OHDA ipsilateral side, 21 and &gt;64 days), there is more optical density of TH in the dorsal side of dSTR in &gt;64 days group than 21 days group. However, in the summary two samples comparisons, there is no recovery of TH fiber (dSTR TH optical density ratio) at all in &gt;64 days group.</p><p>- Figure S1C: Representative TH-DAB staining images (&gt;64 days post-infusion) are missing. Furthermore, even though the authors used non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, the number of N is too small to determine statistical significance.</p><p>- Figure S1D: The authors conclude that general locomotion, measured by track length, is recovered over time. But is this claim supported by statistical analysis? Please provide p-values (ANOVA and post-hoc).</p><p>Figure S5:</p><p>- Figure S6C: Calculated spike amplitude in mSN DA neurons is around 30 mV. Is this normal in DA neurons of 8-week-old mice?</p><p>- Figure S6H: Normalized probability and cumulative ISI distribution graphs from 6-OHDA group are left-shifted compared to vehicle group. In cumulative graph, this difference looks statistically significant (If we conduct K-S test), which means that although small, firing frequency might be up-regulated in 6-OHDA lesion group (early post-6-OHDA phase). However, there is no difference in mean firing rate between vehicle and 6-OHDA groups (Figure 2M). How can we reconcile with this discrepancy?(two sample comparison with averaged mean firing rates vs. cumulative graph incorporating all the single spike traces).</p><p>Discussion</p><p>- Line 396: Considering the general locomotion and contra/ipsilateral ratio of paw use (Figure 1D, Figure S1D), it is not sure whether we can claim that substantial behavioral recovery occurred in 6-OHDA lesion group.</p><p>- How Kv4.3 expression level can be adaptively regulated in 6-OHDA parkinsonism model? Can you suggest any potential molecular signaling?<italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Kovacheva et al. examines motor behaviors and firing in medial substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic (DA) neurons in a PD neurotoxin mouse model. In this partial lesion model, 6-OHDA was injected into the dorsal striatum which induced a non-progressive cell death among lateral SN DA neurons. Behavioral experiments performed at 21- and 68-days post injection showed deficits in motor function followed by partial recovery over time. To understand the mechanisms of the partial recovery, the authors tested firing in in vivo and in vitro slice experiments. At 68 days post-lesion, in vivo experiments compared firing in control to 6-OHDA treated animals and found no difference in pacemaking or burst firing, which confirms an early study of partial lesions in rats. The main novelty (reflected in the title) is that brain slice recordings from 6-OHDA treated mice showed faster pacemaking, demonstrating that adaptation occurs in intrinsic firing. Based on immunostaining, the authors then conclude that the increased firing observed in 6-OHDA treated animals can largely be explained by a downregulation of the Kv4.3 ion channel.</p><p>This is an excellent and rigorously performed study. The data are high-quality, the presentation of the data in figures and supplemental figures is clear and transparent. The conclusion that Kv4.3 protein is downregulated in the remaining dopamine neurons in 6-OHDA treated animals is solidly supported by immunohistochemical results. Regarding the weakness of the study, it is unclear whether the 25% downregulation of Kv4.3 protein is the dominant effect here. Past work from many labs has shown that Kv4.3 plays an important role in setting the DA cell firing rate which makes it an obvious choice and Kv4.3 dowregulation is likely involved here as well. However, many other channels contribute to firing in these cells and in my opinion, there are no experiments here that sufficiently address the role of other channels or show whether lower expression of Kv4.3 is the dominant effect. In addition, the authors' reliance on immunohistochemistry to provide evidence for essentially a functional mechanistic question may be problematic as the IHC may not linearly match onto functional properties of ion channels. Therefore, the authors would improve the presentation by being more balanced in their discussion of experimental findings, particularly regarding the central importance of Kv4.3 to adaptation. Despite these short comings, this is a well-executed study with many positives.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>-Quantification of Kv4.3 immunostaining suggests a 25% reduction in Kv4.3 fluorescence signal in 6-OHDA treated animals, but how this relates to recorded currents is unclear. In fact, past work from these same authors examining the A53T α-synuclein mouse model found an increase in IHC protein signal by 30% in the A53T mice while the actually A-type current was decreased by 40% due to redox (Subramaniam et al. 2014). Therefore, absolute protein levels do not provide quantitative information regarding the amplitude, voltage-dependence or dynamics of the conductances. Here, recordings of A-type currents would have provided basic needed information. Given the authors past work and expertise, it was surprising to see that these experiments were not performed. That said, the authors should address this concern either with new experiments or in words with additional text.</p><p>-Role of other conductances should be better considered. The authors find a ~ 30% increase in sag voltage suggesting an increase in Ih. An increase in Ih alone would speed firing and shorten rebound delays. However, the authors largely ignore this increase in Ih, instead referring to it as a 'subtle difference' which seems arbitrary. There are no experiments that directly test the contribution of Ih. Therefore, it seems unjustified to exclude adaptations involving Ih in the main study conclusions while emphasizing effects of approximately the same magnitude (~25-30%) on Kv4.3.</p><p>-In the occlusion experiments, the authors show that in presence of AmmTX that the difference in sag voltage between cells from vehicle and 6-OHDA treated mice is no longer present (compare Figure 3P to 4H). However, the explanation for this effect is unclear because to my knowledge, AmmTX has little to no direct effect on HCN channels. One possibility is that the membrane potential at which the sag voltage is initially measured is not well controlled, resulting in variable recruitment of Ih. Please address this.</p><p>- The authors mention that this preparation is suitable to study &quot;functional adaptations in a stable pool of surviving SN DA neurons.&quot; The neurons tested here have survived the 6-OHDA neurotoxin but the authors do not address whether the alterations that occur result directly from the toxin. There are several studies in the literature that have tested the effects of 6-OHDA on the electrophysiology and underlying ion channels in live functioning DA neurons. Please discuss these publications in the context of the findings here.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Recovery of the full in vivo firing range in post-lesion surviving DA SN neurons associated with Kv4.3-mediated pacemaker plasticity&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by John Huguenard (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the present revised manuscript Kovacheva et al. have added experiments and analysis to work examining substantia nigra dopamine cells that remain following a unilateral partial lesion using 6-hydroxydopamine. In general, data on dopaminergic plasticity following insult remains of interest in neurodegenerative disorders and of particular value is the description of a time-course of this plasticity. The time-course is linked to a gradual improvement of some motor deficits that has been previously described. The work is technically exemplary and experimental details are reported with commendable detail. However, a few remaining concerns limit my enthusiasm for the interpretations of the current work. As I have only reviewed the revision, including responses provided to the original and separate reviewers, I am hesitant to suggest additional experiments, but added analyses may go a long way in alleviating the concerns regarding data presentation and interpretation.</p><p>1. Following an injection of 6µl of 6-OHDA into the dorsal striatum, data from recording experiments focus on the medial SNc where a larger number of dopamine neurons could be examined. However, it is unclear what the state of these neurons is, and accordingly, what they are intended to model. Are the remaining medial SNc neurons cells that took up 6-OHDA, either at levels similar to degenerated cells or at markedly reduced levels owing to their projection pattern, and were simply able to overcome the insult? Or are these neurons assumed to have not been exposed to any 6-OHDA in terminal regions and are therefore undergoing homeostatic plasticity exclusively due to the loss of cells that are more dorsal/lateral? I think it would be helpful if the text on this topic (lines 361-363) was instead moved to the introduction with a clear statement regarding the lack of longer-term plasticity at the single cell level in response to a 6-OHDA insult mentioned in response to original reviewer 3's third to last comment. (i.e. – what is the data that early adaptations are triggered by a 6-OHDA cascade but latent effects or additional aspects of that cascade are completely absent in later time points).</p><p>2. Regarding behavioral recovery the authors state that they have added in statistical details on the recovery of overall locomotion measured using track length. However I do not see these data in the revised manuscript at the listed lines (147-149). Instead, in the copy I have I see statistics on turning data and ipsilateral bias on lines 147-149, but no statistics on track length described in lines 152-154. The statistical data on track length recovery, or lack thereof seems reasonably important to make a stronger case that behavioral recovery is achieved in this model, otherwise the ipsilateral bias appears to be the singular behavior normalized in the current time window.</p><p>3. While the direct measurement of HCN currents is a meaningful addition to the work, it is unclear why the current was measured at -80 mV and not the maximal activation potential at -120mV (or all three potentials tested: -80 mV, -100mV, and -120mV). Judging by the representative traces the hyperpolarizing step to -80mV may simply not activate enough channels to reveal any difference between treatment and vehicle cells and an extremely informal analysis of the traces appears to show a marked difference in H-current amplitudes at -120mV. Either the maximal activation or entire voltage range should be analyzed and included, or the rationale for measuring this current at the apparently modest activating potential of -80mV should be provided.</p><p>4. Semi-related to above – the reduction of Kv4.3 current is dramatic and obvious. However it still seems – to me at least – to be an overstatement that blockade of Kv4.3 accelerating the pacemaking of vehicle cells to the level of 6-OHDA cells is sufficient to make the argument that it is the main driver of the observed plasticity in pacemaking. It would seem equally likely that Kv4.3 is one of a number of K<sup>+</sup> channels responsible for regulating the speed of DA neuron pacemaking (e.g. BK, SK, Kv2.1), and modulation of these other K conductances could also accelerate vehicle pacemaking to a level similar to that seen after 6-OHDA cells. And work from a genetic model of DA cells loss did indeed show a downregulation of a number of K<sup>+</sup> channel genes (González-Rodríguez et al. 2021 extended data Figure 6e). I appreciate that this is a tremendously broad concern to address experimentally, but even the examination of a single prominent K<sup>+</sup> current in addition to Kv4.3 showing a selective downregulation would go a long way to strengthen the concept of 4.3 expression as a critical plasticity locus. Alternatively, the concept of Kv4.3 as one of a number of possible loci for plasticity could be added to acknowledge the possibility of multiple conductances being altered in 64d 6-OHDA cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors present compelling evidence for homeostatic adaptations in DA neurons in a Parkinsonism mouse model, focusing on the functional properties of surviving DA neurons at early (3 weeks) and late (&gt;2 months) stages following a 6-OHDA lesion.

However, considering the previous findings from the same group, the novelty of these findings (physiological changes from a different PD-Parkinsonism model, the same molecular mechanism) is weak and there are several major concerns (clinical relevance, experimental conditions, data interpretation) that undermine the strength of this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the detailed reading and constructive remarks of the reviewer. However, we do not agree that the novelty of our finding is weak in the sense that mutant α-synuclein overexpression (Subramamian et al. 2014) and partial lesion (this manuscript) both activate mechanisms that converge on Kv4.3 channels. Importantly, they do so with very different results, which might have missed by the reviewer: on one hand, oxidative Kv4.3 dysfunction leads to dysregulation (in vivo and in vitro hyperexcitability), while cell loss (via 6-OHDA) is eventually compensated in vivo with firing frequency and pattern back to control levels but achieved with a new pacemaker setpoint via Kv4.3 downregulation. We have made this difference clearer in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1:</p><p>1. The 6-OHDA lesion model the authors used in this manuscript is basically non-progressive, while human Parkinsonism (or PD) is usually progressive.

Therefore, we have applied the model to a cohort of female mice.

The total volume of 6-OHDA injected into a single brain hemisphere (mouse) is extremely large (6 ul). Is this information correct? This can't be right. The usual volume of any solutions (drugs or viruses) injected into a mouse brain is less than 1 ul (sometimes 2 ul). And the speed of injection is also very high (250 nl / min). Considering these two unusual conditions, injection of 6-OHDA or vehicle solutions might nonspecifically affect or damage dorsal striatum (even though the optical density of TH in vehicle-treated mice looks OK).</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer correctly noted, all our experiments were controlled by vehicle infusion. Given the pump-controlled delivery of intra-striatal volumes, we indeed found no evidence for non-specific functional or structural damage. Our 6-OHDA protocol (12µg in 6µl) is no way an “extreme”– intra-striatal volume. Intrastriatal volumina ranging between 2 µl and 8 µl resulting in total 6-OHDA amount between 6 – 18 µg in the published literature in mouse are in a similar ballpark (Francardo et al. 2014) Brain; Slezia et al. (2023) Scientific reports; Mendes-Pinheiro et al. (2021) Int. J. Mol. Sci.; Stayte et al. (2020) Experimental Neurology; Lundblad et al. (2004) Neurobiol of Disease. However, somewhat alarmed by the reviewers strong statement, we explored lower volumes and drugs concentrations as alternatives. The resulting dose-response curve (see new Suppl-Figure 1E) demonstrated that our initial approach was necessary to achieve the cell loss in the range of ca. 50%.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Is this statistically significant? Do you think this is some kind of learning effect? Moreover, although approximate, if we normalize the value of 6-OHDA group by each vehicle group at two time points, it seems like that there is a progressive reduction of contra/ipsilateral usage of paw over time by 6-OHDA lesion (approximate calculation, 21d, 5.73/38.5 = 14%; &gt;64d, 3.167/63.67 = 4.97%). If this normalized reduction of paw usage by 6-OHDA lesion is statistically significant between two different times points, can we insist this effect is caused by stable loss of SN DA neurons?

In this partial lesion model, 6-OHDA was injected into the dorsal striatum which induced a non-progressive cell death among lateral SN DA neurons. Behavioral experiments performed at 21- and 68-days post injection showed deficits in motor function followed by partial recovery over time. To understand the mechanisms of the partial recovery, the authors tested firing in in vivo and in vitro slice experiments. At 68 days post-lesion, in vivo experiments compared firing in control to 6-OHDA treated animals and found no difference in pacemaking or burst firing, which confirms an early study of partial lesions in rats. The main novelty (reflected in the title) is that brain slice recordings from 6-OHDA treated mice showed faster pacemaking, demonstrating that adaptation occurs in intrinsic firing. Based on immunostaining, the authors then conclude that the increased firing observed in 6-OHDA treated animals can largely be explained by a downregulation of the Kv4.3 ion channel.</p><p>This is an excellent and rigorously performed study. The data are high-quality, the presentation of the data in figures and supplemental figures is clear and transparent. The conclusion that Kv4.3 protein is downregulated in the remaining dopamine neurons in 6-OHDA treated animals is solidly supported by immunohistochemical results. Regarding the weakness of the study, it is unclear whether the 25% downregulation of Kv4.3 protein is the dominant effect here. Past work from many labs has shown that Kv4.3 plays an important role in setting the DA cell firing rate which makes it an obvious choice and Kv4.3 dowregulation is likely involved here as well. However, many other channels contribute to firing in these cells and in my opinion, there are no experiments here that sufficiently address the role of other channels or show whether lower expression of Kv4.3 is the dominant effect. In addition, the authors' reliance on immunohistochemistry to provide evidence for essentially a functional mechanistic question may be problematic as the IHC may not linearly match onto functional properties of ion channels. Therefore, the authors would improve the presentation by being more balanced in their discussion of experimental findings, particularly regarding the central importance of Kv4.3 to adaptation. Despite these short comings, this is a well-executed study with many positives.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for detailed reading and appreciation of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments:</p><p>-Quantification of Kv4.3 immunostaining suggests a 25% reduction in Kv4.3 fluorescence signal in 6-OHDA treated animals, but how this relates to recorded currents is unclear. In fact, past work from these same authors examining the A53T α-synuclein mouse model found an increase in IHC protein signal by 30% in the A53T mice while the actually A-type current was decreased by 40% due to redox (Subramaniam et al. 2014). Therefore, absolute protein levels do not provide quantitative information regarding the amplitude, voltage-dependence or dynamics of the conductances. Here, recordings of A-type currents would have provided basic needed information. Given the authors past work and expertise, it was surprising to see that these experiments were not performed. That said, the authors should address this concern either with new experiments or in words with additional text.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have added whole-cell voltage clamp data that directly demonstrate the significantly reduced Kv4.3 whole-cell currents in surviving post-6-OHDA DA SNs (see new Figure 4J,K,M,O).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Role of other conductances should be better considered. The authors find a ~ 30% increase in sag voltage suggesting an increase in Ih. An increase in Ih alone would speed firing and shorten rebound delays. However, the authors largely ignore this increase in Ih, instead referring to it as a 'subtle difference' which seems arbitrary. There are no experiments that directly test the contribution of Ih. Therefore, it seems unjustified to exclude adaptations involving Ih in the main study conclusions while emphasizing effects of approximately the same magnitude (~25-30%) on Kv4.3.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have added whole-cell voltage clamp data that directly demonstrate that HCN whole-cell currents in surviving post-6OHDA DA SNs are not different form controls(see new Figure 4J,N).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-In the occlusion experiments, the authors show that in presence of AmmTX that the difference in sag voltage between cells from vehicle and 6-OHDA treated mice is no longer present (compare Figure 3P to 4H). However, the explanation for this effect is unclear because to my knowledge, AmmTX has little to no direct effect on HCN channels. One possibility is that the membrane potential at which the sag voltage is initially measured is not well controlled, resulting in variable recruitment of Ih. Please address this.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, the new voltage-clamp data have demonstrated a selective reduction of Kv4.3 currents with no change of HCN currents.

Following an injection of 6µl of 6-OHDA into the dorsal striatum, data from recording experiments focus on the medial SNc where a larger number of dopamine neurons could be examined. However, it is unclear what the state of these neurons is, and accordingly, what they are intended to model. Are the remaining medial SNc neurons cells that took up 6-OHDA, either at levels similar to degenerated cells or at markedly reduced levels owing to their projection pattern, and were simply able to overcome the insult? Or are these neurons assumed to have not been exposed to any 6-OHDA in terminal regions and are therefore undergoing homeostatic plasticity exclusively due to the loss of cells that are more dorsal/lateral? I think it would be helpful if the text on this topic (lines 361-363) was instead moved to the introduction with a clear statement regarding the lack of longer-term plasticity at the single cell level in response to a 6-OHDA insult mentioned in response to original reviewer 3's third to last comment. (i.e. – what is the data that early adaptations are triggered by a 6-OHDA cascade but latent effects or additional aspects of that cascade are completely absent in later time points).</p></disp-quote><p>Our study is the first to report the in vivo and in vitro physiology of surviving DA neurons in the medial SN at two time points. We have previously shown that DA neurons in the mSN project to three main areas of the striatum – the dorsolateral, dorsomedial and the lateral shell of nucleus accumbens (Farassat et al. 2019). Given the stable pattern of axonal loss after 6-OHDA infusion, more prominent in dorsal striatum (&gt;50% reduction TH optical density, Suppl—Figure 1A) but also significant in ventral striatum (&gt; 20% reduction TH optical density), demonstrates that all DA neurons – including those that survived and we recorded – had been exposed to and had taken up 6-OHDA. For the medial SN this means, that the prominent dorsal projecting DA neurons (2/3 of all DA neurons in the mSN) would have taken up more 6-OHDA and remaining ventral projecting DA SN neuron less 6-OHDA. We titrated the 6-OHDA model to about 50% overall DA cell loss to enable functional recordings of a sufficiently large set of survivors. Given the descriptive nature of our study, we cannot make mechanistic claim, which events – initially 6-OHDA toxicity directly, later persistent damage (e.g. mitochondria) or local inflammation (or combinations of these events) are driving the observed biophysical phenotypes and how this is to be separated from a purely loss-induced homeostatic plasticity. These different phases are now clearer addressed in the introduction (l. 89ff)</p><p>“Further supporting this, BerreRa et. al (BerreRa et al. 2005) proposed that early electrophysiological changes in surviving DA neurons may result directly from 6-OHDA toxicity triggering a cascade of cellular events, such as hyperpolarization mediated by K-ATP channel activation.” and in the section on limitations of study (l. 464ff).</p><p>“Fourth, given the descriptive nature of our study, we do define the underlying mechanisms of the early and late changes in electrophysiological phenotypes.

While the direct measurement of HCN currents is a meaningful addition to the work, it is unclear why the current was measured at -80 mV and not the maximal activation potential at -120mV (or all three potentials tested: -80 mV, -100mV, and -120mV). Judging by the representative traces the hyperpolarizing step to -80mV may simply not activate enough channels to reveal any difference between treatment and vehicle cells and an extremely informal analysis of the traces appears to show a marked difference in H-current amplitudes at -120mV. Either the maximal activation or entire voltage range should be analyzed and included, or the rationale for measuring this current at the apparently modest activating potential of -80mV should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion regarding an extended voltage range for measuring HCN currents. We now added the analysis of HCN-current amplitudes and activation kinetic at -100 mV and -120 mV. We also find no significant differences in HCN current properties at these more hyperpolarized membrane potentials between medial SN DA neurons from vehicle and 6-OHDA infused animals (see l. 434ff and new Supp-Figure 12AB).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Semi-related to above – the reduction of Kv4.3 current is dramatic and obvious. However it still seems – to me at least – to be an overstatement that blockade of Kv4.3 accelerating the pacemaking of vehicle cells to the level of 6-OHDA cells is sufficient to make the argument that it is the main driver of the observed plasticity in pacemaking. It would seem equally likely that Kv4.3 is one of a number of K<sup>+</sup> channels responsible for regulating the speed of DA neuron pacemaking (e.g. BK, SK, Kv2.1), and modulation of these other K conductances could also accelerate vehicle pacemaking to a level similar to that seen after 6-OHDA cells. And work from a genetic model of DA cells loss did indeed show a downregulation of a number of K<sup>+</sup> channel genes (González-Rodríguez et al. 2021 extended data Figure 6e). I appreciate that this is a tremendously broad concern to address experimentally, but even the examination of a single prominent K<sup>+</sup> current in addition to Kv4.3 showing a selective downregulation would go a long way to strengthen the concept of 4.3 expression as a critical plasticity locus. Alternatively, the concept of Kv4.3 as one of a number of possible loci for plasticity could be added to acknowledge the possibility of multiple conductances being altered in 64d 6-OHDA cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s careful consideration of our Kv4.3 occlusion experiments and the broader question of potassium channel contributions to DA SN neuron pacemaking plasticity. We fully acknowledge that Kv4.3 is one of multiple K conductances that regulate the pacemaker frequency of DA SN neurons, and that additional plastic changes in other channels cannot be ruled out. However, our results strongly support Kv4.3 downregulation as a critical driver of the observed acceleration in pacemaking.</p><p>Our pharmacological occlusion experiment using the highly selective Kv4 Blocker AmmTx3 provides direct functional evidence for the key role of Kv4.3 channels. The fact that in the presence of selective Kv4.3 inhibition, in vehicle-treated DA SN neurons and surviving 6OHDA DA SN neurons display no differences in pacemaker frequency (Figure 4 BCE) has only one simple explanation – that the main driver for the observed differences under control conditions (Figure 3JKM) is indeed Kv4.3. The reviewer voices his/her scepticism on this explanation, but does not provide an alternative explanation to explain the Kv4.3 occlusion experiment. This said, we do not rule out that other channels are also altered but not contributing to frequency control or balancing each other out. We have included this option in the text (l. 397ff).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors present compelling evidence for homeostatic adaptations in DA neurons in a Parkinsonism mouse model, focusing on the functional properties of surviving DA neurons at early (3 weeks) and late (&gt;2 months) stages following a 6-OHDA lesion. By utilizing two complementary electrophysiological techniques, they successfully characterized the physiological adaptations of surviving DA neurons in experiments that are technically challenging. Moreover, their data analysis and interpretation are robust and convincing, making these findings highly relevant to researchers studying the physiological alterations in DA neurons in animal models of Parkinson's disease.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the reviewer’s constructive feedback and encouraging comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the authors have adequately addressed most comments, some issues require further attention or correction:</p><p>- Line 109: Remove the extraneous parenthesis immediately following &quot;6-OHDA.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the reviewer’s constructive feedback and encouraging comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 119: Relocate the sample size information (N = 9) to the corresponding figure legend or include it in proper parentheses within the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The sample size (N = 9) has been added to the text (l. 126).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 126: Delete the phrase &quot;please add N numbers.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The phrase has been removed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 156: The p-value for the 21st post-infusion day is reported as &quot;p &lt; 0.0001&quot; in the manuscript, whereas it is represented as &quot;p &lt; 0.01&quot; in the figure.

This point should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>In the context of our study, Kv4.3 downregulation was identified as a key driver of the accelerated pacemaker phenotype in surviving DA SN neurons. However, additional factors, including intracellular Ca²⁺ buffering and ATP-dependent channel modulation, may contribute to the further acceleration observed in whole-cell mode. The intracellular environment of DA SN neurons contains multiple regulatory mechanisms that influence their excitability, including calcium-dependent modulation of potassium channels (e.g., SK channels), ATP-sensitive conductances, and second-messenger cascades. The pipette solution, while designed to maintain physiological conditions as much as possible, may partially disrupt these intrinsic regulatory mechanisms, thereby further accelerating pacemaking beyond what is observed in vivo. To alert the reader, we have added the following statement (l. 299ff) “This selective pacemaker acceleration by conversion from the on-cell to the whole-cell configuration in the 6-OHDA group might indicate that these surviving neurons might also possess a metabolic factor that dampens the discharge rate. Although we have not carried out further mechanistic studies, altered cytosolic calcium or cyclic nucleotide concentrations might be plausible candidates”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The manuscript employs inconsistent figure reference formats (e.g., &quot;Figure 2D,&quot; &quot;Figure 2 E-H,&quot; &quot;Figure 2E&quot;).
