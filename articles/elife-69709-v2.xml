Many cell surface receptors recycle from endosomes to the plasma membrane via a recently discovered pathway, which includes sorting-nexin SNX17, Retriever, WASH, and CCC complexes. Here, using mammalian cells, we discover that PIKfyve and its upstream PI3-kinase VPS34 positively regulate this pathway. VPS34 produces phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), which is the substrate for PIKfyve to generate PI3,5P<sub>2</sub>. We show that PIKfyve controls recycling of cargoes including integrins, receptors that control cell migration. Furthermore, endogenous PIKfyve colocalizes with SNX17, Retriever, WASH, and CCC complexes on endosomes. Importantly, PIKfyve inhibition results in displacement of Retriever and CCC from endosomes. In addition, we show that recruitment of SNX17 is an early step and requires VPS34. These discoveries suggest that VPS34 and PIKfyve coordinate an ordered pathway to regulate recycling from endosomes and suggest how PIKfyve functions in cell migration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate</kwd><kwd>Retriever</kwd><kwd>recycling</kwd><kwd>SNX17</kwd><kwd>membrane traffic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Project Grant R01 NS064015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weisman</surname><given-names>Lois S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Project Grant R01-NS099340</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weisman</surname><given-names>Lois S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Project Grant R01-DK107733</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burstein</surname><given-names>Ezra</given-names></name><name><surname>Billadeau</surname><given-names>Daniel D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship 14POST20480137</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giridharan</surname><given-names>Sai Srinivas Panapakkam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship 19POST34450253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Guangming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007270</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan Protein Folding Diseases Fast Forward Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pilot grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weisman</surname><given-names>Lois S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The synthesis of multiple phosphoinositides function in an ordered pathway to promote recycling of some receptors to the plasma membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The functions of many cell surface receptors are controlled in part via the regulation of their exposure to the cell surface. Receptors are removed from the cell surface via regulated endocytosis, and then are either returned via recycling pathways or sent to lysosomes for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cullen and Steinberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grant and Donaldson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Naslavsky and Caplan, 2018</xref>). Multiple types of receptors are regulated via endocytosis and regulated recycling. These include G-protein-coupled receptors, postsynaptic receptors for neurotransmitters, nutrient transporters, and cell adhesion proteins. Thus, gaining molecular insight into the regulation of endocytosis and mechanisms for receptor recycling is key to understanding the control of multiple physiological processes.</p><p>An important endosomal recycling pathway was recently discovered that is regulated in part by the Retriever complex. The Retriever complex is composed of three proteins, VPS29, which is also in the retromer complex, and two unique subunits, VPS35L (C16orf62) and VPS26C (DSCR3). The Retriever complex acts with the sorting nexin, SNX17, the WASH complex, and the CCC complex which includes CCDC22 (coiled-coil domain containing 22)–CCDC93 (coiled-coil domain containing 93), and several of 10 COMMD (copper metabolism MURR1 domain)-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McNally and Cullen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simonetti and Cullen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) to regulate trafficking of cargoes and membranes from early endosomes back to the cell surface. Proteomic studies revealed that this pathway traffics over 120 cell surface proteins in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McNally et al., 2017</xref>), which establishes SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH as an important pathway for protein recycling.</p><p>The best characterized cargoes of the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH pathway are the integrins, which are transmembrane proteins that control cell migration via regulation of focal adhesion complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wozniak et al., 2004</xref>). While integrins traffic through the SNX17 pathway, it remains an open question whether integrins can also go to the cell surface via the SNX27 Retromer pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kvainickas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>). Note that the levels of Retriever-specific subunits are much lower than Retromer subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Itzhak et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Integrins that are exposed on the cell surface connect the intracellular actin network to the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>). Integrin levels at the cell surface are controlled both by their endocytosis into endosomes and their subsequent recycling back to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moreno-Layseca et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, understanding how integrin recycling is controlled is of great interest.</p><p>Control of the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH pathway likely occurs in part via SNX17 recognition of cargoes as well as SNX17 association with the other proteins of the transport machinery. SNX17 specifically binds β1-integrin as well as other cargo receptors via direct interaction with an NPxY motif on the cytoplasmic side of the cargo protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Böttcher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chandra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McNally et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Steinberg et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, SNX17 binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chandra et al., 2019</xref>). The WASH complex is recruited to endosomes via the Retromer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harbour et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harbour et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Helfer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zavodszky et al., 2014</xref>), and is also likely recruited by binding to PI3P via the FAM21 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jia et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>PI3P is one of seven phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol (PPI), which are low abundance signaling lipids that play multiple essential roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Craene et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schink et al., 2016</xref>). The seven PPI species are defined by their phosphorylation status at positions 3, 4, 5 of the inositol ring. The synthesis and turnover of PPIs are spatially and temporally regulated by several lipid kinases and phosphatases. PPI lipids act via the recruitment and control of their downstream effector proteins and orchestrate various cellular events including cell signaling, cytoskeletal organization, membrane trafficking, cell migration, and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dickson and Hille, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Some of the cellular PI3P serves as a substrate for PIKfyve, the lipid kinase that generates phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI3,5P<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hasegawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shisheva, 2012</xref>). PIKfyve also serves as the primary source for cellular pools of phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P), likely via the action of lipid phosphatases on PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zolov et al., 2012</xref>) and possibly by direct synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shisheva, 2012</xref>). PIKfyve exists in a protein complex which includes the lipid phosphatase, Fig4 and scaffold protein, Vac14. Both Fig4 and Vac14 positively regulate PIKfyve kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Araujo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dove et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shisheva, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Strunk et al., 2020</xref>). Loss of PIKfyve or its positive regulators causes defects in lysosomal homeostasis and results in enlargement of endosomes and lysosomes in a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Araujo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dove et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shisheva, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The PIKfyve pathway is critical for normal function of multiple organs and tissues. Fig4 or Vac14 knockout mice die perinatally and exhibit profound neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chow et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, mutations in FIG4 and <italic>VAC14</italic> have been linked to neurological diseases including Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Furthermore, homozygous null mutations in human FIG4 lead to infantile death and impairment of multiple organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lenk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>). Likewise, a PIKfyve hypomorphic mouse mutant dies perinatally and in addition to neurodegeneration has defects in multiple organs including the heart, lung, and kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zolov et al., 2012</xref>). A whole-body knockout of PIKfyve results in very early lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ikonomov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Takasuga et al., 2013</xref>). Together these studies indicate that PIKfyve is required for multiple physiological pathways and functions in multiple cell types and organs.</p><p>Recent studies indicate that PIKfyve plays roles in cell migration, cell polarization, and cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cinato et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dayam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dupuis-Coronas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oppelt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oppelt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shi and Wang, 2018</xref>). However, a full understanding of the molecular mechanisms whereby PIKfyve regulates cell migration remain to be established. Here, we show that PIKfyve activity is required for cell migration. We discover that this occurs in part through regulation of the surface levels of β1-integrin via PIKfyve control of the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PIKfyve positively regulates cell migration</title><p>Recent studies using siRNA silencing as well as inhibition of PIKfyve indicate that PIKfyve plays a role in cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cinato et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oppelt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oppelt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shi and Wang, 2018</xref>). To further investigate, we performed wound healing assays in the presence of two chemically distinct PIKfyve inhibitors, YM201636 and apilimod. In cultured cells, compared to vehicle control, PIKfyve inhibition with apilimod and YM201636 delayed wound healing by 45% and 40%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Importantly, inhibition of PIKfyve did not significantly affect cell viability or proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the delay in wound healing reflects a decrease in the ability of the cells to migrate.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PIKfyve positively regulates cell migration in part via regulation of cell surface levels of β1-integrin.</title><p>(A–B) Inhibition of PIKfyve delays cell migration.

Primary neonatal cardiac fibroblasts were analyzed in wound healing assays. Inhibition of PIKfyve with YM201636 impaired wound closure by 21% as compared to DMSO-treated cardiac fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). Similar results were observed with apilimod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cinato et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to chemical inhibition, we sought genetic evidence, and performed wound healing experiments with primary fibroblasts derived from the hypomorphic PIKfyve<sup>β-geo/β-geo</sup> mouse mutant, which expresses about 10% of the wild-type levels of PIKfyve and half the levels of PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and PI5P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zolov et al., 2012</xref>). PIKfyve<sup>β-geo/β-geo</sup> fibroblasts showed strong defects in cell migration and exhibited a 30% reduction in wound healing compared to wild-type fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C-D</xref>).</p><p>Cell spreading is important for cell migration and can be observed within an hour of seeding cells. This enabled us to monitor the impact of PIKfyve inhibition within a shorter time frame. We assessed the ability of newly seeded cells to spread on plastic dishes coated with fibronectin, a component of the extracellular matrix. We found that inhibition of PIKfyve for 1 hr reduced cell spreading by 22% as compared to DMSO-treated control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E-F</xref>).</p><p>The above studies, as well as previous studies, relied solely on lowering PIKfyve activity. To further test whether PIKfyve has a direct role in cell migration, we took the converse approach and tested whether elevation of PIKfyve activity promotes cell migration. We identified a hyperactive allele, PIKfyve-KYA, which elevates PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and PI5P 4-fold and 2-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCartney et al., 2014b</xref>). Inducible expression of PIKfyve-KYA and wild-type PIKfyve was achieved via engineered Flp-In HEK293T cell lines. Induction of PIKfyve-KYA caused a significant increase in wound healing, by approximately 20%, whereas induction of wild-type PIKfyve resulted in a similar degree of cell migration to that observed in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). The wound healing of these three cell lines was not different in the absence of doxycycline induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G-H</xref>). Together, these results suggest that PIKfyve activity directly impacts cell migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PIKfyve activity plays a role in controlling surface levels of β1-integrin</title><p>That PIKfyve plays a direct role in cell migration, provided an opportunity to determine specific pathways that are directly regulated by PIKfyve. Integrins play a crucial role in cell migration. Thus, we tested whether PIKfyve activity correlates with integrin localization. Integrins are heterodimers of α and β chains, and β1-integrin is the most commonly found integrin β subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moreno-Layseca et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore tested whether PIKfyve activity plays a role in the levels of β1-integrin at the cell surface. Notably, using immunofluorescence or flow cytometry, which allowed us to count many more cells, we found that when compared with DMSO-treated cells, apilimod treatment for 1 hr resulted in 21% and 18% less surface-exposed β1-integrin, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). To further probe the importance of PIKfyve, we used siRNA to deplete PIKfyve and assessed the impact of loss of PIKfyve on the surface levels of β1-integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Compared to control siRNA-treated cells, depletion of PIKfyve leads to a decrease in surface levels of β1-integrin by 21%. Importantly, simultaneous expression of siRNA-resistant PIKfyve in siRNA-treated cells rescued integrin levels and furthermore increased them to 21% above the levels in cells treated with control siRNA alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B-C</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, we tested whether an increase in PIKfyve activity increases the surface levels of β1-integrin. We transiently expressed wild-type PIKfyve and PIKfyve-KYA in HeLa cells, and observed a 60% and 107% increase, respectively, in β1-integrin on the cell surface as compared to untransfected control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>). These findings suggest that PIKfyve activity regulates cell migration in part by regulating surface levels of β1-integrin.</p><p>Confidence in the biological significance of the lowered levels of β1-integrin observed by both chemical inhibition and knock-down of PIKfyve is further supported by observations that overexpression of PIKfyve or expression of hyperactive PIKfyve results in an increase in β1-integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>). A potential reason why bigger effects due to inhibition or knock-down of PIKfyve are not observed is that some PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and/or PI5P may still be present. In an earlier study we found that fibroblasts from a hypomorphic PIKfyve<sup>β-geo/β-geo</sup> mouse mutant, which expresses 10% of the wild-type levels of PIKfyve, or shRNA of PIKfyve in wild-type fibroblasts, which reduces PIKfyve to 17% of wild-type levels, each still had approximately half of the normal levels of PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and PI5P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zolov et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, at relatively short time points used for PIKfyve inhibition, there is still some remaining PI3,5P<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Inhibition of PIKfyve results in the accumulation of β1-integrin within internal compartments</title><p>That the surface levels of β1-integrin decrease following just 1 hr of PIKfyve inhibition suggests that PIKfyve has an acute role in the regulation of integrin levels at the cell surface. To test this further, we determined the fate of surface β1-integrin after acute inhibition of PIKfyve for 15 or 30 min. We labeled HeLa cells with an antibody against an extracellular epitope of β1-integrin and assessed the levels of surface exposed and internalized β1-integrin in the presence of either DMSO or apilimod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Using methods to solely label surface integrin, we found that many of the cells were permeabilized during incubation on ice and subsequent fixation. Thus, we used an indirect approach. We fixed and permeabilized the cells, performed immunofluorescence localization of total β1-integrin. To estimate surface β1-integrin, we measured the amount within 0.8 µm of the cell border. In untreated cells, the percent of surface β1-integrin at the cell border was 25%. Following 30 min of incubation in DMSO, the amount of labeled integrin at the cell border exhibited a modest decrease to 21% of total integrin. In contrast, inhibition of PIKfyve for 30 min caused a much larger decrease in the amount of integrin at the cell border to 13.7%.

Since endogenous PIKfyve colocalizes with several endocytic compartments, we specifically tested the impact of PIKfyve inhibition on recycling of internalized β1-integrin back to the cell surface. To generate a pool of labeled, internalized β1-integrin, we performed a pulse, where untreated HeLa cells were incubated for 1 hr in the presence of an antibody against an extracellular epitope of β1-integrin. For the chase, the start of the recycling assay (0 time), cells were exposed to an acid wash to strip off any antibody bound to surface-exposed β1-integrin. Cells were then treated with either apilimod or DMSO and further incubated for 15 or 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–E</xref>). Notably, at 15 min, the amount of antibody-labeled internalized β1-integrin that recycled back to plasma membrane was significantly lowered by 0.58-fold in cells treated with apilimod as compared to DMSO-treated cells. Moreover, after 30 min of treatment, the apilimod-treated cells had 0.45-fold less surface β1-integrin compared with DMSO-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). In addition, we determined the internalized pool of β1-integrin that remained trapped in internal compartments. At the 15 and 30 min time points, we performed a second acid wash to remove antibodies attached to integrin that returned back to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–J</xref>). Consistent with a defect in the return of β1-integrin back to the cell surface, inhibition of PIKfyve resulted in an increase in the internal, labeled, non-recycled pool of β1-integrin. In cells treated with apilimod for 15 min, the internal-non-recycled pool of β1-integrin was significantly higher by 20% compared with DMSO-treated cells, and this accumulation was 30% higher after 30 min of apilimod treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>).

When compared with DMSO controls, PIKfyve inhibition resulted in significantly more labeled β1-integrin in each of the compartments that are part of its itinerary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This suggests that PIKfyve activity is required for the exit of β1-integrin from several endocytic compartments.</p><p>Specifically, the amount of integrin present in EEA1 compartments in DMSO-treated cells decreased by 35% at 15 min and this amount further decreased to 56% at 30 min. In contrast, with PIKfyve inhibition, there was not a significant decrease in the amount of integrin present in EEA1 compartments at either 15 or 30 min. This indicates a delay in the exit of integrin from early endosomes. Similarly, in DMSO-treated cells, the amount of integrin present in LAMP1-positive compartments decreased approximately 32% at 15 and 30 min. However, following PIKfyve inhibition, there was no observable decrease in integrin in LAMP1 compartments. Together, these data show that PIKfyve inhibition causes a delay in the exit of β1-integrin from early and late endosomes. Note that, β1-integrin is recycled from both of these compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moreno-Layseca et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Some of the β1-integrin in LAMP1 compartments could potentially be targeted for lysosomal degradation. However, at the time points measured, we did not see an impact of PIKfyve inhibition on the degradation of β1-integrin. The total level of β1-integrin was not significantly altered after apilimod treatment for 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We also tested whether PIKfyve activity is required for the trafficking of β1-integrin through either RAB4 or RAB11 compartments, which are part of the fast and slow recycling pathways, respectively. In cells treated with DMSO for 15 or 30 min, the amount of β1-integrin in RAB11-positive compartments decreased by approximately 66%. In contrast, during PIKfyve inhibition the amount of integrin in apilimod-treated cells had a more modest decrease of 22% and 34%, at 15 and 30 min of treatment, respectively. The difference between DMSO and apilimod-treated cells suggested either a decrease in the rate of exit of integrin from RAB11 compartments or increased transport of integrin to RAB11 compartments from early endosomes. However, since the exit of integrin from early endosomes is also defective, the increase in integrin in RAB11 endosomes is likely due to defects in recycling of β1-integrin toward the plasma membrane.</p><p>There were similar defects in the trafficking of β1-integrin from RAB4 compartments. In cells treated with DMSO for 15 and 30 min, the amount of integrin remaining in RAB4 endosomes was significantly lower by 57% and 67%, respectively. In comparison, following PIKfyve inhibition, the decrease in β1-integrin in RAB4 endosomes was only 27% at 15 min and 48% after 30 min. Thus, short-term inhibition of PIKfyve also slows the recycling of β1-integrin from RAB4 endosomes. Together, these studies suggest that PIKfyve plays a role in the recycling of β1-integrin from all endocytic compartments tested including early and late endosomes as well as fast and slow recycling endosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>PIKfyve colocalizes with SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH complex proteins</title><p>β1-integrin recycling from endosomes is regulated by the sorting nexin, SNX17, the Retriever complex, the CCC complex, and the actin regulatory WASH complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McNally and Cullen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simonetti and Cullen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).

Similar to PIKfyve inhibition, depletion of PIKfyve also caused a decrease in surface levels of α5-integrin levels by 17%.

We chose EGFR because in a previous study we found that its trafficking was not affected in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) generated from Vac14-/- mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, inhibition of PIKfyve using conditions that impacted integrins and LRP1 does not alter the surface levels of EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). These findings suggest that acute inhibition of PIKfyve does not impact all membrane trafficking pathways that require endosomal function.</p><p>In further support that PIKfyve is required for the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH pathway, we tested and found that PIKfyve colocalizes with SNX17 and subunits of the WASH (Strumpellin and FAM21), Retriever (VPS35L), and CCC (COMMD1 and CCDC93) complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>). Utilizing Mander’s coefficient, we quantified the fraction of the indicated proteins that overlap with endogenous PIKfyve-positive puncta and observed a colocalization of 30–50% of endogenous PIKfyve with the proteins implicated in β1-integrin recycling. This colocalization was not observed in the non-edited control HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

We tested colocalization of these proteins with VPS35-positive endosomes because both the Retromer and Retriever pathways emerge from VPS35 containing endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McNally et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Singla et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, PIKfyve exhibits a strong colocalization with VPS35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Importantly, for each CCC and Retriever subunit tested, acute inhibition of PIKfyve for 30 min caused a significant decrease in their colocalization with VPS35 endosomes. The CCC subunits COMMD1, COMMD5, and CCDC93 were lowered by 22%, 20%, and 30%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

As an orthogonal approach, we tested the changes in COMMD1 localization during depletion of PIKfyve and observed a similar trend. Compared to mock siRNA-treated cells, siRNA depletion of PIKfyve resulted in a 15% decrease in endosomal localization of COMMD1. Importantly this decrease was rescued by expression of PIKfyve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The reliance of the Retriever complex on PIKfyve may either be due to direct binding of some Retriever subunits to PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and/or PI5P, or may be due to a requirement for the presence of the CCC complex on endosomes, since the Retriever complex interacts with the CCC complex, and a portion of VPS35L is associated with the CCC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McNally et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Phillips-Krawczak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Singla et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In contrast with the partial loss of CCC and Retriever proteins from membranes, acute inhibition of PIKfyve resulted in a 27% increase in SNX17 on VPS35-positive endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). The increased recruitment of SNX17 may be due to an elevation in PI3P that occurs during inhibition of PIKfyve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zolov et al., 2012</xref>). The WASH complex subunit, FAM21, remained unchanged.</p><p>To further determine whether the effects observed during PIKfyve inhibition were due to elevation in PI3P or lowering PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> or PI5P, we sought to determine the enzyme that generates the PI3P pool that recruits SNX17. In MEFs, approximately, two-thirds of the PI3P pool comes from VPS34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devereaux et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ikonomov et al., 2015</xref>). Note that inhibition of VPS34 also lowers PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and PI5P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devereaux et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ikonomov et al., 2015</xref>). This is because PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> is synthesized from PI3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sbrissa et al., 1999</xref>), and PI5P is synthesized from PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zolov et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To further test a role for PI3P in the recruitment of SNX17, we inhibited VPS34 with VPS34-IN1, and found that there was significantly less SNX17 on VPS35 endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). In addition, we observed less VPS35L and COMMD1. These changes are likely due to lower levels of PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and PI5P, as inhibition of PIKfyve with apilimod also lowered the levels of these proteins on VPS35 endosomes. The levels of FAM21 were also lower. These changes are likely due to lower levels of the PI3P, PI3,5P<sub>2</sub>, and/or PI5P.</p><p>To determine effects due to lowering PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and PI5P, under conditions where PI3P levels are not elevated, we tested and found that a combination of 1 μM apilimod, and 0.1 µM VPS34-IN1, resulted in lower PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and PI5P, but normal cellular levels of PI3P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>). Note that the methods used here to measure phosphoinositides, report on total cellular levels, and would not detect a change at a specific membrane domain.</p><p>We tested and found that lowering PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and PI5P under conditions without detectable changes in PI3P resulted in no change in SNX17 recruitment. However, there was less VPS35L, COMMD1, and FAM21 on VPS35 endosomes. We tested whether we could use an orthogonal biochemical approach, mild digitonin treatment, to assess changes in membrane binding of the SNX17 pathway proteins. However, this treatment removed 80–95% of many of the tested subunits. This indicates that most of the complex is either weakly associated with membranes or cytosolic. It is not possible to obtain good quantitative data of an additional 15–20% lowering of this small amount of remaining protein. Thus, this approach is not useful for measuring changes in the membrane pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>A summary of trends in phosphoinositide levels with each treatment are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s7">Figure 7—figure supplement 7</xref>. These studies indicate that conversion of PI3P to PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> or PI5P plays an important role in ordered recruitment of these complexes. While SNX17 requires PI3P to associate with these endosomes, VPS35L (Retriever) and COMMD1 (CCC) require the synthesis of PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and/or PI5P. Additionally, the localization of FAM21 to endosomes requires the generation of either PI3P, PI3,5P<sub>2</sub>, and/or PI5P. Consistent with this finding, FAM21 binds multiple phosphorylated phosphoinositide lipids in vitro, including PI3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jia et al., 2010</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that that the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH recycling pathway may be ordered by a phosphoinositide cascade, where PI3P is necessary for the recruitment of SNX17 to WASH complex-containing endosomes, and PI3P-dependent recruitment of PIKfyve generates PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and/or PI5P which facilitates the recruitment the CCC and Retriever complexes.</p><p>To further probe how PIKfyve recruits the CCC complex, we focused on COMMD1, a CCC subunit which functions as an obligate dimer and binds multiple phosphorylated phosphoinositide lipids including PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and PI5P in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Healy et al., 2018</xref>). Mutation of residues that comprise a basic patch on COMMD1, R133Q, H134A, and K167A (COMMD1-QAA) abolished the ability of COMMD1 to bind phosphoinositide lipids in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Healy et al., 2018</xref>). However, this mutant bounds membranes in cells, although there were no further tests of function. Note that in this mutant, two of the basic residues were substituted with alanine, which is hydrophobic and could potentially cause non-specific sticking to cellular membranes. Thus, we mutated the same sites to R133E, H134Q, and K167E (COMMD1-EQE). We expressed this mutant as well as the original COMMD1-QAA mutant in COMMD1-/- cells and found that as previously reported, there was no statistically significant difference in the binding of COMMD1 and the original COMMD1-QAA mutant to endosomes, 17.1% and 15.9%, respectively. In contrast, the COMMD1-EQE mutant exhibited a statistically significant defect in its association with VPS35 endosomes, where 14.8% bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Surprisingly, we found that the COMMD1-QAA mutant was expressed at 8.6-fold higher levels than wild-type COMMD1. This much higher level of expression may explain why the COMMD1-QAA mutant rescued recycling and bound normally to membranes, while the COMMD1-EQE exhibited a defect.</p><p>The assumption was that the surface residues, R133, H134, and K167, are solely involved in binding to phosphoinositide lipids. However, we tested and found that mutation of these sites also resulted in a partial defect in COMMD1 association with the CCC subunit, CCDC93. We expressed wild-type COMMD1 and the COMMD1-QAA or COMMD1-EQE mutants in HeLa cells and found that mutating R133, H134, and K167 partially affected the binding between CCDC93 and COMMD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). When accounting for the amount of COMMD1 pulled down in each experiment, both the COMMD1-QAA and COMMD1-EQE mutant had 40% and 60% less association with CCDC93, when compared with wild-type COMMD1. The difference between COMMD1-QAA and COMMD1-EQE was not statistically significant.</p><p>It is not surprising that mutation of a phosphoinositide binding site would also impair the formation of the CCC complex. Formation of the complex could potentially require association with membranes. Alternatively, this site may play a direct role in formation of the CCC complex. Thus, while it is possible that impaired association with PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> underlies the defect in COMMD1-EQE binding to endosomes, and accounts for a defect in recycling, it is also possible that the defect in the COMMD1-EQE mutant is due to a partial disruption of the CCC complex that is independent of its interaction with phosphoinositide lipids.</p><p>Importantly, the experiments showing that apilimod or siRNA depletion of PIKfyve impairs the SNX17 recycling pathway, and results in a loss of the CCC complex and Retriever complex from endosomes, suggests that PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and PI5P play important roles in regulating the recruitment and/or function some CCC and possibly some Retriever subunits.</p><p>In addition to regulation of the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH recycling pathway, PIKfyve could potentially play a role in β1-integrin recycling via control of endosome associated actin. A previous study revealed that PIKfyve negatively regulates cortactin, which in turn causes excessive Arp2/3 activity and hyperaccumulation of actin on endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hong et al., 2015</xref>). In those studies, PIKfyve was inhibited for 2 hr. However, in the shorter time frame of PIKfyve inhibition used in this study, we did not find any changes in the amount of cortactin that localizes to endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s8">Figure 7—figure supplement 8</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The best characterized roles of PIKfyve are its functions on lysosomes.

These include the regulation of multiple lysosomal ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">She et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">She et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), as well as roles in the fission and reformation of lysosomes and related organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bissig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krishna et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yordanov et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While the most apparent defects in cells following loss of PIKfyve activity are enlarged lysosomes, the multiple pleiotropic defects observed strongly suggest that PIKfyve plays key roles elsewhere in the cell. As an approach to gain mechanistic insight into roles for PIKfyve that are not lysosome-based, we sought mechanistic insight into roles for PIKfyve in cell migration.</p><p>The studies reported here reveal that PIKfyve has roles at endosomes and has a direct role in the regulation of the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH complex. Moreover, endogenously tagged PIKfyve extensively colocalizes with SNX17, Retriever, CCC, and WASH complexes. PIKfyve has a robust 44% colocalization with VPS35, a subunit of the Retromer complex, as well as with the Retriever subunit, VPS35L. In addition, it is likely that PIKfyve specifically localizes to endosomes that are actively engaged in membrane transport. Early endosomes undergo rapid conversion to late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rink et al., 2005</xref>), and this process is linked to Retromer and Retriever-based transport which occurs from the same membrane subdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McNally et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Singla et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, RAB5 and RAB7 act in concert to regulate Retromer recruitment to endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Seaman et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the hypothesis that a major pool of PIKfyve is localized to endosomal compartments involved in recycling fits with the observation that the best colocalization of PIKfyve is with VPS35, followed by good colocalization with EEA1 and RAB7.</p><p>Our mechanistic analysis of roles of PIKfyve with the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH complexes relied primarily on acute inhibition, which is likely to reveal pathways where PIKfyve plays a direct role. In addition, these studies were aided by utilization of a hyperactive allele of PIKfyve. Importantly, activation of PIKfyve had the opposite effect of PIKfyve inhibition, which provides additional evidence that PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and/or PI5P play direct roles in the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH pathway, and in β1-integrin recycling.</p><p>Results reported here, together with earlier studies reveal that the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH recycling pathway is ordered by changes in phosphoinositide lipids as well as a web of protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). VPS34, which resides on endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christoforidis et al., 1999</xref>), provides the PI3P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) for recruitment of SNX17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chandra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jia et al., 2014</xref>), where it can then bind its cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Böttcher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Steinberg et al., 2012</xref>). The generation of PI3P also recruits PIKfyve, via its FYVE domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stenmark et al., 2002</xref>), which initiates the production of PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and PI5P.

Importantly, recruitment of MTMR2 lowers PI3P and PI3,5P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Singla et al., 2019</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that PI3P and PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> coordinate the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH pathway. PI3P is required for initiation, PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and/or PI5P act in the middle steps, and MTMR2, which removes PI3P and PI3,5P<sub>2</sub>, acts late in the pathway. Once the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH complex assembles with cargo, the WASH complex mediates actin nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Derivery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomez and Billadeau, 2009</xref>) and SNX17 recruits EHD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dhawan et al., 2020</xref>) to enable fission of cargo containing membranes for efficient recycling.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69709-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The studies reported here also show that SNX17 and the WASH complex can bind to endosomes without the Retriever and CCC complexes. However, endosomes that contain SNX17 and the WASH complex are not sufficient for the recruitment of either the Retriever or CCC complexes. PIKfyve activity is also needed for recruitment of Retriever and CCC complexes. Furthermore, the CCC subunit CCDC22 recruits MTMR2, which is required for late steps in this recycling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Singla et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, we found that recruitment of MTMR2 lowers both PI3P and PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Singla et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH pathway may be ordered in part via an initiation step that involves PI3P, middle steps that require PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and/or PI5P and a late step via MTMR2 that removes PI3P and PI3,5P<sub>2</sub>. Finally, once the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH complex assembles with cargo, the WASH complex mediates actin nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Derivery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomez and Billadeau, 2009</xref>) and SNX17 recruits EHD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dhawan et al., 2020</xref>) to enable fission of cargo containing membrane for efficient recycling.</p><p>While we favor a model where positive regulation of the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH pathway occurs via direct binding of some of the subunits within these complexes to PI3P and PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> or PI5P, it is possible that these lipids are impacting the pathway in a more global way. For example, PIKfyve is important for endosome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Messenger et al., 2015</xref>), and this could play a role in how PIKfyve regulates the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH pathway.</p><p>The new role for PIKfyve in endocytic recycling reported here may partially explain a recent study which showed that treatment of cells with 100 nM apilimod for 16 hr resulted in a reduction in steady-state levels of exogenously expressed, FLAG-TGFβ-R2 at the cell surface. Note that the recycling pathway utilized by TGFβ-R2 is currently unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cinato et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have also revealed roles for PIKfyve on endosomes. The PIKfyve pathway plays a role in the formation of Stage I melanosomes, which are derived from early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bissig et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, we and others previously showed that knock-down of the PIKfyve pathway causes a defect in recycling of CI-MPR from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Lartigue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rutherford et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>), although the mechanistic basis of this defect remains unknown. Moreover, a recent study revealed that SNX11, which plays a role in the delivery of some cargoes from endosomes to lysosomes, binds to PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, PIKfyve inhibition caused the accumulation of the tight junction proteins, claudin1 and claudin2, into endosomes and delayed the formation of epithelial permeability barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dukes et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, PIKfyve inhibition did not affect the surface localization of claudin4 or the surface levels of EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that PIKfyve regulates specific recycling pathways. Additionally, heterologous studies in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes suggested a connection between PIKfyve activity and RAB11 endosomes that regulate endocytic recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seebohm et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Seebohm et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, we previously found that PIKfyve provides acute regulation of the levels of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) at neuronal postsynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCartney et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Those studies suggested that PIKfyve is a negative regulator of AMPAR recycling, which is the opposite of PIKfyve providing positive regulation of α5-integrin, β1-integrin, and LRP1 recycling. The difference may be that while these latter proteins traffic via the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH pathway, AMPAR recycles via the SNX27-Retromer pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, PIKfyve may differentially regulate these two pathways. Alternatively, the role of PIKfyve in recycling from endosomes to the plasma membrane in neurons may be different from the role of PIKfyve in other cell types.</p><p>In addition to regulating surface levels of β1-integrin, PIKfyve likely regulates cell migration via control of additional pathways. Previous studies suggested that PIKfyve may also regulate cell migration via the activation of the Rac1-GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dayam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oppelt et al., 2014</xref>). PIKfyve regulation of Rac1 activation and integrin recycling may occur in parallel. In addition, there is extensive cross-talk between Rho GTPases and focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vitali et al., 2019</xref>), thus integrin trafficking and Rac1 activation may be linked with each other.</p><p>Apilimod, the PIKfyve inhibitor used in these studies, has recently been proposed as a drug to investigate further for the treatment of COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Riva et al., 2020</xref>), and also blocks the infection of Ebola virus in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nelson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Qiu et al., 2018</xref>). Apilimod may block SARS-CoV-2 entry via loss of positive regulation of TPC2, a downstream target of PIKfyve that resides on lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ou et al., 2020</xref>). The new studies presented here suggest an additional potential mechanism and indicate that the effect of apilimod on surface levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Neuropilin-1 should also be investigated. ACE2 and Neuropilin-1 levels at the plasma membrane are regulated. Importantly, each have been proposed to serve as receptors for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daly et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, a genome-wide screen to identify proteins that regulate entry of SARS-CoV2 identified subunits of the CCC, Retriever, and WASH complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). Together, the potential of apilimod as an antiviral drug heightens the urgency of determining the multiple cellular functions of PIKfyve, and the elucidation of pathways that are impacted by acute inhibition of PIKfyve.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-HA (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell signaling</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2,367 (6E2) RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_10691311">AB_10691311</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-HA (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell signaling</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3,724 (C29F4) RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_1549585">AB_1549585</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF and WB (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CCDC93 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Proteintech</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">20861-1-1AP RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_10696446">AB_10696446</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF (1:200) and WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">COMMD1 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R&amp;D systems</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MAB7526 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2895087">AB_2895087</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">COMMD1 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Proteintech</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">11938–1-AP RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2083542">AB_2083542</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">COMMD5 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Proteintech</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10393–1-AP RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2083555">AB_2083555</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cortactin (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Millipore</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">05–180 (4 F11) RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_309647">AB_309647</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EEA1 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BD biosciences</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">610456 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_397829">AB_397829</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF (1:25)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EEA1 (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell signaling</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3,288 (C45B10) RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2096811">AB_2096811</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FAM21 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Daniel D.

plasmids</title><p>Cells were tested for mycoplasma using LookOut Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit (Sigma Aldrich, Cat. MP0035). HeLa, HEK293, HUH7 cell lines were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin/glutamate (PSG). Primary MEF cells were cultured in DMEM containing 15% FBS and PSG. Flp-In T-Rex 293 cells that inducibly express a cDNA encoding 3xFLAG alone, 3xFLAG-Citrine-PIKfyve, or 3xFLAG-Citrine-PIKfyve-KYA have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCartney et al., 2014b</xref>). These cell lines were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, PSG, 15 μg/ml Blasticidin S HCl, and 0.4 mg/ml Hygromycin B, and cells were induced with 100 ng/ml doxycycline for 12 hr. For transient transfection of PIKfyve, FuGENE 6 was used following manufacturer’s instructions and transfection time was 16–18 hr. All cells were cultured in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C. For immunofluorescence studies, HEK293 and 3xHA-PIKfyve knock-in HEK293 cells were grown in fibronectin and laminin-coated coverslips. siGENOME siRNAs D-005058-10-0010 and D-005058-12-0010 targeting the 5’UTR region of PIKfyve was used to deplete PIKfyve. Cells were transfected with 5 μM of both siRNAs for 3 days. 6XHA-PIKfyve and 6xHA-PIKfyve-KYA were generated by cloning PIKfyve into pHA-CMV and adding 5XHA tag using Gibson assembly as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cinato et al., 2021</xref>).

Donor DNA spanning 315 base pairs on the left homologous region and 353 base pairs on the right homologous region was generated by overlap extension PCR and then cloned into the pGEM-T-Easy vector system. Guide RNA (<named-content content-type="sequence">TGATAAGACGTCCCCAACAC</named-content>) for PIKfyve was cloned into pX458, a pSpCas9-2A-EGFP vector. Lipofectamine 2000 was used for transfection of cells with pX458 expressing Cas9 along with a gRNA donor vector. Three days after transfection, GFP-positive single cells were sorted using flow cytometry into a 96-well plate containing conditioned media. 3xHA-PIKfyve knock-in HEK293 cells were validated by PCR, the PCR product was sequence verified, and the cell lysate was verified by western blot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Wound healing and cell spreading assays</title><p>Cells were grown on coverslips or fibronectin-coated plastic dishes to full confluency and were wounded using a pipet tip, then incubated in DMEM with 10% FBS for the indicated treatments and time points. Quantification of wound healing was performed on five random fields for each condition and wound area closure was quantified from three independent experiments.

Cells were fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were permeabilized and immunostained with Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies. To determine the effect of PIKfyve mutants on the surface levels of integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), cells were fed with complete media for 2 hr prior to labeling surface integrin. Cells were then incubated with 5 µg/ml mouse anti-β1-integrin antibody for 1 hr at 4°C. Cells were fixed at 4°C for 30 min and permeabilized. Cells were immunostained with rabbit anti-HA antibodies followed by Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Integrin trafficking experiments</title><p>To determine the dynamic regulation of integrin levels at the cell surface, cells were incubated with serum-free media containing 0.5% BSA and 5 µg/ml mouse anti-β1-integrin antibody (MAB2000) for 1 hr at 4°C. Cells were then incubated with DMSO or 1 µM apilimod in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37°C for the indicated times. To measure the surface levels, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde after treatment. To determine the internalized and unrecycled pool, cells were fixed after a brief acid wash of 0.5% acetic acid and 0.5 M NaCl for 1 min, to remove surface antibodies. Fixed cells were immunostained with secondary antibodies and analyzed by confocal microscope.</p><p>To measure β1-integrin recycling, cells were incubated with 5 µg/ml mouse anti-integrin antibody (P5D2) in DMEM with 10% FBS for 1 hr at 37°C. Cells were acid washed with PBS, pH 3.0 for 1 min. At this stage, cells were either fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde to determine the internalize pool of β1-integrin or the following treatments were performed. Cells were then either untreated or incubated with DMSO or 1 µM apilimod in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37°C for the indicated times. To determine the non-recycled pool, cells were fixed after a brief acid wash with PBS, pH 3.0 for 1 min. Fixed cells were incubated with the indicated antibodies and analyzed. Cells were co-labeled with Texas Red-WGA to mark the cell border. To determine the localization of non-recycled integrin, cells were co-incubated with antibodies to the endocytic markers: EEA1 for early endosome, LAMP1 for late endosome and lysosome, RAB4 for fast recycling endosomes ,and RAB11 for slow recycling endosomes.</p><p>To measure the effect of COMMD1 mutants on β1-integrin trafficking, COMMD1-/- cells were first infected with lentivirus expressing the COMMD1 mutants or wild-type COMMD1 for 24 hr. Cells were incubated with 5 µg/ml mouse anti-integrin antibody (P5D2) in DMEM with 10% FBS for 1 hr at 37°C. Cells were acid washed.

Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature unless specified. Fixed cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.2% saponin. Permeabilized cells were incubated with the indicated antibodies and analyzed. Images were acquired with an Olympus FV1000, LEICA SP5, or LEICA SP8 confocal microscope under an oil immersion 60× or 63× objective, respectively. Immunoblots were imaged using a ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Images were analyzed using Fiji (ImageJ; NIH) or CellProfiler. To determine the intensity of integrin during trafficking and surface labeling experiments, cells were segmented using the ImageJ crop function and integrated density was measured using the analyze function. The changes in the surface levels of integrin were inferred from the percentage of integrin intensity within 0.8 μm from the plasma membrane; the enlarge function was employed to mark this area. To measure the intensity of proteins on VPS35-positive endosomes, for each field of cells, a mask was created in ImageJ using VPS35 fluorescence and then overlaid onto the fluorescence channel of the protein of interest.</p><p>To determine the colocalization between integrin and endocytic markers, images were segmented, and colocalization was measured using CellProfiler. To determine the colocalization of PIKfyve with other proteins or markers, images were cropped and the colocalization was measured using the Jacop plugin-in, ImageJ. Immunoblots were analyzed using Image Lab Software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>To measure the surface levels of β1-integrin, HeLa cells treated with DMSO or 1 µM apilimod for 1 hr were trypsinized and strained through a 70 µm strainer to remove aggregated cells.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>You will see from the included comments that the reviewers are positive but request specific control experiments to enhance the impact of your story. The reviewers request specificity controls to add information related to pathway specificity, and improved cell surface analysis, localisation experiments, and the need to consider other interpretation of the relatively small phenotypes to make the model more realistic. You will also see experiments proposed to monitor active versus inactive integrins, or MTOC reorganization that are not essential. I include the full reports as the reviewers have offered detailed comments to improve the current story.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, this study elucidates important additional steps in retriever recruitment and function but the authors should address the individual points listed below.</p><p>Figure 1: Why do the authors only use chemical inhibition of PIKfyve for their migration analysis? A simple knockdown and or knockout of PIKfyve would be the better choice, to be validated by chemical inhibition. Or do the authors think that knockdown/knockout could lead to pleiotropic effects masking the effect on recycling?</p><p>Figure 1E-H: From my personal experience with Integrin β 1 and HeLa cells I know that integrin levels are highly variable between individual Hela cells on the same microscopy specimen. Also, I don't really see any difference between the HeLa cells on the left and the PIKfyve transfected cells in the middle panel (Figure 1G). The panel on the right contains several cells which do express PIKfyve-KYA but do not display higher integrin levels. The authors need a better assay and I suggest to perform FACS analysis of surface Integrin β 1 levels. Alternatively, surface biotinylation and western blot analysis of integrin β 1 could be used. FACS is probably the best method and has been extensively used before.</p><p>Figure 7: The authors show via microscopy that Apilimod reduces the endosomal localization of retriever components. The differences appear relatively minor and since this is a key finding, it would be good if the authors could confirm this with a simple biochemical method such as western blotting for cytosol and crude membrane fractions. Again, knockdown or knockout of PIKfyve would be good to confirm these inhibitor based results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the wound healing experiments, do the authors know whether PIKfyve inhibition affects the re-polarisation of the cells at the leading edge as defined by movement of the MTOC?</p><p>The imaging based analysis of cell surface B1 integrin is consistent with PIKfyve being required for B1 integrin surface expression. These data are derived by changes in the surface levels of integrin inferred from the percentage of integrin intensity with 0.8 microns from the plasma membrane. To support this important conclusion the authors should move the biochemical data shown in Figure 6A and B to Figure 3. In addition, they should supplement these surface restricted biotinylation experiments, through inclusion of a negative control, that is a cell surface cargo whose level does not decrease upon PIKfyve inhibition (this could, for example, be a retromer pathway specific cargo protein). In this way, the authors can address whether PIKfyve is causing a global perturbation of endosomal recycling (that is, its effects are not restricted to solely the SNX17-retriever-CCC-WASH pathway) or is it having a selective effect on this pathway.</p><p>While the authors quantify that the steady-state level of B1 integrin is not reduced upon 30 minutes of PIKfyve inhibition (Figure S4), it would be informative to extend this timeline and include experiments with cycloheximide to define if integrin turnover is enhanced. This may provide insight into whether PIKfyve activity is required for integrin retrieval from lysosomal degradation or for post-retrieval transport from the endosomal compartment.</p><p>Endosomal sorting of active versus inactive forms of integrin heterodimers is an important feature of their role in cell migration. Antibodies specific for active and inactive conformation are available, and these could be incorporated into the study to provide a view of whether PIKfyve is required for the recycling of integrins independently of their activity status or is more selective for sorting of active integrins (the SNX17-retriever-CCC-WASH pathway is generally considered to support recycling of active and inactive integrin).</p><p>The quantification of endosomal association of the SNX17-retriever-CCC-WASH pathway components relies on a normalized colocalisation analysis with VPS35. A key assumption is that the endosomal association of VPS35 is not affected in anyway by the drug treatments (within the context of the rather small affects being quantified). After all, a sub-population of VPS35 is know to be associated to endosomes through binding to the PI3P-binding protein SNX3, with the remaining VPS35 population being associated through RAB7-GTP – a GTPase that itself is controlled through endosomal phosphoinositides. Teasing apart the precise roles of PI3P and PI3,5P2 in the context of endosomal association is therefore extremely difficult especially when the perturbation in localization are very small. It would perhaps be more appropriate to place less emphasis on the role of these phosphoinositides in endosome recruitment (with the exception of SNX17 and COMMD's where the evidence is perhaps more clear), by discussing the possibility that the data reflect a role for the phosphoinositide switch in aiding the timing of coupling and communication within the pathway (e.g. could be through conformational changes induced by phosphoinositide binding or altered protein orientation on the membrane).</p><p>The generation of the COMMD1-EDEQE mutant is predicted not to change its overall structure. The authors should validate that when expressed in cells this mutant can retain association to CCDC22 and CCDC93. In addition, what happens to the localization of CCDC22 and/or CCDC93 when PIKfyve is inhibited? Robust and clear loss of endosomal localization of these proteins would be needed to support the statement (line 478) 'generation of PI3,5P2 and/or PI5P then recruits the CCC complex'.</p><p>The final model needs to better reflect the complexities of endosomal association of these sorting components. The WASH complex, for example, is associated to endosomes through retromer-dependent and retromer-independent mechanisms, and while the respective level of these mechanisms may vary between cell types it is incorrect to show that WASH association is solely reliant on PI3P, PI3,5P2 and/or PI5P.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Suggestions for additional data/experiments:</p><p>A. There is a strong focus on the recycling of integrins and the authors do show effects on the cell surface levels of integrins and the endosome to cell surface recycling of integrins (and to a lesser degree, LRP1). I think it would be helpful however if the authors could show something that doesn't change when PIKfyve is inhibited. For example, do cell surface levels of the transferrin receptor, Glut1 or EGFR change in any way when PIKfyve in inhibited? To me, this is a necessary control that will confirm that PIKfyve has a function in sorting/transport of specific ligands from endosomes to the cell surface.</p><p>B. Similarly, when the authors have investigated effects of the expression of the VPS34-IN1 (Figure S7) they show that there are effects on every protein they investigate. Is there an endosomal protein that is not affected by the VPS34-IN1? I would also urge the authors to employ a biochemical assay to examine membrane association as relying purely on microscopy can give somewhat limited data. For example, an assay that separates membranes from cytosol by centrifugation would be useful to corroborate/support the observations made through microscopy. Certainly, some of the effects they observe when PIKfyve is inhibited are quite marginal and not necessarily consistent with PIKfyve (and PI3,5P2) playing such a key role.</p><p>Suggestions for changes to the text:</p><p>A. The authors highlight the role for PI3P in mediating the recruitment of Fam21 to endosomes but there is a more substantial body of data that show that binding of Fam21 to the retromer protein VPS35 mediates recruitment of the WASH complex to endosomes (see PMIDs: 20923837; 22070227; 23331060; 22513087; 24819384). The effects of PI3 kinase inhibition on the endosomal pool of Fam21 appear fairly marginal which might indicate that binding PI3P helps stabilise Fam21 membrane association, but it cannot be concluded that Fam21 recruitment requires PI3P. In other experiments that authors make similar claims regarding the importance of PI3P or PI3,5P2 when the effects observed as rather marginal. Toning down the text to reflect the reality of the observed effect would be beneficial.</p><p>B. Similarly, when the authors describe the role of retriever in endosome to cell surface recycling, they state that half of the cell surface proteins are trafficked by this route but what do they mean by 'half'. Are half of the many species of cell surface proteins affected by loss of retriever function or is there literally half the number of cell surface protein present at the cell surface after loss of retriever?</p><p>C. The authors should recognise (and cite) literature showing that Snx27 may also mediate endosome to cell surface recycling of integrins (see PMIDs: 27909246; 23563491). Indeed, levels of Retriever component expression (except VPS29) are often much lower than levels of retromer components suggesting that retriever may sort fewer membrane proteins (see PMID: 27278775) and that therefore, some membrane proteins could be sorted by both pathways.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Lipid kinases VPS34 and PIKfyve coordinate a phosphoinositide cascade to regulate Retriever-mediated recycling on endosomes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Moreover, in mice a whole body knockout results in early embryonic lethality (PMID: 23322734, PMID: 21349843). Thus, it is likely that knockdown/knockout of PIKfyve would lead to pleiotropic effects. For this reason, we prefer short-term chemical inhibition. However, we agree that orthogonal approaches are also useful. As stated above, we now include siRNA knock-down of PIKfyve in studies of the impact on surface levels of integrins (Figures S3) and localization of COMMD1 to endosomes (Figure 7, Figure S8). In addition, we used primary fibroblasts from the hypomorphic PIKfyve b-geo/b-geo mice, a gene-trap mice that expresses only 10% of WT PIKfyve and has half the levels of PI3,5P2 and PI5P, and found that primary fibroblasts from these mice have defects in cell migration (Figure S2C-D). We also used a Flip-In cell line to over-express hyperactive PIKfyve-KYA and found that this promotes cell migration (Figure 1C-D, Figure S2G-H)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1E-H: From my personal experience with Integrin β 1 and HeLa cells I know that integrin levels are highly variable between individual Hela cells on the same microscopy specimen.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree that in HeLa cells integrin levels are variable.

Here, we tested and found using immunofluorescence, that the surface levels of EGFR are the same in cells treated for 1 hour with either DMSO or apilimod (Figure S6).

It would perhaps be more appropriate to place less emphasis on the role of these phosphoinositides in endosome recruitment (with the exception of SNX17 and COMMD's where the evidence is perhaps more clear), by discussing the possibility that the data reflect a role for the phosphoinositide switch in aiding the timing of coupling and communication within the pathway (e.g. could be through conformational changes induced by phosphoinositide binding or altered protein orientation on the membrane).</p></disp-quote><p>When we consider direct binding to a phosphoinositide, we assume that this could be recruitment of a protein(s), conformational changes of a protein or altered orientation of a protein on a membrane. In addition, we agree that the roles of phosphoinositides could be indirect via proteins in another pathway that bind directly, but then indirectly impact the pathway being investigated. One example would be potential roles of PIKfyve in maturation of endosomes. We have now included a discussion of this possibility in the manuscript.</p><p>“While we favor a model where positive regulation of the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH pathway occurs via direct binding of some of the subunits within these complexes to PI3P and PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> or PI5P, it is possible that these lipids are impacting the pathway in a more global way. For example, PIKfyve is important for endosome maturation (Kim et al., 2014; Messenger et al., 2015), and this could play a role in when the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH pathway is activated.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The generation of the COMMD1-EDEQE mutant is predicted not to change its overall structure. The authors should validate that when expressed in cells this mutant can retain association to CCDC22 and CCDC93.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this question, because following this suggestion resulted in our discovery of additional problems with the COMMD1 mutants used in the original study. We now tested and found that the EDEQE mutant greatly perturbs the association between COMMD1 and CCDC93 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Thus, we removed the EDEQE mutant from the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Mutation of the putative phosphoinositide binding site on COMMD1 impairs the interaction with CCDC93.</title><p>HeLa cells were infected with lenti-virus expressing 3xHA-COMMD1 or 3xHA-COMMD1-EDEQE (R120E/ K129D/R133E/H134Q/K167E) mutant for 48 hours. 3xHA-COMMD1 were immunoprecipitated with HA antibodies and the precipitates were immunoblotted for CCDC93.

This very large increase raises the possibility that the large amounts of the COMMD1-QAA mutant combined with mutation of this site to a hydrophobic patch, could potentially mask any defects associated with a defect in binding to phosphoinositide lipids. Thus, we were unable to analyze the COMMD1-QAA mutant further (Figure S14).</p><p>The COMMD1-EQE mutant also presented some issues. While its expression was closer to wild-type COMMD1, we found that the COMMD1-EQE mutant also had an approximately 60% defect in binding to CCDC93 compared with wild-type COMMD1. When we accounted for the large increase in COMMD1-QAA levels, we found that it had a 40% defect in binding CCDC93, and that the differences between the COMMD1-QAA and COMMD1-EQE mutants were not statistically significant (Figure S14). We now explain the new data as follows:</p><p>“It is not surprising that mutation of a phosphoinositide binding site would also impair the formation of the CCC complex. Formation of the complex could potentially require association with membranes. Alternatively, this site may play a direct role in formation of the CCC complex. Thus, while it is possible that impaired association with PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> underlies the defect in COMMD1-EQE binding to endosomes, and accounts for a defect in recycling, it is also possible that the defect in the COMMD1-EQE mutant is due to a partial disruption of the CCC complex that is independent of its interaction with phosphoinositide lipids.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, what happens to the localization of CCDC22 and/or CCDC93 when PIKfyve is inhibited? Robust and clear loss of endosomal localization of these proteins would be needed to support the statement (line 478) 'generation of PI3,5P2 and/or PI5P then recruits the CCC complex'.</p></disp-quote><p>We now tested and found that inhibition of PIKfyve decreases the endosomal localization of CCDC93 (new supplemental figure S7C-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The final model needs to better reflect the complexities of endosomal association of these sorting components. The WASH complex, for example, is associated to endosomes through retromer-dependent and retromer-independent mechanisms, and while the respective level of these mechanisms may vary between cell types it is incorrect to show that WASH association is solely reliant on PI3P, PI3,5P2 and/or PI5P.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have now changed to text to indicate that these lipids play a role. We made sure to acknowledge that they are not the sole mechanism for the assembly of this pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Suggestions for additional data/experiments:</p><p>A. There is a strong focus on the recycling of integrins and the authors do show effects on the cell surface levels of integrins and the endosome to cell surface recycling of integrins (and to a lesser degree, LRP1). I think it would be helpful however if the authors could show something that doesn't change when PIKfyve is inhibited. For example, do cell surface levels of the transferrin receptor, Glut1 or EGFR change in any way when PIKfyve in inhibited? To me, this is a necessary control that will confirm that PIKfyve has a function in sorting/transport of specific ligands from endosomes to the cell surface.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to determine if other receptors that traffic through endosomes are affected. We had previously published that the rate of trafficking of EGFR, which goes from the cell-surface via endosomes to lysosomes was not affected in Vac14-/- primary fibroblasts (PMID 17956977). Here, we tested and found that the surface levels of EGFR are the same in cells treated for 1 hour with either DMSO or apilimod (Figure S6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B. Similarly, when the authors have investigated effects of the expression of the VPS34-IN1 (Figure S7) they show that there are effects on every protein they investigate. Is there an endosomal protein that is not affected by the VPS34-IN1?</p></disp-quote><p>While it would be optimal to find an endosomal protein that is not affected by VPS34-IN1, we currently do not have a good guess of what to test. As we show in this manuscript (Figures S9 and S11) treatment with Vps34-IN1 lowers PI3P, as well as impacting PIKfyve function which results in lowered PI3,5P<sub>2</sub> and PI5P as well. Thus, we predict that many proteins would be affected. Importantly however, the interpretation that SNX17 and FAM21 are recruited in part by PI3P are based on multiple publications and are not solely based on the inhibitor studies reported here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would also urge the authors to employ a biochemical assay to examine membrane association as relying purely on microscopy can give somewhat limited data. For example, an assay that separates membranes from cytosol by centrifugation would be useful to corroborate/support the observations made through microscopy. Certainly, some of the effects they observe when PIKfyve is inhibited are quite marginal and not necessarily consistent with PIKfyve (and PI3,5P2) playing such a key role.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that an alternate biochemical method to measure the changes in endosomal localization of the proteins would be ideal. However, we found that only about 10-15% of each Retriever, CCC and WASH subunit tested is associated with membranes (Reviewer Figure A). Thus, we did not pursue biochemical approaches further.</p><p>Given that only a small population is on membranes, using immunofluorescence to focus on changes at a specific compartment, for example, Vps35 containing membranes, provides a more sensitive assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggestions for changes to the text:</p><p>A. The authors highlight the role for PI3P in mediating the recruitment of Fam21 to endosomes but there is a more substantial body of data that show that binding of Fam21 to the retromer protein VPS35 mediates recruitment of the WASH complex to endosomes (see PMIDs: 20923837; 22070227; 23331060; 22513087; 24819384). The effects of PI3 kinase inhibition on the endosomal pool of Fam21 appear fairly marginal which might indicate that binding PI3P helps stabilise Fam21 membrane association, but it cannot be concluded that Fam21 recruitment requires PI3P. In other experiments that authors make similar claims regarding the importance of PI3P or PI3,5P2 when the effects observed as rather marginal. Toning down the text to reflect the reality of the observed effect would be beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and we have added a statement about the importance of the retromer for the endosomal association of the WASH complex. We have also toned down the text about potential roles of the phosphoinositide lipids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B. Similarly, when the authors describe the role of retriever in endosome to cell surface recycling, they state that half of the cell surface proteins are trafficked by this route but what do they mean by 'half'. Are half of the many species of cell surface proteins affected by loss of retriever function or is there literally half the number of cell surface protein present at the cell surface after loss of retriever?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and now make a more neutral statement that “Proteomic studies revealed that this pathway traffics over 120 cell surface proteins in HeLa cells (McNally et al., 2017), which establishes SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH as an important pathway for protein recycling.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C. The authors should recognise (and cite) literature showing that Snx27 may also mediate endosome to cell surface recycling of integrins (see PMIDs: 27909246; 23563491). Indeed, levels of Retriever component expression (except VPS29) are often much lower than levels of retromer components suggesting that retriever may sort fewer membrane proteins (see PMID: 27278775) and that therefore, some membrane proteins could be sorted by both pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these studies leave open the possibility that SNX27 may also mediate endosome to cell surface recycling of integrins. We now include this point and the three references listed above in the introduction.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1 wrote, &quot;I was disappointed by the lack of effort to biochemically verify the observed changes in membrane localization of SNX17 and retriever components.
