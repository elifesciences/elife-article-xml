Here, we report that a neuropeptide F (NPF)/nitric oxide (NO) pathway plays a critical role in the locomotor plasticity of swarming migratory locusts. The transcripts encoding two related neuropeptides, NPF1a and NPF2, show reduced levels during crowding, and the transcript levels of NPF1a and NPF2 receptors significantly increase during locust isolation. Both NPF1a and NPF2 have suppressive effects on phase-related locomotor activity. A key downstream mediator for both NPFs is nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which regulates phase-related locomotor activity by controlling NO synthesis in the locust brain. Mechanistically, NPF1a and NPF2 modify NOS activity by separately suppressing its phosphorylation and by lowering its transcript level, effects that are mediated by their respective receptors. Our results uncover a hierarchical neurochemical mechanism underlying behavioral plasticity in the swarming locust and provide insights into the NPF/NO axis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22526.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22526.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22526.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Migratory locusts are widespread throughout the Eastern Hemisphere, especially in Asia, Australia and Africa. Although usually solitary insects, locusts can also form swarms made up of millions of individuals, which can devastate crops. Swarming can be studied on a smaller scale in the laboratory by forcing locusts to crowd together. This causes the locusts to enter a so-called gregarious state in which they are more active and sociable, which in turn promotes swarming. Isolating individual locusts has the opposite effect, causing the insects to enter a solitary state in which they are less active.</p><p>Chemicals in the locust brain called neuropeptides control phase transitions between solitary and gregarious behavior. Neuropeptides bind to specific proteins called receptors in the outer membranes of neurons and initiate unique signaling cascades inside cells. However, exactly how neuropeptides regulate the changes in locust behavior that affect swarming was not clear.</p><p>Hou et al. now reveal the role that two related neuropeptides, NPF1a and NPF2, play in this process. Crowding causes the levels of NPF1a and NPF2 in the locust brain to decrease, whereas isolating individual locusts causes the levels of two NPF receptors to increase. Both neuropeptides reduce levels of a molecule called nitric oxide in the brain. NPF1a does this by reducing the activity of the enzyme that produces nitric oxide, whereas NPF2 reduces the production of this enzyme. The reduction in nitric oxide in turn makes the locusts less active.</p><p>Similar NPF neuropeptides had previously been shown to affect activity levels in other invertebrates, such as roundworms and fruit flies. This, combined with the results now presented by Hou et al., suggests that the NPF/nitric oxide pathway may regulate activity in insects in general. Future work should investigate this possibility, as well as whether the NPF/nitric oxide pathway controls changes in other insect behaviors such as feeding and mating.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22526.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22526.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>invertebrate</kwd><kwd>insect</kwd><kwd>locust</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Youth fund (Grant NO. 31601875)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hou</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant NO. 31472047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xianhui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Priority Research Program (Grant NO.

Individuals benefit from swarming in many aspects, including food searching, territory selection, and defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Okubo, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weaver et al., 1989</xref>). Typically, to maintain the required fission–fusion dynamics, swarming animals exhibit striking behavioral plasticity of different types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Snell-Rood, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Szyf, 2010</xref>). Biochemical changes in the levels of neuromodulators, such as monoamines, neuropeptides, and neurohormones, are able to induce behavioral variation thus mediate behavioral plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freudenberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Godwin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zupanc and Lamprecht, 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, the molecular basis by which neural factors orchestrate behavioral plasticity in swarming animals is poorly understood in detail.</p><p>Neuropeptides, a group of chemically diverse neural modulators, affect a broad range of physiological and behavioral activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lieberwirth and Wang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nässel, 2002</xref>). Accumulating evidence shows that neuropeptides serve as conserved neuronal signals that modulate animal behaviors in social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lieberwirth and Wang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nilsen et al., 2011</xref>). These peptides exert their actions by binding to specific membrane receptors, most of which are G-protein-coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quartara and Maggi, 1997</xref>). The binding initiates a second-message cascade unique for each receptor and results in a distinct molecular response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hökfelt et al., 2003</xref>). It has been revealed that neuropeptides can induce plasticity in a series of behavioral processes, including sensory detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shankar et al., 2015</xref>), signal integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grammatopoulos, 2012</xref>), and behavioral responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruzza et al., 2015</xref>) by acting either individually or in concert with other neuromodulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dölen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flores et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maroun and Wagner, 2016</xref>). Therefore, neuropeptides and their downstream components may act as vital parts of the regulatory network underlying behavioral plasticity in swarming animals.</p><p>The migratory locust, <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic>, exhibits two interconvertible phases, the solitarious phase (S-phase) and the gregarious phase (G-phase), the latter of which is characterized by swarming behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariel and Ayali, 2015</xref>). Locust behaviors in the two phases significantly differ, most notably in the interaction among individuals and in locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Uvarov, 1977</xref>). S-phase locusts are sedentary and repel their conspecifics, whereas G-phase individuals are highly active and attract their conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simpson et al., 1999</xref>). The behavioral transition between two phases is promoted by either isolating G-phase locusts (that is, solitarization) or, in the opposite direction, by forced crowding of S-phase locusts (that is, gregarization), the key step in seeding locust swarming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pener and Simpson, 2009</xref>). Behavioral solitarization occurs faster than behavioral gregarization in the migratory locust. The attraction index and locomotor activity of locusts continuously decrease within 16 hr after isolation. By contrast, these behaviors do not increase until 32 hr after crowding, but are far below the level of gregarious controls even after crowding for 64 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The locust brain undergoes strong neurochemical reconfiguration during behavioral phase transition; for instance, the contents of several neurotransmitters that mediate synaptic plasticity show significant change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2015</xref>). Recently, we have found that several neuropeptide genes are differentially expressed between the central nervous systems of G-phase and S-phase locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hou et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting possible modulatory roles for these neuropeptides in the behavioral phase transition.</p><p>Here, we show that two related neuropeptides, NPF1a and NPF2, act as crucial neural modulators in the phase-related locomotor plasticity of the migratory locust. We uncover a potentially important connection between the atypical neurotransmitter NO and the two NPFs, a connection mediated by NOS. We therefore suggest that the actions of NPFs (or their homolog NPY) may be mediated, partly through NOS and NO, in other organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two related neuropeptides, NPF1a and NPF2, affect phase-related locomotor activity</title><p>We have previously shown that 15 neuropeptide-encoding genes are differentially expressed in the brains of G-phase and S-phase locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hou et al., 2015</xref>).

The behavioral phase state was then assessed in an arena assay and measured by P<italic><sub>greg</sub></italic>, which is calculated using a binary logistic regression model that retains three variables: attraction index, total distance moved, and total duration of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2011</xref>). P<italic><sub>greg</sub></italic> varies between 0 (in the fully S-phase behavioral state) and 1 (in the fully G-phase behavioral state). We performed RNAi-mediated transcript knockdown to reduce the levels of <italic>ACP</italic> and <italic>ILP</italic>, which show higher transcript levels in G-phase locust brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, lower). We found that knockdown of either <italic>ACP</italic> or <italic>ILP</italic> transcript did not significantly change the P<italic><sub>greg</sub></italic> values of G-phase locusts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). On the other hand, we injected synthetic peptides to increase the concentrations of NPF1a and NPF2, which display lower transcript levels in G-phase locust brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, upper). G-phase locusts that were injected with NPF1a or NPF2 peptide behaved in a way that became considerably more solitarious, in a dose-dependent manner, when compared to control locusts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

We establish a causation — the transcriptional changes in two NPF systems and the resulting converse alteration in NO levels in the locust brains contribute to variable locomotor activity during the G/S locust phase transition.

These changes in locomotor behavior can be fully overcome by pharmacological administration of compounds that affect NO levels. Notably, NO signaling displays marked effects on locomotor activity; and the time-course changes in NO levels coincide well with locust behavioral transitions during both isolation and crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2011</xref>), indicating NO is a decisive molecule for phase-related locomotion. The increased NO concentration may serve as a proximate cause of high locomotor activity in G-phase locusts, and decreased NO levels may lead to low locomotor activity in S-phase locusts. These data clearly suggest that the NPF/NO pathway plays a vital role in the modulation of phase-related locomotor plasticity. Our studies do not, however, preclude the regulatory roles of two other neuropeptides, ACP and ILP, in other phase-related characteristics or in long-term behavioral effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pener and Simpson, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies have suggested that NPF signaling can influence a broad range of physiological and behavioral activities in insects, for instance feeding, reproduction, learning, circadian activity and stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nässel and Wegener, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krashes et al., 2009</xref>). Similar functional roles of the NPF (or NPFY) system in locomotion have been observed in two model invertebrate species, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Bono and Bargmann, 1998</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2003</xref>). These findings, in conjunction with ours, raise the possibility that the NPF system might serve as a common neural signaling pathway that shapes locomotor plasticity in invertebrates. In addition, recent studies have reported that NPF (referred to as NPF1a here) can mediate food intake, body weight and male-specific reproduction processes in the adults of another locust species, <italic>Schistocerca gregaria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Van Wielendaele et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">2013b</xref>), indicating that NPF plays multiple roles in locust biology.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that phase differences in food choice are related to cryptic and aposematic strategies. Gregarious nymphs of <italic>S. gregaria</italic> are prone to consume more nutritionally imbalanced food and to accept food containing toxic chemicals more readily than do solitarious nymphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simpson et al., 2002</xref>). This is partly due to the relative gustatory insensitivity to low-quality food in gregarious locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Despland and Simpson, 2005</xref>). A link between NPF signaling and food choice has been suggested in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shen and Cai, 2001</xref>). Thus, a possible involvement of the NPF system could be speculated in phase-related behavioral choices of food quality in the locust nymphs. Further functional analysis is required to confirm this possibility and to elucidate the mechanisms through which NPF regulates multiple phase-related behavioral characteristics.</p><p>Our results indicate that NO signaling has a stimulatory role in locomotor activity in locusts. Several studies have suggested the significance of NO signaling in locomotor activity and behavioral plasticity in various animal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Del Bel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kyriakatos et al., 2009</xref>). For example, NO-initiating signaling has been shown to suppress aggression by promoting the tendency to flee in crickets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stevenson PA, 2016</xref>) and to increase oviposition digging rhythm so as to control egg-laying movements in desert locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Newland and Yates, 2007</xref>). The cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG) pathway (the main downstream target of NO signaling) is involved in the control of foraging and locomotor behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osborne et al., 1997</xref>), as well as in the regulation of labor division in honey bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Shahar, 2005</xref>) and ants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ingram et al., 2005</xref>). However, although there is a phase-dependent regulation of NO synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>) and a higher PKG activity in the anterior midline of brains of insects in the gregarious phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lucas et al., 2010</xref>), significant effects of PKG on behavioral phase state could not be observed in the desert locust <italic>S. gregaria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ott et al., 2012</xref>). A reasonable explanation could be that the regulatory mechanisms of NO signaling in phase transition are species-specific, as is true of the roles played by several other neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anstey et al., 2009</xref>). Another possibility is that NO regulates behavioral phase transition via a PKG-independent pathway in locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Newland and Yates, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>NPF1a and NPF2, their receptors and NOS act in concert to regulate phase-related locomotion through NO signaling</title><p>We provide clear evidence that two NPFs acts as brakes that sequentially modify NO levels to control locomotor plasticity. The regulatory role of the NPF-NO pathway in locomotor behavior is further supported by the overlap immunostaining of two NPFs and NOS in the pars intercerebralis, which is linked to the regulation of locomotor rhythm in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsui et al., 2008</xref>). NO levels may reflect distinct physiological states and affect a wide variety of behaviors across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Del Bel et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cayre et al., 2005</xref>), yet how this molecule’s level responds to varied internal or external conditions remains unclear. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show the link between NPF and NO signaling in shaping behavioral plasticity.</p><p>We show that the sequential inhibitory effects of NPF1a and NPF2 on NO levels are attributed to their regulation of NOS phosphorylation and <italic>NOS</italic> gene transcription, respectively, indicating that these two NPF members are not redundant in regulating phase-related locomotion. Phosphorylation is known to be an important form of post-translational modification (PTM) for a broad range of proteins, including receptors, transcriptional factors and vital enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kasuga et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsuzaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertorello et al., 1991</xref>). The phosphorylated proteins usually display changed spatial structures, subcellular locations and catalytic activity, and thus play key roles in rapid cellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hurley et al., 1990</xref>). Studies in mammals have shown that NOS activity is tightly regulated by phosphorylation. For instance, the phosphorylation of Ser1412 stimulates NOS activity whereas Ser847 phosphorylation inhibits enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Watts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Komeima et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>NOS has also been suggested to be modified post-translationally in the locust embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stern et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we show that NOS is modified by phosphorylation in the locust brains. Even if the total NOS protein level were not influenced by the activities of NPFs, simply reducing NOS phosphorylation leads to significantly decreased NOS activity and thus results in lower NO level, suggesting that NOS activity in the locust largely depends on its modification by phosphorylation. Therefore, NPF1a may lower the NO level by directly reducing NOS phosphorylation, whereas NPF2 may lower the NO level by reducing NOS substrate for phosphorylation. Our results show that NPF1a-regulated NOS phosphorylation cycles quickly, whereas <italic>NOS</italic> expression may respond more slowly to NPF2 regulation. Thus, the distinct modes of changing NO levels that are regulated by the two NPF systems not only explain the more rapid behavioral effect of NPF1a when compared to that of NPF2, but also emphasizes that downregulation of the NPF2 system is necessary in the G-phase to increase locomotion.</p><p>We show that two NPF peptides and their receptors may play synergistic roles in regulating the dynamic changes in NO levels during the two time-course processes of phase transition. The continuous reduction of NO levels during isolation is tightly controlled by the decreased NOS phosphorylation that results from the upregulation of <italic>NPFR</italic> and <italic>NPYR</italic>. By contrast, the reduction of two <italic>NPF</italic>s contributes mainly to the overall enhancement of NOS phosphorylation and NO levels during crowding. Although phosphorylated NOS shows greater activity than the unphosphorylated protein in promoting NO production, as shown previously, the enhancement of NO levels upon crowding seems to be delayed relative to that of NOS phosphorylation, implying that the stimulation of NO levels during crowding is a complex process that might involve additional regulators beyond the enzyme activity. NO level is dependent upon the balance between its production and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sansbury and Hill, 2014</xref>). NO generation not only depends on NOS expression and its post-translational modification but also relies on the availability of the corresponding substrate (e.g., L-Arginine) and cofactor (e.g., BH4, FAD or FMN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li and Poulos, 2005</xref>), whereas NO degradation may result directly from its reaction with reactive species (e.g., superoxide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Channon, 2012</xref>). Given this, modulations of the availability of these factors may responsible for the sluggish increase of NO level during locust crowding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Specific effects of different neuromodulators are essential for orchestrating phase-related behavioral traits</title><p>Locomotor activity is a major phase-related behavior that changes in response to population density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang and Kang, 2014</xref>). The high locomotor activity of G-phase locusts is potentially beneficial for rapid aggregation, synchronous movement, and avoidance of predators or conspecific cannibalism during locust swarming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simpson et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, the sequential modifications of NO levels resulting from NPF1a and NPF2 should allow dynamic locomotor adaptation to maintain locust swarming. Our previous studies have indicated that several other regulators, such as dopamine, serotonin and carnitines, are also involved in the modulation of phase-related locomotion in the migratory locust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, protein kinase A, a possible downstream factor of serotonin and dopamine, can regulate behavioral phase transition in the desert locust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ott et al., 2012</xref>). It has been shown that the NPF/NPFR pathway has a dominant suppressive effect on PKA-sensitized sugar aversion in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). In our study, the expression level of AC2, one of the enzymes catalyzing cAMP production and activating PKA, is also affected by alteration of NPF levels in locusts. Studies in mammals have shown that both dopaminergic transmission and PKA could enhance NO levels thus leading to distinct biological actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang and Lau, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). On the basis of these findings, we hypothesize that the two NPF systems may cooperate with the dopamine pathway to modulate locomotor activity during locust phase transition.</p><p>We show that the NPF/NO pathway is not involved in the modulation of another major phase-related behavioral characteristic, conspecific attraction induced by odors, in the migratory locust. This finding is superficially inconsistent with previous results on the roles of NPFs or NO in fine-tuning of food odor-induced behavior and olfactory learning in mice and the fruit fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rohwedder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sung et al., 2014</xref>). One possible explanation is that pheromone-induced olfactory behaviors that are related to the locust phase change may involve regulatory mechanisms that are different from those involved in food-odor-induced olfactory responses in locusts. And, the locust phase transition is a continuous process involving changes of various characteristics including behaviors, metabolism, immunity and body color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang and Kang, 2014</xref>). In addition to its significance in behavioral modulation, NO signaling is also able to affect a variety of physiological and pathological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogdan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calabrese et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sansbury and Hill, 2014</xref>). Thus, uncovering the long-term effects of the NPF/NO pathway on phase-related characteristics, such as disease resistance, energy metabolism and aging, will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the phase transitions that underlie locust swarming.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Rearing of locusts</title><p>G-phase locusts were maintained in large well-ventilated cages (40 cm × 40 cm × 40 cm) at a density of 500–1000 locusts per cage.

The phylogenetic relationship of NPFR and NPYR of insects and human was analyzed using MEGA software.</p><p>HEK 293 T cells (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL-0063">CVCL-0063</ext-link>) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, CRL-3216, the identity has been authenticated using STR profiling) and cultured in low glucose DMEM (Life Technology) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma every 6 months. For the competition binding assays, HEK 293 T cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1-NPFR or pcDNA3.1-NPYR (with a Flag-tag encoding sequence following target gene) were washed with 1 X PBS and added into 96-well plates (2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) coated with poly-L-lysine (0.1 mg/mL). Cells were then incubated with 25 μL TAMRA-NPF1a or TAMRA-NPF2 (10 nM) in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligands in a final volume of 100 μL of binding buffer (PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of 25 μL unlabeled ligand. Mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 2 hr. Fluorescence intensity was measured using a fluorimeter (Molecular Devices) after washing twice with binding buffer. The HEK 293 T cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 were used as a control. The binding displacement curves were analyzed using the non-linear logistic regression method. Western blotting was carried out to validate the protein expressions of NPFR and NPYR in HEK 293 T cells using the mouse monoclonal antibody against Flag (CoWin, 1:5000).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA-seq and data processing</title><p>The brains of fourth-instar G-phase locusts were collected 4 hr after injection of the mixture of NPF1a and NPF2 peptides or ddH<sub>2</sub>O (a total of 5 μg). Similarly, the brains of fourth-instar S-phase locusts were collected 48 hr after injection of the mixture of ds<italic>NPF1a</italic> and ds<italic>NPF2</italic> or ds<italic>GFP</italic>. Each sample contained 10 brains (5 males and 5 females). Three independent replicates were performed for each treatment. Total RNA was isolated as previously described, and RNA quality was confirmed by agarose gel. cDNA libraries were prepared according to Illumina’s protocols. Raw data were filtered, corrected, and mapped to locust genome sequence using Tophat software. The number of total reads was normalized by multiple normalization factors. Transcript levels were calculated using the reads per kb million mapped reads criteria. The difference sbetween the test and control groups were represented by <italic>P</italic> values. Differentially expressed genes with significance levels at p&lt;0.05 in each comparison were enriched. In addition, unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed using Clustal 3.0, which employs uncentered Pearson correlation and average linkage; results are presented by Java Treeview software. The RNA-seq data have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (accession no. SRP092214).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Locust brains (10–12 individuals/sample) were collected and homogenized in 1 X PBS buffer (0.1 M phosphate buffer, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4) containing the phosphatase inhibitor PhosSTOP (Roche) and a proteinase inhibitor (CoWin). Total protein content was examined using the BicinChoninic Acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (Thermo). The extracts (100 μg) were reduced, denatured, and electrophoresed on 8% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was then cut to two pieces and incubated separately with a specific antibody against the target protein of ~130 KD or a reference protein of ~55 KD overnight at 4°C (affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody against uNOS, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:200; Rabbit polyclonal antibody against tubulin, CoWin, 1:5000). Goat anti-rabbit IgG was used as secondary antibody (CoWin, 1:10000). Protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL kit, CoWin). The band intensity of the Western blot was quantified using densitometry in Quantity One software.</p><p>For determination of NOS phosphorylation, 200 μg brain extracts were incubated with λ phosphatase and 1 X NEB buffer supplemented with 1 mM Mncl<sub>2</sub> for 1 hr at 30°C (NEB). Control protein was treated under the same conditions without λ phosphatase. Western blot analysis was performed to confirm NOS phosphorylation in the locust brains.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Bioassays</title><p>An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (R and D Systems, Inc.) was used to detect the relative cAMP level in locust brains. For NO content determination, Total Nitric Oxide Assay Kit (Beyotime) was used. Because NO molecules are unstable, the total NO levels in all test groups were assessed by detecting the content of nitrate and nitrite. The NOS Kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute) was used to detect the total NOS activity in locust brains. Protein concentrations were measured using the BicinChoninic Acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (Thermo). All of these three measurements were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each measurement was from at least four biological replicates (12–16 locusts/replicate). Data were normalized to the protein concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Whole-mount double immunohistochemistry of locust brains was performed using affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody against NPF1a or NPF2 (AbMAX, China, 1:100) and monoclonal mouse antibody against uNOS (Thermo, 1:200, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_325476">AB_325476</ext-link>). Alexa Fluor-488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cat. A-11008, 1:500; Life Technologies) and Alexa Fluor-568 goat anti-mouse IgG (Cat. A-11019, 1:1000; Life Technologies) were used as secondary antibodies for NPFs and NOS staining, respectively. Fluorescence was detected using an LSM 710 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss). Photos for both positive staining and negative controls were imaged under the same conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Determination of the molecular effects on NOS expression caused by NPFR and NPYR</title><p>To validate the involvement of <italic>NPFR</italic> and <italic>NPYR</italic> in the regulation of NOS expression and phosphorylation by two NPF peptides, the brains of fourth-instar S-phase locusts were microinjected with ds<italic>NPFR</italic> or ds<italic>NPYR</italic>, and collected 48 hr after injection.

Two hours later, SNAP (200 μM, 2 μl/locust) was injected into the heads of the experimental insects. Control insects were treated with an equal amount of saline. The injected locusts were then raised under the gregarious condition and subjected to behavioral analysis 2 hr after injection of SNAP.</p><p>For S-phase locusts, ds<italic>NPFR</italic> or ds<italic>NPYR</italic> was microinjected into the brains of fourth-instar S-phase insects. Forty-six hours after injection, the NOS inhibitor L-NAME was microinjected into the locusts pre-treated with ds<italic>NPFR</italic> or ds<italic>NPYR</italic>.

Therefore, 8–16 animals were examined in each experimental treatment. For behavioral measurement, we knew that 15 individuals per group was sufficient to detect reproducible differences between groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2011</xref>). All of the experiments were performed with at least three independent biological replicates.</p><p>Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used for two-group comparison. One-way ANOVO followed by Turkey’s post-hoc test was used for multi-group comparisons. Data that do not meet normal distribution were excluded in these statistics. Behavioral phase state analysis was performed using the Mann–Whitney U test because of its non-normal distribution feature. Differences were considered statistically significant at p&lt;0.05. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20 software and presented as mean ± s.e.m. except for the P<italic><sub>greg </sub></italic>values, which are shown as median values.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Gerald Reeck (Kansas State University and Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences) for constructive comments during the revision of this manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Shannon B Olsson (Reviewer #1); Amir Ayali (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this interesting study, the authors found that nitric oxide, regulated by NPF peptide mediation of nitric oxide synthase in the pars intercerebralis portion of the brain, leads to increased locomotor activity associated with the solitary to gregarious phase change in the migratory locust. The authors conclude that this pathway could be a key modulator underlying swarming behavior.</p><p>The paper is generally well-written, and covers a large body of work. The methods are thoroughly described, and the results well-presented – with an appropriate separation of results into the main paper and supplementary methods. In general the discussion and conclusions are well-supported by the results.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The methodology and controls are thorough and the results regarding the impact of NPF peptides on NOS and NO are clear. However, it is unclear from the behavior presented whether the decreased/increased movement observed is directly related to swarming behavior, or rather a general increase in mobility. Obviously, increased mobility is needed for swarming, but the two are separate phenotypes. For example, increased locomotion would also affect a number of other behaviors, from foraging to mating, even though the authors show that, for example, it doesn't relate to changes in olfactory attraction to odors.</p><p>Second, the results, in my interpretation, are presented as though the NPF / NO pathways observed lead to the phase change, while they may rather be a byproduct of the transition itself. This issue could be alleviated by a deep dive into the literature, including discussion of previous publications by the authors (some of which are already included in the references). For example:</p><p>1) How might the molecular mechanisms presented relate to the many other physiological and behavioral changes that occur during phase change (Molecular Mechanisms of Phase Change in Locusts, Xianhui Wang and Le Kang, Annual Review of Entomology, Vol. 59: 225 -244)?</p><p>2) Nitric oxide is incredibly important for a number of neurophysiological processes, so how does this mechanism relate to other aspects of NO modulation?</p><p>3) How does this mechanism relate and/or differ from other observations of behavioral modulation by NO in orthopertans (Controlling the decision to fight or flee: the roles of biogenic amines and nitric oxide in the cricket Paul A. Stevenson and Jan Rillich, Current Zoology, 2016, 1-11), and other modulators in locusts observed by the authors previously (Modulation of behavioral phase changes of the migratory locust by the catecholamine metabolic pathway Zongyuan Ma, Wei Guo, Xiaojiao Guo, Xianhui Wang, and Le Kang, PNAS, 108, 3882-3887)?</p><p>4) Finally, how do these observations in l. migratoria relate to observations on the mechanisms of neuromodulation other locust species (Substantial changes in central nervous system neurotransmitters and neuromodulators accompany phase change in the locust, Stephen M. Rogers, Thomas Matheson, Ken Sasaki, Keith Kendrick, Stephen J. Simpson, Malcolm Burrows, Journal of Experimental Biology 2004 207: 3603-3617)?</p><p>These aspects of the results should be discussed to better interpret the results in light of current knowledge.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>My main criticism of this paper is that the Discussion focuses too much on reiterating the results, rather than focusing more on a synthetic interpretation of the results. This is reflected in the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, which provides little insight into how the neuropeptides, receptors and NOS enzyme act in concert to regulate locomotion through nitric oxide signalling. The model as presented suggests that p-NOS and NOS are equally active, and ignores much of the dynamics of the NPFs and receptors described in the results. To this reviewer, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that only p-NOS is active, and that NPF2 increases NOS activity only by providing a greater level of NOS substrate for phosphorylation. Also, that NPF1a-regulated NOS phosphorylation cycles quickly whereas NOS expression is slower to respond to NPF2 regulation not only explains the speed of locomotory transition between phases, but perhaps also explains why regulation of NPYR expression is necessary in the G-Phase to increase locomotion.</p><p>It would also help the reader if the effects of neuropeptide and NO signalling described in this paper could be put in context with the other hormonal and transcriptional regulators described previously. Where does the regulatory system described in this paper fit more broadly within the overall regulation of phase transition?</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This paper describes a very thorough investigation suggesting a potential role for NPF in locust density-dependent phase transition and in locust phase characteristics.</p><p>The paper is overall well written and the findings well described. I do have several comments on the study, the text and figures. The following (a mix of major and minor comments) is arranged by section:</p><p>Introduction</p><p>1) While this is not a focus of this work, the authors tend to use &quot;swarming&quot; and &quot;collective motion&quot; interchangeably, while these refer to different aspects of locust (and other animals) behavior. A related point is that the gregarious phase is not a characteristic of a swarming population, but is rather characterized by swarming behavior. This may seem as merely semantics, yet in a paper describing the control of phase-transformation, I believe it is important. The authors are referred to Ariel and Ayali, 2015, for a recent review addressing these points.</p><p>2) I am not sure that the sentence &quot;Switching between key types of neuromodulators[…]&quot; reflects the major points presented in the cited references, nor in the current text; the point being that neuromodulators are able of choosing among a behavioral repertoire and thus mediate behavioral plasticity. Similarly, neuropeptides induce behavioral plasticity rather than &quot;modulate different types of behavioral plasticity&quot;.</p><p>3) The time course of a locust phase change is a repeated important aspect when reviewing the different presented results. It may deserve some further details and references (e.g. is gregarization indeed &quot;initiates at least 32 h after crowding&quot;, or is it completed?).</p><p>4) While in the Abstract the authors state that the &quot;neuropeptide F (NPF)-nitric oxide (NO) pathway plays a critical role in locomotor plasticity&quot;, in the Introduction they claim that the neuropeptides are crucial neuromodulators in &quot;behavioral plasticity underlying swarming&quot;. As mentioned in my point 1 above, the connection between enhanced locomotion and swarming is not trivial.</p><p>Results</p><p>5) This is somewhat related to the issue of time courses mentioned earlier. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows 11 peptides' mRNA levels that do not change during phase transformation. According to this figure they also seem not to differ between the extreme phases. Yet, they were reported (and therefore presented here) as differentially expressed in gregarious and solitary locusts. Are these data contradicting? Should be explained/discussed. Furthermore, should one expect the levels of mRNA of peptides 0 hr after crowding to be similar to those of 32 hr after isolation and vice versa? This is not the case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1— figure supplement 1</xref> (nor in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, but compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Last, based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, an effect of crowding is seen more often than an effect of isolation and usually within 1-4 hr. How does this fact correspond with the claim that in L. migratoria crowding is very quick while isolation is slow? All this points need clarification/discussion.</p><p>6) The authors present two measures of behavioral phase (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>): the one is Pgreg and the other distance/duration of movement. The reader may tend to take these as a measure of activity (the latter) and a measure of attraction to peers (the former). However, Pgreg is a result of a binary logistic regression model which includes or is heavily based on the distance/duration of movement! Are locusts injected with NPF only less active or also less attracted to peers? This point brings me back to the issue of an effect on swarming behavior vs. a mere effect on locomotion, which are not the same. Another measure appears in the supplementary figures – Attraction index. There is no definition or explanation for how this measure is calculated.</p><p>7) The most left columns (dsGFP) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> seem to be similar. Why didn't crowding affect the control locusts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 D</xref>)?</p><p>8) Not as described in subsection “Two NPF receptors, NPFR and NPYR, are essential for changes in locomotor activity related to phase transition”, according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the pattern of both NPFR and NPYR during isolation is very similar (increase) and somewhat similar during crowding (no change vs decrease).</p><p>9) Coming back yet again to the important question of time courses, the authors state in subsection “NO signaling is a vital modulator of locomotor plasticity in the G/S phase transition” that &quot;The mRNA and protein levels of NOS […] showed strong correlation with the time course of G/S phase transition&quot;. This statement is not consistent with the Introduction section which claims a very slow behavioral change during crowding and a very rapid change during isolation.</p><p>10) How is the olfactory preference measured?</p><p>11) All immunostainings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> seem overexposed making it unclear why specific regions and cells were selected over others.</p><p>12) I am always a little uneasy when western bolt data and their controls (tubulin as internal reference) are not shown on the same gel.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>1) As already mentioned, throughout there is a not well established connection between elevated locomotion activity and swarming (e.g. &quot;anti-swarming&quot;). This point deserves discussion.</p><p>2) Subsection “NPF1a and NPF2 act as anti-swarming neuromodulators in locusts through receptor-mediated pathways that alter NO levels”: the pars intercerebralis is not the same as the central complex (which is a major neuropil structure linked to control of locomotion in insects).</p><p>3) The previously mentioned issue of time courses deserves in-depth discussion.</p><p>4) I am missing some further discussion to put the current results in the context of the current knowledge on NPFs and feeding behavior. On the one hand, the suggested role for NPF in locust is inconsistent with the reported effects of this family of peptides on feeding behavior in other insects i.e. high levels of the peptides promote feeding. In locusts, it is the gregarious phase which is notorious for intense feeding behavior. However here NPF levels are low in gregarious animals. On the other hand, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva, NPF was found to be highly expressed in the brain during the feeding stage but not in the older larval brain during the wandering stage i.e. it has a suppressing effect on locomotion as suggested here.</p><p>5) Very strong support for the current findings come from Lucas et al. 2010 who reported a phase-dependent difference related to the foraging gene and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) in the desert locust. These authors found higher levels of PKG activity (the product of the foraging gene) in brains of gregarious locusts. PKG is known to be part of the Nitric Oxide/cGMP Signaling pathway, and indeed the current paper reports high NOS and NO levels in gregarious locusts. Moreover Lucas et al. observed high PKG activity and FOR expression in the anterior midline of the brain, the pars intercerebralis, consistent with the expression of NOS and of the NPF peptides reported in the current work. This work should be discussed here.</p><p>Materials and methods</p><p>6) While gregarious locusts were reared 500-1000 per cage, the crowding effect was achieved by placing 22 locust (2 S, 20 G) in the same size cage. This is a little troubling.</p><p>7) As already noted, in most cases data is not presented independently for attraction and for locomotor activity (since the measure for attraction is incorporated in the logistic regression model).</p><p>My last comment is that the manuscript will benefit from careful English proof reading (I do not provide specific examples to avoid a situation in which only my few example will be corrected).</p><p>One (after last) suggestion is to change the title to better reflect the work and the major findings. The current title suggests to the reader that the effect of NPF is already known and that the novelty is only in the role of NO. A better title will actually be more similar to the Impact statement.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22526.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The methodology and controls are thorough and the results regarding the impact of NPF peptides on NOS and NO are clear.

A key sentence has been revised to read “Swarming occurs in a wide variety of animal taxa, including insects, fish, birds, and mammals. Individuals benefit from swarming in many aspects, including food searching, territory selection, and defense”. We also revised the description as “the latter of which is characterized by swarming behavior (Ariel and Ayali, 2015)”.</p><p><italic>2) I am not sure that the sentence &quot;Switching between key types of neuromodulators[…]&quot; reflects the major points presented in the cited references, nor in the current text; the point being that neuromodulators are able of choosing among a behavioral repertoire and thus mediate behavioral plasticity.

We have included additional descriptions as “Behavioral solitarization occurs faster than behavioral gregarization in the migratory locust. The attraction index and locomotor activity of locusts continuously decrease within 16 h after isolation. In contrast, these behaviors do not increase until 32 h after crowding, but are far below the level of gregarious controls even crowding for 64 h (Guo et al., 2011)”.</p><p><italic>4) While in the Abstract the authors state that the &quot;neuropeptide F (NPF)-nitric oxide (NO) pathway plays a critical role in locomotor plasticity&quot;, in the Introduction they claim that the neuropeptides are crucial neuromodulators in &quot;behavioral plasticity underlying swarming&quot;.

Actually, nine of the 11 genes (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) have significantly different transcript levels between G-phase and S-phase locusts. Although the transcript levels of the other 2 genes do not differ significantly between two phases, the tendency of their expressions is consistent with our previous finding (Hou et al., 2015). In this study, we only compare the gene expressions between the typical G-phase (0 h after isolation) and typical S-phase (0 h after crowding) and the time-course expression changes of these neuropeptide genes during isolation or crowding.

Detailed method for the measurement of attraction index is shown in corresponding figure legend and the Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>11) All immunostainings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> seem overexposed making it unclear why specific regions and cells were selected over others.</italic> </p><p>The immunostaining for each signal was exposed under the same condition with the negative control. Since NOS is most intensively stained in the pars intercerebralis, we thus only labeled several cells strongly stained by NOS and NPF peptide to present their co-localization in the pars intercerebralis. The overlap of NPF1a and NOS is also detected in the Kenyon cells anterior to the calyces of mushroom bodies in each brain hemisphere (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>12) I am always a little uneasy when western bolt data and their controls (tubulin as internal reference) are not shown on the same gel.</italic> </p><p>We accept the query raised by the review. The western blot data for target protein and corresponding controls are from the same gel. Since the tubulin shows much higher expression level than the target protein in vivo, the membrane transferred with proteins was divided to two parts, and then incubated with different antibodies and visualized separately. Therefore, we did not show the data in the same figure. We have included detailed description on the methods of western blot.</p><p><italic>Discussion</italic> </p><p><italic>1) As already mentioned, throughout there is a not well established connection between elevated locomotion activity and swarming (e.g. &quot;anti-swarming&quot;). This point deserves discussion.</italic> </p><p>We have revised our description throughout the text to make a clear emphasis on phase-related locomotor plasticity instead of swarming behavior.</p><p><italic>2) Subsection “NPF1a and NPF2 act as anti-swarming neuromodulators in locusts through receptor-mediated pathways that alter NO levels”: the pars intercerebralis is not the same as the central complex (which is a major neuropil structure linked to control of locomotion in insects).</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. We have revised our description and added new reference to support our discussion, subsection “NPF1a and NPF2, their receptors and NOS act in concert to regulate phase-related locomotion through NO signalling”.</p><p><italic>3) The previously mentioned issue of time courses deserves in-depth discussion.</italic> </p><p>We have provided additional discussion on the time course changes of NPF/NO pathway during locust phase transition in paragraph four of subsection “NPF1a and NPF2, their receptors and NOS act in concert to regulate phase-related locomotion through NO signalling”.</p><p><italic>4) I am missing some further discussion to put the current results in the context of the current knowledge on NPFs and feeding behavior. On the one hand, the suggested role for NPF in locust is inconsistent with the reported effects of this family of peptides on feeding behavior in other insects i.e. high levels of the peptides promote feeding. In locusts, it is the gregarious phase which is notorious for intense feeding behavior. However here NPF levels are low in gregarious animals. On the other hand, in Drosophila larva, NPF was found to be highly expressed in the brain during the feeding stage but not in the older larval brain during the wandering stage i.e. it has a suppressing effect on locomotion as suggested here.</italic> </p><p>We accept the query raised by the reviewer. We have put in additional discussion on this issue into subsection “The NPF/NO signaling pathway plays an essential role in phase-related locomotor plasticity in locusts”.</p><p><italic>5) Very strong support for the current findings come from Lucas et al. 2010 who reported a phase-dependent difference related to the foraging gene and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) in the desert locust. These authors found higher levels of PKG activity (the product of the foraging gene) in brains of gregarious locusts. PKG is known to be part of the Nitric Oxide/cGMP Signaling pathway, and indeed the current paper reports high NOS and NO levels in gregarious locusts. Moreover Lucas et al. observed high PKG activity and FOR expression in the anterior midline of the brain, the pars intercerebralis, consistent with the expression of NOS and of the NPF peptides reported in the current work. This work should be discussed here.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this suggestion. We have make a detailed comparison between the significance of NO in the migratory locust and the observations concerning PKG activity in the desert locust (Locas et al., 2010; Rogers et al. 2004).</p><p><italic>Materials and methods</italic> </p><p><italic>6) While gregarious locusts were reared 500-1000 per cage, the crowding effect was achieved by placing 22 locust (2 S, 20 G) in the same size cage. This is a little troubling.</italic> </p><p>The crowding treatment is conducted following our previous study (Guo et al., 2011). For gregarization, two fourth-instar S-phase nymphs were reared in small cage (10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm) containing 20 G-phase locusts of the same developmental stage.</p><p><italic>7) As already noted, in most cases data is not presented independently for attraction and for locomotor activity (since the measure for attraction is incorporated in the logistic regression model)</italic> </p><p>We have presented the measurements of locomotor activity and attraction index independently. The attraction index did not show significant change therefore the data is mainly shown in the supplemental figures. In this revision, we have provided detailed information on the measurement of attraction index in both Methods section and the figure legend.</p><p><italic>My last comment is that the manuscript will benefit from careful English proof reading (I do not provide specific examples to avoid a situation in which only my few example will be corrected).</italic> </p><p>We have revised our writing with the help of an American colleague.</p><p><italic>One (after last) suggestion is to change the title to better reflect the work and the major findings. The current title suggests to the reader that the effect of NPF is already known and that the novelty is only in the role of NO. A better title will actually be more similar to the Impact statement.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. We have changed the title to read “The neuropeptide F/nitric oxide pathway is essential for shaping locomotor plasticity underlying locust phase transition”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
