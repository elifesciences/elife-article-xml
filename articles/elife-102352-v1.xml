Biofilms also form in the course of many infections. <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infections frequently involve biofilms, which contribute materially to the difficulty to treat these infections with antibiotic therapy. Many biofilm-related characteristics are controlled by the second messenger, cyclic-di-GMP, which is upregulated on surface contact. Among these factors is the exopolysaccharide Psl, which is a critically important component of the biofilm matrix. Here, we describe the discovery of a <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> bacteriophage, which we have called Clew-1, that directly binds to and uses Psl as a receptor. While this phage does not efficiently infect planktonically growing bacteria, it can disrupt <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms and replicate in biofilm bacteria. We further demonstrate that the Clew-1 can reduce the bacterial burden in a mouse model of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> keratitis, which is characterized by the formation of a biofilm on the cornea. Due to its reliance on Psl for infection, Clew-1 does not actually form plaques on wild-type bacteria under standard in vitro conditions. This argues that our standard isolation procedures likely exclude bacteriophage that are adapted to using biofilm markers for infection. Importantly, the manner in which we isolated Clew-1 can be easily extended to other strains of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and indeed other bacterial species, which will fuel the discovery of other biofilm-tropic bacteriophage and expand their therapeutic use.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Pseudomonas</kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>Bruynoghevirus</kwd><kwd>biofilm matrix</kwd><kwd>exopolysaccharide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hypothesis Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rietsch</surname><given-names>Arne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI169865</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wozniak</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY14362</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearlman</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI145069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Edward W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hypothesis Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rietsch</surname><given-names>Arne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Certain bacteriophage are specifically adapted to infecting biofilm bacteria by exploiting biofilm characteristics, such as the exopolysaccharides produced by bacteria in biofilms.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biofilms formed by bacteria at sites of infection significantly increase the difficulty of treatment with conventional antibiotic therapy. This increased resistance to antibiotic therapy has been attributed to a variety of factors, including reduced penetration of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wilton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2013</xref>), as well as an increase in antibiotic-tolerant persister bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ciofu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lewis, 2008</xref>). Formation of biofilms is a feature of many <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections, including lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">H√∏iby et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mulcahy et al., 2010</xref>), wound, catheter, and device infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ledizet et al., 2012</xref>), as well as blinding corneal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thanabalasuriar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behlau and Gilmore, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Okurowska et al., 2024</xref>). In some instances, these biofilms have been found to be astonishingly antibiotic-tolerant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamed and Debonnett, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the antibiotic tolerance of bacteria in biofilms, there has been a significant increase in antibiotic-resistant isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D‚ÄôAgata, 2004</xref>). In fact, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is one of the particularly worrisome ESKA<underline>P</underline>E group of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rice, 2008</xref>). With the general rise of antibiotic-resistant isolates, phage therapy has garnered some interest as an alternative to treat these infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yin et al., 2024</xref>). However, biofilm formation frequently interferes with phage infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luthe et al., 2023</xref>), and even though a few bacteriophage that can target <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in a biofilm have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Manohar et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knezevic et al., 2021</xref>), the mechanism by which they infect these biofilm bacteria is unknown.</p><p>The extracellular matrix of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms is comprised of exopolysaccharides, including Psl, Pel, and alginate, as well as proteins and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma et al., 2009</xref>). Psl is of significant interest, since it is critical for biofilm formation, where it is needed for the initial surface attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrd et al., 2010</xref>), as well as structural stability of the mature biofilm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colvin et al., 2012</xref>). Psl has been detected on the surface of individual <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> bacteria in an apparent helical pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma et al., 2009</xref>). It is also deposited on surfaces by a subset of motile explorer bacteria during the early stages of aggregate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Psl production interferes with complement deposition and neutrophil functions, such as phagocytosis and ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mishra et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, Psl enhances the intracellular survival of phagocytosed <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, as well as survival in mouse models of lung and wound infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mishra et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe the discovery of a bacteriophage that uses Psl, this crucial biofilm exopolysaccharide, as a receptor. Interestingly, this bacteriophage only infects a subpopulation of planktonically growing <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, but it can disrupt biofilms and replicates efficiently on biofilm-grown bacteria. Moreover, the phage can reduce the bacterial burden in a corneal infection model, which involves the formation of a biofilm.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phage Clew-1 can form plaques on a <italic>‚àÜfliF</italic> mutant, but not wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic></title><p>We screened wastewater samples at the three Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District water treatment plants in Cleveland for bacteriophage. The majority of phages in these samples used type IV pili as a receptor, and we wanted to exclude these from our screen. We had previously generated a ‚àÜ<italic>fliF ‚àÜpilA</italic> double mutant strain in the lab and decided to use it to exclude both surface appendages as potential receptors. This turned out to be fortuitous, since, surprisingly, the screen identified four phages that could form plaques on the <italic>‚àÜfliF ‚àÜpilA</italic> double mutant strain, but not the parental wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1. We named these <underline>Cle</underline>veland <underline>w</underline>astewater-derived phages Clew-1,‚Äì3, ‚Äì6, and ‚Äì10. Subsequent tests determined that it was the <italic>fliF</italic> deletion that rendered <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> permissive for infection by these phages. All four Clew phage can plaque on a <italic>fliF</italic> deletion mutant of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1, but not the corresponding wild-type strain or <italic>‚àÜpilA</italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>).

The beads were then washed with PBS and incubated for 2 hr either in LB or LB with Clew-1. Bacteria were released from the biofilm by sonication and the input CFU (total CFU attached to beads) were compared to the output after 2 hr of incubation (sum of supernatant and bead-associated viable bacteria). Clew-1 resulted in a significant reduction in viable CFU, arguing that phage infection kills biofilm bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In a related experiment, we used LIVE/DEAD staining of bacteria to assess bacterial viability by microscopy. We established biofilms in microwell slides overnight, then added Syto 9 and propidium iodide (PI) to each well along with phage Clew-1, or a buffer control, and incubated the slide overnight again before imaging the biofilms by confocal microscopy. Infection with Clew-1 resulted in a significant increase in the fraction of the biofilm volume that is PI-positive, indicating that the biofilm bacteria are dying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Phage Clew-1 can clear <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in a mouse keratitis model</title><p>Given the ability of phage Clew-1 to infect <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms, we next examined whether Clew-1 could be used to treat a <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection.

Psl is not a capsular polysaccharide, so this distinguishes the Clew phages from phages such as KP32 that infect <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>. Moreover, these <italic>Klebsiella</italic> phages use a capsular depolymerase to break down the capsular polysaccharide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Squeglia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dunstan et al., 2021</xref>). Clew-1, on the other hand, has no such activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>) arguing that the role of Psl in infection is distinct from that seen in capsule-targeting bacteriophage.</p><p>Phage Clew-1 has the surprising quality that it fails to plaque on wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1, but forms plaques on a <italic>fliF</italic> mutant. We determined that the <italic>fliF</italic> mutation generates a c-di-GMP-dependent signal that up-regulates Psl production. Importantly, it increases the fraction of bacteria to which the phage can bind, resulting in efficient lysis in liquid cultures, and plaque formation in top agar. Plaque formation is likely masked in the wild-type bacteria by the fraction of cells that are not phage-susceptible. Notably, certain Bruynogheviruses are able to bind to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1, but not plaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costa et al., 2024</xref>). We now have an explanation for this observation.</p><p>The identification of Psl as phage receptor prompted us to examine the ability of phage Clew-1 to infect wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in a biofilm. We found that phage Clew-1, unlike the unrelated Ocp-2 phage, was able to disrupt biofilms formed by wild-type bacteria. Moreover, Clew-1 was able to actively replicate on biofilm bacteria, while phage Ocp-2 could not. Taken together, our data suggest that phage Clew-1 has evolved to replicate in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> growing in a biofilm. Given the prevalence of bacterial biofilms in nature, this specialization makes sense. Moreover, our observation suggests that we may have underestimated the prevalence of biofilm-tropic bacteriophage since standard isolation techniques using plaque formation of wild-type bacteria would miss phage akin to Clew-1. In fact, another bacteriophage was recently described that requires an intact <italic>psl</italic> operon for replication and can only plaque on PAO1 with elevated c-di-GMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manner et al., 2023</xref>). This bacteriophage, Knedl, belongs to the family of Iggyviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maffei et al., 2024</xref>), highlighting that more biofilm-tropic bacteriophage wait to be discovered. Our data also suggest that, for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, using a ‚àÜ<italic>fliF ‚àÜpilA</italic> double mutant will allow us to enrich for biofilm-specific bacteriophage, by excluding dominant type IV pilus-dependent phage and up-regulating biofilm-specific surface structures such as Psl, Pel, and CdrA. Given the importance of biofilms in contributing to the antibiotic resistance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in infections such as the CF lung, catheters, or wound infections, treatment modalities that are targeted towards biofilm bacteria are sorely needed. Indeed, phage Clew-1 shows some promise in this regard, since it was able to kill biofilm bacteria in vitro, and control <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection in a mouse model of keratitis, which involves biofilm formation at the site of infection. While Clew-1 plaques can sometimes look turbid, this is likely a function of the fact that Clew-1 can only bind to a fraction of the bacterial population (80‚Äì90% in the case of PAO1 ‚àÜ<italic>fliF2</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We have not been able to isolate Clew-1 lysogens, which is consistent with observations using other <italic>Bruynogheviruses</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knezevic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ceyssens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvi et al., 2021</xref>) and argues that Clew-1 is lytic and not temperate. While many bacteriophages are not able to infect <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms, some phages with the ability to target biofilms have been described, including the <italic>Bruynoghevirus</italic> Delta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knezevic et al., 2021</xref>). We present here a way by which phages that target <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms can be enriched during isolation.</p><p>Capsule-targeting bacteriophages tend to use LPS as a secondary receptor for tight binding to the target cell. While Clew-1 does not seem to require either A- or B-band LPS for infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 3</xref>), we did hit several genes involved in the biosynthesis of outer core LPS in our TnSeq analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We tested whether one of these genes, <italic>ssg</italic> (PA5001), is required for Clew-1 infection and found that this is the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 3</xref>). How binding to Psl and LPS relates to the infection of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by Clew-1 will be examined in a future study.</p><p>Another interesting aspect of the work described herein is the relationship between the presence of the MS-ring (FliF) and its associated proteins FliE and FliG with c-di-GMP levels. While it has been noted previously that flagellar mutations lead to increases in c-di-GMP levels and increased production of Psl upon surface contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrison et al., 2020</xref>), our results differ somewhat in that phage susceptibility was primarily the result of loss of the MS-ring and associated proteins (FliEFG), not, for example, the flagellar filament (FliC). This may be due to differences between planktonically grown (as in our study) and surface-attached bacteria. Surface contact leads to up-regulation of c-di-GMP through surface sensing by the Wsp chemosensory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hickman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armbruster et al., 2019</xref>). Attached bacteria divide asymmetrically, with c-di-GMP levels decreasing in the flagellated daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kulasekara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laventie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manner et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christen et al., 2010</xref>). This asymmetry requires the phosphodiesterase Pch, which has been reported to bind to the chemosensory protein CheA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kulasekara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laventie et al., 2019</xref>). A second phosphodiesterase, BifA, is also required for maintaining c-di-GMP homeostasis and developing an asymmetric program of cell division upon attachment to surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manner et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuchma et al., 2007</xref>). In our TnSeq experiment, we found that insertions in flagellar genes, such as <italic>fliF</italic> and <italic>fliG</italic>, but also insertions in <italic>pch</italic> and <italic>bifA</italic> resulted in Clew-1 sensitivity. Whether the strong Clew-1 sensitivity associated with deletion of <italic>fliF</italic>, <italic>fliE</italic>, or <italic>fliG</italic> in our data, relative to deletions in other flagellar components, relates to a pivotal role of the MS-ring in controlling the activity of Pch and/or BifA is unclear, but worth further investigation. However, our work, along with the work of the Jenal group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manner et al., 2023</xref>), suggests that phages such as Clew-1 or Knedl could be a useful tool for interrogating c-di-GMP signaling pathways in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p><p>In summary, we have described here the isolation of a group of bacteriophages that target <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms by using the exopolysaccharide Psl as a receptor.

Three beads were placed individually into microcentrifuge tubes with 1 mL PBS with 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, sonicated for 10 min in a water bath sonicator, and titered on LB plates to determine the input. The remaining beads were transferred into fresh wells of the 24-well plate with either 1 mL LB or 1 mL LB with 10^9 pfu Clew-1 and incubated with shaking (37¬∞C, 150 rpm) for another 2 hr. At this point, the supernatant bacteria were titered, the beads were washed 1x with PBS and placed individually into microcentrifuge tubes with 1 mL PBS with 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and sonicated and titered, as above. The bacterial titers of the supernatant and bead-associated bacteria were added to obtain the total CFU in the well and compared to the input CFU (bead titer at T0).

Using a double ‚àÜfliF ‚àÜpilA mutant strain, they were able to isolate 4 new phages, CLEW-1. -3, -6 and -10, that were unable to infected the parental PAO1F Wt strain. Further experiments showed that the 4 phages were only able to infect a ‚àÜfliF strain, indicating a role of the MS-protein in the flagellum complex. Through further mutational analysis of the flagellum apparatus, the authors were able to identify the involvement of c-di-GMP in phage infection. Depletion of c-di-GMP levels by an inducible phosphodiesterase render the bacteria resistant to phage infection, while elevation of c-di-GMP through the Wsp system made the cells sensitive to infection by CLEW-1. Using TnSeq, the authors were able to not only reaffirm the involvement of c-di-GMP in phage infection but also able to identify the exopolysaccharide PSL as a downstream target for CLEW-1. C-di-GMP is a known regulator of PSL biosynthesis. The authors show that CLEW-1 binds directly to PSL on the cell surface and that deletion of the pslC gene resulted in complete phage resistance. The authors also provide evidence that the phage - PSL interaction happens during the biofilm mode of growth and that the addition of the CLEW-1 phage specifically resulted in a significant loss of biofilm biomass. Lastly, the authors set out to test if CLEW-1 could be used to resolve a biofilm infection using a mouse keratitis model. Unfortunately, while the authors noted a reduction in bacterial load assessed by GFP fluorescence, the keratitis did not resolve under the tested parameters.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The experiments carried out in this manuscript are thoughtful and rational, and sufficient explanation is provided for why the authors chose each specific set of experiments. The data presented strongly supports their conclusions and they give present compelling explanations for any deviation.

following is the authors‚Äô response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Walton et al. set out to isolate new phages targeting the opportunistic pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>.

The paper also doesn't provide any detailed information on the genetic composition of the phages. It is unclear if the phages isolated are temperate or virulent. Many temperate phages enter the lytic cycle in response to QS signalling, and while the data as it is doesn't suggest that is the case, perhaps the paper would be strengthened by further elimination of this possibility. At the very least it might be worth mentioning in the discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your review. The genomes of all Clew phages and Ocp-2 have been uploaded [Genbank accession# PQ790658.1, PQ790659.1, PQ790660.1, PQ790661.1, and PQ790662.1]. It turns out that the Clew phage are highly related, which is highlighted by the genomic comparison in the supplementary figure S1. It therefore made sense to focus our in-depth analysis on one of the phage. We have included a supplementary figure (S1A), demonstrating that the other Clew phage also require an intact psl locus for infection, to make that logic clearer. The phage are virulent (there is apparently a bit of a debate about this with regard to Bruynogheviruses, but we have not been able to isolate lysogens). This is now mentioned in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This manuscript by Walton et al. suggests that they have identified a new bacteriophage that uses the exopolysaccharide Psl from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (PA) as a receptor. As Psl is an important component in biofilms, the authors suggest that this phage (and others similarly isolated) may be able to specifically target biofilm-growing bacteria. While an interesting suggestion, the manner in which this paper is written makes it difficult to draw this conclusion. Also, some of the results do not directly follow from the data as presented and some relevant controls seem to be missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your review. We would argue that the combination of demonstrating Psl-dependent binding of Clew-1 to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, as well as demonstration of direct binding of Clew-1 to affinity-purified Psl, indicates that the phage binds directly to Psl and uses it as a receptor. In looking at the recommendations, it appears that the remark about controls refers to not using the ‚àÜpslC mutant alone (as opposed to the ‚àÜfliF2 ‚àÜpslC double mutant) as a control for some of the binding experiments. However, since the ‚àÜfliF2 mutant is more permissive for phage infection, analyzing the effect of deleting pslC in the context of the ‚àÜfliF2 mutant background is the more stringent test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>First off, I would like to congratulate the authors on this study and manuscript. It is very well executed and the writing and flow of the paper are excellent. The findings are intriguing and I believe the paper will be very well received by both the phage, Pseudomonas, and biofilm communities.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your kind review of our work!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have very little to critique about the paper but I have listed a few suggestions that I believe could strengthen the paper if corrected:</p></disp-quote><p>Comments and suggestions:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) The paper initially describes 4 isolated phages but no rationale is given for why they chose to continue with CLEW-1, as opposed to CLEW-3, -6, and -10. The paper would benefit from going into more detail with phage genomics and perhaps characterize the phage receptor binding to PSL.</p></disp-quote><p>Clew-1, -3, -6, and -10 are actually quite similar to one another. The genomes are now uploaded to Genbank [accession# PQ790658.1, PQ790659.1, PQ790660.1, and PQ790661.1]. They all require an intact Psl locus for infection, we have updated Fig. S1 to show this for the remaining Clew phage. In the end, it made sense to focus on one of these related phage and characterize it in depth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) PA14 was used in some experiments but not listed in the strain table.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, this has been added in the resubmission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Would have been good to see more strains/isolates used.</p></disp-quote><p>We are currently characterizing the host range of Clew-1. It appears to be pretty limited, but this will likely be included in another paper that will focus on host range, not only of Clew-1, but other biofilm-tropic phage that we have isolated since then.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Could purified PSL be added to make non-PSL strain (like PA14) susceptible?</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried adding purified Psl to a psl mutant strain, but this does not result phage sensitivity. Further characterization of the Psl receptor, is something we are currently working on, but will likely be a much bigger story than can be easily accommodated in a revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) No data on resistance development.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not done this as yet.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Alternative biofilm models. Both in vitro and in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that exploring the interaction of Clew-1 with biofilms in greater detail is a logical next step. The revised manuscript does have data on the viability of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm bacteria after Clew-1 infection using either a bead biofilm model or LIVE/DEAD staining of static biofilms. However, expanding on this further (setting up flow-cell biofilms, developing reporters to monitor phage infection, etc.) is beyond the scope of this initial report and characterization of Clew-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) There is a mistake in at least one reference. An unknown author is listed in reference 48. DA Garsin is not part of the paper. Might be worth looking into further mistakes in the reference list as I suspect this might be an issue related to the citation software.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. Yes, odd how that extra author got snuck in. This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) I don't seem to be able to locate a Genbank file or accession number. If it wasn't performed how was evolutionary relatedness data generated?</p></disp-quote><p>The genomes of all Clew phages and Ocp-2 have been uploaded [Genbank accession# PQ790658.1, PQ790659.1, PQ790660.1, PQ790661.1, and PQ790662.1]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) No genomic information about the isolated phages. Are they temperate or virulent? This would be important information as only strictly lytic phages are currently deemed appropriate for phage therapy.</p></disp-quote><p>These phage are virulent. We have only been able to isolate resistant bacteria from plaques, but they do not harbor the phage (as detected by PCR). This matches what other researchers have found for Bruynogheviruses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Others have used different PA mutants lacking known phage receptors to pan for new phages. However, it is not totally clear how the screen here was selected for the Psl-specific phage. The authors used flagella and pili mutants and found Clew-1, -3, -6, and -10. These were all Bruynogheviruses. They also isolated a phage that uses the O antigen as a receptor. The family of this latter phage and how it is known to use this as a receptor is not described.</p></disp-quote><p>Phage Ocp-2 is a Pbunavirus. We added new supplementary figure S3, addressing the O-antigen receptor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors focused on Clew-1, but the receptor for these other Clew phages is not presented. For Clew-1 the phage could plaque on the fliF deletion mutant but not the wild-type strain. The reason for this never appears to be addressed. The authors leap to consider the involvement of c-di-GMP, but how this relates to fliF appears to be lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a supplementary figure demonstrating that all the Clew phage require Psl for infection (Fig. S1A). As noted above, we have uploaded the genomic data that underpins the comparison in our supplementary figure. The phage are all closely related. It therefore made sense to focus on one of the phage for the analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is particularly unclear why this phage doesn't plaque on PAO1 as this strain does make Psl. Related to this, it actually looks like something is happening to PAO1 in Figure S4 (although what units are on the x-axis is not entirely clear).</p></disp-quote><p>We hypothesize that the fraction of susceptible cells in the population dictates whether the phage can make overt plaques. The supplementary figure S4 indicates that a subpopulation of the wild-type culture is susceptible and this is borne out by the fraction of wild type cells that the phage can bind to (~50%). The fliF mutation increases this frequency of susceptible cells to 80-90% (Fig. 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Tnseq screen to identify receptors is clever and identifies additional phosphodiesterase genes, the deletion of which makes PAO1 susceptible. And the screen to find resistant fliF mutants identified genes involved in Psl. However, the link between the phosphodiesterase mutants and the amount of Psl produced never appears to be established. And the statement that Psl is required for infection (line 130) is never actually tested.</p></disp-quote><p>The link between c-di-GMP and Psl production is well-established in the literature. I think the requirement for Psl in infection is demonstrated multiple ways, including lack of plaque formation on psl mutant strains and lack of phage binding to strains that do not produce Psl, direct binding of the phage to affinity purified Psl.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2C describes using a ‚àÜfliF2 strain but how this is different (or if it is different) from ‚àÜfliF described in the text is never explained.</p></disp-quote><p>The difference in the deletions is explained in table S1, in the description for the deletion constructs used in their construction, pEXG2-‚àÜfliF and pEXG2-‚àÜfliF2 (‚àÜfliF2 is smaller than ‚àÜfliF and can be complemented completely with our complementing plasmid, pP37-fliF, which is the reason why we used the ‚àÜfliF2 mutation going forward, rather than the ‚àÜfliF mutation on which the phage was originally isolated).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, there is a sentence (line 138) that &quot;Attachment of Clew-1 is Psl-dependent&quot; but this would appear to have no context.</p></disp-quote><p>The relevant figure, Fig. 3, is cited in the next sentence and is the subject of the remaining paragraphs in this section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Figure 3B, why wasn't the single ‚àÜpslC mutant visualized in this analysis? Similar questions relate to the data in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>Analyzing the effect of the pslC deletion in the context of the ‚àÜfliF2 mutant background, which is more permissive for phage infection, is the more stringent test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The efficacy of Clew-1 in the mouse keratitis model is intriguing but it is unclear why the CFU/eye are so variable. The description of how the experiment was actually carried out is not clear. Was only one eye scratched or both? Were controls included with a scratch and no bacteria ({plus minus} phage)?</p></disp-quote><p>One eye was infected. We did not conduct a no-bacteria control (just scratching the cornea is not sufficient to cause disease). The revised manuscript has an updated animal experiment in which we carried the infection forward to 72h with two phage treatments. Following this regiment, there is a significant decrease in CFU, as well as corneal opacity (disease). Variability of the data is a fairly common feature in animal experiments. There are a number of factors, such as does the mouse blink and remove some of the inoculum shortly after deposition of the bacteria or the phage after each treatment that could explain this variability.</p></body></sub-article></article>
