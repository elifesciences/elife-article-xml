HD is traditionally thought to be associated with lesions of wake-promoting nuclei. However, lesions of a single wake-promoting nucleus, or even two simultaneously, did not exert serious HD. Therefore, the specific nucleus and neural circuitry for HD remain unknown. Here, we observed that the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) exhibited higher c-fos expression during the active period (23:00) than during the inactive period (11:00) in mice. Therefore, we speculated that the PVH, in which most neurons are glutamatergic, may represent one of the key arousal-controlling centers. By using vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vglut2<sup>Cre</sup>) mice together with fiber photometry, multichannel electrophysiological recordings, and genetic approaches, we found that PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons were most active during wakefulness. Chemogenetic activation of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons induced wakefulness for 9 hr, and photostimulation of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup>→parabrachial complex/ventral lateral septum circuits immediately drove transitions from sleep to wakefulness. Moreover, lesioning or chemogenetic inhibition of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons dramatically decreased wakefulness. These results indicate that the PVH is critical for arousal promotion and maintenance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hypersomnolence disorder</kwd><kwd>paraventricular

characterized by an irresistible need for sleep and an inability to stay awake during major waking episodes, which results in reduced function and overall worse life quality, highlighting its public health importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mahowald and Schenck, 2005</xref>). However, few dysfunctional wake-promoting nuclei have been identified to induce hypersomnia. Therefore, further identification of key hypersomnia-controlling nuclei and neural circuitry represents a common goal for clinicians and researchers.</p><p>In the last 100 years, more than 16 wake-promoting nuclei have been identified. Von Economo first proposed a hypersomnia-controlling region located in the posterior hypothalamus from observations of marked somnolence in patients with epidemic encephalitis lethargic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saper et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, Moruzzi et al. and other studies have revealed that a brainstem ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) is responsible for wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moruzzi and Magoun, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carter et al., 2010</xref>). However, cell-body-specific ablation or inhibition of components of the ARAS—including the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT), basal forebrain (BF), pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) cholinergic neurons, dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonergic neurons, and locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic neurons—yields limited alterations in sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuller et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, the lateral hypothalamic area (LH), parabrachial nucleus (PB), tuberomammilary nucleus (TMN), paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and supramammillary nucleus (SUM) have also been demonstrated to be involved in arousal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ren et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eban-Rothschild et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chemelli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sherin et al., 1996</xref>). However, among these wake-promoting nuclei, only LH orexinergic and PB glutamatergic neurons have been shown to be related to hypersomnia. Dysfunction of orexinergic neurons in the LH results in narcolepsy and sleep fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chemelli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerashchenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamantidis et al., 2007</xref>); PB glutamatergic neurons are considered to serve as a hub, as they receive afferent chemosensory information and play a role in triggering hypercapnia-induced arousal in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), whereas ablation of PB glutamatergic neurons decreases hypercapnia-induced arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guyenet and Bayliss, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yokota et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaur et al., 2013</xref>). The further amazing research found that ablation of LH orexinergic neurons and the lateral PB (LPB) have little effect on sleep under baseline conditions, and deletion of the medial PB (MPB) causes only a modest (approximately 20%) reduction in wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerashchenko et al., 2003</xref>). Clinically, patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Kleine-Levin Syndrome, and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), in which LH orexinergic and PB glutamatergic neurons are thought to function normally, still show hypersomnolence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bollu et al., 2018</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that the key hypersomnia-controlling nucleus remains unidentified.</p><p>Here, we found that the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) showed higher c-fos expression during the active period (23:00) than during the inactive period (11:00). The PVH is located in the ventral diencephalon adjacent to the third ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qin et al., 2018</xref>). More than 90 % of the PVH consists of glutamatergic neurons expressing vesicle glutamate transporter 2 (vglut2), whereas GABAergic neurons are more scarcely represented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ziegler et al., 2005</xref>). PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons co-express corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), oxytocin (OT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hung et al., 2017</xref>), and prodynorphin (PDYN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we applied cutting-edge techniques to transgenic mice and found that PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons were preferentially active during wakefulness, and that the activation of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup>, PVH<sup>CRH</sup>, PVH<sup>OT</sup>, and PVH<sup>PDYN</sup> neurons induced wakefulness. Conversely, ablation or suppression of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons caused hypersomnia-like behaviors. Furthermore, photostimulation of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup>→PB/ventral lateral septum (LSv) circuits immediately drove transitions from non-rapid eye movement (non-REM, NREM) sleep to wakefulness. Taken together, our findings indicate that the PVH is essential for physiologic arousal and the pathogenesis underlying HD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The PVH receives direct inputs from the PVT and PB</title><p>To test whether the PVH is one of the key arousal-controlling centers, we visualized an unbiased map of c-fos expression in the PVH after a period of wakefulness or sleep in mice. Immunohistochemistry results showed a 306 % higher number of c-fos-positive cells in the PVH from mice sacrificed in the active period (23:00) compared with those sacrificed in the inactive period (11:00) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), indicating that the PVH might be an important wake-promoting nucleus. We next determined upstream pathways of the PVH to explore potential connections with identified wake-promoting brain regions. Considering that the PVH contains mainly glutamatergic neurons, we used Cre-dependent rabies virus–mediated monosynaptic retrograde tracing in vglut2<sup>Cre</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) to figure out the direct inputs of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons. Rabies virus infection was clearly detectable at the infection site in vglut2<sup>Cre</sup> mice compared with wild-type littermates, indicating no leakage of viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, we found that PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons received direct inputs from many regions. Among them, the PVT and PB are considered as two important wake-promoting nuclei; they exhibit higher activities during wakefulness than during sleep, and their activation induces rapid transitions from sleep to wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ren et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2021</xref>).

In the present study, we identified the PVH as a critical hypothalamic nucleus for the pathogenesis underlying HD. In previous studies, a 15 % reduction in baseline wakefulness is considered significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2006a</xref>). Lu et al have reported that lesions of the PPT and the ventral sublaterodorsal nucleus (vSLD) result in a 20–30% reduction in baseline wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2006b</xref>).

In the present study, we found that ablation of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons in mice induced a 30.6 % reduction in wakefulness across the 24 hr light/dark cycle, highlighting the significance of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons in maintaining wakefulness and preventing hypersomnia. Furthermore, in our murine experiments, no sleep rebound was seen after PVH<sup>vglut2</sup>-activation-induced enhancement of wakefulness. This finding is in accordance with previous studies using chemogenetics to specifically activate wake-promoting neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erickson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anaclet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Venner et al., 2016</xref>) and indicates that chemogenetic activation of wake-promoting neuronal populations does not enhance the homeostatic drive for sleep. Taken together, our present findings provide evidence of the sufficient and necessary wake-promoting action of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons in preventing hypersomnia.</p><p>The PVH is composed of abundant, diverse, and functionally distinct groups of neuroendocrine neurons, including CRH, OT, and PDYN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sterley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2019</xref>). The PVH is estimated to consist of approximately 56,000 neurons in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morton, 1969</xref>), of which 25,000 neurons express OT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wierda et al., 1991</xref>), 21,000 neurons express PDYN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Purba et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Purba et al., 1995</xref>) and 2000 neurons express CRH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). Almost 100 % of neurons expressing CRH, PDYN and OXT were found to co-express with vglut2 in the middle PVH and posterior PVH, which were also the main distribution regions of these three neuropeptides populations in the PVH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ziegler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holmes et al., 1986</xref>). PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons regulate stress, fear, and the immune response, as well as neuroendocrine and autonomic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kondoh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mezey et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Winter and Jurek, 2019</xref>). There is mounting evidence that exposure to various stressors induces CRH and OT release into the peripheral circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>). However, OT exhibits some opposing actions to those of CRH. CRH serves as the starting point and main driver of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Füzesi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Windle et al., 2004</xref>), while OT inhibits the activity of the HPA axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daviu et al., 2020</xref>). PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons orchestrate stress-related behaviors, such as grooming, fear, rearing, and walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Windle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>), while PVH<sup>OT</sup> neurons modulate reward circuits and play a role in mitigating the stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ono et al., 2020</xref>). In the present study, our results showed that PVH<sup>CRH</sup>, PVH<sup>OT</sup>, and PVH<sup>PDYN</sup> neurons play important roles in the regulation of wakefulness. Considering that PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons play a role in the circadian regulation of wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2020a</xref>) and optogenetic stimulation of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons can simulate stress-induced insomnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Spencer and Deak, 2017</xref>), our results provide further evidence that PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons play a role in stress-related insomnia. PVH<sup>PDYN</sup> neurons are key regulators of satiety, and they project to the PB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2019</xref>). We found that chemogenetic activation of PVH<sup>PDYN</sup> neurons induced short-duration wakefulness; hence, dysfunction of PVH<sup>PDYN</sup> neurons may represent one of the causes of sleep-related eating disorders .</p><p>It is surprising that a single injection of CNO into mice expressing Dq designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) in the PVH can affect sleep for up to 9 hr, but there are several possible mechanisms can explain this. First, given that PVH glutaminergic neurons are largely co-expressed with CRH, PDYN, and OT neurons, which are all wake-promoting neurons, the 9 hr of wakefulness induced by activation of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons partly results from activation of these types of neurons. Furthermore, the PVH sends direct projections to the PB, and it was reported that chemogenetic activation of the PB produced ~11 hr of continuous wakefulness in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, endocrine and autonomic function changes may also contribute to the 9 hr of wakefulness. Glucocorticoid hormones (CORT for mice) are the effector hormones of the HPA axis neuroendocrine system, which are regulated by CRH (secreted by neurons in the medial parvocellular portion of the PVH) and produce direct negative feedback inhibition of CRH neurons in the PVH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Purba et al., 1994</xref>). Our results showed that although chemogenetic activation of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons induced higher CRH levels, it did not cause a continuous high level of CORT. These results suggested that changes in glucocorticoid levels indeed occurred but did not last for 9 hr, so the long-lasting effects of wakefulness induced by PVH glutaminergic neurons’ activation could only partly be explained by endocrine and autonomic function changes; the wake-promoting neural circuits of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons played a more important role in the 9 hr of wakefulness.</p><p>As our results show, PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons send widespread projections to distinct brain structures. According to previous research, PVH<sup>CRH</sup>, PVH<sup>OT</sup>, and PVH<sup>PDYN</sup> neurons all project to the median eminence area (ME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2019</xref>), which serves as an interface between the neural and peripheral endocrine systems. Consistent with these studies, we also observed GFP-positive fibers in the ME. Our present results show that PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons promote wakefulness via PB and LSv connections. Previous studies reported that the PVH→LSv projection exhibited scalable control over feeding and negative emotional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2019</xref>), and PVH<sup>PDYN</sup>→PB projections are necessary for satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2019</xref>), which are all wakefulness-required behaviors.</p><p>HD is one of the most common symptoms in many neurological disorders and mental diseases, including PD, AD, IH, OSA, Huntington’s disease, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), Kleine-Levin syndrome, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mahowald and Schenck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bollu et al., 2018</xref>).

Signals were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Data were acquired and analyzed using pClamp 10.3 software (pClamp, Molecular Devices). ChR2 stimulation was evoked using 470 nm light. In voltage-clamp experiments, the holding potential was –70 mV. When needed, 20 μM of 2,3-dihydroxy 6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzoquinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX, 1044, Tocris Bioscience, UK), 25 μM of d-(-)–2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5, 0106, Tocris Bioscience, UK), and 10 μM of SR95531 (SR, ab144487, Abcam Biochemicals, UK) were added to block N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors, α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), and gamma aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vivo fiber photometry</title><p>Following AAV-EF1α-DIO-GCaMP6f injections, an optical fiber (125 μm outer diameter, 0.37 numerical aperture; Newdoon, Shanghai) was placed in a ceramic ferrule and was inserted toward the PVH. Fiber photometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Long et al., 2009</xref>) uses the same fiber to both excite and record from GCaMP in real time. After surgery, mice were individually housed for at least 10 days to recover. Fluorescent signals were acquired with a laser beam passed through a 488 nm excitation laser (OBIS 488LS; Coherent), reflected off a dichroic mirror (MD498; Thorlabs), focused by an objective lens (Olympus), and coupled through a fiber collimation package (F240FC-A, Thorlabs) into a patch cable connected to the ferrule of an upright optic fiber implanted in the mouse via a ceramic sleeve (125 μm O.D.; Newdoon, Shanghai). GCaMP6 fluorescence was bandpass filtered (MF525–39, Thorlabs) and collected by a photomultiplier tube (R3896, Hamamatsu). An amplifier (C7319, Hamamatsu) was used to convert the photomultiplier-tube current output to voltage signals, which were further filtered through a low-pass filter (40 Hz cut-off; Brownlee 440). The photometry voltage traces were down-sampled using interpolation to match the EEG/EMG sampling rate of 512 Hz via a Power1401 digitizer and Spike2 software (CED, Cambridge, UK).</p><p>Photometry data were exported to MATLAB R2018b MAT files from Spike2 for further analysis. We segmented the value of the fluorescent change (ΔF/F) by calculating (F – F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>0</sub> is the baseline of the fluorescent signal. We recorded data for 3–5 hr per mouse for the analysis of sleep–wake transitions to calculate the averaged calcium signal of ΔF/F during all times of vigilant states. For analyzing state transitions, we determined each sleep–wake transition and calculated ΔF/F in a ± 40 s window around that time point.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Firing rate analysis</title><p>Electrophysiological data were filtered with a band-pass filter (300–6000 Hz) to obtain neuronal spikes. Single-unit activities were sorted according to a threshold and shape detector using principal component analysis via Offline Sorter software (Plexon Co, USA). The first two principal components of each spike on the two-dimensional plot of detected spike events were extracted. Waveforms with similar principal components were clustered via a K-means sorting method. The isolated cluster was considered as a single unit recorded from the same neuron. Spikes with inter-spike intervals &lt; 2 ms were discarded. Cross-correlation histograms were used to eliminate cross-channel artifacts. NeuroExplorer software (version 5.0) was used to produce firing-rate rastergrams, and Prism (version 7.0) was used to produce firing-rate histograms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Autonomic function monitoring</title><p>The heart rate and core temperature of mice were measured by implantable telemetry devices (ETA-F10, Data Sciences International, USA), which allows long-time continuous electrocardiography (ECG) recordings in freely moving, awake mice. Surgical procedures were as follows: After administering chloral hydrate (360 mg/kg, i.p.) to all mice for anesthesia, we removed their body hair liberally from all intended incision sites and surgically scrubbed the incision sites with 75 % alcohol. The implant body portion of the device was positioned subcutaneously along the lateral flank between the forelimb and hind limb. The biopotential leads were subcutaneously tunneled from the abdominal incision to the desired ECG electrode locations. The negative lead and the positive lead were placed at the right pectoral muscle and the left caudal rib region, respectively. All skin incisions were closed using wound clips. After surgery, all mice were kept in a warm environment until the return of normal postures and behaviors.</p><p>Biopotential signal recordings started at 08:00, ended at 18:00, and were sampled every 20 s. Each mouse received either vehicle or CNO (3 mg/kg, C2041, LKT) treatment at 09:00 (inactive period) on the following two consecutive days. Recording results were manually reviewed and then analyzed using Dataquest ART Software (Data Sciences International, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Measurement of CRH and CORT levels by ELISA</title><p>After each mouse received either vehicle or CNO (3 mg/kg, C2041, LKT) treatment at 09:00 (inactive period), blood samples were collected at corresponding time points (2, 3, and 4 hr following injection) and allowed to clot for two hours at room temperature before centrifugation for 15 min at 1000× g. Serum was removed and assayed immediately or aliquoted, and samples were stored at −80 °C. The concentration of CRH and CORT in serum was detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (CSB-E14068m and CSB-E07969m, CUSABIO Technology, China) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Histology and immunohistochemistry</title><p>To confirm the correct injection sites, after finishing all related experiments, each mouse was anesthetized with chloral hydrate (360 mg/kg, i.p.) and then perfused intracardially with 30 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 30 mL 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA). Their brains were removed and postfixed in 4 % PFA overnight and then incubated in 30 % sucrose phosphate buffer at 4 °C until they sank. Coronal sections (30 μm) were cut on a freezing microtome (CM1950, Leica, Germany), and the fluorescence of injection sites was checked with the location of the PVH according to the histology atlas of Paxinos and Franklin (2001, The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates 2nd edn [San Diego, CA: Academic]) using a microscope (Fluoview 1200, Olympus, Japan).</p><p>For dual immunostaining with c-fos and mCherry, mice were deeply anesthetized with chloral hydrate (360 mg/kg, i.p.) and were perfused with PBS followed by 4 % PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. The brain was then dissected and fixed in 4 % PFA at 4 °C overnight. Fixed samples were sectioned into 30 μm coronal sections using a freezing microtome (CM1950, Leica, Germany). For immunohistochemistry, the floating sections were washed in PBS and were then incubated in the following primary antibodies in PBS containing 0.3 % Triton X-100 (PBST) at 4 °C: anti-rabbit c-fos (1:10,000 for 48 hr); primary antibody (Millipore); and anti-mouse NeuN (1:1000 for 12 hr; MAB377, Millipore). Primary antibodies were washed five times with PBS before incubation with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 2 hr (Alexa 488, 1:1000; Abcam). Finally, the sections were mounted on glass slides, dried, dehydrated, and cover-slipped. Fluorescent images were collected with a confocal microscope (Nikon AIR-MP).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>In situ hybridization</title><p>In situ hybridization with Vglut2 mRNA was performed via digoxigenin riboprobes in brain sections. The brain sections were placed onto slides and were surrounded by water-repellent traces. Subsequently, the slides were post-fixed in 4 % PFA for 20 min. In situ hybridization was processed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). DNA templates for in situ hybridization probes were obtained by PCR from either wild-type-embryo or P0-mouse cDNA libraries. All the buffers contained 0.1 % of RNase inhibitor (diethyl pyrocarbonate, DEPC, B600154, Sangon Biotech). Finally, the sections were mounted on slides, dried, and coverslipped with VectaMount (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired using a Leica confocal system or Olympus IX71 microscope. For DsRed immunohistochemistry combined with Vglut2 mRNA in situ hybridization, brain sections were placed onto slides and in situ hybridization was performed after DsRed immunohistochemistry was completed. All the buffers contained 0.1 % RNase inhibitor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Sample sizes were chosen based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to perform group comparisons with multiple measurements. Paired and unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests were used for single-value comparisons. One-way ANOVA was used to compare more than two groups, followed by post hoc Tukey tests for multiple pairwise comparisons. Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software, Supervision, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Visualization, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Medical Experimental Animal Administrative Committee of Shanghai.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Lazarus (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to delineate the potential role of changes in endocrine and autonomic function underlie the change in wakefulness.</p><p>2) The inclusion of the human data needs to be further developed or justified.

They provide a series of studies that suggest that increased activity of the PVH increases wakefulness and that inhibition and/or ablation of the PVH induces hypersomnia. Overall, the studies are interesting and will be of interest. However, several issues need to be addressed.</p><p>The biggest criticism is that the human data though tantalizing is at this point preliminary. Obviously, finding patients with lesions centered in the hypothalamus are relatively rare. However, 3 patients is not adequately powered. The omission of the human data would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>In all studies, how were changes in endocrine and autonomic function ruled out as the cause of the change in wakefulness? This is an important point as the PVH has projections to the median eminence and to autonomic preganglionic neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord. For example, do changes in glucocorticoid levels occur and does this help explain the long lasting effects of CNO?</p><p>Why were the optogenetic studies in the supplemental data (SFig 5).</p><p>The authors should address/discuss why single injection of CNO into mice expressing Dq DREADD in the PVH (Figure 4C and Fig5I) can affect sleep up to ~9 hours.</p><p>In the mouse studies, the methods appear to be solid. The used small volumes but it is unclear how injection sites were assessed in each case. Also, it is not clear when unilateral and bilateral injections were performed. More detail is required.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Globally, the article is very interesting and show a huge number of convincing data.</p><p>The authors start by showing three patients with lesion in the PVH who did show hypersomnia. Although the analysis is very limited and won't be sufficient for a full demonstration, I found this small description of interest.</p><p>The authors then study the afferents to the PVH Glutamate neurons using specific retrograde tracing. They describe a very large number of inputs to these neurons.</p><p>The effect of inactivation of the PVH vglut2 neurons by chemogenetic is quite remarkable with a large decrease of Waking and an increase in NREM sleep without a REM increase. The excitation of the same neurons leads to the opposite effect, I.e. a long lasting induction of Waking and nearly disappearance of sleep. They also show that optogenetic activation of the Glu PVH neurons during NREM induced a rapid transition to Waking. They finally showed that optogenetic stimulation of the PVH Glu terminals in the LS and the PB also induced Waking. Chemogenetic stimulation of the CRH, Dynorphin or oxytocin neurons induced also an increase in Waking although with a much shorter duration than for the glutamate neurons. Then, the authors made an ablation of the glutamatergic neurons of the PVH using genetic tools. They found an increase of NREM and a decrease of Waking during the dark rather than during the light period. This is fitting with the patients data.</p><p>Using unit recordings and fiber photometry, they found out that PVH glutamatergic neurons are active during Waking, nearly inactive during NREM and show some activity during REM. The further then show the axonal projection from the PVH glutamatergic neurons using genetic tracing. This is welcome.</p><p>First a general comment, I’m missing in the Results section the number of animals and the statistics in the text. As it is, it is very descriptive and difficult to figure out the power of the results.</p><p>The neuroanatomical retrograde tracing analysis is very limited and in fact does not bring much to the demonstration. They conclude line 128-129 that the fact that the neurons receive inputs from the PVT, PB, ZI and VLPAG suggest that the PVH might act as key central node for sleep-wake regulation. I found this statement rather weak since so many structures project to the PVH that it is not that surprising that some could be interesting for waking. Further, the involvement in Wake of the mentioned structures is not that well demonstrated. I would prefer a more detailed description of the afferents and to couple it with cFos to determine whether they are wake active. It can be left in the paper as it is but it does not bring crucial information.</p><p>I wonder why they choose to study only two efferent structures and not others? Do they believe that only the projections to the given structures is inducing Waking?</p><p>I’m missing information on whether the three neuropeptides populations of neurons colocalize or not? This is not clear to me? It would be great to know whether each of them are subtypes of glutamatergic PVH neurons.</p><p>What is missing a bit in the unit recordings is a more detailed analysis on the discharge pattern during Waking. Indeed, it would be helpful to know whether the PVH Glu neurons change their activity during different behaviors to more deeply understand their function.</p><p>The photomicrographs shown for the anterograde tracing are of poor quality and it is difficult to figure out where we are in the brains. The drawings help but are not sufficient to show the location of the fibers. I would favor photomicrographs in which landmarks are visible. There is also no quantification there and it is missing. I wonder also whether there is a strong projection to the median eminence since these neurons are mainly known for their neuroendocrine function? I would like the authors to comment on such role of these neurons in the Discussion.</p><p>I never heard of the dorsal terminal nucleus. This does not seem the common name of this region. Please explain.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The neuronal mechanisms of hypersomnolence disorder (HD), characterized by excessive sleep due to pathological conditions, remains essentially unknown. Based on human data from HD patients with lesions around the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), Chen et al. hypothesized that the PVH is a key node for sleep-wake regulation. In addition to the human data, the authors investigated the role of PVH glutamatergic neurons in the control of wakefulness in mice by using cutting-edge genetically engineered systems in combination with in-vivo recording of neuronal activity. They found that PVH-parabrachial nucleus and PVH-lateral septum projections mediated the wake-promoting effects of PVH glutamatergic neurons and ablation of the glutamatergic neurons leads to hypersomnia-like behaviors in mice. I feel that this is an important observation, and, due to combination of human and mouse data, the findings may have clinical relevance to treat hypersomnia. The experiments are well designed and the paper is in principle well written.</p><p>I have one major comment:</p><p>Evidence for selective ablation of vglut2-positive neurons (e.g. vglut2 in-situ hybridization) in figure 6B should be shown. NeuN staining is not enough.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69909.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to delineate the potential role of changes in endocrine and autonomic function underlie the change in wakefulness.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we did more experiments and added a supplement figure. Please see Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><p>In order to delineate the potential changes in autonomic function, we measured the heart rate and temperature of PVH<sup>vglut2-M3</sup> mice after treatment with vehicle or CNO by implantable telemetry devices. We found that chemogenetic activation of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons induced an increase in heart rate and temperature for 3 h, which both peaked at about 2 h after injection and returned to baseline level at about 3 h following administration of CNO. As for the endocrine function, we detected serum corticotropin release factor (CRF) and corticosterone (CORT) levels in PVH<sup>vglut2-M3</sup> mice after treatment with vehicle or CNO. As shown in Figure supplement 3C, chemogenetic activation of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons significantly increased CRF level at 2 h, 3 h and 4 h timepoints after injection of CNO, while the CORT level was only higher than that of vehicle group at 3 h timepoint following administration.</p><p>Glucocorticoid hormones (CORT for mouse) are the effector hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis neuroendocrine system, which are regulated by CRF (secreted in the medial parvocellular portion of the PVH) and produce direct negative feedback inhibition of CRF neurons in the PVH [1] (Robert LSpencer, et al., 2017, Figure 1A). Our results showed that although chemogenetic activation of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons induced higher CRH levels, it did not cause a continuous high level of CORT. These results suggested that changes in glucocorticoid levels indeed occurred but did not last for 9 h, so the long-lasting effects of wakefulness induced by PVH glutaminergic neurons’ activation could only partly be explained by endocrine and autonomic function changes; the wake-promoting neural circuits of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons played a more important role in the 9 h of wakefulness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The inclusion of the human data needs to be further developed or justified.

First, given that PVH glutaminergic neurons are largely co-expressed with corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), prodynorphin (PDYN) and oxytocin (OT) neurons, which are all wake-promoting neurons, the 9-h of wakefulness induced by activation of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons partly results from activation of these types of neurons. Furthermore, the PVH sends direct projections to the PB, and it was reported that chemogenetic activation of the PB produced ~11 h of continuous wakefulness in rats [2, 3]. Furthermore, as we mentioned in response to Essential Revisions 1, the change of endocrine and autonomic function may also contribute to the long-time wakefulness. All these have been added to the discussion in revised manuscript.

According to our previous studies [4-7], after finishing all related experiments, each mouse was anesthetized with chloral hydrate (360 mg/kg) and then perfused intracardially with 30 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 30 mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Their brains were removed and postfixed in 4% PFA overnight and then incubated in 30% sucrose phosphate buffer at 4°C until they sank. Coronal sections (30 μm) were cut on a freezing microtome (CM1950, Leica, Germany), and the fluorescence of injection sites was checked with the location of the PVH according to the histology atlas of Paxinos and Franklin (2001, The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates 2nd edn [San Diego, CA: Academic]) using a microscope (Fluoview 1200, Olympus, Japan).

We found that PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons received direct inputs from many brain regions (Figure 1E and Figure supplement 1). Among them, the PVT expressed a higher level of c-fos during the active period (24:00) than the inactive period (12:00), and activation of PVT<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons induced rapid transitions from sleep to wakefulness [8]. Similarly, chemogenetic activation of PB neurons induced increased expression of c-fos and a potent wakefulness lasting about 9 hours [2]. In contrast, ablation of PB<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons induced hypersomnia-like behaviors [9].</p><p>More importantly, we observed higher c-fos expression in the PVH during the active period (23:00) than during the inactive period (11:00) (Figure 1A, B). Therefore, we speculated that PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons might act as a central node for sleep–wake regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I wonder why they choose to study only two efferent structures and not others? Do they believe that only the projections to the given structures is inducing Waking?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful questions. The reason for choosing these two efferent structures is that PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons mainly projected to four neuroanatomical sites related to sleep–wake regulation: the PB, LSv, PVT and NTS (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and Figure 5—table supplement 1). The PVT, PB and NTS have been demonstrated to be essential in controlling wakefulness [2, 3, 8] and the PB innervates PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons to form bidirectional connections. In addition, the PVH<sup>vglut2</sup><bold>→</bold>LSv pathway is involved in the regulation of feeding, which is a wakefulness-required behavior[10]. Therefore, we explored these four pathways to identify the neuronal circuits mediating the wake-promoting effect of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons and found that optical stimulation of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup><bold>→</bold>PB and PVH<sup>vglut2</sup><bold>→</bold>LSv promoted wakefulness (Figure 5) while activation of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup><bold>→</bold>NTS or PVH<sup>vglut2</sup><bold>→</bold>PVT pathways did not alter sleep–wake states (Figure 5—figure supplementary 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I'm missing information on whether the three neuropeptides populations of neurons colocalize or not? This is not clear to me? It would be great to know whether each of them are subtypes of glutamatergic PVH neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your essential suggestions. The distributions of neuropeptides populations in the PVH have been reported in previous research [11], in which Xu et al., observed marker gene enrichment and pairwise gene co-expression in the PVH regions (Figure S5, Xu et al., 2020). According to the results, almost 100% of neurons expressing CRH, PDYN and OXT co-expressed with Vglut2 in the middle PVH (mPVH) and posterior PVH (pPVH), which were also the main distribution regions of these three neuropeptides populations in the PVH (Figure 2B, Xu et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is missing a bit in the unit recordings is a more detailed analysis on the discharge pattern during Waking.
