in the expanding adipose tissue, but also bone marrow (BM) production of invasive Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes. As BM adiposity also accrues with HFD, we explored the relationship between the gains in BM white adipocytes and invasive Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes by in vivo and ex vivo paradigms. We find a temporal and causal link between BM adipocyte whitening and the Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte surge, preceding the adipose tissue macrophage rise during HFD in mice. Phenocopying this, ex vivo treatment of BM cells with conditioned media from BM adipocytes or bona fide white adipocytes favoured Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte preponderance. Notably, Ly6C<sup>high</sup> skewing was preceded by monocyte metabolic reprogramming towards glycolysis, reduced oxidative potential and increased mitochondrial fission. In sum, short-term HFD changes BM cellularity, resulting in local adipocyte whitening driving a gradual increase and activation of invasive Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>immunometabolism</kwd><kwd>bone marrow monocytes</kwd><kwd>bone marrow adipocytes</kwd><kwd>glycolytic shift</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN-143203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klip</surname><given-names>Amira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN-14333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Philpott</surname><given-names>Dana J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Banting &amp; Best Diabetes Centre-Novo Nordisk Graduate Studentship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017- 2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boroumand</surname><given-names>Parastoo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SickKids Research Training Centre Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019- 2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boroumand</surname><given-names>Parastoo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Diet-induced obesity in mice led to a duration of diet-dependent bone marrow adipocyte whitening, which drove monocyte expansion and skewing towards a tissue-invasive phenotype, likely contributing to ensuing tissue infiltration that accompanies obesity and diabetes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A continuum of chronic obesity leading to metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and eventually type 2 diabetes is of paramount concern worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">OECD, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">World Health Organization, 2016</xref>).

This low-grade inflammation is partly explained by circulating monocyte infiltration into tissues where they differentiate to pro-inflammatory macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kohyama et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes in mice, and classical CD14<sup>+</sup> CD16<sup>-</sup> monocytes in humans, constitute the predominant tissue-infiltrating monocyte subset during chronic inflammation. These tissue-invasive monocytes are classified by high surface abundance of the Ly6C protein, the chemokine receptor CCR2 and the adhesion molecule L-selectin, all of which allow for monocyte extravasation from the BM and infiltration into the tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auffray et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boniakowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fink et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Geissmann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weisberg et al., 2006</xref>). With obesity, the development of Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes along with their stem and progenitor cells in the BM is boosted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Griffin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manicone et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Singer et al., 2014</xref>) leading to a rise in available circulating Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes for tissue-infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedrich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Singer et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Various obesity-driven factors amalgamate for greater Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte infiltration into the AT including (a) increased AT-dependent chemoattraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamei et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nagareddy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Renovato-Martins et al., 2017</xref>) and (b) enhanced BM myelopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Griffin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manicone et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Singer et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is not clear whether the obesity-induced BM myelopoiesis occurs prior to, concurrently, or after the elevation of AT macrophages. Since the BM is a highly vascularized tissue, home to hematopoietic and mesenchymal lineages, and is dynamically reactive to environmental changes, we reasoned it might be an early responder to HFD-induced obesity, producing increased Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes prior to their accumulation in the AT. Further, since BM-resident adipocytes undergo hyperplasia and hypertrophy during obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boroumand and Klip, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doucette et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scheller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tratwal et al., 2020</xref>) we contemplated that this process might be temporally and potentially causally related to the HFD-driven BM myelopoiesis and Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytosis. Finally, we considered whether the response of the monocytic lineage to the BM environment during obesity includes a metabolic shift leading to the increase in Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes. In fact, and surprisingly, little is known about the metabolic orientation of the Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes in states of obesity, although there is mounting evidence of a link between a macrophage-intrinsic metabolic shift and their pro-inflammatory orientation in this condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">OâNeill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thapa and Lee, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Verdeguer and Aouadi, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Hence, the overall hypothesis driving this study is that, with obesity, the increased production of Ly6C<sup>high</sup>-bearing monocytes in the BM is accompanied and possibly caused by a glycolytic shift in these cells, driven by changes in bone marrow adipocytes (BMA). Accordingly, we investigated the temporality of enhanced BM myelopoiesis, BM Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte accumulation, and AT macrophage accrual during high fat diet (HFD) feeding in mice. Next, we explored the potential for a causal relationship between the obesity-induced changes in BMA and increased Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte production. Using an in vitro platform, we deconstructed the effects of obesity-induced BM cellular changes on Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte expansion. We report that BM Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes accumulate in the BM prior to the gain in pro-inflammatory AT macrophages. The rise in BM monocytes temporally correlated with the elevation in BMA. Moreover, BMA whitening correlated with the timely increases in BM Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes, and remarkably, isolated BMA from HFD-fed mice directly prompted Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte development ex vivo. This monocyte developmental cue was also induced ex vivo by <italic>bona fide</italic> white adipocytes while <italic>bona fide</italic> brown adipocytes favoured Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocyte predominance. Noteworthy, the white adipocyte-induced swap in proportion of Ly6C<sup>low</sup> relative to Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes was preceded by a switch in monocyte metabolism from oxidative to glycolytic. Mechanistically, brown adipocytes increased Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocyte proliferation while white adipocytes appear to promote Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocyte conversion and potentially progenitor expansion to increase Ly6C<sup>high</sup> preponderance. We propose that HFD-induced remodelling in BMA disrupts the normal balance of BM monocyte subsets leading to a higher output of tissue invasive Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increased fasting blood glucose, peripheral and BM adiposity by 3 weeks of HFD</title><p>To study the temporal relationship of HFD-induced myeloid changes in the BM relative to that in epididymal white AT (EWAT), C57BL/6 mice were fed HFD or control low fat diet (LFD) for either 3, 8, or 18 weeks.

Collectively, the above data suggest the possibility that the mere shift in BMA towards white adiposity may directly favour induction of BM Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes. To test this hypothesis, we generated conditioned media (CM) from BMA (BMA-CM) pooled from three control and three HFD-fed mice, collected 3, 8, and 18 weeks into the diets. In parallel, BM of control mice was used to generate monocytes through a 5-day in vitro differentiation protocol (as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Francke et al., 2011</xref>, see Methods). These monocytes were treated with BMA-CM from control and HFD-fed mice for 18 hr thereafter. Subsequently, the monocyte population was analyzed via flow cytometry. BMA-CM from 3 weeks HFD-fed mice had no effect on the monocyte subset proportions compared to BMA-CM from control diet-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Strikingly, however, BMA-CM from 8-week HFD-fed mice applied to BM-derived monocytes from control mice resulted in a significant production of Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes compared to the effect of BMA-CM from mice on the 8-week control diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This skewing was further enhanced when exposing the control BM cells to BMA-CM from 18-week HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we tested whether BMA-CM was capable to induce changes in gene expression of the mitochondrial fusion and fission genes in monocytes, as observed with monocytes isolated from HFD-fed mice. Accordingly, in vitro-generated monocytes were treated with BMA-CM from control and HFD-fed mice. As before, the analyzed genes involved in mitochondrial fusion were <italic>Mfn1</italic>, <italic>Mfn2</italic>, <italic>Opa1</italic>, <italic>Tomm20,</italic> and <italic>Tomm40</italic>, while the tested genes involved in mitochondrial fission were <italic>Drp1</italic>, <italic>Ppid,</italic> and <italic>Fis1</italic>.

The mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using MitoTracker Red CMXRos and flow cytometry analysis. Remarkably, Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes incubated in vitro with WATA-CM experienced a left-ward shift in MitoTracker Red CMXRos peak indicating a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential induced by the WATA-CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), reproducing what was observed with monocytes from HFD-fed mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâC</xref>).

to the conversion of Ly6C<sup>low</sup> into Ly6C<sup>high</sup>) or BATA-CM, respectively. To this end, we treated BM-derived in vitro-generated monocytes with WATA-CM, BATA-CM or left them untreated for 18 hr, with or without the presence of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), an indicator of S-phase. Using flow cytometry analysis, DNA-incorporated BrdU was detected in the Ly6C<sup>low</sup> or Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte gates of the CD11b versus Ly6C plots, with BrdU as the third colorimetric axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Although at the highest levels the CD11b signal created a green background signal in the BrdU channel (as seen in samples not treated with BrdU), the actual BrdU signal could be readily distinguished by the yellow to red signal corresponding to the gradient scale shown. Proliferating cells were quantified as percentage of CD11b<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells that were positive for BrdU incorporation (yellow to red signal). WATA-CM-treated monocytes rendered the expected increase in Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes, yet these cells did not show significantly higher incorporation of BrdU than untreated controls, implying that they are not actively replicating their DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). In contrast, BATA-CM increased DNA-incorporated BrdU in the sorted Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocyte subset, visualized as yellow to red hues in the CD11b<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>low</sup> cell gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), and the number of proliferating cells was elevated by 25-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These findings revealed that brown adipocytes promote an abundance of Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes by inducing their proliferation. Interestingly, this replicative behavior of BATA-CM-treated of Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes, which we showed above are more oxidative than Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes, is consistent with recent observations that proliferative cells have higher glucose consumption and oxidative phosphorylation relative to quiescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yao et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Brown adipocytes favour Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes through progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) BM-derived, in vitro-generated monocytes were treated with media alone, WATA-CM or BATA-CM in the presence of the pyrimidine analogue BrdU to detect cellular proliferation.

These results indicated that while BATA-CM promoted expansion of selected populations (CMP/CFU-GEMM and CFU-M), consistent with the increase in BrdU incorporation shown above, WATA-CM was without effect relative to control Media.</p><p>The above findings suggest that while the proportional increase in Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes induced by BATA-CM involves cell proliferation, the proportional increase in Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes induced by WATA-CM does not. As a complementary approach, BM cells were analyzed by flow analysis by first gating for the Ly6C<sup>low</sup> or Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) and then analyzing for the presence of monocyte progenitors within the monocyte subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Illustrated are the GMP, CMP and MEP gates in the monocyte subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). GMP progenitor cells were essentially the only progenitors detected by this approach in the Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocyte subset, and they represented 140 GMP per 1000 Ly6C<sup>low</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). During the incubation time of 18 hr with conditioned medium, we anticipate the progenitors could theoretically undergo only one doubling and therefore unlikely to account for the full changes in Ly6C<sup>low</sup> cell numbers produced by WATA-CM.</p><p>Collectively, the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7CâE</xref> indicate that WATA-CM treatment did not result in an appreciable expansion of progenitor cells or colony formation. Therefore, alternative mechanisms were explored that might contribute to the WATA-CM induced shift towards Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte preponderance, particularly the possible conversion of one subset into the other. It is known that Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes give rise to Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes in mouse blood and BM, and this is paralleled by the human homologous CD14 and CD16 monocyte subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kratofil et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lessard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patel et al., 2017</xref>). However, while there has been speculation about the conversion of Ly6C<sup>low</sup> to Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes, there is little experimental evidence for this phenomenon. Hence, we contemplated the possibility that BATA-CM may also cause Ly6C<sup>high</sup> to Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocyte conversion, and especially whether WATA-CM might cause Ly6C<sup>low</sup> to Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte conversion, however unprecedented. To this end, we collected each FACS-sorted, homogenous Ly6C<sup>low</sup> and Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte populations and, once isolated, treated them with WATA-CM, BATA-CM, or control media for 18 hr. Following treatments, we evaluated the presence of the alternative monocyte subtype relative to that in the respective starting homogenous populations. Surprisingly, no conversion from Ly6C<sup>high</sup> (red) to Ly6C<sup>low</sup> (gray) monocytes was observed in any condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8AâF</xref>), but, remarkably, there was a switch of the FACS sorted Ly6C<sup>low</sup> into Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes following exposure to WATA-CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and E</xref>). While the FACS-sorted starting cells were all Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes, following the 18 hr WATA-CM treatment the monocyte population consisted of 49.7% Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes (and correspondingly only Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes 50.3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). This was in stark contrast to all other isolated cell and CM treatment combinations tested, which gave rise to a maximum of 16.3% of the opposite monocyte subset compared to the starting population. Taken together, the results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> endorse the novel possibility of Ly6C<sup>low</sup> into Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte conversion induced by secreted factors from white adipocytes.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>WATA-CM promotes Ly6C<sup>low</sup> towards Ly6C<sup>high</sup> shift in BM-derived monocytes.</title><p>Representative plots of FACS-sorted Ly6C<sup>low</sup> (gray) and Ly6C<sup>high</sup> (red) monocytes from control mice were independently treated with (<bold>A</bold>) Media alone, (<bold>B</bold>) WATA-CM, or (<bold>C</bold>) BATA-CM (n=6 mice per FACS-sorted monocyte group) for 18 hr after which the presence of the alternate monocyte subset was assessed via flow cytometry.

The latter presented a more glycolytic metabolism underpinned by a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, a rise in mitochondrial fission genes and a reduction in mitochondrial fusion genes. Causatively, we show that CM from BMA of HFD-fed mice promotes the generation of Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes ex vivo. Phenocopying the effect of BMA derived from HFD-fed mice, bona fide WATA favoured a Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte preponderance, while BATA promoted a dominance of Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes. Interestingly, these differential influences by the respective adipocytes are induced by distinct cellular pathways. Mechanistically, white adipocytes induced a shift in monocyte subset proportion, from Ly6C<sup>low</sup> to Ly6C<sup>high</sup>, suggesting a possible and novel conversion of one subset into the other, while brown adipocytes favoured Ly6C<sup>low</sup> predominance by inducing their proliferation. These changes in monocytes were underpinned by alterations in the monocytes metabolism, as WATA blunted the monocyteâs mitochondrial membrane potential and OCR. Overall, our findings expose a regulation of monocyte subsets directly influenced by adipocytes, whether from the BM or from AT. Based on the high abundance of their defining marker, Ly6C, as well as of CCR2, plus their overall metabolic phenotype, we refer to this population as Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes. Future in-depth analysis should define the nature of this interesting monocyte group. Along with the observation of dynamic whitening of BMA during HFD, our results contribute to the emerging evidence that BMA are not mere space fillers, rather they are important contributors to cellular metabolism and hematopoietic lineage decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boroumand and Klip, 2020</xref>). That these changes occur early on in the course of diet-induced obesity suggests that the BM is an early responder to a change in feeding status and that adipocytes play a significant role in directing monocyte subset skewing. Moreover, they provide evidence of novel mechanisms regulating the genesis of such skewing.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>BM as an early sensor and an active contributor to HFD-induced AT macrophage accumulation</title><p>It is now widely recognized that many factors contribute to the accumulation of macrophages in AT that includes the contribution of monocytes. There is mounting evidence for both HFD-induced EWAT monocyte chemo-attraction and for enhanced BM myelopoiesis, that work together to increase the monocyte infiltration and pro-inflammatory AT macrophage accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Singer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trottier et al., 2012</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâH</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Singer et al., 2014</xref> demonstrated that transplantation of BM from 18week HFD-fed mice into control recipients increased the number of invasive circulating monocytes and pro-inflammatory AT macrophages. These pioneering findings heralded the notion that HFD influences hematopoietic myeloid bias in the BM upstream of monocyte tissue invasion, thereby contributing to downstream systemic and peripheral tissue inflammation. Furthermore, HFD-driven chemoattracting signals from the homeostatically disrupted EWAT initiate tissue influx and depletion of invasive Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes from the circulation, which in turn may acts as a signal for their increased production in the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamei et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nagareddy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Renovato-Martins et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, by analyzing chronological changes in EWAT and BM myeloid composition, we observed that total BM monocytes increase by 3 weeks of HFD, whereas the proportion of Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte predominance was evident only at 8 weeks coinciding with a gain in AT macrophages that were also pro-inflammatory skewed. We did not observe statistical significance in HFD-dependent changes in myeloid progenitors, likely due to their scarcity since HSC make up only 0.01% of the entire BM nucleated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Challen et al., 2009</xref>). The rise in total monocytes observed at 3 weeks of HFD and prior to elevation of AT macrophages identifies the BM as an earlier-responding <italic>locus</italic> during HFD. Interestingly, the increase was only apparent in Ly6C<sup>low</sup> patrolling monocytes and not the Ly6C<sup>high</sup> tissue invasive monocyte subset that is known for tissue infiltration in chronic obesity. This might be explained by an initial non-specific upregulation of total myelopoiesis and an increased Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte BM extravasation. Therefore, it appears that only Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes are elevated in the BM at 3 weeks of HFD. By 8 weeks of HFD, we observed a shift in the monocyte subset proportion, favouring Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes. Thus, by 8 weeks, the BM has adopted the âtypicalâ HFD-induced hematopoietic phenotype, in so far as it already shows the increased Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes previously reported at the habitually studied 16â18 weeks of HFD. Of note, we did not observe significant gains in progenitor cells (CMP, GMP) at either 3, 8 or 18 weeks of HFD compared to control diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>), whereas Singer et al. found these cells elevated at 16 weeks of HFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Singer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Singer et al., 2015</xref>). However, in the latter study, at 6 weeks of HFD, they did not observe changes in progenitor populations, yet an increase in circulating Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes was already observed (Figure 5C in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Singer et al., 2015</xref>). Collectively, those key studies and ours suggest the possibility that progenitor proliferation may be dissociated from the time during HFD when the specification leading to the increase in proportion of the Ly6Chigh subset takes place.</p><p>By comparison, we detected a gain in pro-inflammatory AT macrophages by 8 weeks of HFD that is concurrent with the predominance of invasive Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes in the BM. In contrast, the embryonic-derived tissue resident AT macrophage markers, <italic>Timd4</italic> and <italic>Marco</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beattie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gibbings et al., 2015</xref>), were not elevated until 18 weeks of HFD. This brings to light the importance of the contribution of the BM-derived myeloid cell pool to early EWAT pathology and AT macrophage accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Changes in BMA influence monocyte subset skewing</title><p>BMA are a distinctive member of the BM cellular suite that is sensitive to HFD effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pham et al., 2020</xref>). In lean mice, BMA present characteristics that are similar to those of beige or brown adipocytes in peripheral AT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cuminetti and Arranz, 2019</xref>). With HFD, BMA undergo hyperplasia and hypertrophy triggered by PPARÎ³ activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rosen and MacDougald, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, with obesity, adipocyte precursor mesenchymal stem cells tilt their lineage commitment towards adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">da Silva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bowers and Singer, 2021</xref>). While BMA are now known to be a distinct adipocyte population, they express several characteristics of white and brown adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boroumand and Klip, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krings et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sulston and Cawthorn, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tratwal et al., 2020</xref>). Brown adipocyte markers of BMA are reduced in obese mice and a parallel adoption of more white adipocyte markers has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doucette et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krings et al., 2012</xref>). The amalgamation of upregulated white adipocyte proteins and elevated fat storage capacity is known as BM adipocyte whitening. Obesity-induced gains in whole body adiposity was causally linked to elevated circulating CD11b<sup>+</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takahashi et al., 2003</xref>). However, the influence of BMA from either lean or obese mice on the expansion of CD11b<sup>+</sup> monocytes had not been previously investigated.</p><p>The limited spatial capacity of the BM interior as well as the proximity of the cellular lineages in the various BM niches lead us to anticipate that the obesity-linked BMA whitening would influence the monocytic lineage. Here, we found a temporal, positive link between BMA hypertrophy and monocytosis at 3 weeks of HFD. By 8 weeks of HFD, BMA whitening also positively correlated with the rise in tissue invasive Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes in the BM.</p><p>As a proof-of-concept for a direct and distinctive influence of adipocytes on monocyte number and subsets, we show that exposure to soluble factors from <italic>bona fide</italic> white adipocytes favours Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte preponderance while exposure to soluble factors from brown adipocytes promotes the preponderance of Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes. Mechanistically, we discovered that white adipocytes induced a change in the proportion of Ly6C<sup>low</sup> towards Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes, an unprecedented process that is not well understood at present. Although the Ly6C<sup>low</sup> population contained some level of multipotential progenitor cells, it is unlikely that these contribute in a major way to the switch in preponderance of Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes in response to WATA-CM, since this population did not undergo changes in the proximal lineage-committed precursors (CFU-M) when assayed for colony forming unit potential, and further did not involve BrdU accrual (indicative of DNA replication and cell proliferation).</p><p>Brown adipocytes, on the other hand, increased the proliferation of Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes, as evinced by the higher incorporation of BrdU into the monocyte DNA and the expansion of monocyte lineage-committed precursor CFU-M colonies when tested for colony formation. Interestingly, secretome studies have reported that BAT-derived VEGFA and VEGFB can stimulate proliferation in adipocyte progenitors and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bagchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leung et al., 1989</xref>). Adipocyte-specific VEGFA transgenic mice were protected from the effects of HFD and presented altered macrophage polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elias et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that a reduction in brown adipocyte characteristics of BMA also leads to a drop in the factors that would normally favour proliferation of Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes. While the identification of the soluble unknown factor(s) responsible for the adipocyte-specific myeloid influence is outside the focus of the present study, we have laid the foundation for a future, comprehensive investigation of the molecular mediators involved.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>How do adipocytes skew myeloid lineage subsets?</title><p>While the designation of macrophages as âM1 and M2â (of pro- or anti-inflammatory characteristics, respectively) represents the extremes of a wide spectrum of phenotypes, the âM1â pro-inflammatory orientation has been linked to glycolytic activation while the âM2â anti-inflammatory orientation has been linked to oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castoldi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelly and OâNeill, 2015</xref>). A similar glycolytic metabolic switch with obesity has been reported for CD8 pro-inflammatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buck et al., 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, while pro-inflammatory pathways in monocytes are activated by hyperglycemic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shanmugam et al., 2003</xref>), the metabolic preference of the different monocyte subsets had not been explored. This is a compelling question, given that Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes penetrate tissues and differentiate to pro-inflammatory âM1â macrophages while Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes enter tissues to promote healing and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Geissmann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized here that, in the context of metabolic inflammation, there is a change in the metabolic phenotype of monocyte subsets.</p><p>Our findings show that Ly6C<sup>high</sup> and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes had different metabolic preferences at baseline, with Ly6C<sup>low</sup> having higher mitochondrial membrane potential indicative of more active oxidative phosphorylation. Interestingly, HFD consumption lowered the mitochondrial membrane potential of both Ly6C<sup>low</sup> and Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes, implicating a reduction in their mitochondrial oxidative capacity. This change aligned with a HFD-induced reduction in oxygen consumption by Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes. Importantly, this difference was observed as early as 3 weeks and exacerbated by 8 and 18 weeks of HFD. The elevated lactate concentration measured in the BM at all HFD durations may be reflective of metabolic changes in cells of the BM cavity. Since we did not observe changes in the lactate levels in WATA-CM or BATA-CM, the higher lactate in BM of HFD-fed mice may not originate from changes in BMA.</p><p>Along with the change in monocyte subset proportions, we observed an increase in genes responsible for mitochondrial fragmentation and a decrease in those involved in mitochondrial elongation in monocytes from HFD-fed mice and treated with WATA-CM and BMA-CM. The physiological consequence of these changes is manifest by the striking mitochondrial fragmentation in monocytes treated with WATA-CM in comparison to control or BATA-CM treated monocytes. HFD is known to induce mitochondrial fission in a number of cells that correlates with insulin resistance. A recent report linked the two phenomena through <italic>Drp1</italic> action, as <italic>Drp1</italic> inhibition reversed HFD-induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Filippi et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, obese and diabetic humans have reduced <italic>Mfn2</italic> expression in skeletal muscle. <italic>Mfn2</italic> positively correlates with insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bach et al., 2005</xref>), and <italic>Mfn2</italic> gene and protein are significantly downregulated in liver cells of HFD-fed rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gan et al., 2013</xref>). In our analysis, the expression of <italic>Mfn2</italic> negatively correlated with the abundance of Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes, while, the expression of <italic>Drp1</italic> positively correlated with the BM abundance of Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes. Overall, our study uncovers novel and distinct effects of adipocyte types on monocyte subset development that may occur through changes in mitochondrial fitness.</p><p>Given that the proportion of Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes dropped in favour of a predominance of Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes by 8 but not 3 weeks of HFD, it is possible that this subset change obeys a prior switch in their metabolic orientation. Supporting these observations, exposure of monocytes to white adipocyte CM also reduced their mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, BMA-CM from 8-week HFD-fed mice also lowered monocyte mitochondrial membrane potential compared to control BMA-CM and favoured Ly6C<sup>high</sup> predominance. Mechanistically, these data suggest that white adipocytes induce a monocyte metabolic switch that may guide Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte prevalence.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate an interconnectivity of cellular networks within the BM, a vulnerability of the BM microenvironment to HFD, and a consequential myeloid lineage determination likely due to BMA whitening. Because of the vastly different metabolic and soluble factors between bona fide white and brown adipocytes, it is easy to imagine that phenotypic changes in BMA can vastly alter the BM microenvironment and the factors that surround hematopoietic cells. BMA whitening during HFD feeding contributes to myelopoiesis and predominance of invasive Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes mediated by changes in monocyte metabolism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal procedures</title><p>Mouse protocols were approved by the animal care committee (Protocol #20011850 to S.E.G. and D.J.P., University of Toronto and #1000047074 to A.K., The Hospital for Sick Children).

The cells were then washed with FACS buffer, surface markers were stained as described above and incubated in Foxp3 Fixation/Permeabilization Buffer (eBioscience, 00-5523-00) overnight. They were then treated with 30 Âµg of DNAse I.9 (Sigma, 260913) for 1 hr, stained with anti-BrdU antibody (abcam, ab6326) for 1 hr and then washed with FACS buffer in preparation to run on LSR Fortessa Cytometer (BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantitative PCR (qPCR)</title><p>RNA was extracted from cells or tissues using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Cat No 15596018), then cDNA synthesized using the SuperScript VILO cDNA kit (Life Technologies, Cat No 11754250) according to manufacturerâs instructions. qPCR reactions were performed with predesigned TaqMan probes (Life Technologies) on a StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems-ThermoFisher). Duplicates of each cDNA sample were used for gene expression analysis and values were normalized to the average of a set of the following housekeeping genes: <italic>Abt1</italic>, <italic>Hprt</italic>, and <italic>Eef2</italic> by the ÎÎC<sub>T</sub> method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Lactate quantification</title><p>The BM content was fractioned into hematopoietic and supernatant portions by centrifugation at 1600 rpm.

Seahorse 96-well cell culture plates were pretreated with 1 Âµg/cm<sup>2</sup> Corning Cell-Tak Cell and Tissue Adhesive (Fisher Scientific, Cat No CB40240) and FACS sorted Ly6C<sup>low</sup> or Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes were seeded at 100,000 cells/well, allowed to equilibrate for 1 hr in XF base medium supplemented with 11 mM glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM Glutamine. Following baseline measurements, FCCP was injected at 1 mM and thereafter an injection of Antimycin A/ Rotenone. Cells were counted following the Seahorse assay to test for changes in cellular detachment between the conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Immunofluorescence staining for super-resolution microscopy</title><p>Monocytes were spun down onto coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Thereafter, the cells were rinsed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The cells were then blocked with 2% BSA in PBS at 4Â°C overnight. The cells were then incubated with the primary antibody, Tom20 (FL-145, Santa Cruz, sc-11415), in a 1:100 dilution in blocking buffer at 4Â°C overnight. Thereafter, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:100) for 2 hr at room temperature. Cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 Phalloidin (1:100) for 3 hr at room temperature. Coverslips were then mounted by ProLong Diamond (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and allowed to dry for 2 days. The images were acquired via Zeiss LSM880 Airyscan super resolution microscopy and the images were processed via Fiji software. The percentage of monocytes displaying each mitochondrial morphology (fragmented, intermediate, or tubulated) was scored as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rambold et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Colony-forming unit assay</title><p>In vitro generated, BM-derived monocytes (5Ã10<sup>5</sup> cell/ml) were treated with WATA-CM, BATA-CM or media, as indicated, then pelleted and suspended in Iscoveâs modified Dulbeccoâs medium to 2Ã10<sup>5</sup> cell/ml, diluted in MethoCult GF-M3434 medium and plated at 20,000 cells/35 mm well in a 6-well plate of low-adherence culture-ware (STEMCELL Technologies, Inc), in triplicate. The colonies that grew had distinct cell lineages and morphologies as defined in detail by the STEMCELL manual for MethoCult GF-M3434 methylcellulose media. After 7â10 days, colonies were counted, using an inverted light microscope, and identified as: Burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E), Colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythrocyte, macrophage, megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM), CFU-granulocyte (CFU-G) or CFU-macrophage (CFU-M), based on the STEMCELL Technologies detailed instructions. Of note, CFU-GEMM progenitors are also known as CMP, and GMP progenitors give rise to the CFU-G and CFU-M lineages (immediate precursors of monoblasts and monocytes) that form colonies in this assay (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.stemcell.com/hematopoietic-stem-and-progenitor-cells-lp.html">https://www.stemcell.com/hematopoietic-stem-and-progenitor-cells-lp.html</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>ELISA determinations</title><p>The BM content was fractioned into hematopoietic and supernatant portions by centrifugation at 1600 rpm.

See related comments in the recommendation for the authors.</p><p>2) In addition, the authors need to provide the number of times each experiment was performed, provide absolute number (normalize the cell number to the weight of the tissue) as well as include gating strategies for all cell types already at the start of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>â Could the number of times each experiment was performed be added to the figure legends?</p><p>â Please include gating strategies for all cell types already at the start of the paper.

The authors only provide %s of the different assessed cell subsets.

A central claim of the paper is that Ly6clow monocytes mature or convert to Ly6chigh monocytes. However, the authors fail to formally show this either with transfer experiments or in vitro spike-in assays. Furthermore, the authors do investigate the abundance of myeloid progenitors but not their potential. Therefore, in order to stake that claim, it is imperative to further investigate this phenotype with one of the aforementioned assays.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65553.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An essential revision requirement is to provide stronger evidence to validate the claim that Ly6Chi monocytes are increased due to Ly6Clo monocyte conversion to Ly6Chi monocytes.

We had already documented the presence of precursors cells in the bone marrow cells from mice fed control and high fat diet, and also after ex vivo treatment with conditioned media from white and brown adipose tissue. In response to this suggestion, we have now added a new analysis of the precursor markers in FACS-identified Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo monocytes and have also evaluated the potential contribution of <italic>replication</italic> of progenitor cells. We detected a small amount of progenitor cells in the Ly6Clo preparation that could potentially contribute to the expansion of Ly6Chi cells in response to WATA. However, our new experiments of Colony Forming Assays and previous ones of BrdU incorporation failed to show an expansion in progenitor-derived cells and in DNA replication, respectively. We have nonetheless left open the possibility that progenitor cells contribute in part to the increase in Ly6Chi cells, but we sustain that even if it occurred it would not be sufficient to account for the entirety of the proportional change in Ly6Clo to Ly6Chi cells, and we provide evidence endorsing the novel conversion of Ly6Clo cells into Ly6Chi. We expand on these new observations in the detailed response below and the indicated pages in the revised manuscript. The specific changes are indicated within the Answers to the Reviewers, following this section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In addition, the authors need to provide the number of times each experiment was performed, provide absolute number (normalize the cell number to the weight of the tissue) as well as include gating strategies for all cell types already at the start of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Throughout the manuscript, we highlight in yellow all statements regarding the number of times each experiment was performed and other similar information. In particular:</p><p>a) We have stated the number of experiments performed in each figure legend, and we also state in Methods (page 24) the following:</p><p>âEach duration of feeding involved at least 3 mice within each dietary group, and the precise number of mice evaluated in each experiment is indicated in the figure legends. The feeding protocol was repeated with three independent cohorts of mice, initiated at different times. The graphs illustrated include data collected from the three cohorts. Logistically, not every mouse could be used for every type of experiment, and the number of mice involved is indicated in each figure.â</p><p>As well on page 25 as follows:</p><p>âFifty imaging fields per mouse femur were analyzed for the presence of adipocytes, assessed by blinded volunteers. Adipocyte area was calculated using ImageJ software version 1.53.â</p><p>And on page 26 as follows:</p><p>âTypically, when BM cells were collected for monocyte maturation, three mice were independently processed at the same time. This process yielded three cohorts of differentiated monocytes that would each be treated with Media-, WATA- and BATA-CM.â</p><p>If the comment to normalize the number of cells refers to cells of the bone marrow, their number cannot be related to the weight of the entire bone as this structure contains overwhelmingly more structural material and other cells. Experimentally, the cells are flushed out into the same amount of fluid each time, so there is no weight index to refer them to.</p><p>If this comment refers to monocytes/macrophages in adipose tissue, the majority of studies in this field report the % of a particular cell type in the Soluble Vascular Fraction in samples from each diet group, and some studies report the difference in cell number in the fat pad in each diet group. We have used the former (express the content of monocytes, macrophages or pro-inflammatory macrophages as % of live cells in the SVF). Note that we simply indicate these changes at different times during the diet as reference, as our goal was not to analyze any mechanistic changes within adipose tissue, but rather the focus of the study was on changes within the bone marrow, as described above. We hope that these explanations clarify our choice or reporting proportion of cells within each niche.</p><p>b) We now present the gating strategies at the beginning of the paper, both in the Methods section as well as in the new Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1 (formerly Figure S4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>â Please include gating strategies for all cell types already at the start of the paper.

However, when analysing Ly6C lo and hi subsets, we routinely pre-incubate the cell samples prior to flow analysis or sorting with Anti-CD16/32 (Fc Î³ III/II) to mitigate non-specific binding of all antibody reagents to the Fc Î³ receptors. In addition, we always run a Ly6C FMO control (antibody cocktail minus Ly6C) to clearly delineate a Ly6C negative signal from a Ly6Clo gate. Further, we use primary antibodies directly conjugated to a fluorophore. Together, we believe these steps reduce the additional requirement of an isotype control for each of our surface markers, including Ly6C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Can some quantification be provided for Figure 6F?</p></disp-quote><p>In attendance to this comment and have now repeated these experiments using samples from an additional 3 mice, treated their BM-derived in vitro-generated monocytes with WATA-CM and BATA-CM, and analyzed mitochondrial morphology in &gt;50 cells per condition, using a binning tool to quantify fragmented, intermediate and elongated mitochondria (Rambold et al., 2011. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 108(25):10190-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1107402108). The new results are presented in Figure 6F-H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Several claims within the paper need further experimental data to be valid.</p><p>1. The authors only provide %s of the different assessed cell subsets. In light of the growth of tissue and the dynamics of adipose tissue growth, it would be important to normalize the cell number to the weight of the tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not report the % of monocyte subsets in adipose tissue, rather in the bone marrow. The weight of the adipose tissue over time and across diets is given in figure 1. In figure 2, we next simply report the proportion of monocytes, or of macrophages, or of pro-inflammatory macrophages over time and with each diet. The point routinely communicated in the field is the increase in immune cells within the adipose tissue as it expands, and to our knowledge, it is usually not reported relative to the size of the expanding tissue. We simply indicate these changes at different times during the diet as reference, but do not analyze any mechanistic changes within adipose tissue, as the focus of our study was the changes in monocytes within the BM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Prior literature has identified several adipose tissue-resident macrophage subsets. the authors should use these markers and assess the heterogeneity of macrophages at their time points (Silva et al., 2019, JEM).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a deep analysis of the cellular diversity and nuances of the adipose tissue and BM populations would be interesting to do, but we submit that this would constitute a stand-alone, large analysis that lies beyond the gist of our study, which was to explore the relationship between the changes in adipocytes within the bone marrow and the increase in Ly6Chi that happen with diet.</p><p>Regarding adipose tissue-resident macrophage subset, we had reported the levels of the resident macrophage markers Timd4 and Marco to distinguish resident from recruited macrophages (Figure 2). However, we did not measure also the markers reported by Silva et al., because our focus was not adipose tissue cells, rather the bone marrow monocyte subsets, Ly6Clo and Ly6Chi. The markers used by Silva et al., and other authors as well, could be used in the future to characterize adipose tissue immune cells using RNAseq across times and conditions, a goal clearly beyond the scope of our study. That type of future study could even include the bone marrow cells (or the muscle, or the liver) to provide a dynamic landscape of immune cells in the body under high fat feeding stress. The Reviewerâs comment is taken as an inspiration for that future analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. A central claim of the paper is that Ly6clow monocytes mature or convert to Ly6chigh monocytes. However, the authors fail to formally show this either with transfer experiments or in vitro spike-in assays. Furthermore, the authors do investigate the abundance of myeloid progenitors but not their potential. Therefore, in order to stake that claim, it is imperative to further investigate this phenotype with one of the aforementioned assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We have attended to this comment in two ways, as follows:</p><p>a) In new experiments, we have now analyzed BM cells by flow analysis for the presence of monocyte progenitors within FACS-identified Ly6C<sup>low</sup> or Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte subsets. GMP progenitor cells were essentially the only progenitors detected by this approach in the Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocyte subset, and they represented 140 GMP per 1000 Ly6C<sup>low</sup> cells (Figure 7E). During the incubation time of 18 h with conditioned medium, we anticipate the progenitors could theoretically undergo only one doubling and therefore unlikely to account for the overall changes in Ly6C<sup>low</sup> cell numbers produced by WATA-CM.</p><p>These results complement our previous observations measuring the progenitors into (CMP, GMP, MEP) and HSC and MPP in bone marrow cells isolated from mice fed control and HFD (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 2). This choice of progenitor and precursor markers emulates the ones used in the key study of Singer et al., (2014) who measured GMP and pre-GM (CMP). In our study, there were no gains in any of these progenitors in response to HFD. The difference is now discussed on pages 19-20, lines 431-438 of our revised manuscript, as follows:</p><p>âOf note, we did not observe significant gains in progenitor cells (CMP, GMP) at either 3, 8 or 18 weeks of HFD compared to control diet (Figure 2 âfigure supplemental 2), whereas Singer et al., found these cells elevated at 16 weeks of HFD (Singer et al., 2014, Singer et al., 2015). However, in in the latter study, at 6 weeks of HFD, they did not observe changes in progenitor populations, yet an increase in circulating Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes was already observed. Collectively, those key studies and ours suggest the possibility that progenitor proliferation may be dissociated from the time during HFD when the specification leading to the increase in proportion of the Ly6C<sup>high</sup> subset takes place.â</p><p>B) Further attending to the reviewerâs question, we have now performed Colony Forming Assays in BM in vitro-generated monocytes treated with WATA (new Figure 7C,D). WATA treatment failed to cause an expansion in progenitor-derived cells, whereas treatment with BATA, which we propose causes a proliferation of Ly6Clo cells, did. The new text and results on pages 15-16, lines 341-365 read as follows:</p><p>âTo buttress the above results, we also assessed the colony forming potential of in vitro-generated monocytes that received pre-treatment of WATA-CM or BATA-CM, to assess the potential for expansion of progenitor cells present in the samples. Colonies were identified as BFU-E (giving rise to erythroid cells); CFU-GEMM (giving rise to large mixed cultures of granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, megakaryocyte; also, known as CMP); CFU-G (giving rise to granulocytes) or CFU-M (giving rise to macrophages). BATA-CM promoted growth of CMP/CFU-GEMM cultures over control Media (**p&lt;0.01 Two-way ANOVA, Tukeyâs multiple comparisons, Figure 7C) and biased granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (widely known as GMP) towards macrophage over granulocyte differentiation, relative to control Media (**p&lt;0.01) or WATA-CM (*p&lt;0.05 or ***p&lt;0.001, Figure 7C). The total numbers of colonies that grew after 7-10 days of culturing of each pre-treated cohort of monocytes were not different across the three treatments, although trended upwards with BATA-CM (Figure 7D). These results indicated that while BATA-CM promoted expansion of selected populations (CMP/CFU-GEMM and CFU-M), consistent with the increase in BrdU incorporation shown above, WATA-CM was without effect relative to control Media.</p><p>The above findings suggest that while the proportional increase in Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes induced by BATA-CM involves cell proliferation, the proportional increase in Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes induced by WATA-CM does not.</p><p>Collectively, those results indicate that WATA-CM treatment did not result in any appreciable expansion of progenitor cells or colony formation. Accordingly, alternative mechanisms had to be explored that might contribute to the WATA-CM induced shift towards Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte preponderance.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
