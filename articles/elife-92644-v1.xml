whereas extraocular muscles (EOMs) are comparatively spared. While hindlimb and diaphragm muscles of end-stage SOD1G93A (G93A) mice (a familial ALS mouse model) exhibit severe denervation and depletion of Pax7<sup>+</sup>satellite cells (SCs), we found that the pool of SCs and the integrity of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are maintained in EOMs. In cell sorting profiles, SCs derived from hindlimb and diaphragm muscles of G93A mice exhibit denervation-related activation, whereas SCs from EOMs of G93A mice display spontaneous (non-denervation-related) activation, similar to SCs from wild-type mice. Specifically, cultured EOM SCs contain more abundant transcripts of axon guidance molecules, including <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, along with more sustainable renewability than the diaphragm and hindlimb counterparts under differentiation pressure. In neuromuscular co-culture assays, AAV-delivery of <italic>Cxcl12</italic> to G93A-hindlimb SC-derived myotubes enhances motor neuron axon extension and innervation, recapitulating the innervation capacity of EOM SC-derived myotubes. G93A mice fed with sodium butyrate (NaBu) supplementation exhibited less NMJ loss in hindlimb and diaphragm muscles. Additionally, SCs derived from G93A hindlimb and diaphragm muscles displayed elevated expression of <italic>Cxcl12</italic> and improved renewability following NaBu treatment in vitro. Thus, the NaBu-induced transcriptomic changes resembling the patterns of EOM SCs may contribute to the beneficial effects observed in G93A mice. More broadly, the distinct transcriptomic profile of EOM SCs may offer novel therapeutic targets to slow progressive neuromuscular functional decay in ALS and provide possible ‘response biomarkers’ in pre-clinical and clinical studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</kwd><kwd>satellite cell</kwd><kwd>neuromuscular junction</kwd><kwd>chemokine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS105621</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jingsong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS129219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ostrow</surname><given-names>Lyle W</given-names></name><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Jianjie</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jingsong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG071676</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Jianjie</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jingsong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AL170061(W81XWH1810684)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jingsong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The distinct transcriptomic features of extraocular muscle satellite cells, partially mimicked by NaBu treatment, endow enhanced self-renewal and axon attraction, contribute to neuromuscular junction preservation during ALS progression.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disorder characterized by progressive motor neuron (MN) loss and skeletal muscle wasting, resulting in respiratory failure and death 3–5 years following diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hardiman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vucic et al., 2014</xref>). While not entirely spared, the extraocular muscles (EOMs) of ALS patients and mutant mouse models exhibit comparatively preserved structure and function and retained neuromuscular junctions (NMJ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Domellöf, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Domellof, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmadi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Valdez et al., 2012</xref>).

The degree to which ‘dying-forward’ from the central nerve system or ‘dying-back’ process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dadon-Nachum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frey et al., 2000</xref>) starting distally at NMJs contributing to ALS progression remains unsettled and may vary in different patient subsets. Regardless of the direction of communication and relative contribution of different cell types to ALS progression (e.g. glia, neurons, myofibers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frey et al., 2000</xref>), it is widely accepted that NMJ disassembly and the resulting skeletal muscle denervation is a critical pathogenic event in both patients and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campanari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cappello and Francolini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Martineau et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>EOMs differ from limb and trunk muscles in many respects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Horn and Straka, 2021</xref>). In contrast to other skeletal muscles, the individual motor neurons (MNs) controlling EOMs innervate fewer EOM myofibers, and individual myofibers often have multiple NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nijssen et al., 2017</xref>). The multiple innervation phenotype refers to the co-existence of innervated ‘en plaque’ and ‘en grappe’ NMJs in a single EOM myofiber. The ‘en plaque’ type of NMJs are located in the middle portion of myofibers and resemble NMJs seen in other types of muscles. Each EOM myofiber has one ‘un plaque’ NMJ. ‘en grappe’ NMJs are a series of smaller, grape-shaped NMJs that are located in the distal portion of some EOM myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Domellöf, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nijssen et al., 2017</xref>). MNs innervating EOMs express higher level of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins calbindin-D28k and parvalbumin, thus may be more resistant to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced excitotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ince et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexianu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mosier et al., 2000</xref>). Pronounced differences exist between EOM and limb muscles in their transcriptomic profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fischer et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, a recent proteomic study revealed more than 2500 proteins differentially expressed between EOM and EDL muscles and more than 2000 between EOM and soleus muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eckhardt et al., 2023</xref>). However, none of muscle-derived neuroprotective factors, including BDNF, GDNF, NT3, and NT4 were expressed (RNA or proteins) significantly higher in EOM myofibers compared to hindlimb myofibers in both mutant G93A and wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eckhardt et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harandi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Harandi et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, it is important to look for clues in other cell types that influence the microenvironment around NMJs, such as satellite cells (SCs).</p><p>An association between SC function, NMJ integrity, and resultant denervation has been demonstrated in animal models of aging and muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Using transgenic mice expressing GFP in the progeny of activated SCs, Liu and colleagues demonstrated that inducible depletion of adult skeletal muscle SCs impaired the regeneration of NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2015b</xref>). Furthermore, they found that the loss of SCs exacerbated age-related NMJ degeneration. Preservation of SCs attenuated aging-related NMJ loss and improved muscle performance in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). SCs from EOMs exhibit superior expansion and renewability (the capability to maintain dividing and undifferentiated stem cells after rounds of regeneration) than their limb counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stuelsatz et al., 2015</xref>), inspiring us to compare the phenotypes of SCs derived from EOMs and limb muscles and to conduct transcriptomic profiling of SCs to look for candidate genes that could preserve NMJ integrity in ALS.</p><p>In the current study, we found that the integrity of NMJs and the amount of Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs are maintained in EOMs in end-stage G93A mice, in contrast to the severe denervation and depletion of Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs in hindlimb and diaphragm muscles. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that the EOM SCs exhibit abundant transcripts of axon guidance molecules, such as <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, along with sustainable renewability compared with SCs from diaphragm and hindlimb muscles. Furthermore, EOM SC-derived myotubes enhance axon extension and innervation in co-culture experiments with spinal motor neurons compared to hindlimb SC-derived myotubes.

We found that G93A mice fed with 2% sodium butyrate (NaBu) in drinking water decreased NMJ denervation and SC depletion in hindlimb and diaphragm muscles. Adding NaBu to the culture medium improved the renewability of SCs derived from the G93A hindlimb and diaphragm muscles, as well as increasing the expression of <italic>Cxcl12,</italic> resembling EOM SC transcriptomic pattern.

When G93A SCs are isolated and cultured in vitro, their properties become similar to those of WT counterparts.</p><p>Additionally, we listed top 20 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; ranked by Log2FC, both the upregulated and downregulated) by comparing: (1) EOM SCs to their hindlimb and diaphragm counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>); (2) G93A SCs to WT SCs of the same muscle origin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>); (3) G93A hindlimb and diaphragm SCs with and without 3-day NaBu treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata3">Figure 6—source data 3</xref>).</p><p>The top 20 DEGs comparing EOM SCs to their hindlimb and diaphragm counterparts are mainly homeobox transcription factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>), reflecting different anatomic origin of these SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Robertis et al., 1990</xref>). For example, Alx4 and Pitx1 are expressed significantly higher in EOM SCs, while <italic>Lbx1</italic>, <italic>Tbx1</italic>, <italic>Hoxa,</italic> and <italic>Hoxc</italic> genes are expressed significantly lower in EOM SCs than hindlimb and diaphragm counterparts acquired from either WT or G93A mice.

Additionally, Pax3 is expressed significantly lower in EOM SCs than hindlimb and diaphragm counterparts cultured in growth medium, which reflects the unique Pax3-independent induction of myoD expression reported in EOM SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sambasivan et al., 2009</xref>). It is also worth mentioning that BMP4 is expressed significantly higher in G93A EOM SCs compared to G93A hindlimb and diaphragm counterparts cultured in differentiation medium, potentially contributing to the continued expansion and slowed myogenic differentiation of EOM SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ono et al., 2011</xref>). This trend is also seen in SCs acquired from WT mice, but not pronounced enough to make it to the top 20 list. However, most of the top 20 differentially expressed genes between G93A and WT SCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>) are with poor functional annotation records and there exist great variations in the lists between muscles of different origins. We also examined the top 20 differentially expressed genes following 3-day NaBu treatment in G93A hindlimb and diaphragm SCs. It did not turn out to be very informative (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata3">Figure 6—source data 3</xref>).</p><p>To better understand RNA-Seq data in the perspective of SC homeostasis, which refers to the transition between quiescence (dormant, slow self-renewal), activation (rapid amplification with symmetric and asymmetric cell division) and differentiation states during tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ancel et al., 2021</xref>), we compiled the lists of quiescence, activation and differentiation signature genes respectively. For quiescence signature genes, a list of 507 genes highly upregulated in quiescent SCs compared to activated SCs have been generated previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fukada et al., 2007</xref>.

The activation signature gene list was generated from our RNA-seq data using those expressed significantly higher in SCs (both from WT and G93A) in growth medium (1187 genes in total, |log2FC|≥0.4 and FDR ≤0.001). Accordingly, the differentiation signature gene list was generated from those expressed significantly higher in SCs cultured in differentiation medium (1349 genes in total).</p><p>To verify that our signature gene lists recapitulate the SC properties at activation and differentiation state reported in previous studies, we did functional annotation analysis (KEGG pathway, Gene ontology_biological process, Gene ontology_cellular component). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, the top functional annotations enriched in our activation signature genes are all related to cell cycle and DNA replication, while the top functional annotations for our differentiation signature genes are associated with muscle contraction, muscle-specific subcellular structures and metabolic changes.</p><p>To explore whether the homeostatic states of EOM SCs are different from that of SCs from other muscle origins, we looked for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared-in-common among the following four groups: WT EOM SC-vs-WT diaphragm SC; WT EOM SC-vs-WT HL SC; G93A EOM SC-vs-G93A diaphragm SC; G93A EOM SC-vs-G93A HL SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left two panels). Within the 1119 shared DEGs identified in SCs cultured in growth medium, slightly more activation signature genes and quiescence signature genes were expressed higher in EOM SCs compared to diaphragm and hindlimb-derived SCs. Meanwhile more differentiation signature genes were expressed lower in EOM SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, leftmost panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata4">Figure 6—source data 4</xref>). These trends became much more prominent in the 3318 shared DEGs identified in SCs cultured in differentiation medium, implying that EOM SCs are notably superior at preserving renewability in a differentiation environment than their diaphragm and hindlimb counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, middle panel). Consistently, subgroups of quiescence signature genes belonging to commonly used stem cell markers (<italic>Pax7, Cd34, Cxcr4, Vcam1, Sdc3, Sdc4, Cdh15, Met, Cav1</italic>), Notch signaling pathway (<italic>Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, Jag1, Heyl, Dtx4, Msc</italic>) and pluripotency signaling pathway (<italic>Klf4, Igf1, Bmp2, Bmp4, Fzd4, Fgfr4, Pik3r1, Lifr</italic>) were all expressed higher in EOM SCs in differentiation medium than SCs derived from diaphragm and hindlimb muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, middle panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata5">Figure 6—source data 5</xref>).</p><p>In parallel, we examined whether the 3-day NaBu treatment could alter the homeostasis of G93A diaphragm and hindlimb SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, rightmost panel). There were 3018 DEGs shared between the following two comparing groups: G93A diaphragm SC_D_NaBu3-vs-G93A diaphragm SC_D and G93A HL SC_D_NaBu3-vs-G93A HL SC_D. Similar to the trends observed in EOM SCs in differentiation medium, the majority of activation and quiescence signature genes found in these DEGs were upregulated in the NaBu treated group, while the differentiation signature genes were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, rightmost panel). The elevated quiescence signature genes of the NaBu treated group include commonly used stem cell markers (<italic>Pax7, Cd34, Vcam1, Sdc4, Cdh2, Met, Cav1, Itga7</italic>), Notch signaling pathway members (<italic>Notch3</italic>, <italic>Rbpj</italic>) and pluripotency signaling pathway components (<italic>Fzd4</italic>, <italic>Bmp4</italic>). However, other three pluripotency-related genes (<italic>Klf4</italic>, <italic>Wnt4</italic> and <italic>Bmp2</italic>) were found downregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata6">Figure 6—source data 6</xref>), indicating that NaBu treatment also has a mixed impact on the stemness of the SCs.</p><p>To compile EOM SCs signature gene list, we identified 621 genes expressed higher in EOM SCs than diaphragm and hindlimb SCs cultured in growth medium from the 1119 DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, leftmost panel). Next, we pulled out 2424 genes that are expressed higher in EOM SCs than diaphragm and hindlimb SCs cultured in differentiation medium from the 3318 DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, middle panel). These two lists have 478 genes shared-in-common. Particularly, many of these genes are related to axon guidance, cell migration and neuron projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1 fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 1 and 2</xref> further demonstrate this phenotype when the functional annotation analysis was done separately for the growth or differentiation culture conditions. The functional annotation analysis for the 3018 genes altered by the 3-day NaBu treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, rightmost panel) also spotted axon guidance, cell migration and neuron projection on the top of the annotation lists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata3">Figure 7—source data 3</xref>). Importantly, the chemokine <italic>Cxcl12</italic> shows up in all three lists. Cxcl12 is known to promote axonal extension and NMJ regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Negro et al., 2017</xref>).

The axons stayed close to the edge of the microgrooves and even grew backward toward the neuronal compartment, which we termed ‘edge effect’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref>, arrows). This was rarely seen in the WT hindlimb SC-derived myotubes. In contrast, RSMN axon extension was dramatically enhanced in the co-culture system either with G93A hindlimb SC-derived myotubes overexpressing <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, or G93A EOM SC-derived myotubes overexpressing GFP (as control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>). Those neurites located close to the microgrooves were often seen to closely grow along nearby myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B</xref>). G93A hindlimb SC-derived myotubes overexpressing <italic>Cxcl12</italic> occasionally were even seen to overcome the ‘edge effect’ and redirect the axons toward their proximities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B</xref>, arrow) - a persuasive indication of chemoattractive effects of those myotubes. Meanwhile, RSMN innervation of AChR clusters (BTX positive patches) were not seen in co-cultures with G93A hindlimb SC-derived myotubes overexpressing GFP, while they were consistently observed in the other three types of AAV-transduced myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).</p><p>The overall innervation incidence was too low for statistical analysis due to the sparsity of axons in the myotube compartments, thus we conducted co-culture experiments where RSMNs were added to SC-derived myotubes in a uni-compartmental co-culture setting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>, when co-cultured in a single compartment, <italic>Cxcl12</italic> overexpressing G93A hindlimb SC-derived myotubes exhibited increased innervation compared to GFP overexpressing controls. Furthermore, individual <italic>Cxcl12</italic> overexpressing EOM SC-derived myotubes were frequently innervated by multiple (3 or more) times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1D</xref>), recapitulating the ‘multi-innervation’ property of EOMs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nijssen et al., 2017</xref>). The extra ‘anchor points’ seemed to encourage better spatial alignment of the RSMN axon network to the myotubes globally in the co-cultures. This spatial alignment of RSMN axons and myotubes was not observed in co-cultures of RSMNs and hindlimb SC-derived myotubes (<italic>without Cxcl12 overexpression</italic>), which also did not exhibit multi-innervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Under higher magnification, we often observed that axons sending branches to adjacent BTX positive patches on EOM SC-derived myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, arrows). Of note, there was higher expression of several Netrin and Semaphorin family members reported to promote axon-branching in EOM SCs compared to other muscle-derived SCs cultured in differentiation medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dent et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fukunishi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jeroen Pasterkamp et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tang and Kalil, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hayano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dong et al., 2023</xref>).

Besides the developmental myosin isoforms, EOMs also express both adult fast and slow myosin contractile elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhou et al., 2010a</xref>), suggesting that the sparing may not be solely linked to the fast or slow twitch nature of the muscle fibers, rather the changes in SCs may play a pivotal role in preserving the EOM function during the progression of ALS. We have demonstrated an association between the degeneration of NMJs and depletion of peri-NMJ SCs in hindlimb and diaphragm muscles in vivo in end-stage G93A mice. In contrast, EOM NMJs exhibited no signs of denervation or SCs depletion. The FACS profile of SCs isolated from EOM suggests spontaneous activation even without pathological stimulation, which is supported by previous in vivo BrdU labeling and staining results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McLoon and Wirtschafter, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, immunostaining, qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq analyses all imply that EOM SCs in vitro possess superior renewability better than hindlimb and diaphragm SCs, under differentiation-inducing culture conditions. Comparative functional annotation analyses of the transcriptomes highlight higher expression of axon guidance molecules in EOM SCs. Neuromuscular coculture experiments demonstrate that EOM SC-derived myotubes are more attractive to potential axons derived from rat spinal motor neurons than their hindlimb counterparts – which in fact appeared to repel the branching axons. Thus, the unique homeostasis regulation and axon attraction properties of EOM SCs may contribute to the resistance to denervation of EOM under ALS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>).</p><p>Earlier report of SC quantification from muscle biopsy samples using electron microscopy detected no significant difference between ALS patients and non-ALS controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ishimoto et al., 1983</xref>). Other studies using primary cultured SCs from muscle biopsy samples implied compromised differentiation program in ALS SCs compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pradat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Scaramozza et al., 2014</xref>). As to proliferation, one study reported enhanced proliferation in ALS SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Scaramozza et al., 2014</xref>), while the other cued for deficits in proliferation in ALS SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pradat et al., 2011</xref>). The various findings may reflect variations in the disease stage of patients during sampling. For animal studies, Manzano et al measured the amount of Pax<sup>7+</sup> SCs in dissociated EDL and soleus myofibers from G93A mice and WT controls and observed large variations across muscle-type and disease stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Manzano et al., 2012</xref>). In another study carried out by the same group, primarily cultured EDL and soleus SCs from G93A mice generally showed lower proliferation potential than the WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Manzano et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In our whole-mount muscle imaging data and FACS profiles of isolated SCs, SC depletion, at least for the most quiescent population, is observed in hindlimb and diaphragm muscles from end-stage G93A mice. Additionally, the heterogeneity of Vcam1 levels observed in hindlimb and diaphragm SCs derived from end stage G93A mice compared to those from WT controls indicates occurrence of denervation-related pathological activation. Although this activation may transiently elevate the number of SCs, the continuous dominance of asymmetric over symmetric cell division, as well as the differentiation pressure to regenerate myofibers could gradually exhaust the quiescent stem cell pool, leading to the depletion phenotype seen in the end stage G93A mice. In contrast, the superior preservation of renewability of EOM SCs seen in differentiation medium is an effective measure against this catastrophe. However, the spontaneous activation and superior renewability of EOM SCs may not always be an advantage. As mentioned in the introduction section, EOMs are preferentially involved in some other neuromuscular disorders. In the case of mitochondrial myopathies, mitochondrial DNA defects accumulate over time, resulting in compromised oxidative phosphorylation represented by cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-deficient myofibers in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Greaves et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Soltys et al., 2008</xref>). It is possible that the more frequent self-renewal and spontaneous activation of EOM SCs contribute to higher rate of mitochondrial DNA replication, leading to accelerated spreading of mitochondrial DNA defects, resulting in higher proportion of COX-deficient myofibers than other muscles, such as EDL, whose SCs remain dormant under physiological conditions.</p><p>In this study, overexpressing <italic>Cxcl12</italic> in G93A hindlimb SC-derived myotubes promotes motor neuron axon extension under the co-cultured condition. <italic>Cxcl12</italic> has been known as a critical guidance cue for motor and oculomotor axons during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lieberam et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Whitman et al., 2018</xref>), as well as the migration of neural crest cells to sympathetic ganglia in the formation of sympathetic nerve system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kasemeier-Kulesa et al., 2010</xref>). In adult animals, peri-synaptic Schwann cells have recently been reported to transiently produce <italic>Cxcl12</italic> after acute motor axon terminal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Negro et al., 2017</xref>). Intraperitoneal injection of antibodies neutralizing secreted Cxcl12 protein slows down the regeneration process. In contrast, the exposure of primary motor neurons to recombinant Cxcl12 protein stimulates neurite outgrowth and directional axonal extension in compartmentalized culture setup, which could be reversed by the treatment of the Cxcr4-specific inhibitor AMD3100. Published studies have demonstrated that local administration of Cxcl12 protein to neurotoxin injected hindlimb muscles of mice improved evoked junctional potentials of soleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Negro et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the axon guidance role of Cxcl12 has been consolidated both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, myoblasts also express <italic>Cxcr4</italic> and their fusion into myofibers/myotubes involves Cxcl12 guidance as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Griffin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brzoska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bae et al., 2008</xref>). The abundant peri-NMJ SCs in EOMs expressing <italic>Cxcl12</italic> may achieve synergistic effects with peri-synaptic Schwann cells, improving the long-term integrity of NMJs. However, it is possible that motor neurons carrying ALS mutations may respond differently to Cxcl12-mediated axon guidance than WT motor neurons. This is a limitation of the current study, which will be investigated in future co-culture studies.</p><p>Epigenetic regulation of SC transcriptome by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, such as butyrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davie, 2003</xref>), could modulate the myogenesis process both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Iezzi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Johnston et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sincennes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moresi et al., 2015</xref>). Butyrate is a gut-bacteria fermentation product that also acts as an energy source to improve mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Donohoe et al., 2011</xref>). Previous studies by our lab and others showed NaBu-supplemented feeding prolongs the life span of G93A mice and reverses CypD-related mitoflash phenotypes in myofibers derived from G93A mice, which implies a potential decrease of oxidative stress. Additionally, NaBu treatment also improved mitochondrial respiratory function of NSC34 motor neuron cell line overexpressing hSOD1G93A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2022</xref>). NaBu treatment has been reported by other groups to directly promote neuronal survival and axonal transport by inhibiting HDAC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rivieccio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fazal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taes et al., 2013</xref>). Aside from neurons, feeding NaBu also changed intestinal microbiota and intestinal epithelial permeability of G93A mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). The effect of NaBu treatment is certainly multi-faceted. Yet previously it was not known whether the beneficiary effects of NaBu are linked to any phenotypic changes of SCs, and whether NaBu treatment induced epigenetic modulations similar to that of EOM SCs. The study here revealed its beneficiary role on the preservation of NMJ integrity and peri-NMJ SCs affected in hindlimb and diaphragm muscles by ALS progression. NaBu treatment of G93A hindlimb and diaphragm SCs in culture induced transcriptomic changes mimicking some features seen in EOM SCs, including the upregulation of activation and quiescence signature genes and the downregulation of differentiation signature genes, indicating NaBu improved the renewability of G93A hindlimb and diaphragm SCs. Additionally, some axon guidance molecules, particularly <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, were also induced by NaBu application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Thus, NaBu-induced EOM SC-like transcriptomic pattern could be a crucial contributor to its therapeutic effect against ALS progression. Combining NaBu treatment with application on top of <italic>Cxcl12</italic> overexpression may have additive therapeutic benefits to slow ALS progression.</p><p>Overall, our studies have defined several mechanisms which (1) may explain why EOMs are relatively spared in ALS, and (2) provides a rationale for targeting these differences as a therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, analysis of these signatures in patient muscle biopsies could be used to select subsets of ALS patients who may be most likely to benefit from therapies targeting this signaling network, and to provide possible ‘response biomarkers’ in pre-clinical and clinical studies. As a cocktail of sodium phenylbutyrate (a derivative of NaBu) and Taurursodiol (an antioxidant) under the Commercial name of Relyvrio has been recently approved in US and Canada as a new ALS therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Paganoni et al., 2020</xref>), our study could help gain more insights into the molecular mechanisms related to this type of ALS therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background<break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B6SJLF1/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #

The protocol on the usage of mice was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas at Arlington (approved IACUC protocol #A19.001). WT mice used in this study were of B6SJL background. The ALS transgenic mouse model (hSOD1G93A) with genetic background of B6SJL was originally generated by Drs. Deng and Siddique’s group at Northwestern University and deposited to the Jackson Lab as B6SJL-Tg (SOD1*G93A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gurney et al., 1994</xref>). For the butyrate feeding experiment, the animals were fed with 2% NaBu (SAFC ARK2161) from the age of 3 months (at the ALS disease onset) and lasting for 4 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Primary culture of satellite cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting</title><p>The hindlimb muscles including tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), gastrocnemius, and quadriceps were dissected from one mouse for each round of sorting. For diaphragm, both the crural and costal domains were dissected from one mouse for each round of sorting. For EOMs, the four rectus muscles in the eye sockets were dissected from 5 to 6 mice of the same gender for each round of sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eckhardt et al., 2019</xref>). The collected muscles were placed in 0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> Ringer’s solution. Excessive connective tissue, tendons, fat, blood clots and vessels were removed as much as possible. After cleanup, the muscles were transferred into the digestion media (DMEM containing 5% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep and 10 mM HEPES) and minced into small blocks using scissors. Collagenase II (Worthington LS004176,≥125 units/mg), dispase II (Sigma D46931G,≥0.5 units/mg), hyaluronidase (Worthington LS002592,≥300 USP/NF units/mg) and Dnase I (Worthington LS002139,≥2,000 Kunitz units/mg) were added at the final concentration of 0.26%, 0.24%, 0.16%, and 0.04% (weight/volume), respectively. The digestion system was placed in an orbital shaker running at 70 rpm at 37 °C for 45 min. The digested muscles were triturated 10 times with a 20-gauge needle attached to a 5 ml syringe. Afterwards the triturated mixture was pipetted onto a pre-wetted 100 μm strainer and centrifuge at 100 × <italic>g</italic> for 2.5 min to precipitate the bulky myofiber debris. The supernatant was transferred onto a pre-wetted 40 μm strainer and cells were collected by centrifuged at 1200 × <italic>g</italic> for 6.5 min. The cells were resuspended in sorting media (PBS containing 0.3% BSA, 10 mM HEPES and 1 mM EGTA) and stained with antibodies or dyes at 4 °C for 45 min with shaking. The antibodies used include PE anti-mVcam1 (Biolegend 105713, 600 ng/10<sup>6</sup> cells), APC anti-mCD31 (Biolegend 102409, 400 ng/10<sup>6</sup> cells), APC anti-mCD45 (Biolegend 103111, 400 ng/10<sup>6</sup> cells) APC anti-mSca-1 (Biolegend 108111, 200 ng/10<sup>6</sup> cells). This antibody combination followed a previous published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2015a</xref>). Vcam1 is a SC marker, CD31 is a endothelial cell marker, CD45 is a hematopoietic cell marker and Sca-1 is a mesenchymal stem cell marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2015a</xref>). For sorting, our target population is VCAM<sup>+</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup>Sca-1<sup>-</sup>. When needed, the cells were stained with methyl green (2 µg/ml) to check mortality rate. As a positive control, half of the cells were transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and methanol (precooled at –20 °C) was added dropwise with gentle mixing and left on ice for 5 min, the dead cells were wash twice before being mixed with the rest half of cells for methyl green staining. The sorting process was conducted using BD FACS Melody Cell Sorter using a 100 µm nozzle. The excitation laser and emission filter setup for methyl green is the same as APC. The flow rate was tuned between 1–7 to adjust the event rate to 2000–4000/sec. Gating conditions of FSC-A/SSC-A, SSC-H/SSC-W, FSC-H/FSC-W, Vcam1/CD31_CD45_Sca-1 and Vcam1/Methyl green plots were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>. The sorted cells were collected in growth media (DMEM containing 20%FBS, 1% Pen/Strep, 1% chick embryonic extract and 10 mM HEPES). Afterwards the cells were seeded into laminin (Corning 354232) -coated plates or glass-bottom dishes containing growth media (without HEPES). Culture media was changed on the third day and the fourth day. To induce differentiation, cells were washed three times with PBS and cultured in differentiation media (DMEM containing 2% horse serum) for 2 more days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Neuromuscular coculture assay</title><p>For neuromuscular coculture in compartmentalized chambers (XonaCHIPS XC450), XoanCHIPS were coated with poly-L-ornithine (0.5 mg/ml) for 1 hr at 37 °C followed by laminin (0.1 mg/ml) for 1 hr at 37 °C. Primary cultured satellite cells were seeded at 1x10<sup>5</sup> into the myotube compartment in growth medium for attachment overnight and then switched to differentiation medium and cultured for 2 more days.

AAV transduction was conducted for one day as described above. The infected myotubes were washed with Neurobasal Plus Medium (Thermo Fisher A3582901, with B-27 and GlutaMax supplement) before the addition of rat spinal motor neurons (4x10<sup>3</sup>/chamber, iXCells 10RA-033) to the same chamber. The coculture was kept in Neurobasal Plus Medium for 9 more days and half medium change was conducted every 2 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunofluorescence (IF) and imaging of whole mount muscle samples</title><p>EDL, soleus and EOM (the four rectus muscles) were dissected out and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 hr. Afterwards the samples were washed with PBS containing 1% glycine once and two more times with PBS. Further fixation and permeabilization was done with methanol at –20 °C for 10 min. For diaphragm, the costal muscles and their surrounding rib cages were dissected and immersed in methanol directly for fixation (PFA fixation was skipped because it made the diaphragm harder to flatten and introduced more non-specific noises in staining). The samples were rehydrated and washed with PBS. The epimysium and tendons were removed as much as possible. EDL and soleus were further split into smaller bundles along the longitudinal axis. Then the samples were immersed in blocking buffer (PBS containing 2% BSA, 2% horse serum, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.05% sodium azide) overnight at 4 °C. Next day the samples were incubated with primary antibodies for 1–2 days. After washing with PBS for three times, the samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor labeled secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher 1:1000) and Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated α-Bungarotoxin (Thermo Fisher B13422, 1:1000) for 1–2 days. The samples were then washed with PBS, counterstained with DAPI and mounted in antifade mounting media (20 mM Tris, 0.5% N-propyl gallate, 80% glycerol) for imaging. Primary antibodies used: neurofilament (DSHB 2H3 concentrate, 1:250), synaptophysin (Thermo Fisher PA11043, 1:400), Pax7 (SCBT sc-81648, 1:100), Cxcl12 (R&amp;D MAB350, 1:200).</p><p>Z-stack scans of glycerol-cleared whole muscles were obtained using 40 x high working distance lens of Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope. The z- stacks were compacted into 2D images by maximal intensity projection. To quantify SC number surrounding NMJs, circles (75 µm in diameter) were drawn around each NMJ in Image J. The DAPI channel was used as a mask to filter out nonspecific staining of Pax7 in the extracellular matrix.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunofluorescence and imaging of cultured myoblasts/myotubes and motor neurons</title><p>The cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min and then washed with 1% glycine and PBS.

The homogenate was transferred into tubes containing 5 PRIME Phase Lock Gel (Quantabio 2302830), and 1/10 volume of 1-bromo-3-chloroporpane (Alfa Aesar A11395) was added. The samples were shaken vigorously for 12 s and centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × <italic>g</italic>.

Next day, after 15 min centrifugation at 16,000 <italic>g</italic> the precipitate was washed briefly with 75% ethanol. After another 5 min centrifugation, the ethanol was removed. The precipitate was briefly dried and resuspended in RNase-free water. For whole muscle samples, the freshly dissected muscles were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, kept at –80 °C freezer overnight and then soaked in RNALater ICE (Thermo Fisher AM7030) for 2–3 days at –20 °C. Before RNA extraction, leftover tendons and neurites were removed and muscles were transferred to 1 ml Trizol. Homogenization was conducted in FastPrep-24 Classic bead beating grinder (MP Biomedicals 116004500). The tissue homogenate was transfer to centrifuge tubes containing phase lock gel (QuantaBio 2302830) and 1/10 volume of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane was added. The tubes were hand shaken for 12 s, left at bench top for 2 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 15 min. The upper phase was transferred to a new centrifuge tube and mixed with equal volume of ethanol. The following steps of RNA purification was conducted with Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus kit (Zymo Research R2070). RNA concentration was measured with Quantus Fluorometer (Promega E6150). RNA quality was assessed by RNA ScreenTape analysis at Genomics Core Facility at the University of North Texas Health Science Center. Only RNAs with RIN ≥9 and 28 s/18s≥1 were used for qRT-PCR or RNA-Seq. Reverse transcription was done using Promega GoScript Reverse Transcription system. The qPCR reactions used Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher) and were carried out by the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher). Relative quantification (RQ) of gene expression was generated by ΔΔCt method. The sequences of primers used for qPCR were listed in Key Resource Table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Bulk RNA-Seq and analysis</title><p>Non-stranded mRNA sequencing was carried out by BGI Americas Corporation. The average number of clean reads per sample was 45.16 million (ranging from 44.11 to 48.51 million). The average percentage of clean reads was 93.32% (ranging from 92.42% to 93.97%). The average percentage of aligned reads (to Genome Reference Consortium Mouse Build 38 patch release 6) was 96.01% (ranging from 95.40% to 96.67%) and the average percentage of uniquely aligned reads was 86.46% (ranging from 85.12% to 87.63%). To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different samples (using Poisson distribution method to compare uniquely mapped reads of the gene), only genes with |log2FC|≥0.4 and FDR ≤0.001 were considered. To identify DEGs between different groups (containing more than one sample, using DESeq2 method), only genes with |log2FC|≥0.4 and Qvalue ≤0.05 were considered. PCA analysis, hierarchical clustering, functional annotation analysis (KEGG pathway, GO_C, GO_P) were performed in Dr. TOM platform of BGI.

The underlying hypothesis being that since EOMs are largely spared from this debilitating disease, they may secrete NMJ-protective factors. The results of their transcriptome analysis identified several axon guidance molecules including the chemokine Cxcl12, which are particularly enriched in EOM-derived satellite cells. Transduction of hindlimb-derived satellite cells with AAV encoding Cxcl12 reverted hindlimb-derived myotubes from the G93A mice into myotubes sharing phenotypic characteristics similar to those of EOM-derived satellite cells. Additionally, the authors were able to demonstrate that EOM-derived satellite cell myotube cultures are capable of enhancing axon extensions and innervation in co-culture experiments.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strength of the paper is that the authors successfully isolated and purified different populations of satellite cells, compared their transcriptomes, identified specific factors release by EOM-derived satellite cells, overexpressed one of these factors (the chemokine Cxcl12) by AAV-mediated transduction of hindlimb-derived satellite cells. The transduced cells were then able to support axon guidance and NMJ integrity. They also show that administration of Na butyrate to mice decreased NMJ denervation and satellite cell-depletion of hind limbs.

The findings of the study offer valuable information that EOMs are spared in ALS because they produce protective factors for the NMJ and, more specifically, factors secreted by EOM-derived satellite cells. While most of the experimental approaches are convincing, the use of sodium butyrate (NaBu) in this study needs further investigation, as NaBu might have a variety of biological effects. Overall, this work may help develop future therapeutic interventions for patients with ALS.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the editor that NaBu have a variety of biological effects that require further investigation. Our team previously have explored the effect of NaBu treatment on intestinal microbiota and intestinal epithelial permeability (DOI: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2016.12.014), on the mitochondrial respiratory function of NSC-34 motor neuron cell line overexpressing hSOD1G93A (DOI: 10.3390/biom12020333) and on the mitochondrial function of skeletal muscle myofibers of G93A mice (DOI: 10.3390/ijms22147412). Other research teams have also explored the role of NaBu (or HDAC inhibition) in neuronal survival and axonal transport (DOIs: 10.1073/pnas.0907935106; 10.1038/s41467-017-00911-y; 10.15252/embj.2020106177; 10.1093/hmg/ddt028).</p><p>Since the theme of this manuscript is the transcriptomic characteristics of EOM SCs, to include data of how NaBu affect cellular/molecular processes of other tissues will somewhat deviate from the theme.

We realized that our previous description on butyrate’s beneficial role might be overstated in the Abstract Section. We have made two changes to avoid potential overstatement of our finding: (1) We modified the Abstract to state that “the NaBu-induced transcriptomic changes resembling the patterns of EOM SCs “may contribute to” (instead of “underlie”) the beneficial effects observed in G93A mice” (Page 1, Line 29); (2) We have edited the corresponding paragraph in the Discussion section to emphasize that the effect of NaBu treatment is multi-faceted (Page 11, Line 459-461).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>line 388-389.

As one of the earliest discovered chemokines, the chemotactic role of Cxcl12-Cxcr4 axis on cells and cellular processes (such as axons) has been comprehensively investigated by different functional assays from overexpression to protein application to inhibitor application to knockdown by shRNAs in different types of tissues. To list a few examples, the establishment of the correct routing trajectories of mammalian motor axons and oculomotor axons during embryonic development (DOIs: 10.1016/j.neuron.2005.08.011; 10.1167/iovs.18-25190). The regeneration of injured motor axon terminals guided by terminal Schwann cells in adult mice (DOI: 10.15252/emmm.201607257). The migration of neural crest cells to sympathetic ganglia in the formation of sympathetic nerve system during embryogenesis (DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0892-10.2010). The migration of myoblasts in the process of fusion into myotubes (DOIs: 10.1242/jcs.066241; 10.1111/boc.201200022; 10.1074/jbc.M706730200).</p><p>Because the existence of so many detailed mechanistic studies, our goal for this manuscript is not to identify a novel mechanism of how Cxcl12-mediated chemotaxis is achieved. Rather, we used it as one of the proof-of-concept mechanisms contributing to the resistance of EOMs against ALS and benefits of NaBu treatment. Certainly, it is not the sole mechanism.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concern, we have expanded discussion about the previous studies regarding the chemotactic effect of Cxcl12 in the discussion section.
