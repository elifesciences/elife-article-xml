health. The disruption of normal gut microbiota by the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents enables <italic>C. difficile</italic> to proliferate in the colon. The emergence and prevalence of hypervirulent <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains result in increased morbidity, mortality, and high recurrence rates of CDI, thus creating a pressing need for novel therapeutics. The multi-domain toxins TcdA and TcdB are the primary determinants of CDI pathogenesis, rendering them ideal drug targets in the anti-virulence paradigm. In this study, we identified caffeic acid and its derivatives from natural compounds library as active inhibitors of TcdB via a cell-based high-throughput phenotypic screening. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) could directly bind to TcdB, thus suppressing InsP<sub>6</sub>-induced autoproteolysis and inhibiting glucosyltransferase activity. CAPE treatment remarkably reduces the pathology of CDI in a murine infection model in terms of alleviated diarrhea symptoms, decreased bacterial colonization, and relieved histopathological lesions. Moreover, CAPE treatment of <italic>C. difficile</italic>-challenged mice induces a remarkable increase in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota and alterations of gut metabolites (e.g., adenosine, D-proline, and melatonin), which might partially contribute to the therapeutic outcomes of CAPE against CDI. Our results reveal the potential of CAPE as a therapeutic for the management of CDI, or CAPE might serve as a lead compound for the development of antivirulence drugs targeting TcdB.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic></kwd><kwd>TcdB</kwd><kwd>gut microbiota</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFD1801000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiu</surname><given-names>Jiazhang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32200141</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007847</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20230101142JC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiu</surname><given-names>Jiazhang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007847</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20240101282JC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Hongtao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiu</surname><given-names>Jiazhang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Caffeic acid phenethyl ester treats <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection by neutralizing <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> toxin B and altering the gut microbiota and metabolites.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> is an obligate anaerobic, spore-forming, gram-positive bacterial pathogen that is the most common cause of hospital-acquired and antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal diseases, including mild diarrhea and life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smits et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelly and LaMont, 2008</xref>). In the United States, <italic>C. difficile</italic> is responsible for almost half a million infections and approximately 29,000 deaths per year, resulting in an estimated annual healthcare-associated cost of up to $4.8 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dubberke, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lessa et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, the incidence, severity, mortality, and healthcare costs of <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection (CDI) have dramatically increased in the 21st century, at least partially owing to the frequent use of antimicrobial agents and the emergence of hypervirulent strains (e.g., PCR ribotypes 027 and 078) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goorhuis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clements et al., 2010</xref>). Limited options are available for the treatment of CDI, while antibiotics including metronidazole, fidaxomicin, and vancomycin are the mainstays of clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cornely et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bingley and Harding, 1987</xref>). However, antibiotic treatment is ineffective in more than 35% of CDI patients and can lead to infection recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feuerstadt et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hopkins and Wilson, 2018</xref>). Moreover, the rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance in <italic>C. difficile</italic> has further compromised the therapeutic efficacy of current treatment options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spigaglia et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the high morbidity and mortality, high recurrence rates, and emergence of multiple antibiotic-resistant isolates have made this pathogen a major threat to public health; these factors highlight the urgent need for novel therapies.</p><p><italic>C. difficile</italic> widely exists in the environment and in the intestinal tract of humans and animals and is mainly transmitted via the fecal–oral route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seekatz and Young, 2014</xref>). The pathogenesis of CDI is correlated with the use of antibiotics, which impair the structure and composition of the normal gut microbiota, thus allowing <italic>C. difficile</italic> to proliferate in the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seekatz and Young, 2014</xref>). Therefore, previous antibiotic therapy is the major risk factor for the development of CDI. In the colon, the dormant spores of <italic>C. difficile</italic> germinate into oxygen-sensitive vegetative cells that produce toxins and cause symptoms of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paredes-Sabja et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>C. difficile</italic> secretes two large clostridial exotoxins (TcdA and TcdB), which are directly responsible for the clinical pathology of CDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lyras et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuehne et al., 2010</xref>). Epidemiological studies suggest that most disease-causing <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains have genes that encode TcdB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drudy et al., 2007</xref>). TcdA and TcdB have identical functional domains: a N-terminal glucosyltransferase catalytic domain (GTD), a cysteine protease active domain (CPD), a transmembrane domain (DRBD), and a C-terminal receptor-binding domain (CROPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). When secreted into the colon, both toxins are internalized by host cells through receptor-mediated, clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Following a decrease in endosomal pH, the toxins undergo conformational changes in the DRBD, resulting in insertion of the toxin into the endosome membrane, pore formation, and the release of the GTD and CPD domains into the cytosol. Then, CPD binding with cytosolic inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP<sub>6</sub>) activates its protease activity, leading to the cleavage and release of the GTD. Eventually, the GTD utilizes UDP-glucose to glucosylate Rho and/or Ras family GTPases, thus disrupting GTPase signaling and resulting in deleterious effects, including cytopathic ‘rounding’, dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton, apoptosis, and pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smits et al., 2016</xref>). Although both toxins are cytotoxic to host cells, TcdB shows greater toxicity than TcdA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Orrell and Melnyk, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Disruption of the gut microbiota by antimicrobial agents results in high recurrence rates, which limits the application of antimicrobial therapy for CDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seekatz and Young, 2014</xref>). Consequently, there is a critical need to develop nonantibiotic treatments for CDI, either as standalone or augmented therapies. Importantly, strategies targeting bacterial virulence factors, including toxins, are termed anti-virulence strategies and have attracted interest in the 21st century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rasko and Sperandio, 2010</xref>). Owing to its essential role in <italic>C. difficile</italic> pathogenesis, TcdB has become an ideal target for the development of anti-virulence drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tam et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, caffeic acid and a series of its derivatives were found to inhibit TcdB-mediated cell rounding via cell-based screening. Among these potential inhibitors, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) had the greatest inhibitory effect. Mechanistically, CAPE bound to both full-length TcdB and the GTD fragment, leading to alterations in the secondary structure. This interaction suppressed the InsP<sub>6</sub>-mediated self-cleavage of TcdB, as well as the enzymatic activity of GTD, thereby decreasing the level of glucosylated Rac1 in TcdB-treated host cells and further inhibiting the cytopathology and cytotoxicity of TcdB. Oral administration of CAPE significantly protected against CDI in models of animal infection. In addition to direct toxin inhibition, the therapeutic effect may also be attributed to CAPE-induced alteration of the gut microbiota (e.g., <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp.) as well as gut metabolites (e.g., adenosine, D-proline, and melatonin). Overall, our study revealed that caffeic acid and its derivatives, particularly CAPE, may serve as promising lead compounds for the development of anti-virulence drugs to treat CDI.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CAPE inhibits cell rounding induced by TcdB</title><p>TcdB can inactivate Rho GTPases via glucosylation, leading to the loss of cytoskeletal structure and cell rounding. Consequently, we utilized this phenotype to identify potential TcdB inhibitors from 2076 chemicals, including 1515 FDA-approved drugs and 561 natural compounds. The minimal concentration of recombinant His<sub>6</sub>-TcdB (0.2 ng/ml) that induced 100% cell rounding within 1 hr was used for drug screening. This concentration of TcdB was preincubated with 8 μg/ml of the individual compounds for 1 hr. The compounds that were not bound to TcdB were removed by ultrafiltration centrifugal partition and then added to Vero cell cultures. Residual compounds that have not bound to TcdB may lead to an exaggerated assessment of their efficacy and could also result in misleading positive outcomes. As the effective concentration for cellular interactions may inadvertently be increased, such carryover could distort the determination of the compound’s minimum effective concentration. At 1 hr post-TcdB treatment, cell morphology was visualized under a light microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These analyses allowed us to identify 22 candidate compounds with potent inhibitory effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, 6 out of the 22 compounds were caffeic acid derivatives. The natural compound library contained eight caffeic acid derivatives, of which methyl caffeic acid and ferulic acid displayed no efficacy. Caffeic acid itself only slightly inhibited TcdB-induced cell rounding, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 527.5 μg/ml (1.86 mM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Notably, except for rosmarinic acid, the IC<sub>50</sub> values for the other screened caffeic acid derivatives were less than 6 μg/ml, suggesting that these compounds potently inhibited TcdB-mediated toxicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). CAPE is the phenethyl alcohol ester of caffeic acid and a main active component of propolis with broad pharmacological properties, such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balaha et al., 2021</xref>). As CAPE has the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> (3.0 μg/ml) among the active caffeic acid derivatives, it was selected as the representative compound for subsequent investigations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). After preincubation with increasing concentrations of CAPE, dose-dependent inhibition of cell rounding was observed in both Vero and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The protective influence of CAPE against TcdB-induced Vero cell death remained evident even when the treatment duration was prolonged to 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) suppresses TcdB-mediated cell rounding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the process used for the identification of small molecules that inhibit the cell rounding phenotype induced by TcdB.

Furthermore, we evaluated the efficacy of CAPE following an intraperitoneal injection by administering it 2 hr prior to the injection of TcdB, in order to gauge the survival rate of the mice. The outcomes revealed that a 2-hr pretreatment with CAPE at doses of 30 and 50 mg/kg significantly enhanced the mice’s protection rate by 57.1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Following this, CAPE proceeds to bind to sites with secondary or reduced affinity, a process that prolongs the time required to achieve equilibrium. Furthermore, the possibility that CAPE binds to multiple sites on TcdB necessitates a duration for the exploration and occupation of these various sites before equilibrium is established.

Metabolomic analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of CAPE treatment on gut metabolites in mice. On the third day after infection, the feces of mice in each group were frozen by liquid nitrogen for metabolomics analysis. Specifically, utilizing mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, a simple screening of each metabolite is conducted for parameters such as retention time and mass-to-charge ratio. Subsequently, peak area calibration is performed using the first quality control (QC) sample to enhance the accuracy of identification. The peak extraction is then conducted with settings for mass deviation at 5 ppm, signal intensity deviation at 30%, minimum signal intensity, and adduct ions. Simultaneously, quantification of peak areas is carried out, and target ions are integrated. Molecular formulas are predicted using molecular ion peaks and fragment ions, and these are compared with databases such as mzCloud, mzVault, and Masslist. Background ions are removed using blank samples. The raw quantification results are standardized using the formula: original quantification value of the sample/(total metabolite quantification value of the sample/total metabolite quantification value of QC1 sample), to obtain relative peak areas. Compounds with a coefficient of variation greater than 30% in the relative peak areas of QC samples are excluded. Finally, the identification and relative quantification results of the metabolites are obtained. The partial least square discriminant analysis model exhibited significant separation of clusters between the model and CAPE treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

Furthermore, KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the differentially abundant metabolites were significantly enriched in the purine metabolism and bile secretion pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that binds to specific cell surface receptors to exert anti-inflammatory effects at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cronstein, 1985</xref>).

Moreover, correlation analysis revealed a positive association between <italic>Faecalibaculum</italic> abundance and melatonin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that alterations in gut metabolites caused by CAPE treatment might contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in CDI. We found that the metabolites of the gut microbiota changed after CAPE treatment. While detectable, the impact of gut microbiota modifications seems to be of secondary importance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Oral administration of melatonin alleviates the symptoms of CDI</title><p>Next, we investigated whether any of the upregulated metabolites had a direct influence on TcdB. To this end, we preincubated recombinant TcdB with each of the selected metabolites prior to addition to the cell cultures. Interestingly, treatment with TcdB and 100 μg/ml melatonin significantly alleviated the cell death induced by this toxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). This observation prompted us to investigate the direct therapeutic potential of melatonin in CDI. Therefore, <italic>C. difficile</italic>-infected mice were orally administered 200 mg/kg melatonin at 24-hr intervals. The weight changes and the dry/wet ratio of the stool samples were monitored daily for 3 days.

Consistent with these observations, histopathological assessment of colonic tissue sections also revealed attenuated colon damage upon melatonin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D, E</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that a high dose of exogenous melatonin could protect mice from CDI. However, the CAPE treatment group induced only minor alterations in gut microbiota-derived melatonin levels, which may not reach therapeutic relevance. While existing studies suggest that melatonin exhibits beneficial effects against CDI, the primary antimicrobial activity appears to be mediated directly by CAPE rather than through melatonin-associated mechanisms.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Oral administration of melatonin alleviates the pathology of <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection (CDI).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The impact of upregulated metabolites on the cytotoxicity of TcdB.

In particular, the increase in morbidity and mortality caused by the prevalence of hypervirulent and drug-resistant strains has become a global concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">He et al., 2013</xref>). In 2019, <italic>C. difficile</italic> was listed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as an ‘urgent threat’ that surpassed methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and ESBL-producing <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">CDC, 2019</xref>). <italic>C. difficile</italic> is a commensal bacterium that colonizes the lower gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas and Zackular, 2020</xref>). CDI typically occurs in susceptible individuals whose normal gut microbiota is disrupted by the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas and Zackular, 2020</xref>). Although CDI is considered an antibiotic-associated disease, the current treatment for CDI still relies on antimicrobial drugs, including metronidazole, fidaxomicin, and vancomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cornely et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bingley and Harding, 1987</xref>). Despite antibiotic therapy, more than 35% of CDI patients are susceptible to recurrent infection, which is primarily attributable to the intrinsic effects of antimicrobial agents, which disrupt the microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hopkins and Wilson, 2018</xref>). In addition, long-term administration of antibiotics promotes the selection of antibiotic-resistant subpopulations in the gut, thus increasing the risk of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant and opportunistic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raplee et al., 2021</xref>). As a result, the development of nonantibiotic therapeutics is needed for the treatment of CDI.</p><p>Indeed, numerous novel treatments for CDI are being investigated, among which the anti-virulence strategy represents one of the most promising and successful therapeutic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rasko and Sperandio, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beilhartz et al., 2015</xref>). Unlike antibiotics, which target bacterial components that are critical for bacterial growth, anti-virulence drugs aim to disarm pathogenic bacteria by neutralizing their virulence factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ranftler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zucca et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, this strategy imposes less selective pressure that directs bacterial evolution of antimicrobial resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zucca et al., 2013</xref>). The disease progression of CDI is strictly dependent on large clostridial toxins (TcdA and TcdB), as strains lacking both toxins (i.e., A<sup>−</sup>B<sup>−</sup>) were completely avirulent and failed to induce any discernible disease symptoms in a hamster model of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuehne et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains with increased morbidity and mortality rates produce greater amounts of toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Warny et al., 2005</xref>). Based on these premises, TcdA and TcdB are considered ideal drug targets for CDI in the anti-virulence paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stewart et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, bezlotoxumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that neutralizes TcdB, was approved by the FDA and used in CDI patients to reduce the rate of recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deeks, 2017</xref>). This achievement has encouraged researchers to develop next-generation anti-virulence treatments. In particular, small molecule inhibitors of toxin production and/or activity have attracted increasing interest owing to their advantages in cost and the convenience of oral administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beilhartz et al., 2015</xref>). The multidomain architecture and mechanisms of action of clostridial toxins have provided distinct options for blocking their toxicity. Indeed, previous efforts have identified diverse inhibitors that act on distinct steps of intoxication, such as the inhibition of toxin binding to cell receptors, the suppression of endosomal maturation, and the inactivation of GTD or CPD activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bender et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tam et al., 2020</xref>). Although which approach is the best remains unknown, we believe that an inhibitor that targets multiple steps of intoxication would be superior to those that act on a single step. In this study, we identified a series of caffeic acid derivatives that were potent inhibitors of TcdB via a phenotypic screen. Further mechanistic study revealed that CAPE, the phenethyl alcohol ester of caffeic acid, could block InsP<sub>6</sub>-induced autoproteolysis of TcdB and inactivate its GTD function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). CAPE can also inhibit the growth of <italic>C. difficile</italic> and the production of spores. Moreover, CAPE treatment significantly protected against CDI in a mouse model of infection. Our results suggested that caffeic acid derivatives, particularly CAPE, are promising lead compounds for the development of targeted therapies against CDI. CAPE is a major component of propolis, a natural bee-produced substance that has been used as a remedy for thousands of years in Europe and Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tek et al., 2024</xref>). As a result, further investigations on the therapeutic potential of propolis against CDI, either in combination with standard therapy or as a single therapy, would be of great interest.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>A model for caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE)-mediated suppression of TcdB cytotoxicity and protection of mice from <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection (CDI).</title><p>The intoxication of cells by TcdB involves multistep mechanisms. Direct interaction of CAPE with full-length TcdB blocks InsP<sub>6</sub>-induced autoproteolysis, resulting in decreased production of active GTD. The binding between GTD and CAPE inhibits its glucosyltransferase activity, thus decreasing the glucosylation level of Rac1. CAPE treatment of CDI mice markedly restored the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota and induced changes in gut metabolites, which might have contributed to the therapeutic outcomes of CDI following CAPE treatment.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-101757-fig10-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Antibiotic-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis is a major risk factor for CDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schubert et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, reconstituting the gut microbiota is a promising strategy for CDI therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is considered an effective CDI therapeutic strategy and is widely used in clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Nood et al., 2013</xref>). Despite the high cure rate and increasing popularity of FMT, patients remain limited in their acceptance. Another prominent advantage of anti-virulence drugs is that they allow maintenance of the normal microbiota, which is of critical importance for the treatment of CDI. Importantly, CAPE treatment of <italic>C. difficile</italic>-infected mice restored the structure and composition of the microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In particular, the abundance of <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, a critical gut microbiota component that is required for resistance to <italic>C. difficile</italic> colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bornet and Westermann, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pike and Theriot, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deng et al., 2019</xref>), was significantly elevated upon CAPE treatment. Interestingly, <italic>Bacteroides</italic> were also predominant in CDI patients administered RBX2660 (Rebyota), an FDA-approved fecal microbiota product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gonzales-Luna et al., 2023</xref>). The increased diversity of the gut microbiota might contribute to the therapeutic effects of CAPE in CDI.</p><p>In addition to the microbiota, gut metabolites also play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of CDI, either by promoting or suppressing disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gurung et al., 2024</xref>). For example, bile acids and amino acids promote spore germination and pathogenesis, while secondary bile acid and short-chain fatty acids aid in colonization resistance and suppress spore germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gurung et al., 2024</xref>). In addition to the restoration of the gut microbiota, metabolomics analysis of mouse fecal samples revealed dramatic alterations in gut metabolites upon CAPE treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The differentially abundant metabolites were significantly enriched in the purine metabolism and bile metabolism pathways. Remarkably, the level of adenosine, an endogenous purine nucleoside that can regulate immune responses and inflammatory processes by binding to its receptors, such as its ability to inhibit the release of certain inflammatory mediators, was dramatically increased in CAPE-treated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haskó et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shakya et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, the amount of uric acid, the final product of purine metabolism, was reduced. Previous studies showed that the increase in adenosine concentrations caused by the inhibition of adenosine deaminase via EHNA prevents <italic>C. difficile</italic> TcdA-mediated damage and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Araújo Junqueira et al., 2011</xref>). This protection might be a result of the anti-inflammatory effects of adenosine, which rely on the activation of its receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavalcante et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, we observed a reduction in the amount of D-proline, which is one of the preferred amino acids utilized by <italic>C. difficile</italic> to generate energy through Stickland reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouillaut et al., 2013</xref>). Melatonin is a ubiquitous indolamine that has broad biological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, we detected a significantly increased amount of melatonin in the feces of mice that were administered CAPE. Importantly, an earlier study demonstrated a decreased risk of recurrent CDI in patients exposed to melatonin, possibly owing to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sutton et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we found that oral administration of exogenous melatonin alleviated the symptoms of CDI in a mouse model of infection. Although determining the exact mechanism will require further investigation, we propose that the melatonin-mediated inhibition of TcdB intoxication observed in this study might contribute to its therapeutic effect. Taken together, these results indicate that the alterations in gut metabolites caused by CAPE might also contribute to treatment outcomes for CDI patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>All cell lines (HeLa, Caco-2, Vero, HEK293T, and THP-1) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA).

Prior to cell treatment, Alexa Fluor 488-TcdB was preincubated with CAPE at a concentration of 32 μg/ml for 30 min. The treated solution was then added to Caco-2 cells and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. Following three washes with PBS, the Caco-2 cells were collected, and the fluorescence signal was measured using flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Cytotoxicity assay</title><p>Vero or THP-1 cells were plated into 96-well plates. The next day, different concentrations of CAPE were prepared by diluting them in DMEM and adding them to the cells. After incubation at 37°C for 3 hr, the viability of cells was assessed using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) (Beyotime Biotechnology Co, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Biacore analysis</title><p>The affinity analysis of TcdB or GTD with CAPE was conducted using a Biacore T100 device (Biacore Inc, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A CM5 chip (General Electric Company, GE) was utilized to immobilize the TcdB or GTD proteins. Various concentrations of CAPE were injected, and all steps were performed in running buffer consisting of 5% DMSO in PBS-P20 (GE). Evaluation version 3.1 software provided by Biacore and the 1:1 Langmuir combined model were employed for data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Mouse infection model</title><p>For the acute toxicity model, after pretreatment of TcdB with CAPE (2 or 4 μg/ml) for 1 hr, the mice were randomly assigned and intraperitoneally injected with a complex of TcdB-solvent or TcdB-CAPE (30 ng of TcdB per mouse). The survival of mice was observed for 72 hr.</p><p>For the CDI model, mice were given cefoperazone (0.5 g/l) in their drinking water for 5 days (from days –7 to –2), followed by switching to sterilized water for 2 days. On day 0, the mice were challenged with 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFUs of <italic>C. difficile</italic> BAA-1870 (Ribotype 027) by oral gavage. For the CAPE or melatonin treatment group, mice were treated with CAPE (30 mg/kg by oral gavage) or melatonin (200 mg/kg by oral gavage) every day after <italic>C. difficile</italic> challenge. The weight loss and fecal state of the mice were monitored daily. Fecal samples were collected on days 0–3 to evaluate the stool water content as a marker of diarrhea. Additionally, fecal samples on day 3 were collected to assess <italic>C. difficile</italic> colonization. Colonic tissues were collected on day 3 post-infection, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and scored as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reeves et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Fecal samples were collected on day 3 post-infection, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and transferred to the laboratory with dry ice for 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis (Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co, Ltd, Tianjin, China). The melatonin level in mouse stool supernatant was determined using the Mouse MT (Melatonin) ELISA Kit (Sangon Biotechnology Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Western blot densitometry and LysoTracker fluorescence intensity were measured using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software, USA). Unpaired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests were used for comparing two groups, and one-way ANOVA was used for analyzing data from more than three groups. The statistical significance was determined using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test (survival rates) in vivo.

Was this mass-spec or NMR-based metabolomics. Assuming it was mass-spec, what kind? How was metabolite identity assigned, etc? These are important details, which need to be included. Even in cases where additional information was included, the authors did not discuss how the specific way in which certain experiments were performed could affect interpretation of their results. One example is the potential for compound carryover in their experiments. Another important one is the fact that CAPE affects bacterial growth and sporulation. Therefore, it is critical that authors acknowledge that they cannot discard the possibility that other factors besides compound interactions with the toxin are involved in their phenotypes. As stated previously, authors should also be careful when drawing conclusions from the analysis of microbiota composition data, and changes to the manuscript should be made to reflect this. Ascribing causality to correlational relationships is a recurring issue in the microbiome field. Again, I suggest authors carefully revise the manuscript and tone down some statements about the impact of CAPE treatment on the gut microbiota.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your constructive suggestion.

It should read &quot;Growth curves of C. difficile BAA-1870 in the presence of varying concentrations of CAPE (0-64 µg/mL)&quot;. Also, there is something wrong with the symbols in this figure. I suspect what is happening is that the symbols for the concentrations of 32 and 64 µg/mL are superimposing, but this is a problem because the lower line looks like a closed circle, which is supposed to represent the condition where no CAPE was added. The authors should change the symbols to allow clear distinction between each of the conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your constructive suggestion. We have modified the panel and figure legend in Figure 3SB. The concentrations of 32 μg/mL and 64 μg/mL are quite similar, which makes it challenging to differentiate between the corresponding data points on the graph. To enhance clarity, we have utilized distinct colors to help distinguish these closely valued lines as effectively as possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since the authors observed a significant effect of CAPE on both bacterial growth and spore production, their discussion and conclusions need to reflect the fact that the effects observed can no longer be attributed solely to toxin inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. We have modified the corresponding description according to your suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In lines 43-45, authors state that &quot;CAPE treatment of C. difficile-challenged mice induces a remarkable increase in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota (e.g., Bacteroides spp.)&quot;. It is still unclear to this reviewer why mention Bacteroides between parentheses. Does this mean that there was an increase in the abundance of Bacteroides? If that is the case this needs to be stated more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. Treatment with CAPE indeed significantly increased the abundance of <italic>Bacteroides spp.</italic> in the gut microbiota (Figure 7H-J). However, to avoid ambiguity in the abstract, we have chosen to delete the specific mention of <italic>Bacteroides spp.</italic> within the parentheses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The modifications made to lines 132-135 still do not address my concern. Authors stated in the manuscript that &quot;compounds that were not bound to TcdB were removed&quot;. But how was this done? This needs to be clearly explained in the manuscript. In the response to reviewers document, authors state that this was done through centrifugation. But given that the goal here is to separate excess of small molecule from a protein target, just stating that centrifugation was used is not enough. Did the authors use ultracentrifugation? What were the conditions employed. This is critical so that the reader can assess the degree of compound carryover that may have occurred. Also, authors need to clearly acknowledge the caveats of their experimental design by stating that they cannot rule out the contribution of compound carryover to their results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. We employed ultrafiltration centrifugal partition to remove the unbound small molecule compounds. Due to the large molecular weight of TcdB, approximately 270 kDa, we selected a 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff ultrafiltration membrane. The centrifugation was performed at 4000 g for 5 min to eliminate the compounds that did not bind to TcdB. We have incorporated the relevant methods and discussed the potential impacts on the respective sections of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In line 142, authors added the molar concentration of caffeic acid, as requested. Although this helps, it is even more important that molar concentrations are added every time a compound concentration is mentioned. For instance, just 2 lines down there is another mention of a compound concentration. It would be informative if authors also added molar concentrations here and throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. In our initial test design, we have utilized the concentration unit of μg/mL. However, during the conversion to μM using the dilution method, some values do not result in neat, whole numbers. For instance, the conversion of 32 μg/mL of caffeic acid phenyl ethyl ester yields 112.55 μM, which appears somewhat irregular when expressed in this manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 277. For the sake of clarity, I would strongly suggest that authors use the term &quot;control mice&quot; instead of &quot;model mice&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. We have modified “model mice” to “control mice” throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In line 302, the word taxa should not be capitalized. I capitalized it in my original comments simply to draw attention to it.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. We have modified this word.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the section starting in line 318, authors still need to include details of how the metabolomics analyses were performed. Just stating that samples were &quot;frozen for metabolomics analyses&quot; is not enough. Was this mass-spec or NMR-based metabolomics. Assuming it was mass-spec, what kind? How was metabolite identity assigned? Etc, etc. These are important details, which need to be included.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. We have added some metabolomics methods in the corresponding section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In line 338, the authors misunderstood my original comment. This sentence should read &quot;...the final product of purine degradation, were markedly decreased in mice after...&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. We have modified this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Panels of figure 3 are still incorrectly labeled. The secondary structure predictions are shown in A and C, not A and B as is currently stated in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. We have modified the figure legend in Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>About Figure 5C, I think the authors for the clarification, but this explanation should be included in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. We have added the relevant information to the figure legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
