lysosome-rich enterocytes (LREs). The gut microbiome has been shown to enhance absorption of nutrients, such as lipids, by intestinal epithelial cells. However, whether protein absorption is also affected by the gut microbiome is poorly understood. Here, we investigate connections between protein absorption and microbes in the zebrafish gut. Using live microscopy-based quantitative assays, we find that microbes slow the pace of protein uptake and degradation in LREs. While microbes do not affect the number of absorbing LRE cells, microbes lower the expression of endocytic and protein digestion machinery in LREs. Using transgene-assisted cell isolation and single cell RNA-sequencing, we characterize all intestinal cells that take up dietary protein. We find that microbes affect expression of bacteria-sensing and metabolic pathways in LREs, and that some secretory cell types also take up protein and share components of protein uptake and digestion machinery with LREs. Using custom-formulated diets, we investigated the influence of diet and LRE activity on the gut microbiome. Impaired protein uptake activity in LREs, along with a protein-deficient diet, alters the microbial community and leads to an increased abundance of bacterial genera that have the capacity to reduce protein uptake in LREs. Together, these results reveal that diet-dependent reciprocal interactions between LREs and the gut microbiome regulate protein absorption.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>intestine</kwd><kwd>enterocyte</kwd><kwd>host-microbiome</kwd><kwd>gut</kwd><kwd>protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK132120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bagnat</surname><given-names>Michel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK121007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rawls</surname><given-names>John F</given-names></name><name><surname>Bagnat</surname><given-names>Michel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The gut microbiome regulates protein absorption activity in lysosome-rich enterocytes (LREs) and causes broad gene expression changes, while LRE activity also affects the microbiome.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability of the intestine to efficiently absorb nutrients from the diet is influenced significantly by the microbiome that it harbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wilson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kau et al., 2011</xref>). Most dietary nutrients, including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, are absorbed by the small intestinal epithelium after luminal digestion. In zebrafish and mice, microbiome colonization enhances small intestinal absorption of dietary lipids compared to germ-free (GF) animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Semova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martinez-Guryn et al., 2018</xref>). Gut microbiomes are also known to increase dietary energy harvest by fermenting complex carbohydrates into short-chain fatty acids that can be absorbed by the gut epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cholan et al., 2020</xref>). There is evidence that <italic>Drosophila</italic>-associated microbes absorb dietary proteins and amino acids and are, in turn, ingested and metabolized by the host, promoting survival under dietary protein-limited conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keebaugh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yamada et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lesperance and Broderick, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, amino acids secreted by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> microbiome have been shown to modify feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). However, whether the microbiome affects intestinal absorption of dietary proteins remains poorly understood. The importance of this question is underscored by the gut microbiomeâs links to protein malnutrition diseases. Children with kwashiorkor, a disease caused by severe protein malnutrition, have significantly altered gut microbiomes that promote weight loss when transplanted into GF mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). These studies suggest that protein deprivation may cause a gut microbial community to develop that further exacerbates the effects of the disease. Defining the reciprocal interactions between intestinal physiology, microbiome, and dietary protein nutrition is, therefore, an important research goal.</p><p>In neonatal mammals and fishes, dietary protein absorption is dependent on the function of a specialized population of epithelial cells in the ileal region of the small intestine originally described as vacuolated or neonatal enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kraehenbuhl and Campiche, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">RodrÃ­guez-Fraticelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wallace et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gonnella and Neutra, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rombout et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graney, 1968</xref>). Recent work in zebrafish and mice showed that these cells, which we refer to as LREs, are highly endocytic and specialize in the uptake of luminal proteins that they then digest in giant lysosomal vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2019</xref>). In mammals, LREs are present only during suckling stages and are lost at weaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harper et al., 2011</xref>), whereas in fishes they are retained through adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Noaillac-Depeyre and Gas, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stroband and Debets, 1978</xref>). In zebrafish, digestive processes can be observed live in the transparent larvae following gavage with fluorescent cargoes directly into the intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">RodrÃ­guez-Fraticelli et al., 2015</xref>). Using this assay, LREs were shown to internalize proteins but not lipids from the intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>LREs internalize luminal proteins using an endocytic complex composed of the scavenger receptor cubilin (Cubn), the transmembrane linker amnionless (Amn), and endocytic clathrin adaptor Dab2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2019</xref>). Loss of these components severely reduces their capacity to take up luminal proteins, leading to stunted growth, poor survival, and intestinal edema reminiscent of kwashiorkor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2019</xref>). LREs are broadly present in vertebrates and likely also in lower chordates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nakayama et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yonge, 1923</xref>), suggesting LRE development and physiology are ancient and important aspects of intestinal function. However, whether gut microbes play a role in LRE-dependent processes or the pathobiology of LRE deficiency is not known.</p><p>Previous work suggested that microbes affect uptake and degradation kinetics in LREs. Specifically, zebrafish larvae colonized with a complex gut microbiome (ex-GF conventionalized or CV) had electron-dense material in the lysosomes of LREs that was not detected in GF larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rawls et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with these findings, CV larvae immersed in horse radish peroxidase (HRP) had increased HRP accumulation in LREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2006</xref>). However, it was unclear from those studies if microbes caused the material to accumulate in LREs by increasing the rate of LRE uptake, decreasing LRE degradation, or both.</p><p>Here, we investigate how interactions between LREs, the gut microbiome, and diet affect host nutrition in zebrafish larvae. We demonstrate that the gut microbiome reduces the rates of protein uptake and degradation in LREs. We present single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data that represents all major intestinal cell types, uncovering cell populations capable of protein uptake, and the effects of microbes across the gut. Using monoassociation experiments, we dissected the effects of specific microbial strains on LREs and found that <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> colonization strongly reduces LRE activity. Finally, using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and custom-formulated diets, we found that dietary protein content and LRE activity also affect the gut microbiome composition. Together, our results uncover significant interactions between LREs, diet, and gut microbes that regulates host nutrition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gut microbiome slows uptake and degradation kinetics in LREs</title><p>We first investigated if microbes affect protein absorption in LREs. To do this, we used established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pham et al., 2008</xref>) to rear zebrafish to the larval stage in gnotobiotic conditions to compare LRE activity in GF and ex-GF conventionalized (CV) conditions. In these experiments, a portion of the GF cohort was conventionalized with microbes at 3 d post fertilization (dpf), while the rest remained in the GF condition until the experimental endpoint of 6 dpf. At that point, we gavaged GF and CV larvae with fluorescent soluble cargoes and imaged uptake in the LRE region using confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cocchiaro and Rawls, 2013</xref>). To test how the microbiome affects protein uptake in LREs, we gavaged larvae with the purified fluorescent protein mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>). Previous work showed that LREs readily take up mCherry following gavage with fluorescence peaking in the anterior LREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2019</xref>). We found that GF and CV larvae rapidly took up mCherry in the LREs, absorbing detectable levels of mCherry within 5 min of gavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-C</xref>). LREs progressively became more saturated with mCherry between 5â60 min post-gavage in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-C</xref>). However, mCherry fluorescence peaked in the anterior LREs of GF larvae by 40 min PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), but the peak did not emerge until 60 min PG in CV larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Between 5 and 60 min PG, the anterior LREs of GF larvae accumulated mCherry at a significantly faster rate than those in CV larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Across the entire LRE region, GF larvae took up significantly more mCherry than CV larvae by 1 hr PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, LREs in CV larvae eventually reached a similar level of mCherry uptake by 5 hr PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Over the 1â5 hr time course, the anterior LREs in CV larvae gradually increased in mCherry saturation, while mCherry saturation remained at a stable, high level in GF larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We tested if the gut microbiome reduces mCherry uptake in LREs by lowering its concentration in the lumen. That did not appear to be the case because luminal mCherry concentrations were equivalent in GF and CV larvae at 1 and 5 hr PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), and the microbiome did not degrade mCherry over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We observed a similar trend using Lucifer Yellow (LY) as a fluid phase endocytic tracer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Swanson et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2019</xref>). GF larvae took up significantly more LY than CV larvae by 1 hr PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) but accumulated similar amounts by 3 hr PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that microbial colonization reduces the rate of endocytosis in the LRE region.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Microbes slow the rate of soluble cargo uptake in lysosome-rich enterocytes (LREs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon depicting experimental design of the gavage assay in GF and CV larvae.

We show that the gut microbiome slows the rates of protein uptake and degradation in LREs and reduces expression of lysosomal protease genes. We also found that monoassociated bacteria such as <italic>Aeromonas caviae</italic> and <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> reduce protein uptake in LREs and downregulate expression of endocytic and protease genes. Finally, we show that impaired LRE protein uptake activity and dietary protein content impact the microbiome.</p><p>Precise delivery of fluorescent cargoes to the gut via gavage provided a quantitative assay that allowed us to uncover that the gut microbiome reduces the rate of cargo uptake and protein degradation in LREs. These effects were caused by microbially-induced metabolic effects in the LREs, not quantity of LREs that developed or the availability of luminal protein. The significance of the microbe-dependent downregulation of protein uptake remains unclear. One possibility is that this effect limits the transepithelial transport of microbial products, which occurs as a byproduct of the endocytic activity of LREs, thus dampening the expression of pro-inflammatory markers. This microbial suppression of the principal physiologic function of LREs (i.e. protein uptake and degradation) is strikingly similar to the microbial suppression of genes involved in lipid absorption in enterocytes within the small intestine of zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Camp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Willms et al., 2022</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Camp et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that microbial inhibition of absorptive gene expression programs across enterocyte populations may be a broader conserved theme in intestinal physiology.</p><p>Recent scRNA-seq studies suggested that the gut microbiome affects the transcriptome of LREs and other ileal cell types in zebrafish by upregulating expression of immune markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Massaquoi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Willms et al., 2022</xref>). Our dataset also showed that microbes upregulated expression of immune markers in LREs. However, the immune markers that other studies attributed to LREs were not upregulated by LREs in our dataset. For example, we found that several of these immune markers (<italic>saa, prdx1, lect2l</italic>) were actually upregulated in cloaca cells, not LREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Willms et al., 2022</xref>). These misalignments could result from previous datasets including relatively few LREs that were over-clustered with cloaca, pronephros, or other ileal cells. Furthermore, these studies did not functionally evaluate intestinal protein absorption, making it difficult to assess the impact of microbes on LRE-dependent processes. Sequencing FACS-sorted IECs minimized contamination from other tissues like the pronephros. Furthermore, we captured a larger number of bona fide LREs from GF and CV larvae that were positively identified in our dataset by their fluorescent label and transcriptional program. Thus, our single-cell dataset provides a high degree of resolution into the effects of the microbiome on LREs and IECs and made it possible to differentiate anterior from posterior LREs.</p><p>Labeling intestinal cells by mCherry gavage allowed us to identify all intestinal cells that take up luminal protein, including EECs, goblet, and acinar cells. These cells showed greater expression of LRE markers than mCherry-negative secretory cells. Unlike LREs, they do not appear to play a significant role in protein absorption as gavaging with DQ Red BSA, which labels cells with lysosomal degradation activity, did not label these cells. Remarkably, anterior enterocytes and <italic>best4/otop2</italic> cells were completely mCherry-negative, indicating that they are virtually devoid of endocytic activity.</p><p>The proportion of mCherry-positive secretory cells was greater in the CV condition. EECs are known for sensing intestinal nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldspink et al., 2018</xref>), but they also influence the intestinal inflammation response to the gut microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Worthington et al., 2018</xref>). Intestinal microbes, including <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, regulate EEC signaling activity in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ye et al., 2019</xref>). In the mouse intestine, some EECs have a synaptic connection to neurons through neuropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">BohÃ³rquez et al., 2015</xref>), which could facilitate the uptake of mCherry by neurons that we detected. Neuronal expression of <italic>cldn15la</italic> was detected in our data and other datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Willms et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sur et al., 2023</xref>), allowing them to be captured by our cell sorting here. Goblet cells secrete a mucous barrier that protects the intestinal epithelium from microbial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belkaid and Hand, 2014</xref>). They also sample luminal antigens and endocytose luminal cargoes as a byproduct of membrane recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birchenough et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McDermott and Huffnagle, 2014</xref>). Similarly, acinar cells secrete digestive enzymes and antimicrobial peptides into the intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahuja et al., 2017</xref>). The gut microbiome may stimulate mucin production and the exocytosis of antimicrobial peptides, which would cause these cells to upregulate their compensatory endocytic activity and lead to mCherry uptake. We speculate that the mCherry uptake we observed in these non-LRE cell types could be related to these respective known functions.</p><p>The overwhelming majority of LREs were mCherry-positive regardless of microbial colonization. This result aligns with our kinetic assays, which showed that LREs have protein uptake activity in both GF and CV conditions. However, our gavage assays showed that anterior LREs in the GF condition took up protein more rapidly than they did in the CV condition. However, the anterior LREs accumulate more protein than posterior LREs in both the GF and CV conditions. The high uptake activity in this anterior LRE region may be due to greater expression of <italic>dab2</italic>, which our HCR results support. Thus, the anterior LRE region has a greater dynamic range in protein uptake activity, and that may partially explain why the effect of the microbiome was more apparent in this region. In addition, anterior LRE protein uptake activity may have remained more active than posterior LREs in both GF and CV conditions due to reduced expression of innate immune factors compared to posterior LREs. Through high rates of apical endocytosis, LREs could be exposed to large amounts of microbial antigens. Posterior LREs upregulated inflammatory response genes in the CV condition, but anterior LREs did not. Furthermore, anterior LREs showed higher expression of tryptophan metabolism genes than posterior LREs, which may attenuate their inflammatory response to the microbiome. Tryptophan metabolites, including kynurenine derivatives, are AhR receptor ligands that downregulate host immune response to bacterial antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bessede et al., 2014</xref>). However, tryptophan metabolism may be an important microbiome-tolerance pathway in both LRE regions. The microbiome-induced expression of <italic>haao</italic>, an enzyme that produces kynurenine metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xue et al., 2023</xref>), in posterior LREs. These results suggest that tryptophan metabolic activity in LREs could participate in host tolerance of the gut microbiome, and inflammation may affect protein uptake activity in LREs.</p><p>LREs may play a role in shaping the gut microbiome community by impacting luminal iron levels. Microbes strongly upregulated expression of iron-ion transport genes in LREs that control the influx and efflux of cellular iron. The microbiome increases intestinal iron absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mayneris-Perxachs et al., 2022</xref>), but its effect on iron absorption in LREs is unknown. Host iron nutrition and luminal iron levels can affect the gut microbiome community and proliferation of microbial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mayneris-Perxachs et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dostal et al., 2012</xref>). Iron absorption and secretion by LREs may affect the gut microbiome community and play a role in host-microbiome homeostasis.</p><p>The impact of intestinal microbes on LRE activity may be dependent on their inflammatory properties. Monoassociating larvae with <italic>A. calcoaceticus</italic>, <italic>P. mendocina</italic>, <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, and <italic>A. caviae</italic> produced differential effects on protein uptake activity and expression of endocytic machinery. <italic>A. calcoaceticus</italic> may be classified as an anti-inflammatory bacterial strain because it reduces intestinal neutrophil recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rolig et al., 2015</xref>). Colonization with <italic>A. calcoaceticus</italic> only mildly reduced protein uptake activity, and it did not reduce expression of endocytic machinery. In contrast, the pro-inflammatory strains, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>A. caviae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rolig et al., 2015</xref>), reduced LRE activity and endocytic expression. <italic>V. cholerae</italic> colonization causes intestinal neutrophil recruitment and stimulates macrophages to express TNF-alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wiles et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ngo et al., 2024</xref>). Importantly, the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strain we used here does not encode cholera toxin or toxin-coregulated pilus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stephens et al., 2016</xref>). This strain has been shown to increase intestinal contractility in zebrafish (Ngo, Amitabh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ngo et al., 2024</xref>) and may affect protein absorption under nutrient limiting conditions. However, in our gavage assays the luminal protein concentrations are never limiting and were not affected by <italic>V. cholerae</italic> colonization (Fig. S6D). Future studies could identify the underlying bacterial signals causing LREs to regulate protein uptake activity and host signal transduction mechanisms.</p><p>Our investigations into the impact of LRE protein uptake activity on the gut microbiome revealed diet-dependent effects on the microbial community. LP-fed, <italic>cubn</italic> mutants developed a distinct microbiome community with diminished species richness. <italic>Aeromonas</italic> was the only genus that proliferated in <italic>cubn</italic> mutants compared to heterozygotes. While <italic>Aeromonas</italic> is considered a part of the core zebrafish gut microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roeselers et al., 2011</xref>), some species are inflammatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rolig et al., 2015</xref>). As discussed, <italic>A. caviae</italic> can reduce LRE protein uptake activity. This result suggests that host protein deprivation through the impaired LRE activity may lead to proliferation of proinflammatory bacteria like <italic>Aeromonas</italic> that can further reduce protein uptake activity by LREs.</p><p>Altogether, our results show reciprocal regulation between LREs and the gut microbiome, along with the impact of the gut microbiome on protein uptake by IECs. These results pave the way to identify microbial signals or antigens that reduce protein uptake activity by LREs. Future studies could characterize the effect of microbes on protein-uptake by secretory cell populations. Further investigations into the tryptophan metabolism, iron ion transport, and expression of bacteria-sensing genes by LREs could reveal mechanisms for host-microbiome homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics</title><p>Animal experimentation: Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were used in accordance with Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines and approved under our animal protocol A072-20-03.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Fish</title><p>The Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines were followed in the care and use of all fish in this project.

Briefly, embryos were treated with antibiotic zebrafish media, followed by iodine and bleach washes to eliminate microbes from their chorions at 0 dpf. Following microbe-removal steps, embryos were housed in sterile cell culture flasks containing autoclaved gnotobiotic zebrafish media (GZM) and incubated at 28 Â°C. Each flask contained 30 embryos in 30 mL media. At 3 dpf, gnotobiotic larvae were either conventionalized, monoassociated, or remained in the GF condition. In this process, 80% of the media was replaced. The media in GF and monoassociated flasks was replaced with 24 mL autoclaved GZM, while CV flasks received 12 mL autoclaved GZM and 12 mL 5 Âµm-filtered zebrafish system water. After this step, gnotobiotic zebrafish either (Protocol A) continued to be raised as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pham et al., 2008</xref>), or (Protocol B) they were raised by our modified protocol designed to boost the bacterial load.

At the 6 dpf endpoint, GF flasks were tested for sterility by spot-testing on TSA plates, as well as brain-heart, dextrose and nutrient broth. The bacterial density in CV and monoassociated media was tested by serial dilutions on TSA plates. Zebrafish larvae were monoassociated with <italic>Acinetobacter calcoaceticus</italic> ZOR0008, <italic>Aeromonas caviae</italic> ZOR0002, <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> ZWU0020, or <italic>Pseudomonas mendocina</italic> ZWU0006 that were previously isolated from conventionally-reared zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stephens et al., 2016</xref>). Bacteria stocks used in monoassociation were kept in 50% glycerol at â80Â°C for long-term storage and on tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates at 4 Â°C for short-term storage. Bacteria were cultured by incubating picked colonies in LB liquid media on a shaker table at 30 Â°C for 24â72 hr to reach turbidity with an OD600 of 1â3. Cultures were re-suspended in 1 X PBS after spinning at 5000 RPM for 2 min. The bacterial density (CFU/mL) was determined by plating serial dilutions on TSA plates and incubating overnight at 37 Â°C.

Larvae were imaged by confocal microscopy using a Leica SP8 microscope equipped with 10X and 25 X objectives. The difference in HCR probe fluorescence profiles between GF and monoassociated larvae was calculated with a two-way ANOVA. To do so, the average probe fluorescence in each segment (30 Âµm) of the LRE region (300 Âµm) was compared between the GF and monoassociated conditions. HCR probe sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>. HCR probes were tested and imaged in at least three replicate experiments (data not shown). HCR probe fluorescence was measured in GF and monoassociated larvae in two replicate experiments and multiple larvae as indicated in the figure legend.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>High and low-protein diet feeding</title><p>Sibling larvae from a <italic>cubn</italic> heterozygous-mutant cross were conventionally raised from 0â5 dpf. At 6 dpf larvae were housed in 3 L tanks at a density of 10 larvae per tank and raised on our standard circulating aquarium. From 6 â 30 dpf, larvae were fed 10 mg/d of a custom-formulated high (HP) or low-protein (LP) diet daily between 11 amâ12 pm. There were three tanks per diet. Diet formulations are described in detail below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>16S rRNA gene sequencing</title><p>At 30 dpf, samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Larvae were anesthetized with 0.2 Âµm-filtered tricaine in autoclaved egg water. After the water was removed, larvae were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tank water samples were collected by passing 50 mL through a 0.2 Âµm filter (Pall Corporation MicroFunnel Filter Funnels #4803), then flash freezing the filter paper in liquid nitrogen.</p><p>Samples were put on dry ice during transport to the Duke Microbiome Shared Resource for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Larval DNA was extracted with the MagAttract PowerSoil DNA EP Kit (Qiagen, 27100-4-EP). Following the Earth Microbiome Project protocol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/">http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/</ext-link>), the V4 region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the 515F and 806R primers, which are barcoded for multiplexed sequencing. PCR product concentration was measured with the Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (ThermoFisher, Q32854) on a Promega GloMax plate reader. Equimolar PCR products from all samples were pooled and sequenced with 250 bp PE reads on the MiSeq Illumina platform. Sequencing results are deposited at NCBI Sequence Read Archive (BioProject Accession #: PRJNA1188138).</p><p>Paired-end fastq files were demultiplexed in R (version 4.1.1).

Mitochondria and chloroplasts were filtered out of the dataset using the Phyloseq package (version 1.46.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McMurdie and Holmes, 2013</xref>). Phyloseq was used for downstream analysis of relative abundance and taxa richness. The DESeq2 package (version 1.42.0) was used to measure differential abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Love et al., 2014</xref>). The ggplot2 package (version 3.5.0) was used to generate heatmap and relative abundance plots.

In this study they seek to understand how the presence and composition of the microbiota impacts the protein absorption function of these cells and reciprocally, how diet and intestinal protein absorption function impact the microbiome.</p><p>Strengths of the study include the functional assays for protein absorption performed in live larval zebrafish, which provides detailed kinetics on protein uptake and degradation with anatomic precision, and the gnotobiotic manipulations. The authors clearly show that the presence of the microbiota or of certain individual bacterial members slows the uptake and degradation of multiple different tester fluorescent proteins.</p><p>To understand the mechanistic basis for these differences, the authors also provide detailed single-cell transcriptomic analyses of cells isolated based on both an intestinal epithelial cell identity (based on a transgenic marker) and their protein uptake activity. The data generated from these analyses, presented in Figures 3-5, are valuable for expanding knowledge about zebrafish intestinal epithelial cell identities, but of more limited interest to a broader readership. Some of the descriptive analysis in this section is circular because the authors define subsets of LREs (termed anterior and posterior) based on their fabp6 expression levels, but then go on to note transcriptional differences between these cells (for example in fabp6) that are a consequence of this initial subsetting.</p><p>Inspired by their single-cell profiling and by previous characterization of the genes required for protein uptake and degradation in the LREs, the authors use quantitative hybridization chain reaction RNA-fluorescent in situ hybridization to examine transcript levels of several of these genes along the length of the LRE intestinal region of germ-free versus mono-associated larvae. They provide good evidence for reduced transcript levels of these genes that correlate with the reduced protein uptake in the mono-associated larval groups.</p><p>The final part of the study (shown in Figure 7) characterized the microbiomes of 30-day-old zebrafish reared from 6-30 days on defined diets of low and high protein and with or without homozygous loss of the cubn gene required for protein uptake. The analysis of these microbiomes notes some significant differences between fish genotypes by diet treatments, but the discussion of these data does not provide strong support for the hypothesis that &quot;LRE activity has reciprocal effects on the gut microbiome&quot;. The most striking feature of the MDS plot of Bray Curtis distance between zebrafish samples shown in Figure 7B is the separation by diet independent of host genotype, which is not discussed in the associated text. Additionally, the high protein diet microbiomes have a greater spread than those of the low protein treatment groups, with the high protein diet cubn mutant samples being the most dispersed. This pattern is consistent with the intestinal microbiota under a high protein diet regimen and in the absence of protein absorption machinery being most perturbed in stochastic ways than in hosts competent for protein uptake, consistent with greater beta dispersal associated with more dysbiotic microbiomes (described as the Anna Karenina principle here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28836573/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28836573/</ext-link>).

The work refines our understanding of intestinal cell types that contribute to protein uptake and their respective transcriptomes. The work also provides some evidence that microbiomes are modulated by enterocyte protein uptake capacity in a diet-dependent manner.

The microbiome field has long used 16S sequencing to characterize the microbiota, but its variability due to experimental parameters limits the ability to draw causative conclusions about the link between LRE activity, dietary protein, and microbial composition. Additionally, the complex networks involved in dopamine synthesis and signalling cannot be fully represented by RNA levels alone. The authors' conclusions on this biological phenomenon based on single-cell data need support from functional and in vivo experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their assessment and for pointing out some areas that needed to be explained better and/or discussed.</p><p>The Reviewer mentions some potential confounding factors (ie., size differences, transit time, oral gavage) in the gnotobiology experiments. We would like to convey that these aspects have been addressed in our experimental design and are now clarified in the revised manuscript: 1- larval sizes were recorded and found to be similar between GF and monoassociated larvae (Figure S6A); 2- while intestinal transit time may be affected by microbes and is a topic of interest, in our assay luminal mCherry cargo is present at high levels throughout the gut and is not limiting at any point during the experiment; 3- gavage, which is necessary for quantitative assays, is indeed an experimental manipulation that may somehow alter the subjects (the same is true for microscopy and virtually any research method). However, it cannot explain differences between GF and CV or alter our conclusions via microbial or dietary effects. We now elaborate the former point in the revised discussion (line 426). A new panel has been added for Fig.S6 to show that standard length was similar in GF and monoassociated larvae (Figure S6A).</p><p>We are aware that microbial community composition is often highly variable between experiments and this necessitates adequately high biological replication and inclusion of internal controls to allow conclusions to be drawn. Nevertheless, studies evaluating the utility of 16S rRNA gene sequencing have found that this analysis reveals important impacts of environmental factors on the gut microbiome (PMIDs: 21346791, 31409661, 31324413). Our results provide further evidence that 16S rRNA gene sequencing remains a useful method to detect perturbations to the zebrafish gut microbiome. Reproducing previous findings, we detected many of the core zebrafish microbiota strains in our samples that have been identified by other studies (PMIDs: 26339860, 21472014, 17055441). To ensure the robustness of our results, we included several biological replicates for each condition, co-housed genotypes and included large sample sizes to minimize environmental variability between groups. In response to this reviewer concern, we have added a supplemental beta diversity plot and statistical analyses showing that the microbiomes in our larvae were significantly different from the diets or tank water (Figure S7A). This analysis shows that the host environment influenced microbial community composition (lines 376 â 378). We also added an additional supplemental panel and performed analysis showing that the experimental replicates (i.e., different tanks) were not a significant source of variation in this study (lines 378 â 380) (Figure S7B). This result underscores that the microbiota in these larvae were influenced by both the host and diet.</p><p>Regarding dopamine pathways, we acknowledge that it involves complex biology that will require dedicated studies. In this work, we simply point out gene expression patterns we find interesting as they may inform future studies.</p><p>Finally, the Reviewer mentions the use of inadequate statistical methods for some analyses without specifying or indicating alternative analyses, only the need to justify the use of two-way ANOVA is made explicit. In this point, we respectfully disagree and would like to emphasize that we use statistical methods that are standard in the field (PMID: 37707499). We nevertheless added a justification for the use of two-way ANOVA where appropriate (lines 635-637, 653-654, 773-776). The two-way ANOVA test was to compare fluorescence profiles of gavages cargoes or HCR probes along the length of the LRE region. This test accounts for differences in fluorescence between experimental conditions in segments (30 Î¼m) along the LRE region (~300 Î¼m). This allows us to capture differences in fluorescence between experimental conditions while accounting for heterogeneity in the LRE region. Please see our comment below for more information about our use of the 2-way ANOVA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Please provide in the materials and methods the strain identifiers and sources of the bacteria used in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions.

This is because the concentration of luminal protein was equivalent in GF and CV larvae (Figure S1E), so the LREs had equal saturating access to those proteins in both conditions. Furthermore, we showed the microbiota did not degrade fluorescent protein (Figure S1F). Therefore, we feel confident that there was lower protein uptake in the LREs of CV larvae because the microbiome exerted regulatory effects on LRE activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Provide detailed information on the gating strategy used for single-cell sorting to enhance the dataset's utility and support claims about cell changes.</p></disp-quote><p>The methods we used for sorting cells were previously described (PMID: 31474562).
