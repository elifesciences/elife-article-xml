Applied genetic tools include RNAi, CRISPR/Cas9, and site-specific recombination technologies such as the Cre-Lox or Flp-FRT systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mohr et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Housden et al., 2017</xref>). While these technologies have undoubtedly revolutionized genetic screening, target identification and validation, each method is associated with drawbacks that limit the usability for certain aspects of target validation. Specifically, RNAi is prone to off-target effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jackson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scacheri et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2005</xref>) and insufficient knockdown levels, while CRISPR/Cas9-based methods are associated with off-target effects and incomplete LOF across cell populations. These limitations are particularly problematic for candidate targets in oncology, which should ideally be validated genetically in cancer cell lines and tumor models in vivo. In both cases, insufficient LOF or off-target effects can lead to far-reaching misconceptions about target suppression effects. Outgrowth of wild-type clones that retain gene function upon CRISPR- and recombination-based gene editing can result in transient phenotypes that complicate data interpretation. Similarly, insufficient knockdown or uncontrolled off-target effects induced by RNAi can lead to an unjustified de-prioritization or pursuit of candidate targets, respectively. Prior to initiating the time- and resource-intense process of drug development, more informative target validation assays would be highly desirable.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To develop such an assay system, we reasoned that instead of using gene-specific LOF triggers for every new candidate gene, the expression of any gene could be efficiently suppressed by engineering the target site of a pre-validated, highly potent, synthetic short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) into its exonic sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Besides ensuring efficient target knockdown in a highly standardized manner, such an approach would also provide control over off-target activities through expressing the shRNA side-by-side in target-site engineered and wildtype cells. This approach leaves the genome engineering procedure, needed to integrate the pre-validated artificial RNA interference (ARTi) target site into a gene of interest, as the only potential source of off-target effects. As suitable RNAi system, we chose optimized micro-RNA embedded shRNAs (shRNAmirs) in the miR-E backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fellmann et al., 2013</xref>), which do not interfere with endogenous miRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Premsrirut et al., 2011</xref>) and can be expressed from tet-responsive elements and other Pol-II promoters in the 3′-UTR of fluorescent reporter genes, thus providing a versatile system for inducible RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zuber et al., 2011</xref>). To identify potent ARTi sequences with minimal off-target activity, we analyzed the nucleotide composition of shRNAs that reach exceptionally high-performance scores in common shRNA design algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vert et al., 2006</xref>) and of miRNA seed sequences with exceptionally low off-target scores according to siSPOTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boudreau et al., 2013</xref>). By merging nucleotide biases identified in both analyses, we derived a 22-nt base composition matrix for the design of ARTi shRNAmirs (TTCGWWWNNAHHWWCATCCGGN; W = A/T, H = A/T/C; N = A/T/G/C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). To further reduce possible off-target effects, we eliminated all shRNAs whose extended seed sequence (guide positions 2–14) had a perfect match in the human or mouse transcriptome and, finally, selected six top-scoring ARTi predictions for experimental validation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design and selection ARTi-shRNAmirs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic outline of the ARTi approach.

In all six cases, ARTi-shRNAmir matched or outperformed previously validated highly potent shRNAmirs targeting Renilla luciferase or PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fellmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We compared these results to a panel of 592 gene-specific shRNAs that were tested using the same assay and found that ARTi-shRNAmirs ranked among top-performing shRNAmirs overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Next, we selected the three top-performing ARTi-shRNAmirs and evaluated possible off-target activities using competitive proliferation assays and transcriptome profiling. ARTi-shRNAmir expression had no effects on proliferation or survival in four human and three mouse cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), with the exception of ARTi.6634 and ARTi.6786, which induced a mild fitness defect in the murine leukemia cell line RN2 and MV4-11, respectively. In contrast to the effects of a MEK inhibitor trametinib, which we included as a positive control, stable expression of ARTi-shRNAmirs had only marginal effects on the transcriptome in two commonly used human cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>) and no effect in proliferation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), indicating that they do not trigger major off-target effects, even in the absence of their respective target site. Together, these studies established a set of highly potent, off-target-free ARTi-shRNAmirs, among which we selected ARTi.6570 (ARTi-shRNAmir) for further investigations.</p><p>To establish ARTi as a method for target validation, we performed ARTi-based LOF experiments in cancer cell lines and xenograft models for three prominent oncology targets: EGFR and KRAS, which act as driving oncogenes in various cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hynes and MacDonald, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Punekar et al., 2022</xref>), and STAG1, which has been identified as a synthetic lethal interaction with recurrent LOF mutations of STAG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">van der Lelij et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benedetti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van der Lelij et al., 2017</xref>).

Instead of designing gene-specific LOF reagents that remain prone to off-target effects, ARTi involves a simple, highly standardized experimental procedure that provides full control over on- and off-target effects and can be applied to any coding and non-coding gene. In cells that are pre-engineered to express the dox-inducible ARTi-shRNAmir, candidate genes can be converted into ARTi target genes and subsequently evaluated head-to-head in a highly standardized manner, either through knocking in ARTi target sites into endogenous loci or through knockout rescue approaches. Placement of ARTi target sites in non-coding transcript regions leaves the endogenous target protein unaltered, which is a key advantage over chemical-genetic LOF methods relying on the introduction of degron tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lai and Crews, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cromm and Crews, 2017</xref>). Targeting endogenously engineered ARTi target sites through tetracycline (Tet)-inducible ARTi-shRNAmir expression enables inducible, titratable, and likely reversible (not tested in this study) LOF perturbations of candidate genes without altering their endogenous transcriptional regulation, which is not possible using conventional Tet-expression systems. In principle, by engineering multiple target sites in the same cell, ARTi enables combinatorial LOF perturbations, for example, for modeling synergistic target interactions, without multiplying the risk for off-target effects. Although ARTi requires the design of gene-specific sgRNAs and genome engineering steps that can be non-trivial, the method enables researchers to reach well-interpretable, comparable, and unambiguous experimental results that can guide larger investments in targets of high medical interest. Beyond providing a scalable method for early target validation, we foresee that ARTi can be used to establish on-target benchmark phenotypes for guiding the development and optimization of inhibitory molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Design and cloning of ARTi shRNAs</title><p>To design pairs of artificial shRNAs and matching target sites that trigger effective and selective target suppression with minimal off-target effects, nucleotide composition of shRNAs that reach exceptionally high-performance scores in a well-established siRNA prediction tool (DSIR [Designer of Small Interfering RNA]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vert et al., 2006</xref>) and contain no A or T in guide position 20 to eliminate shRNAmirs that produce RISC-loadable small RNAs from the passenger strand were analyzed. To establish the criteria for ARTi design, siRNA predictions for the human and mouse genome were retrieved from DSIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vert et al., 2006</xref>) using default parameters. Top-scoring predictions (DSIR score &gt;105) harboring G or C in position 20 were analyzed for nucleotide biases, which were used to define basic design criteria at the 5′-end the 3′-half. Next, possible off-targets were minimized using siSPOTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boudreau et al., 2013</xref>), an siRNA-based prediction tool that assesses off-target potential of different siRNA seed sequences (guide positions 2–8) in the human and mouse genome. Seed sequences with the lowest predicted off-target activity (top 1%) showed biases for C and/or G in guide positions 2–6, but 23% contained a T at the 5′ end of the seed sequence that is required in our design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Among these, we observed particularly strong biases for CG in the following two positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which were found in 73% of all seed sequences harboring a 5′ T. Overall, 17% of all top-scoring seed sequences harbored TCG at their 5′ end, making it the second most common triplet (after CGC, which was found in 20%). Based on these analyses, we fixed the first four nucleotides of the guide to TTCG. For the following positions, we reasoned that introducing additional GC biases would destroy 5′–3′ asymmetry of small RNA duplexes that is critically required for efficient RISC loading. To maintain sufficient asymmetry, we therefore decided to bias the next three positions toward A or T, which in most positions is in alignment with nucleotide biases associated with knockdown efficacy.</p><p>For the remaining sequence 3′ of the seed region, we adhered to nucleotide features associated with knockdown efficacy based on our DSIR analysis, which are remarkably prominent and cannot all be explained through established processing requirements. Altogether, this established a 22-nt matrix for the design of ARTi shRNAmirs (TTCGWWWNNAHHWWCATCCGGN; W = A/T, H = A/T/C; N = A/T/G/C).

The idea of identifying potent artificial RNAi (ARTi) triggers is intriguing, and the authors successfully identify six ARTi with robust knockdown efficiency and limited to no off-target effects. As a proof-of-concept, the authors examined three oncology targets for validation, including EGFRdel19 (which already has a clinically approved drug for validation), KRASG12R (for which there are no in vivo compatible inhibitors yet) and STAG1 (which has a synthetic lethal interaction with recurrent loss-of-function mutations of STAG2). The authors demonstrated significant suppression of colony formation and in vivo tumor growth for all three oncology targets.</p><p>This novel system could serve as a powerful tool for loss-of-function experiments that are often used to validate a drug target. Not only this tool can be applied in exogenous systems (like EGFRdel19 and KRASG12R in this paper), the authors successfully demonstrated that ARTi can also be used in endogenous systems by CRISPR knocking in the ARTi target sites to the 3'UTR of the gene of interest (like STAG2 in this paper).</p><p>ARTi enables specific, efficient, and inducible suppression of these genes of interest, and can potentially improve therapeutic target validations. However, the system cannot be easily generalized as there are some limitations in this system:</p><p>• The authors claim in the introduction that CRISPR/Cas9-based methods are associated with off-target effects, however, the author's system requires the use CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out a given endogenous genes or to knock-in ARTi target sites to the 3' UTR of the gene of interest. Though the authors used a transient CRISPR/Cas9 system to minimize the potential off-target effects, the methods does not, as the authors acknowledge, eliminate the possibility of off-target effects.</p><p>• Instead of generating gene-specific loss-of-function triggers for every new candidate gene, the authors identified a universal and potent ARTi to ensure standardized and controllable knockdown efficiency. It seems this would save time and effort in validating each lost-of-function siRNAs/sgRNAs for each gene. However, users will still have to design and validate the best sgRNA to knock out endogenous genes or to knock in ARTi target sites by CRISPR/Cas9. The latter is by no-means trivial. Users will need to design and clone an expression construct for their cDNA replacement construct of interest, which will still be challenging for big proteins. This is not, as the authors point out, a replacement for other LOF methods, and there are other ways to achieve gene-specific regulation via, for example, degrons. However it is an effective orthogonal approach that many users may find compelling for their applications.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84792.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this manuscript, Hoffmann et al. introduce a novel and innovative method to validate and study the mechanism of action of essential genes and novel putative drug targets. In the wake of many functional genomics approaches geared towards identifying novel drug targets or synthetic lethal interactions, there is a dire need for methods that allow scientists to ablate a gene of interest and study its immediate effect in culture or in xenograft models.

In contrast to conventional RNAi- and CRISPR-based approaches, such off-target effects can be investigated prior to loss-of-function experiments through comparison between parental and engineered cells, which in the absence of CRISPR-induced off-target events are expected to be identical. Subsequent ARTi experiments provide full control over RNAi-induced off-target activities through comparison of target-site engineered and parental cells. However, we agree that undetected CRISPR/Cas9-induced off-target events cannot be ruled out in a definitive way, which we have pointed out in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Instead of generating gene-specific loss-of-function triggers for every new candidate gene, the authors identified a universal and potent ARTi to ensure standardized and controllable knockdown efficiency.

However, we believe that decisive advantages of the method, in particular the robustness of LOF perturbations and additional means for controlling off-target activities, can make ARTi an investment that pays off. In our experience, much time can be lost in the search for effective LOF reagents, and even when these are found, questions about off-target activity remain. While ARTi overcomes many of these challenges by providing a standardized experimental workflow, we do not propose to replace all other LOF approaches by this method. Instead, we would position ARTi as a unique orthogonal approach for the stringent validation and in-depth characterization of candidate target genes, as we have highlighted in our revised discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The approach of knocking-out an endogenous gene followed by replacement of a regulatable gene can also be achieved using regulated degrons, and by tet-regulated promoters included in the gene replacement cassette. The authors should include a discussion of the merits of these approaches compared with ARTi.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these alternative LOF methods. We had already included a brief discussion of chemical-genetic LOF methods based on degron tags. While we certainly share the current excitement about degron technologies, they inevitably require changes to the coding sequence of target proteins, which can alter their regulation and function in ways that are hard to control for. In our revised discussion, we have added a brief comparison to conventional tet-regulatable expression systems, which unlike ARTi require the use of ectopic tet-responsive promoters. Overall, we would position ARTi as an orthogonal tool that enables inducible and reversible LOF perturbations without changing the coding sequence and the endogenous transcriptional control of candidate target genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>[…] The ARTi system is based on expression of a transgene with an artificial RNAi target site in the 3'-UTR as well as a TET-inducible miR-E-based shRNAi.

However, there are no experiments supporting the reversible suppression of their gene of interest. Data are required to support this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The statement about the reversibility ARTi-mediated effects was based on a rich body of literature that has demonstrated the reversibility of Tet-shRNAmir-induced LOF perturbations and associated phenotypes. As ARTi employs the same Tet-shRNAmir expression vectors, we have no reason to believe that this feature would be lost. However, since we have not demonstrated this in our study, we have removed this statement in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In Figure 1E, the authors did make the point by including trametinib treated samples as positive controls. However, the trametinib treated samples also made the transcriptome changes in the ARTi groups hard to read. I wonder what the PCA analysis will look like if the authors exclude the trametinib treated groups.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1E, we used PCA as a common and easy-to-digest visualization tool to showcase the neutrality of ARTi shRNAmirs. Given the complete absence of significantly deregulated genes for all three ARTi shRNAmirs (Figure 1F), we believe that a PCA analysis of just these samples would merely represent experimental noise and not yield additional insights.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• This universal and potent ARTi should ensure standardized and controllable knockdown efficiency, however, the knockdown efficiency for KRASG12R is not as potent as that for EGFRdel19. The authors should discuss the differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The exact level of knockdown on the protein level is hard to determine due to detection limits of the used method. The differences in the extent to mRNA knockdown could be attributable to cleavage efficiencies due to potential secondary structures in the respective mRNAs. We suspect that the KRASG12R transgene expresses at higher levels, compared to EGFRdel19. We might therefore still be looking at the same overall magnitude of knockdown. As we did not perform a detailed analysis of the respective knockdown levels, we do not feel comfortable in stating differences in knockdown levels and therefore do not think that addressing potential differences are justified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• It is interesting to see that, unlike other cancer types, tumor burdens did not decrease after inducing knockdown of STAG1 in STAG2 knockout HCT116 lines in Figure 2L. Have the authors examined senescence markers in this set of mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not investigated these markers and thank the reviewer for this suggestion. More detailed analyses of the phenotype are planned.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Have the authors carefully examined the transcriptome changes induced or if not across all targets at least in the case of ARTi knock into the 3'UTR of STAG1?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. This would indeed be interesting to conduct for STAG1/2, especially for genes with an integration of the ARTi into the 3’UTR. The reason why we did not perform this analysis with our cell lines is that we used a construct that also adds an AID tag to STAG1 (STAG1_AID_V5_P2A_Blasti_STOP_ARTi), as outlined in the methods section. After the engineering, STAG1 carries the ARTi sequence in the 3’UTR but is also fused to AID::V5. In addition a P2A::Blasticidin_resistance Protein is made from the same transcript. We chose to use this complex strategy with the aim of comparing AID mediated degradation with ARTi-mediated knockdown. Unfortunately, the AID-based approach did not work, and we were not able to observe a reduction in protein levels. We however observed lower expression of STAG1 in the engineered versus the parental cells, likely caused by the tag, and consequently did not conduct gene expression analyses, as we would not be able to assess if transcriptome changes could be solely ascribed to the changes in the 3’UTR. The knockdown levels are hence only analyzed on the protein level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>This is a fantastic paper, easy to read and provides a very meaningful new and innovative approach for drug target validation. I think the manuscript could be further improved by adding a section to the discussion outlining other approaches that could be used to solve the same problem. For example, Bill Kaelin came up with a strategy of expressing shRNA- or sgRNA-resistant and rtTA- or tTA-regulated cDNAs of essential gene-of-interest followed by sh/sgRNA-mediated ablation of the endogenous gene (e.g.PMID: 28082722), which is conceptually quite similar to the ARTi approach. Similarly, people have used conditional degron tags such as AID tags, dTags, HALOTags, IHZF3 degrons or SMASh either knocked into the endogenous locus or as rescue transgene. Comparing and contrasting the pros and cons of these methods to the ARTi-based approach would be certainly beneficial to the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for pointing out these alternative LOF methods. We certainly share the current excitement about various degron tags and are applying them in our own research. In our view, a major downside of these strategies is that they inevitably require changes to the coding sequence of target proteins, which can alter their regulation and function in ways that are hard to predict and control for. We had briefly mentioned this distinguishing feature in our discussion. The strategy proposed by Bill Kaelin, i.e. rescue of the the endogenous gene through Tet-regulated expression of sh/sgRNA-resistant cDNAs, indeed shares many features of the ARTi system, but requires expression of the candidate target from an ectopic promoter element. In contrast, ARTi enables similar perturbations of candidate genes without altering their endogenous transcriptional regulations – a feature that we have highlighted in our revised discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All my other comments outlined below should be considered minor and are not essential.</p><p>1, Suppl Fig.1 C: Please explain what the red star means. How can the knock-out be more than 100%. Please specify what the controls are. Why does shRNA660 exhibit no knockdown at all?</p></disp-quote><p>The red star indicates ARTi-shRNAmirs that were selected for further characterization. Depicted GFP knockdown levels are normalized to the performance of shRen.713, a well-characterized potent control shRNA targeting Renilla Luciferase. Values of more than 100% mean that the respective shRNA exceeded effects of shRNA.713. shRNA.660 served as a neutral control – its target site was not included in the reporter construct. We thank the reviewer for bringing up these points, which we have clarified in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2, x-axis label in Suppl Fig. 1D is missing</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for spotting this and have added this information to the figure and its legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3, I would argue that ARTi6634 also has a slight effect in MV4-11 similar to its effect to RN2.

Is this a EGFR wt lysate with EGFR::dsRED::ARTi overexpression and as such a type in the legend or is this a non-complete KO? It might be beneficial to label the legend with EGFR::dsRED::ARTi instead of EGFR::ARTi have one arrow depicting EGFR and one additional arrow showing the EGFR::dsRED fusion (as in Fig. 1F).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We interpret the WB signal in lane three as potential cleavage/degradation products of the transgene as all signal disappears upon ARTi-mediated knockdown. Due to space reasons, we would prefer to keep the label as it is. The exact nature of the transgene is stated in the text and in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7, Suppl Fig. 2d: It is interesting that there is such a huge upregulation of DUSP6 in cells that express EGFR::ARTi compared to parental? The figure legend states: expression levels of DUSP6 in parental and engineered PC-9 cells. I assume the first box (EGFR::ARTi -/ dox -) is the parental line? Is there really a 5x upregulation of DUSP6 upon overexpression of EGFR::ARTi compared to parental (despite the fact that the endogenous EGFR::ARTi is expressed to similar levels compared to the endogenous EGFR)? Please clarify a little better which of the cells are parental and which are EGFR KO and which are transduced with EGFR::ARTi. Might suffice to just explain in the supplmental figure legend that expression of the exogenous EGFR::ARTi in EGFR KO cells leads to increased expression of ERK targets such as DUSP6 and EPHA2 etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We ascribe the increased expression of DUSP6 to the forced expression of the oncogenic variant of EGFR (EGFRdel19) while only a subset of <italic>EGFR</italic> genes in PC-9 cells is mutated and the rest is wild-type. Therefore, the net-output of EGFR signaling would be higher, even if the EGFR protein levels were exactly the same, as the <italic>EGFR</italic> gene is only present in the oncogenic form in the engineered cells but a mixture of mutant and wild-type proteins would make up the EGFR pool in the parental cells. The figure legend was changed accordingly, highlighting that <italic>DUSP6</italic> is a MAPK downstream gene.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8, Suppl Fig. 2e: Similar to my comment #7. Expression of endogenous EGFR is lost upon KO of EGFR, but cylcinD1 expression as well as expression of other ERK target genes increases upon loss of the endogenous EGFR gene with concomitant expression of EGFR::ARTi . It is nice to see that most of those genes are down-regulated upon DOX treatment. However, CyclinD1 is strongly up-regulated - any idea why? Might be nice to comment on this in the supplemental material to make it easy for the reader to interpret the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the direct MAPK target genes follow the expected pattern of strong downregulation. We have not studied the expression of CCND1 in detail and therefore cannot comment on the mechanistic basis of this observation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9, Fig. 2F - might be nice to provide some densitometry data to quantify the effect of ARTi-mediated KRasG12R knock-down.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and apologize that this data is not available for this study. We will include densitometry data in upcoming studies involving ARTi. As the observed knockdown was almost complete and hence readily observable by eye, we did not measure the effects using densitometry. In addition, we would like to mention that the sensor assay contains a quantitative analysis of the knockdown levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10, Fig. 2I, it might be nice to add the V5 tag to the schematic and mention the V5 tag in the text: ... and homozygously inserted ARTi target sites into the 3'-UTR as well as a V5 tag to the endogenous STAG1 alleles (Fig. 2i)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and explained the exact makeup of the construct better in the main text. We would however like to keep the figure as simple as possible and put the focus on the endogenous engineering here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11, Fig. 2J - might be nice to provide some densitometry data to quantify the effect of ARTi-mediated STAT1::V5 knock-down.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and apologize that this data is not available for this study.

Fig 4B: the authors write: 'Western blotting confirmed ... the homozygous insertion of the targeting cassette into the STAG1 locus, ...' . I think the WB nicely shows insertion of the V5 tag into the STAG1 locus, but it I think WB cannot show homozygous insertion. The fact that in Suppl Fig 1B STAG1 expression is (almost) completely ablated, is a good indication, but in Fig. 2J, there is still about 50% expression. As such, proofing homozygous insertion by PCR/Sanger sequencing or densitometry over several experiments or just rephrasing the text a little might be beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have adapted the respective passage in the main text.</p><p><bold>Competing interests statement:</bold> A patent application related to the design and use of the ARTi system entitled ‘Methods and molecules for RNA interference (RNAi)’ has been submitted by T.H., M.H., J.Z. and R.N. to the European Patent Office (application EP21217407.2).</p></body></sub-article></article>
