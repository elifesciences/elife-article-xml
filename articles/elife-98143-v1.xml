the ratio of excitation to inhibition (E/I) in neural circuits is experience dependent, and changes across development. Here, we assessed 3T Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) markers of cortical E/I ratio in 10 individuals who had been treated for dense bilateral congenital cataracts, after an average of 12 years of blindness, to test for dependence of the E/I ratio on early visual experience in humans. First, participants underwent MRS scanning at rest with their eyes open and eyes closed, to obtain visual cortex Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA+) concentration, Glutamate/Glutamine (Glx) concentration, and the concentration ratio of Glx/GABA+, as measures of inhibition, excitation, and E/I ratio, respectively. Subsequently, EEG was recorded to assess aperiodic activity (1–20 Hz) as a neurophysiological measure of the cortical E/I ratio, during rest with eyes open and eyes closed, and during flickering stimulation. Across conditions, congenital cataract-reversal individuals demonstrated a significantly lower visual cortex Glx/GABA+ ratio, and a higher intercept and steeper aperiodic slope at occipital electrodes, compared to age-matched sighted controls. In the congenital cataract-reversal group, a lower Glx/GABA+ ratio was associated with better visual acuity, and Glx concentration correlated positively with the aperiodic intercept in the conditions with visual input. We speculate that these findings result from an increased E/I ratio of the visual cortex as a consequence of congenital blindness, which might require commensurately increased inhibition in order to balance the additional excitation from restored visual input. The lower E/I ratio in congenital cataract-reversal individuals would thus be a consequence of homeostatic plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>visual development</kwd><kwd>excitatory/inhibitory balance</kwd><kwd>visual deprivation</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>sensitive periods</kwd><kwd>cataract models</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009052</institution-id><institution>Hector Fellow Academy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pant</surname><given-names>Rashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG Ro 2625/10-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Röder</surname><given-names>Brigitte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Landesforschungsförderung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LFF-FV 6</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Röder</surname><given-names>Brigitte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 936-178316478-B11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Röder</surname><given-names>Brigitte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rare individuals treated for congenital cataracts demonstrated shifts in the visual cortex’s excitatory/inhibitory balance even decades post-surgery, reflected by alterations in the neurotransmitter concentration ratio and aperiodic electroencephalogram activity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensitive periods are epochs during the lifespan within which effects of experience on the brain are particularly strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Knudsen, 2004</xref>). Non-human animal work has established that structural remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bourgeois, 1997</xref>) and the development of local inhibitory neural circuits strongly link to the timing of sensitive periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gianfranceschi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hensch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hensch and Bilimoria, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hensch and Fagiolini, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Takesian and Hensch, 2013</xref>). Early visual experience has been shown to fine-tune local inhibitory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benevento et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chattopadhyaya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gandhi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Toyoizumi et al., 2013</xref>), which dynamically control feedforward excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Tao and Poo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). The end of the sensitive period has been proposed to coincide with the maturation of inhibitory neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hensch, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Wong-Riley, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Within this framework, neural circuit stability following sensitive periods is maintained via a balance between excitatory and inhibitory transmission across multiple spatiotemporal scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Froemke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Haider et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Maffei et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Takesian and Hensch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Such an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) ratio has been studied at different organizational levels, including the synaptic and neuronal levels, as well as for neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Wu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The experience-dependence of local inhibitory circuit tuning in early development is supported by a large body of work in non-human animals. In particular, studies of the mouse visual cortex demonstrated a disrupted tuning of local inhibitory circuits as a consequence of lacking visual experience at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hensch and Fagiolini, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Levelt and Hübener, 2012</xref>). In addition, dark-reared mice have been shown to have increased spontaneous neural firing in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benevento et al., 1992</xref>) and a reduced magnitude of inhibition, particularly in layers II/III of the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Morales et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting an overall higher level of excitation.</p><p>Human neuroimaging studies have similarly demonstrated that visual experience during the first weeks and months of life is crucial for the development of visual neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baroncelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lewis and Maurer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Maurer and Hensch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Röder et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Röder et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Singh et al., 2018</xref>). As studies manipulating visual experience are impossible in human research, much of our understanding of the experience-dependence of visual circuit development comes from patients who underwent a transient period of congenital blindness due to dense bilateral congenital cataracts. If human infants born with dense bilateral cataracts are treated later than a few weeks from birth, they suffer from a permanent reduction of visual acuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Birch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Khanna et al., 2013</xref>), stereovision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Birch et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Tytla et al., 1993</xref>), and impairments in higher level visual functions such as face perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Le Grand et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Putzar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Röder et al., 2013</xref>), coherent motion detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bottari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hadad et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Maurer and Lewis, 2018</xref>), visual temporal processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badde et al., 2020</xref>), and visual feature binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">McKyton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Putzar et al., 2007</xref>). These visual deficits in congenital cataract-reversal individuals have been attributed to altered neural development due to the absence of early visual experience, as individuals who suffered from developmental cataracts do not typically display a comparable severity of visual impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Lewis and Maurer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Sourav et al., 2020</xref>). While the extant literature has reported correlations between structural changes and behavioral outcomes in congenital cataract-reversal individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Feng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Guerreiro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hölig et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Pedersini et al., 2023</xref>), functional brain imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Heitmann et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Rączy et al., 2022</xref>) and electrophysiological research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bottari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Ossandón et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Pant et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Pitchaimuthu et al., 2021</xref>) have started to unravel the neural mechanisms which rely on visual experience during early brain development.</p><p>Resting-state activity measured via fMRI suggested increased excitation in the visual cortex of congenital cataract-reversal individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Rączy et al., 2022</xref>): The amplitude of low frequency (&lt;1 Hz; blood oxygen level-dependent) fluctuations (ALFF) in the visual cortex was increased in congenital cataract-reversal individuals compared to normally sighted controls when they were scanned with their eyes open. Since similar changes were observed in permanently congenitally blind humans, the authors speculated that congenital visual deprivation resulted in an increased E/I ratio of neural circuits due to impaired neural tuning, which was not reinstated after sight restoration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Rączy et al., 2022</xref>). Other studies measured resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and analyzed periodic (alpha oscillations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bottari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Ossandón et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Pant et al., 2023</xref>) as well as aperiodic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Ossandón et al., 2023</xref>). Both measures pointed towards an higher E/I ratio of visual cortex in congenital cataract-reversal individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Ossandón et al., 2023</xref>). In recent research, authors have interpreted the slope of the aperiodic component of the EEG power spectral density function as an indirect indication of the relative level of excitation; the flatter the slope, the higher the assumed E/I ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Lombardi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">McSweeney et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Medel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Molina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Muthukumaraswamy and Liley, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Nanda et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Schaworonkow and Voytek, 2021</xref>). In fact, prospective studies in children have recently reported a flattening of this slope with age, which was interpreted as increasing levels of excitation with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Favaro et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hill et al., 2022</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Ossandón et al., 2023</xref> observed a flatter slope of the aperiodic power spectrum in the high-frequency range (20–40 Hz) but a steeper slope of the low-frequency range (1–19 Hz). This pattern was found in both congenital cataract-reversal individuals, as well as in permanently congenitally blind humans. The low-frequency range has often been associated with inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Lozano-Soldevilla, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Lozano-Soldevilla et al., 2014</xref>). However, it has remained unclear how to reconcile EEG resting-state findings for lower and higher frequency ranges.</p><p>Two studies with permanently congenitally blind humans employed Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to investigate the concentration of both, the inhibitory neurotransmitter Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) and the excitatory neurotransmitters Glutamate/Glutamine (Glx) as proxy measures of visual cortex inhibition and excitation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Coullon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Weaver et al., 2013</xref>). Glutamate/Glutamine concentration was significantly increased in the ‘visual’ cortex of anophthalmic (n=5) compared to normally sighted individuals, suggesting increased excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Coullon et al., 2015</xref>). Preliminary evidence in congenitally permanently blind individuals (n=9) suggested a decreased GABA concentration in the visual cortex compared to normally sighted individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Weaver et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, these MRS studies corroborated the hypothesis that a lack of visual input at birth enhances relative excitation in visual cortex compared to typical brain development. However, the degree to which neurotransmitter levels recover following sight restoration after a phase of congenital blindness, and how they related to electrophysiological activity, remained unclear.</p><p>Here, we filled this gap: we assessed Glutamate/Glutamine (Glx) and GABA+ concentrations using the MEGA-PRESS sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Mescher et al., 1998</xref>) in individuals whose sight had been restored, on average, after 12 years of congenital blindness. The ratio of Glx/GABA+ concentration was used as a proxy for the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gao et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Grent-’t-Jong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Narayan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Steel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Takei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Ten congenital cataract-reversal individuals were compared to age-matched, normally sighted controls at rest. In addition to MRS, EEG was recorded to assess and compare aperiodic activity in the same participants. Participants were tested with their eyes open, eyes closed (MRS and EEG), and while viewing visual stimuli (EEG) which changed in luminance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Pant et al., 2023</xref>), since both neurotransmitter levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kurcyus et al., 2018</xref>) and EEG aperiodic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Ossandón et al., 2023</xref>) systematically varies between these conditions. We predicted an altered visual cortex Glx/GABA+ concentration ratio in the edited MRS signal in congenital cataract-reversal individuals. Since the aperiodic intercept has been linked to broad band neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Manning et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Musall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Winawer et al., 2013</xref>) and based on prior findings suggesting higher excitation in congenital cataract-reversal individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Ossandón et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Rączy et al., 2022</xref>), we predicted a higher intercept as well as an altered slope of the EEG aperiodic component in this group. We further hypothesized that neurotransmitter changes would be concurrent with changes in the slope and intercept of the EEG aperiodic activity in congenital cataract-reversal individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Ossandón et al., 2023</xref>). Finally, we exploratorily assessed the relationship between the MRS and EEG parameters, as well as their possible link to visual deprivation history and visual acuity in congenital cataract-reversal individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We tested two groups of participants. The first group consisted of 10 individuals with a history of dense bilateral congenital cataracts (CC group, 1 female, Mean Age = 25.8 years, Range = 11–43.5). Participants in this group were all recruited at the LV Prasad Eye Institute (Hyderabad, India) and the presence of dense bilateral cataracts at birth was confirmed by ophthalmologists and optometrists based on a combination of the following criteria: clinical diagnosis of bilateral congenital cataract, drawing of the pre-surgery cataract, occlusion of the fundus, nystagmus (a typical consequence of congenital visual deprivation), a family history of bilateral congenital cataracts and a visual acuity of fixating and following light (FFL+) or less prior to surgery, barring cases of absorbed lenses. Absorbed lenses occur specifically in individuals with dense congenital cataracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ehrlich, 1948</xref>) and were diagnosed based on the morphology of the lens, anterior capsule wrinkling, and plaque or thickness of stroma. Prior to cataract surgery, the intactness of the retina is typically checked. Thus, we can exclude major retinal damage as source of group differences.</p><p>Duration of deprivation was calculated as the age of the participant when cataract removal surgery was performed on the first eye.

Due to the spectral overlap of GABA (3.0 ppm) and Glu/Gln (3.75 ppm) with the higher concentration peaks of N-Acetyl Aspartate (NAA) and Creatine (Cr), accurate quantification of GABA and Glu/Gln is challenging. MEGA-PRESS uses spectral editing to obtain these measurements. Spectroscopy data consisted of an edit-ON and an edit-OFF spectrum for each voxel, wherein the ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ refer to whether the frequency of the editing pulse applied is on- or off-resonance with the signal coupled to the GABA complex (applied at approximately 1.9 ppm). Therefore, subtracting repeated acquisitions of the edit-ON and edit-OFF spectra allows for measurement of the magnitude of signals differing in their response to the editing pulse (e.g. GABA), while cancelling out signals that do not (e.g. Cr; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Mescher et al., 1998</xref>). Each MEGA-PRESS scan lasted for 8.5 min and was acquired with the following specifications: TR = 2000ms, TE = 68ms, Voxel size  = 40 mm x 30 mm x 25 mm, 256 averages. Additionally, eight unsuppressed water averages were acquired, allowing all metabolites to be referenced to the tissue water concentration. Concentrations of GABA and Glu/Gln quantified from these acquisitions are respectively referred to as GABA+, due to the presence of macromolecular contaminants in the signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Mullins et al., 2014</xref>), and Glx, due to the combined quantification of the Glu, Gln, and Glutathione peaks.</p><p>Two MRS scans were collected from the visual cortex, centered on the calcarine sulcus of every participant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A prior study with normally sighted individuals suggested that visual cortex Glx and GABA+ concentrations depend on whether the participants were scanned with eyes open or eyes closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kurcyus et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, to ensure any group differences were not potentially driven by differences in eye opening/closure, we tested all participants at rest in two conditions – with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC). Both scans were conducted with regular room illumination, that is, without any explicit visual stimulation.</p><p>To ensure that we were identifying neurochemical changes specific to visual regions, we selected the frontal cortex as a control region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and collected two scans (EO and EC) from the frontal cortex. The order of the MRS scans was counterbalanced across individuals for both locations and conditions. Two SC subjects did not complete the frontal cortex scan for the EO condition and were excluded from the statistical comparisons of frontal cortex neurotransmitter concentrations. Voxel placement was optimized to avoid the inclusion of the meninges, ventricles, skull and subcortical structures. For each participant, a proper placement was ensured by examining the voxel region across the slices in the acquired T1 volume. Saturation bands to nullify the skull signal were placed at the posterior and anterior edge of the visual cortex and frontal cortex voxel, respectively. Due to limitations of the clinical scanner settings, rotated and skewed voxels were not possible, and therefore voxels were not always located precisely parallel to the calcarine. As documented in Appendix 1.2, the visual cortex voxel showed significant (&gt;60%) overlap with the V1-V6 region in every individual participant.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>MRS data analysis</title><p>All data analyses were performed in MATLAB (R2018b, The MathWorks Inc). For MRS data analyses, we used Gannet 3.0, a MATLAB based toolbox specialized for the quantification of GABA+ and Glx from edited spectrum data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Edden et al., 2014</xref>). Following initial data analysis, all datasets were reanalyzed for quantification of NAA, GABA+ and Glx using linear combination modelling with the Osprey toolbox (v. 2.5.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Oeltzschner et al., 2020</xref>) in MATLAB 2024a (Appendix 1.3).

Gannet uses SPM12 to determine the proportion of grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid in each individual participant’s voxel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Penny et al., 2007</xref>). Note that the tissue fraction values did not differ between groups or conditions (all p’s&gt;0.19, see Appendix 1.4). GABA+, Glx and Glx/GABA+ values were compared across groups as proxy measures of inhibition, excitation and E/I ratio, respectively. The use of Glx/GABA+ as a proxy measure of E/I neurotransmission is supported by a study that observed a regional balance between Glx and GABA+ at 3T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Steel et al., 2020</xref>).

NAA forms one of the most prominent peaks in the MR spectrum (2.0 ppm chemical shift).

Mean signal-to-noise ratio values for GABA+ and Glx in all groups and conditions were above 19 in the visual cortex and above 8 in the frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). A recent study has suggested that an SNR value above 3.8 allows for reliable quantification of GABA+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Zöllner et al., 2021</xref>), in conjunction with considering a given study’s sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Mikkelsen et al., 2018</xref>). Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) values, that is, the theoretical lower limit of estimated error, were 30% or lower for NAA quantification in both groups and conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cavassila et al., 2001</xref>). Note that CRLB values above 50% are considered unreliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). In all quality metrics for Glx, GABA+ and NAA our dataset showed higher quality for the visual cortex voxel than for the frontal cortex voxel, irrespective of group (Main effect of region: all p’s&lt;0.004, Appendix 1.6).

After baseline removal, epochs with signals exceeding a threshold of ±120 μV were rejected in order to exclude potential artifacts.

Studies in humans who were born blind due to dense bilateral cataracts, and who had received sight restoration surgery in childhood or as adults, have found limited recovery of both basic visual and higher order visual functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Birch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Röder and Kekunnaya, 2021</xref>). Here, we tested whether neurotransmitter concentrations and electrophysiological markers of cortical E/I ratio depend on early visual experience in humans, and how possible changes in visual cortex E/I ratio relate to sight recovery. First, we employed MRS and assessed Glutamate/Glutamine (Glx) and GABA+ concentrations, as well as their ratio, in the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Shibata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Steel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Takei et al., 2016</xref>). Second, the slope and intercept of the aperiodic resting-state EEG activity with eyes open and closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Muthukumaraswamy and Liley, 2018</xref>), as well as during flickering visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Pant et al., 2023</xref>), were measured over the occipital cortex in the same individuals. The EEG measures allowed us to exploratorily relate neurotransmitter changes to neural activity changes in congenital cataract-reversal individuals.</p><p>We found a lower Glx/GABA+ concentration ratio in the visual cortex of congenital cataract-reversal (CC) individuals as compared to normally sighted controls (SC). Additionally, the slope of the aperiodic EEG power spectrum was steeper for the low-frequency range (1–20 Hz), and its intercept was higher in CC than SC individuals. In the CC group, Glx concentration correlated with the intercept of the aperiodic component during flickering visual stimulation. The Glx/GABA+ concentration ratio during the eyes closed condition predicted visual acuity of CC individuals. Together, the present results provide initial evidence for experience-dependent development of the E/I ratio in the human visual cortex, with consequences for behavior.</p><p>Previous MRS studies in the visual cortex of permanently congenitally blind humans reported higher Glx concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Coullon et al., 2015</xref>) in five anophthalmic humans, and numerically lower GABA concentrations in congenitally blind humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Weaver et al., 2013</xref>) (n=9), as compared to normally sighted individuals. These results were interpreted as suggesting a higher E/I ratio in the visual cortex of permanently congenitally blind humans, which would be consistent with the extant literature on higher BOLD activity in the visual cortices of the same population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bedny, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Rączy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Röder and Kekunnaya, 2022</xref>). We observed a lower Glx/GABA+ ratio and a steeper slope of the aperiodic EEG activity (1–20 Hz) at occipital electrodes, both of which suggest a lower rather than higher E/I ratio in the visual cortex of CC individuals. Here, we speculate that our results imply a change in neurotransmitter concentrations as a consequence of <italic>restoring</italic> vision following congenital blindness. Further, we hypothesize that due to limited structural plasticity after a phase of congenital blindness, the neural circuits of CC individuals, which had adapted to blindness after birth, likely employ physiological plasticity mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Knudsen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Mower et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Röder et al., 2021</xref>), in order to re-adapt to the newly available visual excitation following sight restoration later in life.</p><p>Structural remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bourgeois and Rakic, 1996</xref>) for typical E/I balance requires visual experience following birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hensch and Fagiolini, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Takesian and Hensch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and is linked to a sensitive period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Desai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hensch and Fagiolini, 2005b</xref>). A repeatedly documented finding in permanently congenitally blind humans is the increased thickness of visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anurova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hölig et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>). These structural changes in permanently congenitally blind individuals were interpreted as a lack of experience-dependent pruning of exuberant synapses and/or reduced myelination, the latter typically leading to a shift of the grey-white matter boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Natu et al., 2019</xref>). In parallel, it was observed in non-human primates that the overproduction of synapses during the initial phase of brain development was independent of experience, but that synaptic pruning, predominantly of excitatory synapses, depended on visual experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bourgeois and Rakic, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bourgeois et al., 1989</xref>). The lack of excitatory synapse pruning was thought to underlie the observed higher excitability of visual cortex due to congenital visual deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benevento et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Morales et al., 2002</xref>). Crucially, increased visual cortex thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Feng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Guerreiro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hölig et al., 2023</xref>) and higher BOLD activity during rest with the eyes open <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Rączy et al., 2022</xref> have been observed for CC individuals following congenital blindness, suggesting incomplete recovery of cortical structure and function <italic>after</italic> sight restoration in humans. Thus, the restored feedforward drive to visual cortex after cataract removal surgery might reach a visual cortex with a lower threshold for excitation.</p><p>As to the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first assessing MRS markers of cortical excitation in humans following sight restoration after congenital blindness, we allude to non-human animal work for the interpretation of our findings. Such studies have often demonstrated that excitation and inhibition go hand-in-hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Froemke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Haider et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Tao and Poo, 2005</xref>). Analogously, we speculate that an overall reduction in Glx/GABA ratio might be effective in counteracting the aforementioned adaptations to congenital blindness, that is a lower threshold for excitation. Higher overall visual cortex excitation as a consequence of congenital blindness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benevento et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Morales et al., 2002</xref>) might come with the risk of runaway excitation in the presence of restored visually-elicited excitation. Phrased differently, we postulate that significantly lowering overall excitation of an originally hyper-excited visual cortex (during the phase of blindness) after sight restoration might be instrumental for maintaining neural circuit stability. Evidence for such homeostatic adjustments comes from studies with normally sighted humans that observed a reduction of GABA concentrations in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Lunghi et al., 2015</xref>) and an increase in the BOLD response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Binda et al., 2018</xref> following monocular blindfolding. Further, studies in adult mice have provided support for a homeostatic adjustment of the E/I ratio following prolonged changes in neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Goel and Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Keck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Whitt et al., 2014</xref>). For example, a long period of decreased activity following enucleation in adult mice commensurately decreased inhibitory drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Keck et al., 2011</xref>), primarily onto excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>). In line with the lowered Glx/GABA+ ratio being a compensatory measure to prevent runaway excitation during visual stimulation, the link between the Glx/GABA+ ratio during eye closure and visual acuity in an exploratory correlation analysis suggests that the more successful such assumed downregulation of the E/I ratio in visual cortex, the better the visual recovery. In fact, this correlation with visual acuity recovery is reminiscent of a previously reported correlation in a larger group of CC individuals, between decreased visual cortex thickness and better visual acuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hölig et al., 2023</xref>). Hence, CC individuals with more advanced structural normalization appear to have a better starting point for functional recovery, the latter possibly mediated by physiological plasticity. Yet, future work has to explicitly test these hypotheses.</p><p>An increased intercept of the aperiodic component of occipital EEG activity was observed in the same CC individuals who underwent MRS assessment, irrespective of condition, that is, during rest with eyes open and eyes closed, as well as during flickering stimulation. The intercept of the aperiodic component has been linked to overall neuronal spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Manning et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Musall et al., 2014</xref>) and fMRI BOLD activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Winawer et al., 2013</xref>). The higher aperiodic intercept may therefore signal increased spontaneous spiking activity in the visual cortex of CC individuals. This interpretation would be consistent with the previously observed increase in visual cortex BOLD activity of CC compared to SC individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Rączy et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In CC individuals, the intercept of the aperiodic activity was highly correlated with the Glx concentration during rest with eyes open and during flickering stimulation. This exploratory finding needs replication in a larger sample. If reliable, the correlation between the EEG aperiodic intercept and Glx concentration in CC individuals might indicate more broadband firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Manning et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Winawer et al., 2013</xref>) in CC than SC individuals during active and passive visual stimulation.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>The sample size of the present study was rather high for rare population of carefully diagnosed CC individuals, but undoubtedly overall small. Access to CC individuals was limited by the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, all the group differences, the exploratory correlations with visual history metrics, and between MRS-EEG parameters, are reported for further investigation in a larger sample. Moreover, our speculative accounts for the present findings need to be validated with pre- and post-surgery assessments. Finally, a comparison of CC individuals with a control group of developmental cataract-reversal individuals would be instrumental to test the hypothesis that the observed group differences are specific to early brain development.</p><p>We are aware that MRS and EEG has a low spatial specificity. Moreover, MRS measures do not allow us to distinguish between presynaptic, postsynaptic and vesicular neurotransmitter concentrations. However, all reported group differences in MRS and EEG parameters were specific to visual cortex and were not found for the frontal control voxel or at frontal electrodes, respectively. While data quality was lower for the frontal compared to the visual cortex voxels, as has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Juchem and de Graaf, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Rideaux et al., 2022</xref>), this was not an issue for the EEG recordings. Thus, lower sensitivity of frontal measures cannot easily explain the lack of group differences for frontal measures. Crucially, data quality did not differ between groups.</p><p>While interpretations of new data in the absence of similar data sets are necessarily speculative, the validity of the neurochemical findings was supported by quality assessments; phantom testing showed high correlations between the experimentally varied metabolite concentrations and the extracted GABA+ and Glx concentrations (Appendix 1.3). The neurochemical results were robust to analysis pipelines (Appendix 1.3) as well as normalization method (Appendix 1.5). The EEG results from the present group of CC individuals replicated effects observed in a larger sample of 28 additional CC individuals (Appendix 1.18; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Ossandón et al., 2023</xref>), as well as prior findings from another sample reporting lower alpha power (Appendix 1.19; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bottari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Pant et al., 2023</xref>). Further, the aperiodic intercept of EEG activity decreased with chronological age irrespective of group or condition, replicating earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hill et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Voytek et al., 2015</xref>) (Appendix 1.15). Finally, group differences were observed despite the considerable variance of blindness duration and time since surgery, demonstrating the crucial role of early visual experience.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study in sight recovery individuals with a history of congenital blindness indicates that E/I balance is a result of early experience and crucial for human behavior.

First, the visual ROI mask was obtained using the Anatomy toolbox in SPM 12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Eickhoff et al., 2005</xref>), including all areas V1-V6 of the occipital lobe. This mask was aligned, co-registered and resliced to every subject’s T1 scan. Subsequently, the proportion of vertices in the MRS visual cortex voxel mask (as generated by Gannet 3.0 using SPM 12) overlapping with the T1-aligned occipital lobe mask of each participant was calculated as a percentage of the total number of vertices in the MRS visual cortex voxel. The percentage overlap in both groups did not significantly differ (Mean CC = 67.1%, Mean SC = 70%, t(18) = –1.14, p=0.269).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>1.3.

Osprey is an open-source toolbox which uses linear combination modelling for analysis of MEGA-PRESS as well as PRESS datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Oeltzschner et al., 2020</xref>).

Cr is often used as an internal reference as its concentration is relatively stable in most brain regions. Similar to the water-normalized values, a lower Glx/GABA+ concentration ratio was observed in the visual cortex of CC than SC individuals with Cr-normalization (Main effect of group: F(1,39) = 5.80, p=0.021, η<sub>p</sub>²=0.14), regardless of eye opening or eye closure (Main effect of condition: F(1,39) = 2.29, p=0.138, η<sub>p</sub>²=0.06, Group-by-condition interaction: F(1,39) = 1.15, p=0.290, η<sub>p</sub>²=0.03) (Figure S22).

They attempted to do so by comparing neurochemistry conditions ('eyes open', 'eyes closed') and resting state, and visually evoked EEG activity between ten congenital cataract patients with recovered sight (CC), and ten age-matched control participants (SC) with normal sight. First, they used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure in vivo neurochemistry from two locations, the primary location of interest in the visual cortex, and a control location in the frontal cortex. Such voxels are used to provide a control for the spatial specificity of any effects because the single-voxel MRS method provides a single sampling location. Using MR-visible proxies of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, Glx and GABA+ respectively, the authors report no group effects in GABA+ or Glx, no difference in the functional conditions 'eyes closed' and 'eyes open'. They found an effect of group in the ratio of Glx/GABA+ and no similar effect in the control voxel location. They then perform multiple exploratory correlations between MRS measures and visual acuity and report a weak positive correlation between the 'eyes open' condition and visual acuity in CC participants. The same participants then took part in an EEG experiment. The authors selected two electrodes placed in the visual cortex for analysis and report a group difference in an EEG index of neural activity, the aperiodic intercept, as well as the aperiodic slope, considered a proxy for cortical inhibition. Control electrodes in the frontal region did not present with the same pattern. They report an exploratory correlation between the aperiodic intercept and Glx in one out of three EEG conditions.</p><p>The authors report the difference in E/I ratio and interpret the lower E/I ratio as representing an adaptation to visual deprivation, which would have initially caused a higher E/I ratio. Although intriguing, the strength of evidence in support of this view is not strong. Amongst the limitations are the low sample size, a critical control cohort that could provide evidence for higher E/I ratio in CC patients without recovered sight for example, and lower data quality in the control voxel. Nevertheless, the study provides a rare and valuable insight into experience-dependent plasticity in the human brain.</p><p>Strengths of study</p><p>How sensitive period experience shapes the developing brain is an enduring and important question in neuroscience. This question has been particularly difficult to investigate in humans. The authors recruited a small number of sight-recovered participants with bilateral congenital cataracts to investigate the effect of sensitive period deprivation on the balance of excitation and inhibition in the visual brain using measures of brain chemistry and brain electrophysiology. The research is novel, and the paper was interesting and well-written.</p><p>Limitations</p><p>Low sample size. Ten for CC and ten for SC, and further two SC participants were rejected due to lack of frontal control voxel data. The sample size limits the statistical power of the dataset and increases the likelihood of effect inflation.</p><p>In the updated manuscript, the authors have provided justification for their sample size by pointing to prior studies and the inherent difficulties in recruiting individuals with bilateral congenital cataracts. Importantly, this highlights the value the study brings to the field while also acknowledging the need to replicate the effects in a larger cohort.</p><p>Lack of specific control cohort. The control cohort has normal vision. The control cohort is not specific enough to distinguish between people with sight loss due to different causes and patients with congenital cataracts with co-morbidities. Further data from a more specific populations, such as patients whose cataracts have not been removed, with developmental cataracts, or congenitally blind participants, would greatly improve the interpretability of the main finding. The lack of a more specific control cohort is a major caveat that limits a conclusive interpretation of the results.</p><p>In the updated version, the authors have indicated that future studies can pursue comparisons between congenital cataract participants and cohorts with later sight loss.</p><p>MRS data quality differences. Data quality in the control voxel appears worse than in the visual cortex voxel. The frontal cortex MRS spectrum shows far broader linewidth than the visual cortex (Supplementary Figures). Compared to the visual voxel, the frontal cortex voxel has less defined Glx and GABA+ peaks; lower GABA+ and Glx concentrations, lower NAA SNR values; lower NAA concentrations. If the data quality is a lot worse in the FC, then small effects may not be detectable.</p><p>In the updated version, the authors have added more information that informs the reader of the MRS quality differences between voxel locations. This increases the transparency of their reporting and enhances the assessment of the results.</p><p>Because of the direction of the difference in E/I, the authors interpret their findings as representing signatures of sight improvement after surgery without further evidence, either within the study or from the literature. However, the literature suggests that plasticity and visual deprivation drives the E/I index up rather than down. Decreasing GABA+ is thought to facilitate experience dependent remodelling. What evidence is there that cortical inhibition increases in response to a visual cortex that is over-sensitised to due congenital cataracts? Without further experimental or literature support this interpretation remains very speculative.</p><p>The updated manuscript contains key reference from non-human work to justify their interpretation.</p><p>Heterogeneity in patient group. Congenital cataract (CC) patients experienced a variety of duration of visual impairment and were of different ages. They presented with co-morbidities (absorbed lens, strabismus, nystagmus). Strabismus has been associated with abnormalities in GABAergic inhibition in the visual cortex. The possible interactions with residual vision and confounds of co-morbidities are not experimentally controlled for in the correlations, and not discussed.</p><p>The updated document has addressed this caveat.</p><p>Multiple exploratory correlations were performed to relate MRS measures to visual acuity (shown in Supplementary Materials), and only specific ones shown in the main document. The authors describe the analysis as exploratory in the 'Methods' section. Furthermore, the correlation between visual acuity and E/I metric is weak, not corrected for multiple comparisons. The results should be presented as preliminary, as no strong conclusions can be made from them. They can provide a hypothesis to test in a future study.</p><p>This has now been done throughout the document and increases the transparency of the reporting.</p><p>P.16 Given the correlation of the aperiodic intercept with age (&quot;Age negatively correlated with the aperiodic intercept across CC and SC individuals, that is, a flattening of the intercept was observed with age&quot;), age needs to be controlled for in the correlation between neurochemistry and the aperiodic intercept. Glx has also been shown to negatively correlates with age.</p><p>This caveat has been addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Multiple exploratory correlations were performed to relate MRS to EEG measures (shown in Supplementary Materials), and only specific ones shown in the main document. Given the multiple measures from the MRS, the correlations with the EEG measures were exploratory, as stated in the text, p.16, and in Fig.4. yet the introduction said that there was a prior hypothesis &quot;We further hypothesized that neurotransmitter changes would relate to changes in the slope and intercept of the EEG aperiodic activity in the same subjects.&quot; It would be great if the text could be revised for consistency and the analysis described as exploratory.</p><p>This has been done throughout the document and increases the transparency of the reporting.</p><p>The analysis for the EEG needs to take more advantage of the available data. As far as I understand, only two electrodes were used, yet far more were available as seen in their previous study (Ossandon et al., 2023). The spatial specificity is not established. The authors could use the frontal cortex electrode (FP1, FP2) signals as a control for spatial specificity in the group effects, or even better, all available electrodes and correct for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, they could use the aperiodic intercept vs Glx in SC to evaluate the specificity of the correlation to CC.</p><p>This caveat has been addressed. The authors have added frontal electrodes to their analysis, providing an essential regional control for the visual cortex location.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>In the first revision, the authors made reasonable adjustments to their manuscript that addressed most of my comments by adding further justification for their methodology, essential literature support, pointing out exploratory analyses, limitations and adding key control analyses. Their revised manuscript was overall improved, providing valuable information, though the evidence that supports their claims is still incomplete.</p><p>In their second revision, the authors pointed to justifications for their analyses, careful interpretation and tempered claims to clarify their response to the initial feedback. However, my assessment of the first revision has not been changed after the second revision, because there were no further modifications of their responses to my feedback.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98143.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The study examined 10 congenitally blind patients who recovered vision through the surgical removal of bilateral dense cataracts, measuring neural activity and neuro chemical profiles from the visual cortex. The declared aim is to test whether restoring visual function after years of complete blindness impacts excitation/inhibition balance in the visual cortex. The manuscript reports precious behavioural, electrophysiological and magnetic resonance data from a rare population. Although the findings are useful for stimulating further research in the field, they only provide incomplete support to the authors' claims.</p><p>The main claim is that sight recovery impacts the excitation/inhibition balance in the visual cortex; however, the paradigm does not allow to distinguish the effects of sight recovery from those of visual deprivation (i.e. in patients who were born blind but recovered vision after several months/years vs. patients who were born blind and never recovered vision); moreover, the link between electrophysiological findings and cortical excitation/inhibition is tentative and its interpretation remains speculative.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The findings are undoubtedly useful for the community, as they contribute towards characterising the many ways in which this special population differs from normally sighted individuals.

Ten individuals with reversed congenital cataracts were compared to age-matched, normally sighted controls, assessing the cortical E/I balance and its interrelationship and to visual acuity. The study reveals that the Glx/GABA ratio in the visual cortex and the intercept and aperiodic signal are significantly altered in those with a history of early visual deprivation, suggesting persistent neurophysiological changes despite visual restoration. First of all, I would like to disclose that I am not an expert in congenital visual deprivation, nor in MRS. My expertise is in EEG (particularly in the decomposition of periodic and aperiodic activity) and statistical methods. Second, although the authors addressed some of my concerns on the previous version of this manuscript, major concerns and flaws remain in terms of methodological and statistical approaches along with the (over) interpretation of the results.</p><p>Persistent specific concerns include:</p><p>(1 3.1) Response to Variability in Visual Deprivation</p><p>Rather than listing the advantages and disadvantages of visual deprivation, I recommend providing at least a descriptive analysis of how the duration of visual deprivation influenced the measures of interest.

The justification that previous studies employed similar sample sizes does not adequately address the limitation in the current study. I strongly suggest that the correlation analyses should not feature prominently in the main manuscript or the abstract, especially if the discussion does not substantially rely on these correlations. Please also revisit the recommendations made in the section on statistical concerns.</p><p>(3 3.3) Statistical Concerns</p><p>While I appreciate the effort of conducting an independent statistical check, it merely validates whether the reported statistical parameters, degrees of freedom (df), and p-values are consistent. However, this does not address the appropriateness of the chosen statistical methods.</p><p>Several points require clarification or improvement:</p><p>(4) Correlation Methods: The manuscript does not specify whether the reported correlation analyses are based on Pearson or Spearman correlation.</p><p>This has been addressed in the final revision</p><p>(5) Confidence Intervals: Include confidence intervals for correlations to represent the uncertainty associated with these estimates.</p><p>This has been addressed in the final revision</p><p>(6) Permutation Statistics: Given the small sample size, I recommend using permutation statistics, as these are exact tests and more appropriate for small datasets.</p><p>(7) Adjusted P-Values: Ensure that reported Bonferroni corrected p-values (e.g., p &gt; 0.999) are clearly labeled as adjusted p-values where applicable.</p><p>This has been addressed in the final revision</p><p>(8) Figure 2C</p><p>Figure 2C still lacks crucial information that the correlation between Glx/GABA ratio and visual acuity was computed solely in the control group (as described in the rebuttal letter).

This choice conflates subsequent spectral analyses due to aliasing issues, as explained by the Nyquist theorem. While the authors cite prior studies (Schwenk et al., 2020; VanRullen &amp; MacDonald, 2012) to justify this decision, these studies focused on alpha (8-12 Hz), where aliasing is less of a concern compared of analyzing aperiodic signal. Furthermore, in contrast, the current study analyzes the frequency range from 1-20 Hz, which is too narrow for interpreting the aperiodic signal asE/I. Typically, this analysis should include higher frequencies, spanning at least 1-30 Hz oreven 1-45 Hz (not 20-40 Hz).</p><p>(13) Baseline Removal: Subtracting the mean activity across an epoch as a baseline removal step is inappropriate for resting-state EEG data. This preprocessing step undermines the validity of the analysis. The EEG dataset has fundamental flaws, many of which were pointed out in the previous review round but remain unaddressed. In its current form, the manuscript falls short of standards for robust EEG analysis.</p><p>(14) The authors mention: &quot;The EEG data sets reported here were part of data published earlier (Ossandón et al.,2023; Pant et al., 2023).&quot; Thus, the statement &quot;The group differences for the EEG assessments corresponded to those of a larger sample of CC individuals (n=38) &quot; is a circular argument and should be avoided.&quot;</p><p>The authors addressed this comment and adjusted the statement. However, I do not understand, why the full sample published earlier (Ossandón et al., 2023) was not used in the current study?</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The current version of the manuscript is almost unchanged compared to the last version. Unfortunately, I observed that the authors have not adequately addressed most of my previous suggestions; rather, they provided justifications for not incorporating them.</p><p>Given this, I do not see the need to modify my initial assessment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98143.4.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pant</surname><given-names>Rashi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00g30e956</institution-id><institution>Universität Hamburg</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hamburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pitchaimuthu</surname><given-names>Kabilan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Linnaeus University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kalmar</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ossandón</surname><given-names>José P</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Hamburg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hamburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shareef</surname><given-names>Idris</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Nevada Reno</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Reno</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lingareddy</surname><given-names>Sunitha</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lucid Medical Diagnostics</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hyderabad</named-content></addr-line><country>India</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Finsterbusch</surname><given-names>Jurgen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hamburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kekunnaya</surname><given-names>Ramesh</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>L V Prasad Eye Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hyderabad</named-content></addr-line><country>India</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Röder</surname><given-names>Brigitte</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Hamburg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hamburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p><p>This neuroimaging and electrophysiology study in a small cohort of congenital cataract patients with sight recovery aims to characterize the effects of early visual deprivation on excitatory and inhibitory balance in visual cortex. While contrasting sight-recovery with visually intact controls suggested the existence of persistent alterations in Glx/GABA ratio and aperiodic EEG signals, it provided only incomplete evidence supporting claims about the effects of early deprivation itself. The reported data were considered valuable, given the rare study population. However, the small sample sizes, lack of a specific control cohort and multiple methodological limitations will likely restrict usefulness to scientists working in this particular subfield.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewing editors for their consideration and updated assessment of our manuscript after its first revision.</p><p>In order to assess the effects of early deprivation, we included an age-matched, normally sighted control group recruited from the same community, measured in the same scanner and laboratory. This study design is analogous to numerous studies in permanently congenitally blind humans, which typically recruited sighted controls, but hardly ever individuals with a different, e.g. late blindness history. In order to improve the specificity of our conclusions, we used a frontal cortex voxel in addition to a visual cortex voxel (MRS). Analogously, we separately analyzed occipital and frontal electrodes (EEG).</p><p>Moreover, we relate our findings in congenital cataract reversal individuals to findings in the literature on permanent congenital blindness. Note, there are, to the best of our knowledge, neither MRS nor resting-state EEG studies in individuals with permanent late blindness.</p><p>Our participants necessarily have nystagmus and low visual acuity due to their congenital deprivation phase, and the existence of nystagmus is a recruitment criterion to diagnose congenital cataracts.</p><p>It might be interesting for future studies to investigate individuals with transient late blindness. However, such a study would be ill-motivated had we not found differences between the most “extreme” of congenital visual deprivation conditions and normally sighted individuals (analogous to why earlier research on permanent blindness investigated permanent congenitally blind humans first, rather than permanently late blind humans, or both in the same study). Any result of these future work would need the reference to our study, and neither results in these additional groups would invalidate our findings.</p><p>Since all our congenital cataract reversal individuals by definition had visual impairments, we included an eyes closed condition, both in the MRS and EEG assessment. Any group effect during the eyes closed condition cannot be due to visual acuity deficits changing the bottom-up driven visual activation.</p><p>As we detail in response to review 3, our EEG analyses followed the standards in the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary</p><p>In this human neuroimaging and electrophysiology study, the authors aimed to characterise effects of a period of visual deprivation in the sensitive period on excitatory and inhibitory balance in the visual cortex. They attempted to do so by comparing neurochemistry conditions ('eyes open', 'eyes closed') and resting state, and visually evoked EEG activity between ten congenital cataract patients with recovered sight (CC), and ten age-matched control participants (SC) with normal sight.</p><p>First, they used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure in vivo neurochemistry from two locations, the primary location of interest in the visual cortex, and a control location in the frontal cortex. Such voxels are used to provide a control for the spatial specificity of any effects, because the single-voxel MRS method provides a single sampling location. Using MR-visible proxies of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, Glx and GABA+ respectively, the authors report no group effects in GABA+ or Glx, no difference in the functional conditions 'eyes closed' and 'eyes open'. They found an effect of group in the ratio of Glx/GABA+ and no similar effect in the control voxel location. They then perform multiple exploratory correlations between MRS measures and visual acuity, and report a weak positive correlation between the 'eyes open' condition and visual acuity in CC participants.</p><p>The same participants then took part in an EEG experiment. The authors selected two electrodes placed in the visual cortex for analysis and report a group difference in an EEG index of neural activity, the aperiodic intercept, as well as the aperiodic slope, considered a proxy for cortical inhibition. Control electrodes in the frontal region did not present with the same pattern. They report an exploratory correlation between the aperiodic intercept and Glx in one out of three EEG conditions.</p><p>The authors report the difference in E/I ratio, and interpret the lower E/I ratio as representing an adaptation to visual deprivation, which would have initially caused a higher E/I ratio. Although intriguing, the strength of evidence in support of this view is not strong. Amongst the limitations are the low sample size, a critical control cohort that could provide evidence for higher E/I ratio in CC patients without recovered sight for example, and lower data quality in the control voxel. Nevertheless, the study provides a rare and valuable insight into experience-dependent plasticity in the human brain.</p><p>Strengths of study</p><p>How sensitive period experience shapes the developing brain is an enduring and important question in neuroscience. This question has been particularly difficult to investigate in humans. The authors recruited a small number of sight-recovered participants with bilateral congenital cataracts to investigate the effect of sensitive period deprivation on the balance of excitation and inhibition in the visual brain using measures of brain chemistry and brain electrophysiology. The research is novel, and the paper was interesting and well written.</p><p>Limitations</p><p>Low sample size. Ten for CC and ten for SC, and further two SC participants were rejected due to lack of frontal control voxel data. The sample size limits the statistical power of the dataset and increases the likelihood of effect inflation.</p><p>In the updated manuscript, the authors have provided justification for their sample size by pointing to prior studies and the inherent difficulties in recruiting individuals with bilateral congenital cataracts. Importantly, this highlights the value the study brings to the field while also acknowledging the need to replicate the effects in a larger cohort.</p><p>Lack of specific control cohort. The control cohort has normal vision. The control cohort is not specific enough to distinguish between people with sight loss due to different causes and patients with congenital cataracts with co-morbidities. Further data from a more specific populations, such as patients whose cataracts have not been removed, with developmental cataracts, or congenitally blind participants, would greatly improve the interpretability of the main finding. The lack of a more specific control cohort is a major caveat that limits a conclusive interpretation of the results.</p><p>In the updated version, the authors have indicated that future studies can pursue comparisons between congenital cataract participants and cohorts with later sight loss.</p><p>MRS data quality differences. Data quality in the control voxel appears worse than in the visual cortex voxel. The frontal cortex MRS spectrum shows far broader linewidth than the visual cortex (Supplementary Figures). Compared to the visual voxel, the frontal cortex voxel has less defined Glx and GABA+ peaks; lower GABA+ and Glx concentrations, lower NAA SNR values; lower NAA concentrations. If the data quality is a lot worse in the FC, then small effects may not be detectable.</p><p>In the updated version, the authors have added more information that informs the reader of the MRS quality differences between voxel locations. This increases the transparency of their reporting and enhances the assessment of the results.</p><p>Because of the direction of the difference in E/I, the authors interpret their findings as representing signatures of sight improvement after surgery without further evidence, either within the study or from the literature. However, the literature suggests that plasticity and visual deprivation drives the E/I index up rather than down. Decreasing GABA+ is thought to facilitate experience dependent remodelling. What evidence is there that cortical inhibition increases in response to a visual cortex that is over-sensitised to due congenital cataracts? Without further experimental or literature support this interpretation remains very speculative.</p><p>The updated manuscript contains key reference from non-human work to justify their interpretation.</p><p>Heterogeneity in patient group. Congenital cataract (CC) patients experienced a variety of duration of visual impairment and were of different ages. They presented with co-morbidities (absorbed lens, strabismus, nystagmus). Strabismus has been associated with abnormalities in GABAergic inhibition in the visual cortex. The possible interactions with residual vision and confounds of co-morbidities are not experimentally controlled for in the correlations, and not discussed.</p><p>The updated document has addressed this caveat.</p><p>Multiple exploratory correlations were performed to relate MRS measures to visual acuity (shown in Supplementary Materials), and only specific ones shown in the main document. The authors describe the analysis as exploratory in the 'Methods' section. Furthermore, the correlation between visual acuity and E/I metric is weak, not corrected for multiple comparisons. The results should be presented as preliminary, as no strong conclusions can be made from them. They can provide a hypothesis to test in a future study.</p><p>This has now been done throughout the document and increases the transparency of the reporting.</p><p>P.16 Given the correlation of the aperiodic intercept with age (&quot;Age negatively correlated with the aperiodic intercept across CC and SC individuals, that is, a flattening of the intercept was observed with age&quot;), age needs to be controlled for in the correlation between neurochemistry and the aperiodic intercept. Glx has also been shown to negatively correlates with age.</p><p>This caveat has been addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Multiple exploratory correlations were performed to relate MRS to EEG measures (shown in Supplementary Materials), and only specific ones shown in the main document. Given the multiple measures from the MRS, the correlations with the EEG measures were exploratory, as stated in the text, p.16, and in Fig.4. yet the introduction said that there was a prior hypothesis &quot;We further hypothesized that neurotransmitter changes would relate to changes in the slope and intercept of the EEG aperiodic activity in the same subjects.&quot; It would be great if the text could be revised for consistency and the analysis described as exploratory.</p><p>This has been done throughout the document and increases the transparency of the reporting.</p><p>The analysis for the EEG needs to take more advantage of the available data. As far as I understand, only two electrodes were used, yet far more were available as seen in their previous study (Ossandon et al., 2023). The spatial specificity is not established. The authors could use the frontal cortex electrode (FP1, FP2) signals as a control for spatial specificity in the group effects, or even better, all available electrodes and correct for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, they could use the aperiodic intercept vs Glx in SC to evaluate the specificity of the correlation to CC.</p><p>This caveat has been addressed. The authors have added frontal electrodes to their analysis, providing an essential regional control for the visual cortex location.</p><p>Comments on the latest version:</p><p>The authors have made reasonable adjustments to their manuscript that addressed most of my comments by adding further justification for their methodology, essential literature support, pointing out exploratory analyses, limitations and adding key control analyses. Their revised manuscript has overall improved, providing valuable information, though the evidence that supports their claims is still incomplete.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting ways to improve our manuscript and carefully reassessing our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study examined 10 congenitally blind patients who recovered vision through the surgical removal of bilateral dense cataracts, measuring neural activity and neuro chemical profiles from the visual cortex.

Importantly, we analyzed the intercept of the aperiodic activity fit as well, and discuss results related to the intercept.</p><p>Quote:</p><p>“(3.4) Interpretation of aperiodic signal:</p><p>- Several recent papers demonstrated that the aperiodic signal measured in EEG or ECoG is related to various important aspects such as age, skull thickness, electrode impedance, as well as cognition. Thus, currently, very little is known about the underlying effects which influence the aperiodic intercept and slope. The entire interpretation of the aperiodic slope as a proxy for E/I is based on a computational model and simulation (as described in the Gao et al. paper).</p><p>Apart from the modeling work from Gao et al., multiple papers which have also been cited which used ECoG, EEG and MEG and showed concomitant changes in aperiodic activity with pharmacological manipulation of the E/I ratio (Colombo et al., 2019; Molina et al., 2020; Muthukumaraswamy &amp; Liley, 2018). Further, several prior studies have interpreted changes in the aperiodic slope as reflective of changes in the E/I ratio, including studies of developmental groups (Favaro et al., 2023; Hill et al., 2022; McSweeney et al., 2023; Schaworonkow &amp; Voytek, 2021) as well as patient groups (Molina et al., 2020; Ostlund et al., 2021).</p><p>- The authors further wrote: We used the slope of the aperiodic (1/f) component of the EEG spectrum as an estimate of E/I ratio (Gao et al., 2017; Medel et al., 2020; Muthukumaraswamy &amp; Liley, 2018). This is a highly speculative interpretation with very little empirical evidence. These papers were conducted with ECoG data (mostly in animals) and mostly under anesthesia. Thus, these studies only allow an indirect interpretation by what the 1/f slope in EEG measurements is actually influenced.</p><p>Note that Muthukumaraswamy et al. (2018) used different types of pharmacological manipulations and analyzed periodic and aperiodic MEG activity in humans, in addition to monkey ECoG (Muthukumaraswamy &amp; Liley, 2018). Further, Medel et al. (now published as Medel et al., 2023) compared EEG activity in addition to ECoG data after propofol administration. The interpretation of our results are in line with a number of recent studies in developing (Hill et al., 2022; Schaworonkow &amp; Voytek, 2021) and special populations using EEG. As mentioned above, several prior studies have used the slope of the 1/f component/aperiodic activity as an indirect measure of the E/I ratio (Favaro et al., 2023; Hill et al., 2022; McSweeney et al., 2023; Molina et al., 2020; Ostlund et al., 2021; Schaworonkow &amp; Voytek, 2021), including studies using scalp-recorded EEG from humans.</p><p>In the introduction of the revised manuscript, we have made more explicit that this metric is indirect (Page 3, Line 91), (additionally see Discussion, Page 24, Lines 644-645, Page 25, Lines 650-657).</p><p>While a full understanding of aperiodic activity needs to be provided, some convergent ideas have emerged. We think that our results contribute to this enterprise, since our study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first which assessed MRS measured neurotransmitter levels and EEG aperiodic activity. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Additionally, the authors state:</p><p>&quot;We cannot think of how any of the exploratory correlations between neurophysiological measures and MRS measures could be accounted for by a difference e.g. in skull thickness.&quot;</p><p>(11) This could be addressed directly by including skull thickness as a covariate or visualizing it in scatterplots, for instance, by representing skull thickness as the size of the dots.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware of any study that would justify such an analysis.</p><p>Our analyses were based on previous findings in the literature.</p><p>Since to the best of our knowledge, no evidence exists that congenital cataracts go together with changes in skull thickness, and that skull thickness might selectively modulate visual cortex Glx/GABA+ but not NAA measures, we decided against following this suggestion.</p><p>Notably, the neurotransmitter concentration reported here is after tissue segmentation of the voxel region. The tissue fraction was shown to not differ between groups in the MRS voxels (Supplementary Material S4). The EEG electrode impedance was lowered to &lt;10 kOhm in every participant (Methods, Page 13, Line 344), and preparation was identical across groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12 3.5) Problems with EEG Preprocessing and Analysis</p><p>Downsampling: The decision to downsample the data to 60 Hz &quot;to match the stimulation rate&quot; is problematic. This choice conflates subsequent spectral analyses due to aliasing issues, as explained by the Nyquist theorem. While the authors cite prior studies (Schwenk et al., 2020; VanRullen &amp; MacDonald, 2012) to justify this decision, these studies focused on alpha (8-12 Hz), where aliasing is less of a concern compared of analyzing aperiodic signal. Furthermore, in contrast, the current study analyzes the frequency range from 1-20 Hz, which is too narrow for interpreting the aperiodic signal as E/I. Typically, this analysis should include higher frequencies, spanning at least 1-30 Hz or even 1-45 Hz (not 20-40 Hz).</p></disp-quote><p>As previously mentied in the Methods (Page 15 Line 376) and the previous response, the pop_resample function used by EEGLAB applies an anti-aliasing filter, at half the resampling frequency (as per the Nyquist theorem <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://eeglab.org/tutorials/05_Preprocess/resampling.html">https://eeglab.org/tutorials/05_Preprocess/resampling.html</ext-link>). The upper cut off of the low pass filter set by EEGlab prior to down sampling (30 Hz) is still far above the frequency of interest in the current study (1-20 Hz), thus allowing us to derive valid results.</p><p>Quote:</p><p>“- The authors downsampled the data to 60Hz to &quot;to match the stimulation rate&quot;.

This paradigm and method was developed by VanRullen and colleagues (Schwenk et al., 2020; Vanrullen &amp; MacDonald, 2012), wherein the analysis requires the same sampling rate between the presented frequencies and the EEG data. The downsampling function used here automatically applies an anti-aliasing filter (EEGLAB 2019) .”</p><p>Moreover, the resting-state data were not resampled to 60 Hz.

We made a principled decision based on the literature (showing a knee in aperiodic fits of this dataset at 20 Hz) (Medel et al., 2023; Ossandón et al., 2023), data quality (possible contamination by line noise at higher frequencies) and the purpose of the visual stimulation experiment (to look at the lower frequency range by stimulating up to 60 Hz, thereby limiting us to quantifying below 30 Hz), that 1-20 Hz would be the fit range in this dataset.</p><p>Quote:</p><p>“(3) What's the underlying idea of analyzing two separate aperiodic slopes (20-40Hz and 1-19Hz). This is very unusual to compute the slope between 20-40 Hz, where the SNR is rather low.</p><p>&quot;Ossandón et al. (2023), however, observed that in addition to the flatter slope of the aperiodic power spectrum in the high frequency range (20-40 Hz), the slope of the low frequency range (1-19 Hz) was steeper in both, congenital cataract-reversal individuals, as well as in permanently congenitally blind humans.&quot;</p><p>The present manuscript computed the slope between 1-20 Hz. Ossandón et al. as well as Medel et al. (2023) found a “knee” of the 1/f distribution at 20 Hz and describe further the motivations for computing both slope ranges. For example, Ossandón et al. used a data driven approach and compared single vs. dual fits and found that the latter fitted the data better. Additionally, they found the best fit if a knee at 20 Hz was used. We would like to point out that no standard range exists for the fitting of the 1/f component across the literature and, in fact, very different ranges have been used (Gao et al., 2017; Medel et al., 2023; Muthukumaraswamy &amp; Liley, 2018). “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Baseline Removal: Subtracting the mean activity across an epoch as a baseline removal step is inappropriate for resting-state EEG data. This preprocessing step undermines the validity of the analysis. The EEG dataset has fundamental flaws, many of which were pointed out in the previous review round but remain unaddressed.

One recent study suggests spurious group differences in the 1/f signal might be driven by an inappropriate dB division baselining method (Gyurkovics et al., 2021), which we did not perform.</p><p>Any effect of our baselining procedure on the FFT spectrum would be below the 1 Hz range, which we did not analyze.</p><p>Each of the preprocessing steps in the manuscript match pipelines described and published in extensive prior work. We document how multiple aspects of our EEG results replicate prior findings (Supplementary Material S15, S18, S19), reports of other experimenters, groups and locations, validating that our results are robust.</p><p>We therefore reject the claim of methodological flaws in our EEG analyses in the strongest possible terms.</p><p>Quote:</p><p>“(3.5) Problems with EEG preprocessing and analysis:</p><p>- It seems that the authors did not identify bad channels nor address the line noise issue (even a problem if a low pass filter of below-the-line noise was applied).</p><p>As pointed out in the methods and Figure 1, we only analyzed data from two occipital channels, O1 and O2 neither of which were rejected for any participant. Channel rejection was performed for the larger dataset, published elsewhere (Ossandón et al., 2023; Pant et al., 2023). As control sites we added the frontal channels FP1 and Fp2 (see Supplementary Material S14)</p><p>Neither Ossandón et al. (2023) nor Pant et al. (2023) considered frequency ranges above 40 Hz to avoid any possible contamination with line noise. Here, we focused on activity between 0 and 20 Hz, definitely excluding line noise contaminations (Methods, Page 14, Lines 365-367). The low pass filter (FIR, 1-45 Hz) guaranteed that any spill-over effects of line noise would be restricted to frequencies just below the upper cutoff frequency.</p><p>Additionally, a prior version of the analysis used spectrum interpolation to remove line noise; the group differences remained stable (Ossandón et al., 2023). We have reported this analysis in the revised manuscript (Page 14, Lines 364-357).</p><p>Further, both groups were measured in the same lab, making line noise (~ 50 Hz) as an account for the observed group effects in the 1-20 Hz frequency range highly unlikely.
