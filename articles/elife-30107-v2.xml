Despite numerous differences in the specific ways in which muscles are formed in these two organisms, there are also remarkable similarities in the fundamental developmental processes that underlie myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roy and VijayRaghavan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bothe and Baylies, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schnorrer et al., 2010</xref>). These similarities are most clearly evident when the mechanisms of myogenesis of the large multifibrillar indirect flight muscles of <italic>Drosophila</italic> are compared to vertebrate skeletal muscles. In both cases, muscle stem cells generated during embryogenesis give rise to a large pool of muscle precursor cells called myoblasts that subsequently fuse and differentiate to produce the multinucleated syncytial cells of the mature muscle. These mechanistic similarities of myogenesis are reflected at the molecular genetic level, in that many of the key genes involved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle development have served as a basis for the identification of comparable genes in vertebrate muscle development (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Srinivas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abmayr and Pavlath, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates, mature skeletal muscle cells can manifest regenerative responses to insults due to injury or degenerative disease. These regenerative events require the action of a small population of tissue specific stem cells referred to as satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bothe and Baylies, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mauro, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brack and Rando, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>). Muscle satellite cells are located between the sarcolemma and the basal lamina of muscle fibers. Although normally quiescent, satellite cells respond to muscle damage by proliferating and producing myoblasts, which differentiate and fuse with the injured muscle cells. Myoblasts generated by satellite cells are also involved in the growth of adult vertebrate muscle. Given the numerous fundamental aspects of muscle stem cell biology and myogenesis that are similar in flies and vertebrates, it is surprising that muscle satellite cells have not been reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Indeed, due to the apparent absence of satellite cells in adult fly muscles, it is unclear if muscle regeneration in response to injury can take place in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>In a previous study, we showed that a small set of embryonically generated muscle-specific stem cells known as AMPs (adult muscle progenitors) give rise post-embryonically to the numerous myoblasts which fuse to form the indirect flight muscles of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gunage et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we show that muscle stem cell lineal descendants are present in the adult as unfused cells which have all the anatomical features of muscle satellite cells. In adult muscle, these unfused cells are located in close proximity to mature muscle fibers and are surrounded by the basal lamina of the fibers. Moreover, although normally quiescent, following muscle injury they undergo Notch signaling-dependent proliferation to generate fusion-competent lineal descendants. In view of these remarkable developmental, morphological and functional features, we consider these cells to be the <italic>Drosophila</italic> equivalent of vertebrate muscle satellite cells. Thus, in flies and vertebrates the muscle stem cell lineage that generates the adult-specific muscles during normal development is also available for adult myogenesis in muscle tissue in response to damage. This finding further opens adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle for the understanding of muscle maintenance, wasting, damage and repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two different types of cells are present in adult flight muscle</title><p>During normal postembryonic development of the indirect flight muscles, a set of approximately 250 mitotically active adult muscle precursors (AMPs) located on the epithelial surface of the wing imaginal disc generates a large number of postmitotic myoblast progeny. These myoblasts subsequently migrate and fuse to form the indirect flight muscles (IFMs) of the adult. The IFMs are composed of the dorso-ventral muscles (DVMs) formed by the de novo fusion of myoblast and the dorsal longitudinal muscles (DLMs) which are formed using remnant larval muscles as templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gunage et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernandes et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dhanyasi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with their developmental origin, which results in a large myoblast pool, the IFMs are large multinucleated cells formed by myoblast fusion. For convenience we focus here on the DLMs. The multinucleate nature of these muscles is evident in confocal optical sections through adult flight muscle fibers labeled by TOPRO (marks all nuclei) and myosin heavy chain (MHC) immunostaining, which marks myofibers. As expected, numerous nuclei, clearly located intra-cellular between individual myofibrils, are seen throughout the muscle fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, A’</xref>, white arrowheads). Interestingly, however, these optical sections also reveal nuclei located peripherally in close proximity to the muscle fiber surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, A’</xref>, green arrowheads).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30107.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Unfused muscle associated cells are present at the surface of adult flight muscles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dorsal longitudinal muscles (DLMs) stained for Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC) (red) to delineate muscle fibrils and TOPRO (Blue) marking nuclei.

To determine the relative numbers of peripherally located unfused cells versus fused differentiated myoblasts, all optical sections (along the z-axis) of the co-labeled adult DLM muscle fibers were scored for cells associated with the surface of the muscle fibers versus cell nuclei located within the flight muscle fibers. These experiments (n = 12) indicate that a DLM muscle fiber has an average of 20 ± 4 unfused cells versus an average of 700 ± 50 fused myoblasts. Hence the ratio of unfused cells to differentiated fused myoblasts is 1:30 implying that the population of surface-associated cells is markedly smaller than the population of fused myoblasts.</p><p>Taken together, these findings indicate that two different types of cells are present in adult muscle. The first comprises the well-characterized population of differentiated myoblasts that have fused to generate the large multinuclear muscle fibers. The second comprises a novel population of small, apparently unfused cells located at the surface of the muscle fibers. In the following, we will refer to these small, unfused muscle fiber-associated cells as <italic>Drosophila</italic> satellite cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ultrastructure of satellite cells in adult flight muscle</title><p>To characterize the morphological features of the close association of satellite cells with the large multinucleated muscle fibers at the ultrastructural level, an electron-microscopic analysis of adult DLM fibers was carried out. In electron micrographs, the mature muscle fibers are large cells containing multiple prominent nuclei, numerous organelles, as well as extensive sets of elongated myofibrils, and are surrounded by a prominent extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition to these typical multinucleated muscle cells, the ultrastructural analysis also shows satellite cells as small, wedge-shaped cells closely apposed to the large multinucleated muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These satellite cells have compact nuclei and small cytoplasmic domains with few organelles. The intact cell membrane of the satellite cells is directly adjacent to the intact muscle cell membrane demonstrating unequivocally that they are not fused with the muscle cells. They do, however, appear to be embedded in the same contiguous extracellular matrix of their adjoining muscle fiber.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30107.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Unfused muscle-associated cells have ultrastructural features of satellite cells.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Transmission electron micrographs of adult flight muscle.

To investigate this, we induced MARCM clones in late larval stages and recovered labeled clones in the adult muscle. In these experiments, Dmef2-Gal4 was used to drive a GFP reporter label, muscle cells were co-labeled using MHC immunostaining, and cell nuclei were co-labeled with TOPRO. Labeled cells in the adult were visualized using confocal microscopy and analyzed in serial stacks of optical sections.</p><p>These clonal labeling experiments reveal the presence of a small number of GFP labeled satellite cell nuclei closely apposed to the surface of the adult muscle fibers. A reconstructed 3D view of optical sections shows that these GFP-positive nuclei are distributed along the entire surface of the muscle fibers and located both at the interface between different muscle fibers and at the surface of individual muscle fibers but not within the muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Note that while the nuclei of differentiated myoblasts within the muscle fiber are also targeted in this MARCM experiment, no clonal UAS-GFP labeling is visible due to the persistent expression of the Gal80 repressor by the unlabeled nuclei in the multinuclear muscle cell. Hence, in these experiments, cell nuclei can only be labeled if their cells are unfused and remain outside of the muscle fiber.</p><p>These clonal MARCM labeling experiments are in accordance with the notion that Drosophila satellite cells are lineal descendants of AMPs, which, in contrast to myoblasts, do not fuse with the mature muscle cells but rather persist as unfused cells in the adult albeit closely associated with the mature muscle fibers.

To document this, we carried out an analysis of Zfh1 expression at different time points during DLM development in representative pupal stages.</p><p>Indirect flight muscle development during pupal stages has been characterized in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernandes et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roy and VijayRaghavan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bate et al., 1991</xref>). During the earliest pupal stages at the onset of metamorphosis, the AMP-descendent myoblasts are still located on the third instar wing disc notum. Subsequently, these myoblasts migrate from the wing disc and begin to swarm over a set of persistent larval muscles referred to as DLM templates that act as scaffolds for the developing DLMs. By 20 hr after puparium formation (APF) numerous myoblasts are present around and between the six DLM templates, fusion of myoblasts with these transformed DLM templates is ongoing, and myoblast nuclei are observed inside the developing DLMs. By 30 hr APF, most myoblasts have fused with the DLMs and by 36 hr APF, myogenesis of the adult DLM muscle is essentially complete.</p><p>Immunolabeling experiments show that at 20 hr APF all of the nuclei of myoblasts around and in between the DLM templates express Zfh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). Moreover, the nuclei that are located inside the DLM templates due to the fusion of their myoblasts with the templates also express Zfh1. Thus, at this pupal stage, most if not all the nuclei of the AMP lineage myoblasts, be they fused within DLM templates or unfused outside of these templates, continue to express Zfh1 comparable to the situation in larval stages (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, by 30 hr APF a dramatic change in the number and location of Zfh1 expressing cell nuclei has occurred. Zfh1 expression is only seen in a very small number of unfused cell nuclei located outside, albeit closely apposed to, the DLM muscle fiber templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>). None of the nuclei located inside of the developing DLM muscle fibers express Zfh1. Thus, by 30 hr APF, when myoblast fusion is largely complete and myofibrils become visible in the muscle, Zfh1 expression has become restricted to a small number of unfused AMP lineal cells comparable to the situation in the adult, in which the only AMP lineal descendants that continue to express Zfh1 are the unfused satellite cells.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30107.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Pattern of Zfh1 expression in AMP lineal cells at 20 hr and 30 hr APF.</title><p>Zfh1 immunolabeling (green) of unfused myoblasts and of myoblasts that have fused with DLM templates, co-labeled with Phalloidin (red) and TOPRO (blue).

At 24 hr after muscle injury, most of the labeled cell nuclei were both RFP positive and GFP positive (i.e. yellow), signifying both real-time and lineage-dependent previous activity of the Zfh1-Gal4 driver in these cells. Moreover, as expected for Zfh1-labeled cells in adult muscle, all of these were located at the muscle fiber surface (see above). Similar findings were obtained at 48 hr after muscle injury; both RFP-positive and GFP-positive cell nuclei were manifest at the muscle surface, while none were seen inside the bulk of DLMs. In contrast, 1 week after injury, labeled cells that appeared to be located inside muscle fibers were observed. Thus, in addition to RFP-positive and GFP-positive cell nuclei located at the surface of the muscle, GFP-positive nuclei indicative of lineage-specific previous activity of the Zfh1-Gal4 driver appeared to be positioned inside muscle fibers, albeit very close to their surface.

To investigate the possibility that Zfh1 lineal progeny might have fused with mature DLMs after injury, we repeated these G-trace experiments in the background of alpha Spectrin immunolabeling. Alpha Spectrin is a plasma-membrane-associated protein that marks muscle cell boundaries and can also be seen at low levels in the cytoplasm of DLMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">LaBeau-DiMenna et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In age matched, uninjured animals with G-trace induced in the adult stage, Zfh1 lineage cell nuclei that are both RFP positive and GFP positive can be seen closely associated with surface of the DLM as delimited by alpha Spectrin labeling but clearly located outside of the muscle cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>).

A quantification of this reduction in PH-3-labeled satellite is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13C</xref>. Comparable results were obtained when a dominant negative form of Delta was expressed using the Act88F driver in injured muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13C</xref>). These findings indicate that Delta expression in muscle fibers is required for the induction of injury-dependent mitotic activity of satellite cells.</p><p>To determine if Notch expression in satellite cells is similarly required for injury induced mitotic activity of satellite cells; comparable PH-3 labeling experiments were carried out using a temperature sensitive Notch allele. A quantification of the number of PH-3-labeled cells in the injured muscle of Notch temperature-sensitive allele flies at permissive (17°C) versus restrictive (29°C) temperature is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>. While numerous satellite cells were PH-3 positive at the permissive temperature, at the restrictive temperature only few cells were PH-3-positive. (Similar results were obtained by using the chemical inhibitor DAPT, a gamma-Secretase inhibitor, to block Notch pathway activity; data not shown). This finding was confirmed in Dmef2-driven Notch-RNAi knockdown experiments, in which the knockdown was restricted to adult stages via Gal80-ts repressor; a dramatic reduction of PH-3-labeled cell number in injured muscle fibers as compared to controls was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13E</xref>). These findings imply that functional Notch expression in the satellite cells is indeed required for injury-induced proliferation of the satellite cells population</p><p>Taken together with the previously mentioned experiments, our findings are in accordance with a model in which lineal descendants of muscle stem cell-like AMPs are present in adult muscle as muscle fiber apposed satellite cells. Although normally quiescent, following muscle fiber injury these satellite cells become mitotically active, engage in Notch-Delta signaling-dependent proliferative activity and generate lineal descendant cell populations, which can fuse with the injured muscle fiber.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The identification and characterization of satellite cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> indicates that muscle stem cell lineages act not only in the development of flight muscle as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gunage et al., 2014</xref>), but also have a role in the mature muscle of the adult. Thus, comparable to the situation in vertebrates, the Drosophila satellite cells are lineal descendants of the muscle-specific stem cell-like AMPs generated during embryogenesis, become intimately associated with adult muscle fibers and remain quiescent under normal circumstances. Following muscle injury, these Zfh1-expressing cells engage in Notch-Delta signaling-dependent proliferative activity and generate lineal descendant progeny that can fuse with the injured fibers. With improved immune-EM staining protocols on <italic>Drosophila</italic> DLMs, visualizing Zfh1 expression in these cells at the ultrastructural level will prove valuable.</p><p>Previous work has shown a role of Zfh1 in other developmental and maintenance processes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Thus, loss of Zfh1 function leads to defects in <italic>Drosophila</italic> somatic muscle, heart and gonad development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sellin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lai et al., 1993</xref>). Adult germline stem cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> testes, require Zfh1 for stem cell maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leatherman and Dinardo, 2008</xref>). Zfh1 is also known to control neural lineages in a Notch-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee and Lundell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garces and Thor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Su et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, Zfh1 acts near the top of a transcription factor cascade that influences hematopoesis beginning in embryos and continuing in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frandsen et al., 2008</xref>). Evidently, Zfh1 expression is associated with the development, maintenace and differentiation of stem cells in multiple tissues across the lifespan of <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>The mammalian homologs of Zfh1 known as ZEB1 and ZEB2 have been largely studied for their role in cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vandewalle et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, the ZEB family protein ZEB2, controls adult hematopoetic differentiation in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Postigo and Dean, 2000</xref>). Direct functional analyses of ZEB, in mammalian muscles are restricted to C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Postigo and Dean, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fontemaggi et al., 2001</xref>). In all cases, ZEB expression was found to inhibit differentiation of myoblasts. In view of these results, our findings in Drosophila motivate a deeper look into ZEB function in muscle development in mammals.</p><p>The remarkable similarities in lineage, structure and function of satellite cells in flies and vertebrates imply that the role of these adult-specific muscle stem cells is evolutionarily conserved and, hence, is likely to be manifest in other animals as well. Recently, satellite cells have been identified in a crustacean (Parhyale hawaiensis) during limb regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Konstantinides and Averof, 2014</xref>). It will now be interesting to determine if comparable satellite cells are also present in adult musculature of other key protostome and deuterostome invertebrate phyla such as molluscs, annelids and echinoderms.</p><p>In vertebrates, satellite cells can undergo symmetric divisions which expand the stem cell pool and asymmetric divisions in which they self-renew and also generate daughter cells that differentiate into the fusion-competent myoblasts required for muscle regeneration and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abmayr and Pavlath, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, symmetric and asymmetric division modes are seen during development in the muscle stem cell-like AMPs. Notch signaling controls the initial amplification of AMPs through symmetric divisions, the switch to asymmetric divisions is mediated by Wingless regulated Numb expression in the AMP lineage, and in both cases, the wing imaginal disc acting as a niche provides critical ligands for these signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gunage et al., 2014</xref>). It will important to determine if fly satellite cells, as lineal descendants of AMPs, manifest similar cellular and molecular features in their proliferative response to muscle injury and, thus, recapitulate myogenic developmental mechanisms in the regenerative response of adult muscle. It will also be important to investigate if the mature muscle acts as a niche in this process.</p><p>We show that proliferation of Zfh1 expressing cells in DLMs is rapid and extensive in response to stab wounds. We also show that first instances of fusion are seen removed in time from this burst of proliferation. Such a delay between satellite cell proliferation and fusion is puzzling and is also seen in vertebrates. We speculate that satellite cell fusion in this paradigm may serve as a later step in a regenerative process initiated soon after injury, possibly through signaling between injured muscle fibers and satellite cells. Further investigations characterizing the molecular and physical events in DLM repair are likely to clarify our understanding of this process and the system we have developed allows such directions to be explored.</p><p>Drosophila has proven to be a powerful genetic model system for unraveling the fundamental mechanisms of muscle development and stem cell biology, and in both respects many of the findings obtained in the fly have been important for the analysis of corresponding mechanisms in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abmayr and Pavlath, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roy and VijayRaghavan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Egger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Homem and Knoblich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang and Reichert, 2013</xref>). With the identification of satellite cells in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the wealth of classical and molecular genetic tools available in this model system can now be applied to the mechanistic analysis adult-specific stem cell action in myogenic homeostasis and repair. Given the understanding of various fusion molecules involved in early stages of myogenesis, it will also be interesting to investigate a possible conservation of the fusion molecular machinery for regeneration and repair in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dhanyasi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haralalka and Abmayr, 2010</xref>). Finally, in view of the evidence for age and disease-related decline in satellite cell number and function in humans (e.g.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang and Rudnicki, 2014</xref>), this type of analysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> may provide useful information for insight into human muscle pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains, genetics and MARCM</title><p>Fly stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Centre (Indiana, USA) and were grown on standard cornmeal medium at 25°C.</p><p>For MARCM experiments mentioned in flies of genotype Hsflp/Hsflp; FRT 42B, Tub Gal80 were crossed to +; FRT 42B, UAS GFP/CyO Act-GFP; Dmef2-Gal4.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Newly identified satellite cells respond to damage through Notch-Delta signaling to fuse with adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscles&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All reviewers agree that the identification of satellite cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is potentially exciting. However, they feel that the work is preliminary and not well substantiated by the quality of the data presented. Please see reviewers' comments for specific suggestions.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this paper, the authors extended their previous characterization of muscle-specific stem cells in fly development by presenting evidence that the descendants of these stem cells in adult flies similarly as vertebrate muscle satellite cells. This conclusion would be highly significant if substantiated. While the authors have presented some evidence to show that these cells undergo mitosis upon injury, whether their progeny contribute to adult muscle was hard to evaluate, at least based on the GFP data alone. Additional experiments to clearly demarcate these GFP-positive cells as part of the muscle fibres would strengthen the conclusion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their paper the authors attempt to extend their previous findings published in <italic>eLife</italic> that a set of cells known as AMPs, which give rise to muscle during early development, are also capable of acting as satellite cells in the adult.</p><p>As the paper currently stands the data presented are not convincing. No evidence presented for regeneration, let alone regeneration of new tissue that leads to functional tissue. Without more rigorous data, in particular better clonal data, I would not recommend publication. In fact, at this point the data, at best, suggest that the AMP remnants stick around and can divide but do not give rise to any new cells, as has been shown to be the case by Fox and Spradling with the adult hindgut imaginal ring. Below are experiments that would go a long way to proving the author's points. I would strongly encourage the authors to address most of the comments with new, better, and more rigorous experiments rather than arguing them away. Ultimately, either there are or there aren't satellite cells that give rise to new muscle following injury AND are necessary for regeneration. And a publication claiming there are satellite stem cells based on poor quality data, which is later shown to be incorrect would reflect poorly on the authors and <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) How many satellite cells do the authors think there are? What is the ratio between satellite and differentiated cells?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: Without better markers I cannot tell where the GFP labeled cells are.</p><p>3) The EdU data, including methodology, should be included.</p><p>4) How close is panel C to the big hole shown in A?</p><p>5) Why is the GFP so weak/strange looking in E in comparison to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-E</xref>? And the merge in H? There is a lot of GFP that is of equal or more intense than said clones and not associated with anything.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>: Over what area and what percentage of satellite cells? How was the region chosen? Do all satellite cells become mitotically active following injury? 50%? Also, I'm surprised the difference here is only 2 stars.</p><p>7) Why are most of the GFP descendents PH3 positive 24 hours after injury? I would expect only half to be positive since half of the progeny would not be satellite cells, but daughters of satellite cells. Do the authors think the daughters can divide? Or perhaps do the authors think the response by satellite cells takes 24 hours? Does PH3 number go down with time? If so what are the kinetics? Knowing this would make testable predictions about when one should see labeled cells outside and inside the muscle.</p><p>8) The quality of the PH3 staining is poor and therefore not convincing. It essentially looks like background. The presence of mitotic spindles would help the author's case. Along these lines what does the equivalent of 3E-3H PH3 staining look like in uninjured tissue? They could help with background green levels.</p><p>9) Can the authors rule out dividing cells as being hemocytes?</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I-3N</xref>: Why do the authors induce clones 6hr prior to injury whereas in earlier experiments they induced clones in the larval period?</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I-3N</xref>: Nothing in this figure leads me to believe that there are now GFP+ cells in the muscle. The position of the nucleus appearing to &quot;intercalate&quot; could be based solely on optical sectioning. The satellite cells should both self-renew and give rise to a myoblast that differentiate and fuse, so there should always be two labeled cells, right? Where is the second cell? Better markers, close–up views, and 3-D reconstruction would bolster the author's assertion. Furthermore, I would like to get a quantification of how many new muscle nuclei there are.</p><p>12) Ultimately, the authors need to use a reporter that would be capable of labeling either the muscle membrane or cytoplasm so we can see the new cell and the extent of repair. I understand the author's argue that the CD8::GFP gets diluted. But with enough damage it should be possible for enough new nuclei to be made to produce an identifiable signal. Or to use more sensitive membrane reporter, for example see &quot;ultrafast tissue staining with chemical tags&quot; published in PNAS by Kohl et al., (2014).</p><p>13) The presence of a muscle fibre that is GFP positive cannot rule out fusion of a &quot;satellite cell&quot; directly with a fibre versus the progeny of a &quot;satellite cell&quot; fusing with a muscle fibre. The use of twin spot clonal systems (those in which each progeny is labeled with a different color following mitotic recombination) could help resolve this issue.</p><p>14) Notch staining in 4A-C looks strongly nuclear. In fact, Notch staining in flies tends to be membrane and in endocytic vesicles and never seen in the nucleus. In addition, there is no control using N RNAi to show staining goes away. This is true of Delta and neutralized with respect to lack of controls for immune-reactivity.</p><p>15) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N: I</xref> assume the area examined is the same for PH3 experiments. If so why are 5% of cells NRE+. In other words, there are approx. 175 dividing cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> but 10-12 NRE positive cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>.</p><p>16) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O-P</xref>: Where is Delta? Is it nuclear again, like N staining? Should be either membrane or vesicular. These low magnification images are not informative at all. Also, it appears that Dl staining is present in the Delta-RNAi image?</p><p>17) The neuralized staining looks like background and could benefit from a control (neutralized knockdown followed by staining). Also – are the levels adjusted the same? R inset looks like it has less background than S inset.</p><p>18) Does neur knockdown in muscle (using Act88F) also block PH3? What happens with Notch knockdown using Act88F?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The article by Gunage et al. describes a MARCM clonal analysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> aimed at identifying adult muscle satellite cells. That is, non-differentiated myoblasts associated with the mature adult muscles that might contribute to adult muscle repair upon activation. The significance of this finding, if proven, is extremely high: there has been no prior evidence that satellite cells exist in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, yet the existence of such cells would enable the use of a powerful system to investigate the specification and biology of these cells. Such a finding would be a major advance.</p><p>In their paper, Gunage et al. identify clones of cells expressing dMEF2-Gal4 that appear to satisfy some of the criteria of satellite cells. They are located at or near the adult flight muscles; there is some evidence that they proliferate in response to injury; and aspects of the biology of these cells is affected by manipulation of the Notch pathway, that regulates the specification of <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult myoblasts, and plays a major role in satellite cell activation in vertebrates.</p><p>Despite these promising findings, I feel that the depth of analysis presented here does not go far enough to confirm the existence of these cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Given the significance of the proposed conclusions, I think that the analyses should be far more rigorous than shown here. Specific concerns are as follows:</p><p>1) The stains and documentation in numerous figures do not effectively support the authors claims about the cells. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> panels C and D, it is not apparent that the GFP-labeled cells are located at the periphery of the muscle, because there are no markers used to label the periphery. Also, the red dotted lines are in slightly different locations comparing panel D with E, further raising doubt as to the precise location of the boundaries of the muscle cells. I suggest co-staining with a membrane marker to more clearly localize the cells. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> panels F and G are so weakly stained that it is not possible to see what is intended.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows electron micrographs of flight muscle cells and a cell associated with the flight muscles. There is no evidence that this cell either corresponds to a satellite cell or shares any of the markers of satellite cells. I think this figure should be removed.</p><p>3) Since dMEF2-Gal4 is expressed in cells other than adult muscle precursor cells associated with the wing discs, the authors cannot claim that the GFP-positive cells observed in the adult arise from the wing disc myoblasts without more detailed lineage tracing carried out during the pupal stage.</p><p>4) There are no markers that are specific for the cells identified as satellite cells. An analysis of a number of candidate markers would improve confidence that the identified cells are myoblast-like, such as Twist, dMEF2, and others, and would improve the ability of the authors to follow the cells as they proliferate. Otherwise, one might argue that the infiltrating cells are non-muscle cells, perhaps responding to injury or sepsis, and unrelated to a repair mechanism.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. It is difficult to reconcile some of the data presented in this figure. Firstly, can the authors describe (or ideally show) the proximity of the stained areas to the muscle injury? This applies to all subsequent figures where the muscle is injured. It would be good to confirm that the band of PH3-positive cells is close to the site of damage, and does not occur at a location away from the area of damage. Otherwise, the PH3 stain might instead represent some kind of cellular response. In panels C and F there appear to be a relatively large number of PH3-positive cells, whereas in panels I-N the number of cells is quite sparse. While I understand that the GFP marking system in I-N only labels a subset of cells, it would be nice to know how many such satellite cells exist, and whether the number of marked cells in C and F is consistent with the numbers of precursors. This also relates to comment 4 above, where there is a paucity of markers for these important cells. Also, the PH3 and GFP stains in panels E and F are too faint to be considered reliable. Finally, in panels J-N, the authors show GFP cells associated with an injury site, but the location of the injury is not shown, and the relative locations of the GFP-positive cells relative to the cell membrane cannot be determined, thus it is not clear if the cells are really infiltrating.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The Notch staining in panel B is not convincing. Why is the DNA stain in panels H-J fainter than the same stain in panels K-M?</p><p>7) For the Delta knockdown experiment and for the Neuralized expression levels, there must be quantitation of the degree of knockdown and the degree of Neur over-expression. Comparison of stained sections is not satisfactory, and instead the authors should carry out quantitative RT-PCR or western blotting to confirm their stains. Also, why is the Phallodin intensity greater in panel S than R? Accurate quantitation as suggested here would protect the authors from concerns that differential efficiency of staining or imaging is the cause of the observed changes in intensity.</p><p>8) There is no evidence that the adult muscles repair, that the identified cells have any role in the repair, or that the repair depends upon Notch pathway members.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Identification and Functional Characterization of Muscle Satellite Cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While both reviewers appreciate the improvement over the last submission, they remain unconvinced that the study definitively shows the origin, existence and activity of these cells similar to the mammalian satellite cells. They are especially concerned about the quality of the lineage and functional data implicating these cells in muscle repair.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In their resubmission, the authors argue that <italic>Drosophila</italic> flight muscles contain satellite cells that proliferate in response to damage and give rise to progeny that fuse with muscle to lead to functional repair. While I agree that there has been an improvement in the quality of data since their last submission, in particular the presence of superficial cells, I am not convinced that these cells are a stem cell population that participates in muscle repair. The lineage and functional data presented is poor quality, not only from the level of cellular resolution but with respect to the assays used. I think part of the problem is the syncytial nature of the tissue, which makes it hard to analyze. Definitive proof will probably require live imaging in intact flies, something that I would thing feasible with 2 photon microscopy.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) Are the muscle nuclei polyploid? Are the green arrow nuclei diploid? If so it would help to DAPI quantify.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> there is only one superficial nuclei. In 1C there are three. The scale bar suggests the picture is the same size but 1C looks smaller?</p><p>3) &quot;(In control experiments, MARCM clones were also triggered in pupal stages and recovered in the adult to confirm that the labeled cells were not infiltrating cells that might derive from unknown proliferating cells located external to the wing disc; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>)”. I don't understand this. Is the reasoning that during pupation there are no cell divisions in this lineage and therefore you would expect not to recover clones? Why is it parentheses? Also, throughout the paper there are examples of text placed in parentheses. Is this a convention the authors use to indicate an afterthought? It's unnecessary.</p><p>4) &quot;Note that, while differentiated myoblasts are also targeted in this MARCM experiment, no GFP labeled cells are visible within the adult muscle fibres since their membrane tethered GFP becomes diffuse due to incorporation into the extensive muscle fibre membrane following cell fusion (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).&quot; Wouldn't the argument used by the authors later, that gal80 is present, explain why there is no membrane GFP?</p><p>5) &quot;Care was taken to restrict damage such that only 1 or 2 muscle fibres were affected and that fibres were not severed by the injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>).&quot; Out of how many fibres? How much area would this represent?</p><p>6) &quot;DLMs damaged in this way can regenerate and in morphological respects appear normal after approximately 3 weeks (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).&quot;</p><p>7) How do they appear after 1 day? 2 days? 3 days? etc. It's confusing why one would look after 3 weeks, especially when data presented later implies that muscle function returns after 2 days! By looking at many early time points one might get an idea of how the proposed repair occurs. In fact, maybe the area of damage is repaired by fusion of remaining tissue or hypertrophy of adjacent nuclei. There is no way to rule these alternatives out based on the resolution (spatial and temporally) provided. Also, it's unclear where the original injury might have been. There is no presentation of muscles that have no/poor repair (e.g. DmefGal4 X Notch RNAi) to compare with.</p><p>8) &quot;For both PH-3 and EdU labeling, evidence for increased mitotic activity was largely restricted to the damaged muscle fibres and rarely observed in undamaged muscle fibres”. Could you show a damaged fibre next an undamaged fibre with PH3 staining.</p><p>9) In contrast, within the damaged muscle fibre, evidence for increased mitotic activity was seen in nuclei along the entire extent of the fibre length. It surprises me that mitosis would be seen along the entire fibre. How many nuclei would that be? Is that the case with vertebrate satellite muscle cells? How many of new progeny fuse with the fibre?</p><p>10) &quot;In order to label only cells that were generated by mitotic activity in the adult, clones were induced in the adult 6h prior to physical injury and recovered 24h later.&quot; According to the authors divisions are rare, so how were clones recovered at all? The better way is follows right after in the parentheses.</p><p>11) &quot;This implies that some of the daughter cells generated by satellite cells during injury-induced proliferative activity remained at the muscle cell surface while others appear to have entered muscle fibre's interior and may have fused with the injured muscle cell.&quot; This was not convincing. They may have not entered the interior but rather intermixed in the space which has been disrupted by injury. Or that injury leads to non-specific fusion caused by injury.</p><p>12) The FUCCI system does not provide information about lineage. And the quantity and quality of the data was not better than PH3. Along these lines, could the authors show examples of metaphase, anaphase and telophase? This would be much more convincing that the surprisingly numerous PH3 positive cells. Also, the long chain of &quot;proliferative&quot; cells shown using the FUCCI system was never seen or described in earlier experiments and makes me wonder if it's an artifact.</p><p>13) Nts affects the entire animal. DmefGal4 X Notch RNAi affects all muscle. MARCM clones of Notch mutants would be more useful since one could see they are PH3 negative in a sea of PH3 positive WT cells.</p><p>14) Was DAPT fed to the flies, for how long?</p><p>15) The Notch responsive element is not a GFP construct of E(spl). It's, I believe, Su(H) binding sites fused to Gbe binding sites and based on the original reporter made by Sarah Bray's lab.</p><p>16) &quot;Targeted Notch downregulation led to significant perturbation in the flight initiation response, indicating the importance of satellite cell lineage proliferation and fusion to restore muscle function after injury.&quot; Actually, this is merely a strict correlation. That is, PH3 falls and so does flight initiation. But whether they are directly connected cannot be concluded. Notch may be required in Dmef2 positive cells for other things. I am also concerned and surprised that repair occurs in 2 days. And along these lines why in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 did the authors wait until 3 weeks for evidence of repair? Furthermore, what about Notch RNAi after 4 days, 5 days? (They only look at Notch RNAi after 2 days). Given the huge variation even among each genotype it's hard to see how one can conclude statistical significance. Can it recover? I would not expect it to given how well PH3 levels fall. Therefore, if it recovered it would argue something else is going on. And why only do 3 trials? Given the ease of the experiment you could do 300 trials.</p><p>17) It's unclear why the authors chose a red box next to the area of damage as opposed to a box with the area of damage in the middle. And why a 100uM and not more? At what distance does PH3 fall? Or is it an entire fibre becomes activated?</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Gunage et al. is a significantly improved version of a manuscript submitted earlier this year, that attempts to describe and characterize for the first time satellite cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This appears a particularly difficult task, given a paucity of suitable markers for these cells and no established muscle injury model in this organism. Nevertheless, the significance of this work, if proven, would be high.</p><p>The prior version of the manuscript suffered from a lack of suitable counterstains and marker analysis for the satellite cells, and this has been improved. It is clear that a separate population of cells exists on the flight muscle surface, and that upon injury there is an increase in the number of proliferating cells in and around the flight muscles. However, I still remain a little unconvinced that this revised work still definitively shows the origin, existence and activity of these cells.</p><p>Firstly, there is still no good data supporting that the satellite cells arise from the wing imaginal discs, versus any other discs or any other part of the body that expresses Dmef2-gal4. The authors indicate they studied pupal time points in a supplementary figure, however that data is poorly described and does not appear to represent a time course.</p><p>Secondly, the authors report that they were not able to identify any markers of the satellite cells from a candidate list. It is unclear if they have tested Dmef2 itself. The satellite cells should be positive for this protein because the Dmef2-gal4 driver is active in the cells.</p><p>Thirdly, the authors are still struggling to definitively demonstrate that the satellite cells and their daughter cells correspond to the nuclei that are thought to infiltrate the injured muscle. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, for example, it looks as though essentially every nucleus becomes PH3 positive. Do the endogenous muscle nuclei (i.e. those that were present in the muscle prior to injury) also accumulate PH3? A clarification of not only the number of PH3-poistive nuclei in each sample, but also the total number of nuclei, would help resolve this. This point is not well supported by the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 H-K</xref>, where the PH3 stain is so weak it could be argued to be either present in all nuclei or absent from all nuclei.</p><p>In addition, the notion that some of the activated satellite cells remain on the surface of the muscle is attractive, but is not well supported by the existing data. Here, there is no proof that the surface nuclei are not fused to the muscle (and no support from the data in panel 4S-U), nor that the activated cells do not fuse to the muscle in the following day or so. Later time points following injury and MARCM induction might resolve this issue.</p><p>Finally, it is still not clear what is the level of repair taking place. The rescue of flight defects is modest and not necessarily due to muscle defects (it could be some form of shock or inflammatory response that causes a reduction in flight after injury); the authors do not provide any data suggesting that new myofibrillar proteins are being made; and there is no indication that there is an overall increase in the number of muscle nuclei following repair. Thus, the roles of these cells are not defined.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the decision letter after the authors resubmitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Identification and Functional Characterization of Muscle Satellite Cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. I do apologise for the very long time it took to review your manuscript. The senior editors who saw the original version have stepped down as editors, and none of the three in-depth reviewers was available to comment. This, compounded with your August submission, when many editors were on vacation, explains – but of course does not excuse – the delay. Your article has been reviewed by a single peer reviewer, and the evaluation has been overseen by Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The reviewer opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our normal practice is to have a discussion between multiple reviewers to achieve a consensus position on each manuscript. However, in this case there was only one in-depth review and so we have provided it in full below. Both the reviewer and the editor are supportive of publication, provided that you address each of the points raised.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Gunage et al. provides an analysis of adult flight muscles in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and presents evidence consistent with the existence of cells within these muscles that possess properties that are highly similar to those that have been described for mammalian satellite cells. These properties include localization at the periphery of muscle fibres, derivation from developmentally active muscle precursors, proliferation in response to muscle damage, contribution of nuclei into regenerated muscle fibres, and dependence on Notch signaling for myogenic activation. The authors also identify a new marker of these cells Zfh-1 and establish a new muscle injury/repair model in the fly. While much of the data presented are descriptive in nature, the clonal analyses and lineage tracing are compelling in support of the authors' hypothesis. The manuscript thus represents an important first step, and although clearly there is much more work to be done to fully understand the nature and activities of these cells this work is likely to impact the field by advancing the relevance of the fly system for studies of muscle regenerative biology and providing a new model system for genetic and mechanistic studies. For these reasons, I am supportive of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, assuming the authors can address the few points below:</p><p>1) Subsection “Two different types of cells are present in adult flight muscle”: &quot;This observation is confirmed by co-staining these adult muscle fibres for expression of either Act88F, an indirect flight muscle specific isoform of actin, or Tropomoysin.&quot; Is this data contained in the manuscript? If so, it should be properly called out and if not, it should be added.</p><p>2) The authors should provide in the Discussion section more information about their newly defined marker Zfh-1, including its other known functions in the fly (it appears to be involved in muscle development and in self-renewal of germline stem cells) as well as information about whether its homolog is expressed in mammalian satellite cells (for which multiple publicly available gene expression data sets are available).</p><p>3) Statistical tests used should be identified in the figure legends and methods should describe statistical approaches and randomization (if used).</p><p>4) If technically feasible, immunoEM to demonstrate that the &quot;satellite cells&quot; identified by ultrastructural analysis are the same cells as those identified by confocal microscopy and Zfh-1 expression would greatly enhance the authors' conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30107.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this paper, the authors extended their previous characterization of muscle-specific stem cells in fly development by presenting evidence that the descendants of these stem cells in adult flies similarly as vertebrate muscle satellite cells. This conclusion would be highly significant if substantiated. While the authors have presented some evidence to show that these cells undergo mitosis upon injury, whether their progeny contribute to adult muscle was hard to evaluate, at least based on the GFP data alone. Additional experiments to clearly demarcate these GFP-positive cells as part of the muscle fibres would strengthen the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed above concerns by several additional experiments using methods such as EdU labeling, Fly-FUCCI and 3D reconstruction.

No evidence presented for regeneration, let alone regeneration of new tissue that leads to functional tissue. Without more rigorous data, in particular better clonal data, I would not recommend publication. In fact, at this point the data, at best, suggest that the AMP remnants stick around and can divide but do not give rise to any new cells, as has been shown to be the case by Fox and Spradling with the adult hindgut imaginal ring. Below are experiments that would go a long way to proving the author's points. I would strongly encourage the authors to address most of the comments with new, better, and more rigorous experiments rather than arguing them away. Ultimately, either there are or there aren't satellite cells that give rise to new muscle following injury AND are necessary for regeneration. And a publication claiming there are satellite stem cells based on poor quality data, which is later shown to be incorrect would reflect poorly on the authors and eLife.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) How many satellite cells do the authors think there are?

The difference in GFP staining in these panels to that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-G</xref> is less in the case illustrated, although differences are to be expected since the clone induction time is different (late third instar versus adult) for wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-G</xref>) compared to damaged muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H-K</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>: Over what area and what percentage of satellite cells?

I would expect only half to be positive since half of the progeny would not be satellite cells, but daughters of satellite cells. Do the authors think the daughters can divide? Or perhaps do the authors think the response by satellite cells takes 24 hours? Does PH3 number go down with time? If so what are the kinetics? Knowing this would make testable predictions about when one should see labeled cells outside and inside the muscle.</p></disp-quote><p>New experiments added, now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H-K</xref> (magnified inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>) clearly shows example of lineage trace and PH3 labeling demonstrating mitotically active as well as inactive satellite cells.

It essentially looks like background. The presence of mitotic spindles would help the author's case. Along these lines what does the equivalent of 3E-3H PH3 staining look like in uninjured tissue? They could help with background green levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the corresponding out experiments and provided new figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H-K</xref> and also Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B) in which the staining quality is substantially improved. Also, we have used Fly-FUCCI to demonstrate the same and the results are now included in the Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Can the authors rule out dividing cells as being hemocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>To rule this out, we have carried out labeling experiments with the e33c-Gal4 line that marks hemocytes (Fossett et al., 2003, Matova and Anderson, 2006). The dividing cells were not labeled indicating that they are not hemocytes. This experiment is now incorporated into the Results section in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I-3N</xref>: Why do the authors induce clones 6hr prior to injury whereas in earlier experiments they induced clones in the larval period?</p></disp-quote><p>Clones were induced in the adult and not in the larva in order to label only those lineages that had proliferated specifically in the adult in response to injury and not those lineages, which had proliferated earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I-3N</xref> of earlier MS is now become <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L-Q</xref>). The 6 h time period of clone induction prior to injury was chosen to ensure that adequate FLP-ase protein is present at the time of injury. We now mention this in the Results section to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I-3N</xref>: Nothing in this figure leads me to believe that there are now GFP+ cells in the muscle. The position of the nucleus appearing to &quot;intercalate&quot; could be based solely on optical sectioning. The satellite cells should both self-renew and give rise to a myoblast that differentiate and fuse, so there should always be two labeled cells, right? Where is the second cell? Better markers, close up views, and 3-D reconstruction would bolster the author's assertion. Furthermore, I would like to get a quantification of how many new muscle nuclei there are.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carried out a 3-D reconstruction and present this together with close–up view and a visualization of all optical sections in a movie in new figure panels (Video 5 and Video 6, 7); this clearly shows that there are GFP positive cells in the muscle. We have also carried out a quantification of how many new muscle nuclei there are in induced clones and show this in a new figure panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>). While we understand the logic of the referee in assuming that there should always be two labeled cells, we cannot assert that this must the case for two reasons. First, we have not studied the mode of cellular proliferation of the satellite cell lineages following injury and thus cannot say if it is asymmetric or symmetric and if it includes transit- amplifying cells. Second, given the amount of time between clone induction and recovery, the satellite cells could divide more than once thus producing more than one round progeny (even if there are no transit-amplifying cells). Our results with Fly-FUCCI experiments showed a clear lineage and hints towards possible mechanisms referees are suggesting (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, D). As we mention in the Discussion section, a detailed characterization of the proliferation properties of satellite cells in response to injury is an important topic for further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Ultimately, the authors need to use a reporter that would be capable of labeling either the muscle membrane or cytoplasm so we can see the new cell and the extent of repair. I understand the author's argue that the CD8::GFP gets diluted. But with enough damage it should be possible for enough new nuclei to be made to produce an identifiable signal. Or to use more sensitive membrane reporter, for example see &quot;ultrafast tissue staining with chemical tags&quot; published in PNAS by Kohl et al., (2014).</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated these experiments and the results are included in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4S-U</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The presence of a muscle fibre that is GFP positive cannot rule out fusion of a &quot;satellite cell&quot; directly with a fibre versus the progeny of a &quot;satellite cell&quot; fusing with a muscle fibre. The use of twin spot clonal systems (those in which each progeny is labeled with a different color following mitotic recombination) could help resolve this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot claim that only the satellite cell progeny but not the satellite cell can fuse directly with a muscle fibre. It is indeed possible that both occur. Our experiments show that following the injury induced proliferation, some of the cells in the satellite cell lineage fuse with the muscle fibres and other do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F-R</xref>). We have now mentioned this explicitly in the results (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, D) and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Notch staining in 4A-C looks strongly nuclear. In fact, Notch staining in flies tends to be membrane and in endocytic vesicles and never seen in the nucleus. In addition, there is no control using N RNAi to show staining goes away. This is true of Delta and neutralized with respect to lack of controls for immune-reactivity.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is correct in that staining for the N intracellular domain is definitely not nuclear. The impression from the figure mentioned, that it is nuclear is due to the fact that the nucleus of the satellite cell is relatively large compared to the rest of the cytoplasm (see our EM figure). To show that N intracellular domain is not in the nucleus, we have carried out high resolution imaging of the satellite cells co-labeled for N intracellular, cell membrane and nucleus. We present this in a new figure panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-D</xref>). We have also carried out the control using N RNAi; this is presented in a new figure panel. Similarly, we have carried out the controls for Delta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 A, B</xref>) and Neuralised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 F, G</xref>); this is presented in new figure panels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N: I</xref> assume the area examined is the same for PH3 experiments. If so why are 5% of cells NRE+. In other words, there are approx. 175 dividing cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> but 10-12 NRE positive cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>The area examined is the same, and the numbers are as presented. Thus, under control conditions we count 175 dividing cells and only around 10 NRE positive cells. We do not claim to investigate the mechanisms responsible for this difference in numbers, rather we simply show that in both cases (division and NRE expression) there is a marked increase in the number of implicated cells following injury.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O-P</xref>: Where is Delta?

For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> panels C and D, it is not apparent that the GFP-labeled cells are located at the periphery of the muscle, because there are no markers used to label the periphery. Also, the red dotted lines are in slightly different locations comparing panel D with E, further raising doubt as to the precise location of the boundaries of the muscle cells. I suggest co-staining with a membrane marker to more clearly localize the cells. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> panels F and G are so weakly stained that it is not possible to see what is intended.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the corresponding experiments and now present new panels which show the unfused GFP labeled cells more clearly with much less background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we have carried out new labeling experiments using different markers including a membrane marker.

There is no evidence that this cell either corresponds to a satellite cell or shares any of the markers of satellite cells. I think this figure should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We include this micrograph to show unequivocally that there are small cells in the adult muscle that are not fused with the muscle fibres but are very closely associated with muscle and even share the muscle cell ECM (previously shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref> reconstruction Video 4, 5 and also demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Cells of this morphological type are novel and have not been previously described. This clearly confirms the notion that there are two different types of cells in adult muscle, one type has fused its nucleus with the muscle cell and the other novel type, while closely associated with the muscle, has not. We clarify this in the revised Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Since dMEF2-Gal4 is expressed in cells other than adult muscle precursor cells associated with the wing discs, the authors cannot claim that the GFP-positive cells observed in the adult arise from the wing disc myoblasts without more detailed lineage tracing carried out during the pupal stage.</p></disp-quote><p>We have traced the dMEF2-Gal4 expressing cells associated with the larval wing discs through pupal stages and into the adult to confirm that the labeled cells in the adult do arise from the wing disc muscle precursors.

An analysis of a number of candidate markers would improve confidence that the identified cells are myoblast-like, such as Twist, dMEF2, and others, and would improve the ability of the authors to follow the cells as they proliferate. Otherwise, one might argue that the infiltrating cells are non-muscle cells, perhaps responding to injury or sepsis, and unrelated to a repair mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We have screened for other candidate markers, but have not found any that are specific for these satellite cells. (This could be a reason why these cells have not been identified previously in <italic>Drosophila</italic>). To rule out that these cells might be infiltrating hemocytes, we have carried out labeling experiments with the Gal4e33 line which marks hemocytes. The dividing cells were not labeled indicating that they are not hemocytes.

It is difficult to reconcile some of the data presented in this figure. Firstly, can the authors describe (or ideally show) the proximity of the stained areas to the muscle injury? This applies to all subsequent figures where the muscle is injured. It would be good to confirm that the band of PH3-positive cells is close to the site of damage, and does not occur at a location away from the area of damage. Otherwise, the PH3 stain might instead represent some kind of cellular response.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show the site of the labeled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shown in red dotted rectangle) relative to the site of injury in a new panel, which presents low magnification of the injured muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> white dotted circle).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In panels C and F there appear to be a relatively large number of PH3-positive cells, whereas in panels I-N the number of cells is quite sparse.

This also relates to comment 4 above, where there is a paucity of markers for these important cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have determined the number of unfused cells (mentioned in main text result) and have also determined that 50% percent of the unfused cells are Ph3 positive, indicating that less than 50% of the satellite cells have become active following injury (Mitotic activity is seen primarily in injured area).

The lineage and functional data presented is poor quality, not only from the level of cellular resolution but with respect to the assays used.

I don't understand this. Is the reasoning that during pupation there are no cell divisions in this lineage and therefore you would expect not to recover clones? Why is it parentheses?

This is much clearer in low zoom images and this represents about one tenth of muscle area.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) &quot;DLMs damaged in this way can regenerate and in morphological respects appear normal after approximately 3 weeks (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We now present new data on the nature of the injury and the timeline of regeneration at 2, 5 and 10 days in a new Results section and note that at 10 days the regeneration is largely complete.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) How do they appear after 1 day? 2days? 3 days? etc. It's confusing why one would look after 3 weeks, especially when data presented later implies that muscle function returns after 2 days! By looking at many early time points one might get an idea of how the proposed repair occurs. In fact, maybe the area of damage is repaired by fusion of remaining tissue or hypertrophy of adjacent nuclei. There is no way to rule these alternatives out based on the resolution (spatial and temporally) provided. Also, it's unclear where the original injury might have been. There is no presentation of muscles that have no/poor repair (e.g. DmefGal4 X Notch RNAi) to compare with.</p></disp-quote><p>See response above to point 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) &quot;For both PH-3 and EdU labeling, evidence for increased mitotic activity was largely restricted to the damaged muscle fibres and rarely observed in undamaged muscle fibres”. Could you show a damaged fibre next an undamaged fibre with PH3 staining.</p></disp-quote><p>We have eliminated the corresponding figure in the revised version and now characterize satellite cell proliferation due to injury using the satellite cell specific Zhf1 label. Moreover, we also use G-trace to label the satellite cells after injury. Both new experiments show both damaged and undamaged fibres which support the above mentioned spatial distribution of proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In contrast, within the damaged muscle fibre, evidence for increased mitotic activity was seen in nuclei along the entire extent of the fibre length. It surprises me that mitosis would be seen along the entire fibre. How many nuclei would that be? Is that the case with vertebrate satellite muscle cells? How many of new progeny fuse with the fibre?</p></disp-quote><p>See response to point 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) &quot;In order to label only cells that were generated by mitotic activity in the adult, clones were induced in the adult 6h prior to physical injury and recovered 24h later.&quot; According to the authors divisions are rare, so how were clones recovered at all? The better way is follows right after in the parentheses.</p></disp-quote><p>The corresponding experiment has been removed in the revised version and replaced by Zfh1 based G-trace lineage tracing methods performed in the injured adult.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) &quot;This implies that some of the daughter cells generated by satellite cells during injury-induced proliferative activity remained at the muscle cell surface while others appear to have entered muscle fibre's interior and may have fused with the injured muscle cell.&quot; This was not convincing. They may have not entered the interior but rather intermixed in the space which has been disrupted by injury. Or that injury leads to non-specific fusion caused by injury.</p></disp-quote><p>The corresponding experiment has been removed in the revised version and replaced by Zfh1 based G-trace lineage tracing methods performed in the injured adult.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The FUCCI system does not provide information about lineage. And the quantity and quality of the data was not better than PH3. Along these lines, could the authors show examples of metaphase, anaphase and telophase? This would be much more convincing that the surprisingly numerous PH3 positive cells. Also, the long chain of &quot;proliferative &quot; cells shown using the FUCCI system was never seen or described in earlier experiments and makes me wonder if it's an artifact.</p></disp-quote><p>The corresponding experiment has been removed in the revised version and replaced by Zfh1 based G-trace lineage tracing methods performed in the injured adult.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Nts affects the entire animal. DmefGal4 X Notch RNAi affects all muscle. MARCM clones of Notch mutants would be more useful since one could see they are PH3 negative in a sea of PH3 positive WT cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the highly restricted nature of the injury, localized effects can be clearly discerned and differentiated from possible global effects by the use of the new highly specific markers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Was DAPT fed to the flies, for how long?</p></disp-quote><p>DAPT was fed for 3days after eclosion and injury was performed at the end of 48h and muscles were processed at the end of 72h.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) The Notch responsive element is not a GFP construct of E(spl). It's, I believe, Su(H) binding sites fused to Gbe binding sites and based on the original reporter made by Sarah Bray's lab.</p></disp-quote><p>The corresponding experiment has been removed in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) &quot;Targeted Notch downregulation led to significant perturbation in the flight initiation response, indicating the importance of satellite cell lineage proliferation and fusion to restore muscle function after injury.&quot; Actually, this is merely a strict correlation. That is, PH3 falls and so does flight initiation. But whether they are directly connected cannot be concluded. Notch may be required in Dmef2 positive cells for other things. I am also concerned and surprised that repair occurs in 2 days. And along these lines why in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 did the authors wait until 3 weeks for evidence of repair? Furthermore, what about Notch RNAi after 4 days, 5 days? (They only look at Notch RNAi after 2 days). Given the huge variation even among each genotype it's hard to see how one can conclude statistical significance. Can it recover? I would not expect it to given how well PH3 levels fall. Therefore, if it recovered it would argue something else is going on. And why only do 3 trials? Given the ease of the experiment you could do 300 trials.</p></disp-quote><p>The corresponding experiment has been removed in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) It's unclear why the authors chose a red box next to the area of damage as opposed to a box with the area of damage in the middle. And why a 100uM and not more? At what distance does PH3 fall? Or is it an entire fibre becomes activated?</p></disp-quote><p>The corresponding figure has been removed in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Gunage et al. is a significantly improved version of a manuscript submitted earlier this year, that attempts to describe and characterize for the first time satellite cells in Drosophila. This appears a particularly difficult task, given a paucity of suitable markers for these cells and no established muscle injury model in this organism. Nevertheless, the significance of this work, if proven, would be high.</p><p>The prior version of the manuscript suffered from a lack of suitable counterstains and marker analysis for the satellite cells, and this has been improved. It is clear that a separate population of cells exists on the flight muscle surface, and that upon injury there is an increase in the number of proliferating cells in and around the flight muscles. However, I still remain a little unconvinced that this revised work still definitively shows the origin, existence and activity of these cells.</p><p>Firstly, there is still no good data supporting that the satellite cells arise from the wing imaginal discs, versus any other discs or any other part of the body that expresses Dmef2-gal4. The authors indicate they studied pupal time points in a supplementary figure, however that data is poorly described and does not appear to represent a time course.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for these valuable and point specific comment. We now present extensive spatiotemporal data on satellite cell origin from larval through pupal stages which clearly show that satellite cells are lineal descendants of AMPs in the wing disc. This work is based on the newly identified Zfh1 marker.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, the authors report that they were not able to identify any markers of the satellite cells from a candidate list. It is unclear if they have tested Dmef2 itself. The satellite cells should be positive for this protein because the Dmef2-gal4 driver is active in the cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment. As a consequence, we have screened for such a marker and have discovered that Zfh-1 is a highly specific marker for satellite cells in the adult musculature. Data based on this maker are included throughout the extensively revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thirdly, the authors are still struggling to definitively demonstrate that the satellite cells and their daughter cells correspond to the nuclei that are thought to infiltrate the injured muscle. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, for example, it looks as though essentially every nucleus becomes PH3 positive. Do the endogenous muscle nuclei (i.e. those that were present in the muscle prior to injury) also accumulate PH3? A clarification of not only the number of PH3-poistive nuclei in each sample, but also the total number of nuclei, would help resolve this. This point is not well supported by the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H-K</xref>, where the PH3 stain is so weak it could be argued to be either present in all nuclei or absent from all nuclei.</p><p>In addition, the notion that some of the activated satellite cells remain on the surface of the muscle is attractive, but is not well supported by the existing data. Here, there is no proof that the surface nuclei are not fused to the muscle (and no support from the data in panel 4S-U), nor that the activated cells do not fuse to the muscle in the following day or so. Later time points following injury and MARCM induction might resolve this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced these experiments by new Zfh1 driven G-trace experiments which clearly demonstrate that satellite cell lineal descendants fuse with muscle following injury.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, it is still not clear what is the level of repair taking place. The rescue of flight defects is modest and not necessarily due to muscle defects (it could be some form of shock or inflammatory response that causes a reduction in flight after injury); the authors do not provide any data suggesting that new myofibrillar proteins are being made; and there is no indication that there is an overall increase in the number of muscle nuclei following repair. Thus, the roles of these cells are not defined.</p></disp-quote><p>We have eliminated the flight data in the revised manuscript. Moreover, we present a spatiotemporal characterization of the injury repair process. We feel that an in–depth characterization of the molecular mechanisms of the repair process goes beyond the scope of this manuscript which is focused on identification and characterization of satellite cells in normal and injured muscles.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to third round of review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>[…] 1) Subsection “Two different types of cells are present in adult flight muscle”: &quot;This observation is confirmed by co-staining these adult muscle fibres for expression of either Act88F, an indirect flight muscle specific isoform of actin, or Tropomoysin.&quot; Is this data contained in the manuscript? If so, it should be properly called out and if not, it should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for highlighting this gap. As you have suggested, we have added a supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) where we show unfused muscle associated mononucleate cells located at the surface of, and between, adult myofibres within whom A) DLM specific Actin (Act88F) and B) Tropomyosin localize to myofibrils. These stainings reiterate the localization of satellite cells illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should provide in the Discussion section more information about their newly defined marker Zfh-1, including its other known functions in the fly (it appears to be involved in muscle development and in self-renewal of germline stem cells) as well as information about whether its homolog is expressed in mammalian satellite cells (for which multiple publicly available gene expression data sets are available).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important suggestion. Clearly it is essential to describe Zfh1 function related knowledge, from the perspective of this study in this manuscript. In the discussion, we have summarized in vivoinvestigations into the role of Zfh1 and its mammalian homolog ZEB in development. The summary can be found in the Discussion section of this manuscript. This is a valuable addition to this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Statistical tests used should be identified in the figure legends and methods should describe statistical approaches and randomization (if used).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion from our reviewer. Accordingly, descriptions of statistical analyses and parameters have been added to the figure legends to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C and F</xref>; Figure 13C and E. A section on the statistics we employed has been added to the Materials and methods section as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) If technically feasible, immunoEM to demonstrate that the &quot;satellite cells&quot; identified by ultrastructural analysis are the same cells as those identified by confocal microscopy and Zfh-1 expression would greatly enhance the authors' conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on the value of demonstrating Zfh1 expression in satellite cell nuclei, delienating apposition to muscles, retaining their own cell membranes, with the resolution of electron microscopy. A clean immunoEM image of Zfh1 in satellite cells would robustly consolidate our observations made through immunohistochemistry. In the revision, we now readily acknowledge this in the Discussion section: “With improved immune-EM staining protocols on <italic>Drosophila</italic> DLMs, visualizing Zfh1 expression in these cells will prove valuable.” However, at this time, the best available protocols for immunoEM in DLMs (Reedy et al., 2000.) show heavy background. While we could try to optimize the protocols for our system and setup, all conceivable avenues of doing so require the generation of new reagents e.g. antibodies which would take months, and at a minimum a few more months for optimization of the protocol. Variability in quality of images is inherent to the combination of antibodies and EM for immunoEM in DLMs. The lack of guaranteed, unquestionably clean immunoEM images after the prospective effort and time, makes this experiment technically unfeasible at this time. This experiment will remain among our priorities for further studies, of which many are ongoing.</p></body></sub-article></article>
