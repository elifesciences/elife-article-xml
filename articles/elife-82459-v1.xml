We investigated the natural variation of cardiac performance in the sequenced inbred lines of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). Genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) identified genetic networks associated with natural variation of cardiac traits which were used to gain insights as to the molecular and cellular processes affected. Non-coding variants that we identified were used to map potential regulatory non-coding regions, which in turn were employed to predict transcription factors (TFs) binding sites. Cognate TFs, many of which themselves bear polymorphisms associated with variations of cardiac performance, were also validated by heart-specific knockdown. Additionally, we showed that the natural variations associated with variability in cardiac performance affect a set of genes overlapping those associated with average traits but through different variants in the same genes. Furthermore, we showed that phenotypic variability was also associated with natural variation of gene regulatory networks. More importantly, we documented correlations between genes associated with cardiac phenotypes in both flies and humans, which supports a conserved genetic architecture regulating adult cardiac function from arthropods to mammals. Specifically, roles for PAX9 and EGR2 in the regulation of the cardiac rhythm were established in both models, illustrating that the characteristics of natural variations in cardiac function identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can accelerate discovery in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heart function</kwd><kwd>GWAS</kwd><kwd>gene regulatory networks</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>conserved genetic architecture</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004431</institution-id><institution>Fondation de France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>00071034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perrin</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007586</institution-id><institution>Aix-Marseille Université</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A*MIDEX</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perrin</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL148827-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colas</surname><given-names>Alexandre R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL149992-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colas</surname><given-names>Alexandre R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG071464-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colas</surname><given-names>Alexandre R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG071464-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colas</surname><given-names>Alexandre R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL132241</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ocorr</surname><given-names>Karen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 AG061598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ocorr</surname><given-names>Karen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comprehensive genome-wide associations studies in flies identify new genes and pathways critical for heart development and function and display relevant overlap with human genetic risks related to cardiac performance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heart diseases is a major cause of mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bezzina et al., 2015</xref>). Although a large number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic variants related to cardiovascular traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roselli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Setten et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shah et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verweij et al., 2020</xref>), we are very far from a comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture of these complex traits. Deciphering the impact of genetic variations on quantitative traits is however critical for the prediction of disease risk. But disentangling the relative genetic and environmental contributions to pathologies is challenging due to the difficulty in accounting for environmental influences and disease comorbidities. Underlying epistatic interactions may also contribute to problems with replication in human GWAS performed in distinct populations which rarely take epistatic effects into account. In addition, linking a trait associated locus to a candidate gene or a set of genes for prioritization is not straightforward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mackay, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the analysis of genetic factors related to cardiac traits is complicated by their interactions with several risk factors, such as increasing age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic, and structural heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Paludan-Müller et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>These pitfalls can be overcome using animal models. Model organisms allow precise controlling of the genetic background and environmental rearing conditions. They can provide generally applicable insights into the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and human diseases, due to the evolutionary conservation of biological pathways. Numerous studies have highlighted the conservation of cardiac development and function from flies to mammals. Indeed, orthologous genes control the early development as well as the essential functional elements of the heart. The fly is the simplest genetic model with a heart muscle and is increasingly used to identify the genes involved in heart disease and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ocorr et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diop and Bodmer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rosenthal et al., 2010</xref>). Although a large number of genes are implicated in establishing and maintaining cardiac function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neely et al., 2010</xref>), the extent to which genes identified from mutant analysis reflect naturally occurring variants is neither known, nor do we know how allelic variants at several segregating loci combine to affect cardiac performance.</p><p>We previously showed that wild populations of flies harbor rare polymorphisms of major effects that predispose them to cardiac dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ocorr et al., 2007a</xref>). Here, we analyzed the genetic architecture of the natural variation of cardiac performance in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Our aims were to (i) identify the variants associated with cardiac traits found in a natural population, (ii) decipher how these variants interact with each other and with the environment to impact cardiac performance, and (iii) gain insights into the molecular and cellular processes affected. For this, we used the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mackay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2014</xref>), a community resource of sequenced inbred lines. Previous GWAS performed in the DGRP indicate that inheritance of most quantitative traits in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is complex, involving many genes with small additive effects as well as epistatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mackay and Huang, 2018</xref>). The use of inbred lines allows us to assess the effects of genetic variations in distinct but constant genetic backgrounds and discriminate genetic and environmental effects.</p><p>We demonstrated substantial among-lines variations of cardiac performance and identified genetic variants associated with the cardiac traits together with epistatic interactions among polymorphisms. Candidate loci were enriched for genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) and signaling pathways, which we validated in vivo. We used non-coding variants - which represented the vast majority of identified polymorphisms – for predicting transcriptional regulators of associated genes. Corresponding TFs were further validated in vivo by heart-specific RNAi-mediated knockdown (KD). This illustrates that natural variations of gene regulatory networks have widespread impact on cardiac function. In addition, we analyzed the phenotypic variability of cardiac traits between individuals within each of the DGRP lines (i.e., with the same genotype), and we documented significant diversity in phenotypic variability among the DGRP lines, suggesting genetic variations influenced phenotypic variability of cardiac performance. Genetic variants associated with this phenotypic variability were identified and shown to affect a set of genes that overlapped with those associated with trait means, although through different genetic variants in the same genes.</p><p>Comparison of human GWAS of cardiac disorders with results in flies identified a set of orthologous genes associated with cardiac traits both in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in humans, supporting the conservation of the genetic architecture of cardiac performance traits, from arthropods to mammals. siRNA-mediated gene KD were performed in human induced pluripotent stem cells derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to indeed show that <italic>dmPox-meso</italic>/hPAX9 and <italic>dmStripe</italic>/hEGR2 have conserved functions in cardiomyocytes from both flies and humans. These new insights into the fly’s genetic architecture and the connections between natural variations and cardiac performance permit the accelerated identification of essential cardiac genes and pathways in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantitative genetics of heart performances in the DGRP</title><p>In this study, we aimed to evaluate how naturally occurring genetic variations affect cardiac performance in young <italic>Drosophila</italic> adults and identify variants and genes involved in the genetic architecture of cardiac traits. To assess the magnitude of naturally occurring variations of the traits, we measured heart parameters in 1-week-old females for 167 lines from the DGRP, a publicly available population of sequenced inbred lines derived from wild caught females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Briefly, semi-intact preparations of individual flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ocorr et al., 2007c</xref>) were used for high-speed video recording combined with Semi-automated Heartbeat Analysis (SOHA) software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sohasoftware.com/">http://www.sohasoftware.com/</ext-link>) which allows precise quantification of a number of cardiac function parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fink et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cammarato et al., 2015</xref>). Fly cardiac function parameters are highly influenced by sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wessells et al., 2004</xref>). Due to the experimental burden of analyzing individual cardiac phenotypes, we focused on female flies only and designed our experiment in the following way: we randomly selected 14 lines out of 167 that were replicated twice. The remaining 153 lines were replicated once. Each replicate was composed of 12 individuals. No block effect was observed due to the replicates in the 14 selected lines (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). This allowed us to perform our final analysis on one replicate of each of the 167 lines. A total sample of 1956 individuals was analyzed. Seven cardiac traits were analyzed across the whole population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, we analyzed phenotypes related to the rhythmicity of cardiac function: the systolic interval (SI) is the time elapsed between the beginning and the end of one contraction, the diastolic interval (DI) is the time elapsed between two contractions and the heart period (HP) is the duration of a total cycle (contraction+relaxation (DI+SI)). The arrhythmia index (AI, std-dev(HP)/mean (HP)) is used to evaluate the variability of the cardiac rhythm. In addition, three traits related to contractility were measured. The diameters of the heart in diastole (end diastolic diameter [EDD]), in systole (end systolic diameter [ESD]), and the fractional shortening (FS), which measures the contraction efficacy (EDD −ESD/EDD). We found significant genetic variation for all traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) with broad sense heritability ranging from 0.30 (AI) to 0.56 (EDD) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Genotype-phenotype associations were performed separately for all seven quantitative traits and variants were ranked based on their p-values. For most of the phenotypes analyzed, quantile-quantile (QQ) plots were uniform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and none of the variants reached the strict Bonferroni correction threshold for multiple tests (2 · 10<sup>–8</sup>), which is usual in the DGRP given the size of the population. However, the decisive advantage of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system is that we can use GWA analyses as primary screens for candidate genes and mechanisms that can be subsequently validated by different means. We therefore chose to analyze the 100 top ranked variants for each quantitative trait. This choice is based on our strategy to test the selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and associated genes by a variety of approaches – data mining and experimental validation (see below) – in order to provide a global validation of association results and to gain insights into the characteristics of the genetic architecture of the cardiac traits. This cut-off was chosen in order to be able to test a significant number of variants while being globally similar to the nominal cut-off (10<sup>–5</sup>) generally used in DGRP analyses. A large proportion of the variants retained have indeed a p-value below 10<sup>–5</sup>. Selected variants were further filtered on the basis of minor allele frequency (MAF &gt;4%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Among the seven quantitative traits analyzed, we identified 530 unique variants. These variants were associated to genes if they were within 1 kb of transcription start site (TSS) or transcription end sites (TES). Using these criteria, 417 variants were mapped to 332 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). We performed a chi-squared test to determine if the genomic location of variants associated with cardiac traits is biased toward any particular genomic region when compared with the whole set of variants with MAF &gt;4% in the DGRP population and obtained a p-value of 2.778e-13. Genomic locations of the variants were biased toward regions within 1 kb upstream of genes TSS, and, to a lesser extent, to genes 5’ UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Variants not mapped to genes (located at &gt;1 kb from TSS or TES) were slightly depleted in our set.</p><p>In GWAS analyses, loci associated with a complex trait collectively account for only a small proportion of the observed genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manolio et al., 2009</xref>) and part of this ‘missing heritability’ is thought to come from interactions between variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flint and Mackay, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manolio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shorter et al., 2015</xref>). As a first step toward identifying such interactions, we used FastEpistasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schüpbach et al., 2010</xref>). SNP identified by GWAS were used as focal SNPs and were tested for interactions with all other SNPs in the DGRP. FastEpistasis reports best ranked interacting SNP for each starting focal SNP, thus extending the network of variants and genes associated to natural variation of cardiac performance, which were used for hypothesis generation and functional validations; 288 unique SNPs were identified, which were mapped to 261 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). While none of the focal SNPs interacted with each other, there is a significant overlap between the 332 genes associated with single marker GWAS and the 261 genes identified by epistasis (n=31, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>, fold change (FC)=6; hypergeometric pval=6.8 × 10<sup>–16</sup>). This illustrates that the genes that contribute to quantitative variations in cardiac performance have a tendency to interact with each other, although through distinct alleles.</p><p>Taken together, single marker GWAS and epistatic interactions performed on the seven cardiac phenotypes identified a compendium of 562 genes associated with natural variations of heart performance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>). In line with the correlation noted between their phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the GWAS for HP and DI identified partially overlapping gene sets (overlap index 0.23, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The same was true, to a lesser extent, for ESD and EDD (0.15). Otherwise, the sets of genes associated with each of the cardiac traits are poorly correlated with each other.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Functional annotations and network analyses of association results</title><p>Our next objective was to identify the biological processes potentially affected by natural variation in cardiac performance. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the combined single marker GWAS and epistatic interactions analyses indicated that genes encoding signaling receptors, TFs, and cell adhesion molecules were over-represented among these gene sets (pval=1.4 × 10<sup>–9</sup> [FC=2.9], 5×10<sup>–4</sup> [FC=2], and 3×10<sup>–3</sup> [FC=4.6], respectively). There was also a bias for genes encoding proteins located at the plasma membrane, at ion channel complexes as well as components of contractile fibers (pval=3.4 × 10<sup>–10</sup> [FC=3], 7×10<sup>–5</sup> [FC=4.2], and 4×10<sup>–2</sup> [FC=3.6]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2a</xref>). Of note, although a number of genes have previously been identified as being required during heart development or for the establishment and maintenance of cardiac function by single gene approaches, we found no enrichment for these gene categories in our analysis. In addition, genes identified in a global screen for stress-induced lethality following heart-specific RNAi KD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neely et al., 2010</xref>) were also not enriched in GWAS detected genes (FC=1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>).

Genes were tested in 1-week-old adult female flies, using the heart-specific Hand&gt;Gal4 driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Popichenko et al., 2007</xref>) and the same semi-intact heart preparations and SOHA analyses as for DGRP lines screening. Notably, 38 of the 42 selected genes led to various levels of cardiac performance defects following heart-specific KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In parallel, we tested the effect on cardiac performance of knocking down 18 genes randomly selected in the genome – the GWAS associated genes being excluded from the selection (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although a number of these genes lead to cardiac phenotypes when inactivated – which is consistent with published observations that quantitative traits can be influenced by a large number of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) – when inactivated in the heart, the genes selected from GWAS lead to significantly more frequent phenotypes compared to the randomly selected genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results therefore supported our association results. It is important to emphasize that our approach is limited to testing the effects of tissue-specific gene KD. Since some of the variants may lead to increased gene function and/or expression, this can lead to a false negative rate that is difficult to estimate. In addition, some of the associated variants may influence heart function by non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, which would not be replicated by cardiac-specific RNAi KD.</p><p>We further focused on the TGFβ pathway, since members of both BMP and activin pathways were identified in our analyses. We tested different members of the TGFβ pathway for cardiac phenotypes using cardiac-specific RNAi KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and confirmed the involvement of the activin agonist <italic>snoo</italic> (Ski orthologue) and the BMP antagonist <italic>sog</italic> (chordin orthologue). Notably, activin and BMP pathways are usually antagonistic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Their joint identification in our GWAS suggest that they act in a coordinated fashion to regulate heart function. Alternatively, it may simply reflect their involvement in different aspects of cardiac development and/or functional maturation. In order to discriminate between these two hypotheses, we tested if different components of these pathways interacted genetically. Single heterozygotes for loss of function alleles show dosage-dependent effects of <italic>snoo</italic> and <italic>sog</italic> on several phenotypes, providing an independent confirmation of their involvement in several cardiac traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, compared to each single heterozygotes, <italic>snoo<sup>BSC234</sup>/sogU<sup>U2</sup></italic> double heterozygotes flies showed non-additive SI phenotypes (two-way ANOVA pval: 2.1 · 10<sup>–7</sup>), suggesting a genetic interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is worth noting however that <italic>snoo</italic> is also a transcriptional repressor of the BMP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takaesu et al., 2006</xref>). The effect observed in <italic>snoo<sup>BSC234</sup>/sogU<sup>U2</sup></italic> double heterozygotes can therefore alternatively arise as a consequence of an increased BMP signaling without affecting the activin pathway. We thus tested other allelic combinations for loss of function alleles of BMP and activin pathways. <italic>babo/tkv</italic> heterozygotes (respectively activin and BMP type 1 receptors) displayed non-additive ESD and EDD phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Synergistic interaction of BMP and activin pathways was also suggested by the analysis of FS in loss of function mutants for <italic>babo</italic> and <italic>dpp</italic>, the BMP ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Of note, <italic>babo/tkv</italic> double heterozygotes also displayed a tendency to non-additive effects on FS albeit non-significant (two-way ANOVA p=0.054). In addition, <italic>mad/smox</italic> heterozygotes (specifc downstream TFs of BMP and activin pathways) displayed non-additive effects on several traits, including phenotypes related to rhythmicity (HP, SI, DI) and contractility (ESD and EDD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Altogether, cardiac performance in response to allelic combinations of activin and BMP supported a coordinated action of both pathways in the establishment and/or maintenance of cardiac activity. This was further supported by the observation that simple heterozygotes for the tested loss of function alleles displayed similar trends with respect to cardiac performance, irrespective of the pathway considered (<italic>dpp, tkv,</italic> and <italic>mad</italic> for BMP; <italic>babo</italic> and <italic>smox</italic> for activin). Indeed, they displayed either no effect or increased FS and rhythmicity phenotypes (HP, DI, SI, AI), and decreased cardiac diameters (ESD and EDD). This suggests coordinated activity of both pathways. Importantly, the genetic interactions were tested using amorphic alleles that lead to systemic loss of function. The observed phenotypes may thus not unravel cardiac-specific effects of the pathways. In support of this, <italic>mad</italic> cardiac-specific RNAi KD was tested (see below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and lead to a decreased HP, DI, SI, and FS whereas heterozygotes for <italic>mad</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neely et al., 2010</xref> have either no (FS) or opposite (HP, DI, SI) effect on these phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Inversely, <italic>mad</italic> RNAi caused a significant increase in AI whereas <italic>mad</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neely et al., 2010</xref>) had no effect. However, heart-specific <italic>dpp</italic> RNAi KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) lead to similar phenotypic trends compared to <italic>dpp<sup>d14</sup></italic> (increased HP, DI, SI, decreased EDD and ESD) with the notable exception of FS which was reduced following cardiac-specific KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), but increased in <italic>dpp<sup>d14</sup></italic> heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these data point to a complex picture of TGFβ pathway activity in regulating cardiac performance, involving both the activin and the BMP pathways as well as gene-specific effects with both systemic and tissue-specific contributions.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) predictions from sequences surrounding non-coding variants and in vivo validation of cognate transcription factors (TFs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the workflow used for motifs analysis in the vicinity of the non-coding variants and comparison with TFBSs databases.

In addition, most variants (95%) were localized in non-coding regions of the genome.

However, oligo analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Helden et al., 1998</xref>) of the 150 bp sequences around these non-coding variants detected significant over-represented k-mers (Evalue ≤ 1e-4).

We identified enrichment of potential DNA binding motifs for both sets of traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

We previously reported that <italic>djun</italic> KD leads to altered HP and AI in young flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monnier et al., 2012</xref>), supporting a function for this stress-activated TF in the cardiac GRN.</p><p>We did not test individually the effects on cardiac performance of mutations in predicted TFBSs located near the SNPs because any individual effect would probably be too small to be detectable by the available methods.

Several studies have indeed shown that the within-line environmental variance of inbred lines is heritable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morgante et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harbison et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayroles et al., 2015</xref>). These genetic variations in phenotypic variability suggest that different genotypes respond differently in response to micro-environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geiler-Samerotte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anholt and Mackay, 2018</xref>). We used the Levene test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levene, 1960</xref> to examine heterogeneity of the ‘micro-environmental’ variance among lines for the seven analyzed cardiac traits. We found evidence of significant heterogeneity among the lines in the variance for all analyzed cardiac traits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that the lines differ in their ability to adapt to micro-environmental variations, and supports the heritability of this differing adaptability. The coefficient of within-line variation (CVe) was used as the metric for within-line environmental variance. We found significant genetic variation for all CVe traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) indicating that within some lines, individuals display relatively constant cardiac performance traits, whereas within others, individuals display widely varying cardiac traits. Similar to trait means, CVe traits were poorly correlated with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), except for HP/DI and EDD/ESD.

Overall, this led to the identification of 887 variants and 566 genes associated with natural variations of CVe of cardiac performance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3a</xref>), which were used for hypothesis generation and functional annotations. Although the number of individuals we were able to analyze – due to the experimental burden of analyzing individual cardiac phenotypes – reduced the statistical power of the analysis of micro-environmental variance, the functional enrichment analyses of variants and genes described below provide support for our association results and highlight important features of the genetic architecture of cardiac traits.</p><p>Consistent with the weak correlation between cardiac trait CVe and trait means, we found only three variants associated with both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3c</xref>). Two variants in total linkage disequilibrium (LD) (5 bp apart) are localized in an intron of <italic>Ca-β</italic>, encoding a voltage gated calcium channel subunit, and are associated for both mean and CVe of FS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3c</xref>). The other variant, highlighted by both GWAS, was situated at more than 25 kb away from any gene. Despite unraveling largely distinct set of variants, GWAS analyses on CVe and trait means are associated with two sets of genes that overlap significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3b</xref>). Among 566 detected respectively from trait CVe and 562 genes detected by trait mean GWAS, 92 genes are found associated with both (FC=5, hypergeometric pval=2.2 × 10<sup>–39</sup>). Therefore, a significant number of genes contribute to natural variation of both mean and CVe traits, although through distinct variants.</p><p>Within the CVe-associated genes we observed an over-representation of cell adhesion processes, transmembrane signaling, and ion channel activity (pval=1.6 × 10<sup>–8</sup> (FC=7), 1.1×10<sup>–3</sup> (FC=2,2), and 4.5×10<sup>–2</sup> (FC=2,5) respectively). Enriched cellular component annotations included cell-cell junction (pval=5.7 × 10<sup>–3</sup> (FC=3.2), receptor complexes (pval=3.3 × 10<sup>–4</sup> (FC=4.6), sarcolemma (pval=1.3 × 10<sup>–2</sup> (FC=25), as well as several annotations related to neuronal projections suggesting both cell autonomous and non-autonomous activity of related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3d</xref>). In addition, genes leading to stress-induced lethality upon heart-specific KD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neely et al., 2010</xref>) were significantly under-represented in this gene set (FC=0,6; p=0,05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3e</xref>). This may suggest that a significant proportion of CVe GWAS-associated genes affect cardiac trait variance non-cell autonomously. As for trait means, variants localized in the proximal region of the genes (0–1 kb upstream of TSS) are over-represented among SNPs associated with traits CVe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This suggested that natural variations of cardiac performance variance are also mainly affecting cis-regulatory regions. We also identified over-represented PSSMs in sequences within 150 pb of non-coding CVe variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Some of these identified PSSMs were specifically enriched in the sequences around CVe variants. This is the case for instance for Ladybird-early, Lbe, the fly orthologue of the mammalian LBX TF. However, several identified CVe PSSMs are similar to those identified in the vicinity of variants associated with trait means. This is the case for motifs predicted to be bound by Luna and Lola – variants of which are associated with CVe traits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3a</xref>) – and it is also the case for Klu and Mad. Therefore, similar to the situation described for trait means, natural variations of phenotypic plasticity of cardiac performance appears, for a large part, to be driven by modifications of gene regulatory networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Conserved features of natural variations of heart performance between flies and humans</title><p>Next, we compared our GWAS results for cardiac performance in flies with similar data in humans.

We first tested the effects of heart-specific KD on cardiac performance in flies using the in vivo assay. Both induced an increased heart rate (reduced HP and SI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) but did not affect other cardiac traits analyzed (not shown). The function of their human orthologues PAX9 and EGR2 was then tested in hiPSC-CMs. We asked whether siRNA-mediated KD affected action potential kinetics using a recently developed in vitro assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McKeithan et al., 2017</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>, both gene KDs induced shortening of the AP duration, thus suggesting conserved function in setting cardiac rhythm for both TFs. The effect was stronger for PAX9 KD and seems specific to the repolarization phase, as suggested by APD50 and 75 shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–I</xref>). APD shortening for PAX9 KD was coincident with increased expression of Na+ and K+ ion channels (<italic>SCN5A, KCNH2,</italic> and <italic>KNCQ1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), supporting the APD shortening phenotype.

From a fundamental perspective, natural selection is thought to operate on complex traits rather than on single genes, further illustrating the need to characterizing and understanding the genetic architecture of natural variations in cardiac performance. Although mammalian studies provide important information about the molecular and cellular basis of heart development and physiology, these systems are less suited to dissecting the relationship between naturally occurring genetic variations and variations in individual cardiac performance.</p><p>Here, we report on the quantitative genetics of cardiac performance in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We performed a standard GWAS of variants associated with cardiac trait looking at both within-line and intra-line variance for seven weakly correlated traits that also included an epistasis analysis. The cornerstone of our approach is a series of downstream analyses, which strongly implied that top hits are indeed genetic polymorphisms influencing quantitative variation in cardiac performance. These findings include: (i) the enrichment of pathways known to be related to cardiac development and physiology; (ii) the generation of an extensive network of protein-protein/genetic interactions that plausibly describes the architecture of cardiac performance; (iii) identification of significant overlap between gene occurrences for trait mean and variance; (iv) enrichment of likely causal variants near binding motifs for a set of cardiac-related TFs; (v) observation that several of these TFs are themselves GWAS candidate genes; and (vi) enrichment of fly genes for overlap with known human cardiac-related genes. In addition, we performed validation experiments that showed enrichment of cardiac effects for GWAS identified genes compared to randomly selected control genes. Importantly, we confirmed synergistic genetic interactions between the BMP and activin pathways; and defined two novel regulators of cardiac function that may well be relevant to human disease.</p><p>Our results therefore validate <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a unique model that permits the analysis of the etiology of the genetic foundations of cardiac function. Importantly, we identified many genes not previously associated with cardiac traits at the genetic, cellular, or molecular levels. This suggested that the space for natural variation associated with cardiac performance extends far beyond the genes and gene networks already identified as participating in the establishment and maintenance of cardiac function and illustrates the value of complementing classical genetic studies with an in-depth analysis of the genetic architecture of corresponding complex traits. A large number of candidate genes were validated in vivo using mutations or RNAi KD generated in unrelated genetic backgrounds, suggesting that the underlying biological processes are common to most genotypes.</p><p>Most of the variants identified affected non-coding regions of the genome. Recent studies in humans have highlighted that non-coding SNPs may affect the function of enhancers or promoters, thereby influencing the expression levels of surrounding or distant genes and which would explain how some non-coding SNPs may contribute to pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tak and Farnham, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kikuchi et al., 2019</xref>). Although we failed to find enriched potential TFBS at SNPs positions, extending the search space to sequences of ±75 bp around the variants revealed enriched DNA binding motifs, and pointed to potential roles for several TFBS. Our results indicate that variants likely affect sequences outside the core TF binding motif (e.g., flanking sequences) that in turn affect TF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grossman et al., 2017</xref>). Supporting our findings, different reports on human GWAS analyses have shown that many risk-associated SNPs are not precisely located in conserved TF binding motifs but are in nearby regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heinz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farh et al., 2015</xref>). Several observations indicate that our predictions are accurate: (i) a large number of similar motifs were independently predicted from distinct sets of variants, (ii) some predicted motifs correspond to TFs whose role during cardiogenesis or for the maintenance of cardiac function have already been characterized, (iii) several discovered motifs correspond to TFs for which SNPs were themselves associated with the variation of some of the cardiac traits studied, and (iv) a high percentage of predicted motifs were validated by testing their cognate TFs in vivo for cardiac performance. Of note, while the cardiac GRN has been extensively studied in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Seyres et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seyres et al., 2012</xref>), a large proportion of the TFBS and cognate factors identified in this study have not been previously characterized as cardiac TFs, again illustrating the complementary contribution represented by the analysis of the genetic architecture of these phenotypes compared to more classical genetic, molecular, and cellular studies.</p><p>Although rarely studied, the genetic control of phenotypic variability is of primary importance. Indeed, variability offers adaptive solutions to environmental changes and may impact developmental robustness to micro-environmental perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geiler-Samerotte et al., 2013</xref>). From a medical genetics point of view, highly variable genotypes may produce individuals beyond a phenotypic threshold, leading to disease state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morgante et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibson, 2009</xref>). Having assessed the cardiac traits for multiple individuals from inbred lines, we were able to examine phenotypic variability among individuals with the same genotypes and therefore to analyze how natural variations impinge on such complex traits. Our results indeed highlight the important contribution that genetic control of variability can play in our understanding of the cause of phenotypic variation. An important feature concerns the nature of the variants and associated genes compared to trait means. In particular, genes identified by a global screen for genes cell autonomously affecting cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neely et al., 2010</xref>) are under-represented among the genes associated with CVe traits. This suggests that this subset of genes influences the variance of cardiac traits in a cell non-autonomous manner. The separation between variants associated with trait means and those associated with the variance of the same traits was another remarkable feature of the genetic architecture of cardiac phenotypic plasticity. Although based on non-overlapping sets of non-coding regions, predictions of TFBS in the vicinity of non-coding variants identified overlapping sets of motifs. This suggests that natural variation of trait means and trait variance affect partially overlapping GRNs, albeit by distinct polymorphisms. Our analysis allowed us to identify common variants associated with phenotypic variability, and to identify essential characteristics of the genetic architecture of these traits. However, we cannot exclude that part of the observed variability is due also to rare alleles in partial LD with the lead associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ek et al., 2018</xref>) or to within-line accumulation of mutations. Nevertheless, the former is likely to be marginal, given the rapid decay of LD with local physical distance in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mackay and Huang, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Several previous studies have established that the principles identified on the DGRP population are universal and can be applied across phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anholt and Mackay, 2018</xref>). In particular, the identification of human genes orthologous to those identified by GWAS in the DGRP may allow identification of a translational blueprint and prioritize candidate genes for focused studies in human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carbone et al., 2016</xref>). Our results provide additional support that the genetic architecture of quantitative traits is conserved. Indeed, a remarkable characteristic of the gene sets associated either with trait means or with trait variance is that they are both enriched for orthologues of human genes that are also associated with disorders affecting the cardiovascular system. This is a strong argument for considering that the genetic architecture of cardiac performance traits is conserved, at least in part, from flies to humans. Hence, the features learned from our study in flies should help reveal the characteristics of the natural variations of cardiac performance in human populations. One intriguing observation is that genes associated with intra-genotypic variance are highly significantly enriched for orthologues of human genes associated with cardiac disorders. Yet, GWAS on human populations are not designed to test the variants involved in intra-genotypic variations. One possible explanation may be that GWAS in humans can pick up variants that do not necessarily affect the mean of cardiac traits, but that cause extreme phenotypes in some individuals by affecting genes that function as buffers.</p><p>The high proportion of orthologous genes identified in GWAS in both flies and humans – for cardiac traits in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and for cardiac disorders in humans – suggested that our results in flies may accelerate discovery of causal genes in humans. We suggest that our study may be used as an aid in prioritizing genes at loci identified by GWAS for cardiac pathologies in humans. Indeed, we show that our data allow identification of new actors that have a conserved role in cardiac function from flies to humans. Although not previously revealed by conventional approaches, we show that <italic>poxm</italic> and <italic>sr</italic> – two genes identified by GWAS as being associated with natural variations of cardiac traits – have a conserved function in the regulation of cardiac activity.</p><p>In summary, the analysis of natural variations of cardiac performance in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, combined with functional validations in vivo and in hiPSC-CM, represents a major advance in understanding the mechanisms underlying the genetic architecture of these complex traits, and holds promise for the identification of the genes and mechanisms underlying cardiac disorders in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Flies’ strains and husbandry</title><p>Fly strains were obtained from the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center or the Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> Resource Center.

The authors utilized the RNAi-mediated knockdown approach in their functional validation studies. It is not clear how each genetic variation (SNP) affects its associated genes. Could some of the SNPs activate the candidate gene expression? For the 4 candidate genes that failed to show cardiac defects, could the overexpression of these 4 genes alter cardiac performance?</p></disp-quote><p>Of course, we cannot predict direction of the effect of the variants on the function of the genes. In this context, loss-of-function experiments are subjected to a risk of false negatives. It is indeed possible that in the case of a lack of effect of the loss of function, a gain of function could reveal an effect. But gain-of-function experiments are difficult to control, and often subjected to non-specific effects because it is complicated to control the level of over-expression compared to endogenous expression. This did not seem suitable for an extensive analysis of a large number of genes.

To do so they examine heterozygotes for sog, a repressor of BMP signaling, and snoo, an activator of Activin pathway. The data from the snoo/sog heterozygote is compelling in its disruption of heart phenotypes, and the authors conclude a &quot;coordinated action of activin and BMP.&quot; snoo, however, also works as a transcriptional repressor in the BMP pathway, so it's possible that the effects the authors are seeing here could be confined to an increase in BMP signaling. Unlike snoo and sog, mutations in babo and dpp are both expected to have negative effects on Activin and BMP signaling, respectively. The babo/dpp interaction is not as quantitatively convincing as the snoo/sog data, despite the integral roles both babo and dpp play in their respective pathways. If both pathways are connected, why do snoo/sog heterozygotes affect SI phenotypes, while babo/dpp heterozygotes affect fractional shortening? I think the authors data suggest an interesting potential interaction between these pathways, which could be confirmed by examining further mutant combinations, knockdowns or increased expression transgenes, but falls short of a &quot;confirmed synergystic genetic interaction.&quot; It does, however, underscore the value of the data in the paper for opening up new avenues for future study.</p></disp-quote><p>(and reviewer 1 comments 3 and 5).</p><p>These comments led us to reconsider the analysis of the phenotypes associated with loss of function of the TGFb pathway, and to analyze other pathway components combinations.</p><p>We acknowledge reviewer 3 criticisms on <italic>snoo/sog</italic> experiments, which are difficult to interpret given the broad action <italic>snoo</italic> may have on both BMP and activin pathways. We have addressed this in the result section.</p><p>We have also analyzed other allelic combinations of BMP and activin pathways components, which strengthen the analysis performed on <italic>dpp/babo</italic>. Indeed, we tested <italic>babo/tkv</italic> heterozygotes (respectively specific activin and BMP receptors) and found significant genetic interactions for ESD and EDD. Albeit non-significant, <italic>babo/tkv</italic> double heterozygotes display a tendency to non-additive effects on FS (p= 0,054). <italic>mad/smox</italic> heterozygotes (respectively specific downstream TFs of BMP and activin pathways) display interactions (non-additive effects) on HP, SI, DI, ESD and EDD. These new results (Supplemental Figure 4) are thus supporting the hypothesis of genetic interactions between the pathways, but also reveal, as suggested by reviewer 3, a complex relationship between both pathways since interactions are revealed for specific traits in each of the mutant combinations analyzed.</p><p>The phenotypes related to the individual loss of function of each of the actors of these pathways (<italic>dpp</italic>, <italic>tkv</italic> and <italic>mad</italic> for BMP; <italic>babo</italic> and <italic>smox</italic> for activin) are however very similar. When they have an effect, heterozygous amorphic alleles of these genes display increased phenotypes related to rhythmicity (HP, DI, SI, AI) and FS, but decreased cardiac diameters (ESD and EDD).</p><p>Finally, as pointed out by reviewer 1, the picture is certainly even more complex since the phenotypes of RNAi mediated heart specific loss of function are not always similar to those of systemic loss of function. Indeed, <italic>mad</italic> RNAi causes a reduction of HP, DI, SI and FS (Figure S5) whereas heterozygotes for <italic>mad<sup>12</sup></italic> have either no or opposite effect on these phenotypes, and <italic>mad</italic> RNAi causes a significative increase in AI whereas <italic>mad<sup>12</sup></italic> has no effect (Figure S4). The discrepancy between tissue specific RNAi and heterozygous background was also found in the case of <italic>dpp</italic>, but specifically for the FS. Indeed, as suggested by reviewer 1 we have analyzed the loss of function of <italic>dpp</italic> by heart-specific RNAi. <italic>dpp</italic> RNAi results in a reduction of the FS (like <italic>mad</italic> RNAi) whereas the loss of function in the whole-body results in an increase of the FS.</p><p>We therefore re-wrote the whole corresponding section of the results and modified Figure S4 to include <italic>babo/tkv; smox/mad</italic> and <italic>dpp</italic> RNAi data.</p><p>“We further focused on the TGFb pathway, since members of both BMP and activin pathways were identified in our analyses. We tested different members of the TGFb pathway for cardiac phenotypes using cardiac specific RNAi knockdown (Figure 2C), and confirmed the involvement of the activin agonist <italic>snoo</italic> (Ski orthologue) and the BMP antagonist <italic>sog</italic> (chordin orthologue). Notably, Activin and BMP pathways are usually antagonistic (Figure 2D). Their joint identification in our GWAS suggest that they act in a coordinated fashion to regulate heart function. Alternatively, it may simply reflect their involvement in different aspects of cardiac development and/or functional maturation. In order to discriminate between these two hypotheses, we tested if different components of these pathways interacted genetically. Single heterozygotes for loss of function alleles show dosage-dependent effects of <italic>snoo</italic> and <italic>sog</italic> on several phenotypes, providing an independent confirmation of their involvement in several cardiac traits (Figure S4). Importantly, compared to each single heterozygotes, <italic>snoo<sup>BSC234</sup>/ sog<sup>U2</sup></italic> double heterozygotes flies showed non additive SI phenotypes (two-way ANOVA p val: 2,1 10-7) suggesting a genetic interaction (Figure 2E and Figure S4A). It is worth noting however that <italic>snoo</italic> is also a transcriptional repressor of the BMP pathway (PMID: 16951053). The effect observed in <italic>snoo<sup>BSC234</sup>/ sog<sup>U2</sup></italic> double heterozygotes can therefore alternatively arise as a consequence of an increased BMP signaling without affecting the activin pathway. We thus tested other allelic combinations for loss of function alleles of BMP and activin pathways. <italic>babo/tkv</italic> heterozygotes (respectively activin and BMP type 1 receptors) displayed non additive ESD and EDD phenotypes (Figure S4C). Synergistic interaction of BMP and activin pathways was also suggested by the analysis of fractional shortening in loss of function mutants for <italic>babo</italic> and <italic>dpp</italic>, the BMP ligand (Figure S4B). Of note, <italic>babo/tkv</italic> double heterozygotes also displayed a tendency to non-additive effects on FS albeit non-significant (two-way anova p= 0,054). In addition, <italic>mad/smox</italic> heterozygotes (specifc downstream TFs of BMP and activin pathways) displayed non-additive effects on several traits, including phenotypes related to rhythmicity (HP, SI, DI) and contractility (ESD and EDD) (Figure S4D). Altogether, cardiac performance in response to allelic combinations of activin and BMP supported a coordinated action of both pathways in the establishment and/or maintenance of cardiac activity. This was further supported by the observation that simple heterozygotes for the tested loss of function alleles displayed similar trends with respect to cardiac performance, irrespective of the pathway considered (<italic>dpp, tkv</italic> and <italic>mad</italic> for BMP; <italic>babo</italic> and <italic>smox</italic> for activin). Indeed, they displayed either no effect or increased fractional shortening and rhythmicity phenotypes (HP, DI, SI, AI), and decreased cardiac diameters (ESD and EDD). This suggests coordinated activity of both pathways. Importantly, the genetic interactions were tested using amorphic alleles that lead to systemic loss of function. The observed phenotypes may thus not unravel cardiac specific effects of the pathways. In support of this, <italic>mad</italic> cardiac specific RNAi knock down was tested (see below, Figure S5) and lead to a decreased HP, DI, SI and FS whereas heterozygotes for <italic>mad<sup>12</sup></italic> have either no (FS) or opposite (HP, DI, SI) effect on these phenotypes (Figure S4D). Inversely, <italic>mad</italic> RNAi caused a significant increase in AI whereas <italic>mad<sup>12</sup></italic> had no effect. However, heart specific <italic>dpp</italic> RNAi knock down (Figure S4E) lead to similar phenotypic trends compared to <italic>dpp<sup>d14</sup></italic> (increased HP, DI, SI, decreased EDD and ESD) with the notable exception of FS which was reduced following cardiac specific KD (Figure S4E), but increased in <italic>dpp<sup>d14</sup></italic> heterozygotes (Figure S4B). Taken together, these data point to a complex picture of TGFb pathway activity in regulating cardiac performance, involving both the activin and the BMP pathways as well as gene specific effects with both systemic and tissue-specific contributions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>There is an enormous amount of data in this paper, but there are places where things are summarized a little too briefly.

The arrhythmia index (AI, std-dev(HP)/mean (HP)) is used to evaluate the variability of the cardiac rhythm. In addition, 3 traits related to contractility were measured.
