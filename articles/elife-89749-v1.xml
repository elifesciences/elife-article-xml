conferring plant resistance to these pathogens. Aiming to identify genetic associations with responses to infection, we screened a large panel of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> natural inbred lines for four disease-related traits caused by infection by <italic>A. thaliana</italic>-naïve and -adapted isolates of the natural pathogen turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). We detected a strong, replicable association in a 1.5 Mb region on chromosome 2 with a 10-fold increase in relative risk of systemic necrosis. The region contains several plausible causal genes as well as abundant structural variation, including an insertion of a <italic>Copia</italic> transposon into a Toll/interleukin receptor (TIR-NBS-LRR) coding for a gene involved in defense, that could be either a driver or a consequence of the disease-resistance locus. When inoculated with TuMV, loss-of-function mutant plants of this gene exhibited different symptoms than wild-type plants. The direction and severity of symptom differences depended on the adaptation history of the virus. This increase in symptom severity was specific for infections with the adapted isolate. Necrosis-associated alleles are found worldwide, and their distribution is consistent with a trade-off between resistance during viral outbreaks and a cost of resistance otherwise, leading to negative frequency-dependent selection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>emerging viruses</kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>frequency-dependent selection</kwd><kwd>GWAS</kwd><kwd>Potyvirus</kwd><kwd>resistance genes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2019-103998GB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elena</surname><given-names>Santiago F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003359</institution-id><institution>Generalitat Valenciana</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PROMETEO/2019/012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elena</surname><given-names>Santiago F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BES-2016-077078</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Ruben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC AdG 789037 - EPICLINES</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nordborg</surname><given-names>Magnus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Osterreichischer Wissenschaftsfonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FWF I 3684-B25</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nordborg</surname><given-names>Magnus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines were screened for resistance to TuMV, identifying a region on chromosome 2 linked to necrosis that includes an antiviral gene.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant viruses represent an enormous threat to crop yields and food security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tomlinson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oerke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones, 2021</xref>). Infected plants are difficult to treat and cure, so it is of vital importance to identify genetic material that is resistant to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monnot et al., 2021</xref>). In spite of this, the genetic architecture of plant responses to viral infections has received much less attention than the response to bacterial and fungal pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartoli and Roux, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monnot et al., 2021</xref>). In agricultural settings, plants are predominantly grown as monocultures, which results in more virulent and specialized viruses that cause more detrimental effects on the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McDonald and Stukenbrock, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">González et al., 2019</xref>). Through their specialization in one host species, viruses also evolve better counter defenses than their naïve counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brosseau et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the response of the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (L.) <sc>Heynh</sc> to its pathogen TuMV (TuMV; species <italic>Turnip mosaic virus</italic>, genus <italic>Potyvirus</italic>, family <italic>Potyviridae</italic>). Potyviruses affect a wide variety of crops, especially from the families <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> and <italic>Solanaceae</italic>, and are among the most widespread crop pathogens worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Revers and García, 2015</xref>). TuMV is among the most damaging of the potyviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tomlinson, 1987</xref>), and also has a high incidence in wild populations of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pagán et al., 2010</xref>). The extensive genetic resources available in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> make it a useful system for investigating mechanisms of viral resistance in plants. In addition, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> belongs to the same family (<italic>Brassicaceae</italic>) as agriculturally important crops such as cauliflower, cabbage, turnip, or rapeseed; thus, a large array of relevant crop viruses can infect and be studied in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pagán et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ouibrahim and Caranta, 2013</xref>). Viral outbreaks are frequent in natural populations of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, and there is substantial genetic variation in resistance, indicating that viral coevolution represents a meaningful selection pressure in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pagán et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Several previous genome-wide association (GWA) studies of the response of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> to viral infection have been carried out. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rubio et al., 2019</xref> used TuMV and 317 lines grown under field conditions, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Butković et al., 2021</xref> also used TuMV but 450 lines were kept in laboratory conditions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Montes et al., 2021</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2022</xref> used 156 and 496 inbred lines, respectively, to measure the response of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> to infection by cucumber mosaic virus under controlled conditions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoffmann et al., 2023</xref> used 100 inbred lines to study the response of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> to infection by cauliflower mosaic virus. These studies have demonstrated that genetic variation for virus response exists, and that individual loci with large effects on virus response segregate in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> populations.</p><p>Here, we report the results of GWA studies using two isolates of TuMV and one of the largest sets of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (1050) inbred lines studied so far. We compare an ‘ancestral’ isolate of TuMV that was obtained from a calla lily (<italic>Zantedeschia</italic> sp.) and was naïve to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2003</xref>)<italic>,</italic> to its ‘evolved’ descendant that had been submitted to 12 serial passages of experimental evolution on <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Col-0 line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">González et al., 2019</xref>). The two virus isolates differ in two non-synonymous mutations fixed during their adaptation to Col-0 and in their infection phenotypes. The evolved virus has mutations in amino acids T1293I (cylindrical inclusion protein; CI) and N2039H (viral genome-linked protein; VPg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Navarro et al., 2022</xref>). CI is involved in viral genome replication and cell-to-cell movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deng et al., 2015</xref>), and has been shown to interact with the photosystem I PSI-K protein in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiménez et al., 2006</xref>). VPg protein is involved in replication and intracellular movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), and is a hub for interactions with other viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bosque et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martínez et al., 2023</xref>). Mutations in VPg have been pervasively observed in evolution experiments of potyviruses in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, in all cases resulting in increased infectivity, virulence and viral load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agudelo-Romero et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hillung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">González et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Navarro et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambrós et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Melero et al., 2023</xref>). We aim to identify plant genes that play a role in TuMV infection and whether some of these genes may respond differentially to each viral isolate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stronger disease phenotypes in response to the evolved TuMV isolate</title><p>We inoculated 1050 lines of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso-Blanco et al., 2016</xref>) with the ancestral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2003</xref>) or evolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">González et al., 2019</xref>) isolates of TuMV and characterized the response to each one based on four phenotypes: (<italic>i</italic>) infectivity (proportion of plants showing symptoms), (<italic>ii</italic>) AUDPS (area under the disease progress stairs), a measure of disease progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Simko and Piepho, 2012</xref>), (<italic>iii</italic>) severity of symptoms on a semi-quantitative scale from 0 to 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Butković et al., 2020</xref>), and (<italic>iv</italic>) necrosis (a binary trait reflecting presence/absence of systemic necrosis, or stage 5 of the severity-of-symptoms scale). We did not measure viral accumulation, but note this is significantly correlated with the intensity of symptoms within the Col-0 line (Corrêa et al. 2020), although it is not clear if this correlation occurs in all lines. Furthermore, throughout the manuscript, we refer to necrosis as the most severe stage of infection: systemic necrosis that results in the death of the plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) rather than to the hypersensitive response that induces local necrotic spots and limits the spread of a pathogen. As a negative control, we mock-inoculated 2100 plants in the same trays as the treated plants and did not observe disease symptoms in any case, indicating that there was no cross-contamination between plants.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Disease phenotypes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the scale used to evaluate the severity of symptoms: (0) no symptoms or healthy plant (1) mild symptoms without chlorosis, (2) visible chlorosis, (3) advanced chlorosis, (4) strong chlorosis and incipient necrosis, (5) necrosis and death of the plant.

Traits showed low to moderate SNP heritability, with a stronger correlation between genotype and severity of symptoms and necrosis in response to the evolved virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This shows that phenotyping was repeatable, and the disease traits measured show genetic variation.</p><p>Lines infected with the evolved isolate showed more severe disease symptoms than those infected with the ancestral one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–G</xref>). We assessed phenotype differences using linear models that account for cohort effects, and calculated <italic>p</italic>-values by permutation. On average, we found a 37% increase in AUDPS (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), a 27% increase in infectivity (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), and a 23% increase in severity of symptoms (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). We also found a 31% increase in necrosis, although this is not statistically significant when cohort effects are taken into account (<italic>p</italic>=0.08). On average, the history of adaptation to Col-0 is associated with increased virulence across the panel of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> inbred lines studied here.</p><p>Despite this overall trend, there was substantial variation in the direction of effects between lines. Although necrosis was highly repeatable between viral isolates, we found only moderate correlations for AUDPS, infectivity, and severity of symptoms in response to the two isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, diagonal elements). When comparing the responses of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> lines to the evolved isolate relative to the ancestral one, 53.21% of lines exhibited increased infectivity, 23.08% showed the same level of infection, and 23.70% were less infected by the evolved virus. In terms of disease progression (AUDPS values), the evolved viral strain performed better in 64.49% of the lines, the same in 9.25%, and worse than the ancestral strain in 26.25%. Two lines exhibited no necrosis in response to the evolved isolate, despite previously showing necrosis when exposed to the ancestral virus. Conversely, 14 lines that did not display necrosis for the ancestral virus exhibited necrosis when infected by the evolved isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–L</xref>). Adaptation of TuMV to Col-0 thus tends to enhance the virus efficacy in other lines but does not guarantee increased infectivity across the range of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> lines, pointing to a complex interaction between viral isolates and plant genotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A strong genetic association with necrosis and severity of symptoms on chromosome 2</title><p>We used the multi-trait GWA analysis implemented in the software package LIMIX to identify individual genetic loci that correlate with the response to each TuMV isolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lippert et al., 2014</xref>).

Lines with the less frequent (henceforth ‘minor’) allele at the most strongly associated SNP showed 23.2- and 11.9-fold increase in necrosis, as well as a 1.83- and 1.75-fold increase in severity of symptoms in response to the ancestral and evolved isolates, respectively.

First, we repeated the experimental procedure using 51 lines that showed systemic necrosis in the initial experiment and 65 that did not test the hypothesis that the observed association is a coincidence due to the small number of necrotic lines.

Six of these associations were common responses to both viral isolates and seven with isolate-specific responses.

However, minor-allele frequencies at all but one of these loci are below 5%, and the presence of the strong association on chromosome 2 may cause false-positive associations at other loci. We, therefore, repeated the GWA analysis, including the genotype at the most strongly associated SNP as a cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Segura et al., 2012</xref>). This revealed two loci with a significant association with the common response to both viruses, and eight loci with a virus-specific response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>). All but one (chromosome 4 position 273,465) of the isolate-specific associations overlapped between the analyses with and without the major association on chromosome 2.

We tried to genotype the presence/absence of this element in the full sample using short-read sequencing data, but this turned out to be unachievable due to the repetitiveness of the sequence (see Materials and methods). Among those lines for which PacBio genomes are available, there was a marked increase in severity of symptoms for lines with the TE insert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Nine and ten lines showed necrosis in response to the ancestral and evolved viral isolates respectively, corresponding to a 23- and 21-fold increase in risk of necrosis for lines with this insertion.

This observation is curious, because we would expect selection to limit the spread of deleterious mutations. To investigate whether this broad spatial distribution could be due to chance, we quantified the mean geographic distance between lines with the minor allele at this SNP, as well as each of the most strongly associated SNPs in the other peaks identified by GWA for necrosis that were significant after accounting for the major association as a cofactor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We then compared these distances to the mean distances between lines with the minor allele at 10,000 randomly chosen loci with similar minor allele counts. For most associated loci, distances between lines with susceptible alleles are well within the distribution of randomly chosen loci, consistent with genetic drift allowing minor alleles to reach modest frequency on a local spatial scale. In contrast, lines harboring the minor alleles at the strong association on chromosome 2 are further apart on average than 98.5% of randomly chosen alleles at similar frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This allele is found at a similar frequency in all but three admixture groups identified by reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso-Blanco et al., 2016</xref>), so this overdispersion cannot be accounted for by an association with a particular ancestry with a high dispersal rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We found similar spatial overdispersion for the associated loci on chromosome 4 at positions 273,465 and 7,917,355.

Upon inoculation of 18 other lines, they observed that the evolved isolate exhibited greater infectivity compared to the ancestral one. However, using a much larger panel of lines, we also found substantial variation in both the magnitude and direction of the response to the two viral lineages between the inbred lines, showing that adaptation to one genotype results in a complex response across host genotypes. Subsequent plant-viral co-evolution is thus likely to depend on the range of host genotypes the virus encounters and, hence, the extent to which it is able to specialize.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The genetic architecture of TuMV resistance</title><p>We identified a 1.5 Mb region on chromosome 2 that was strongly associated with the severity of symptoms and necrosis. This region encompasses several genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2a</xref>), two of which are especially strong candidates for causing these phenotypes. First, <italic>AT2G14080</italic> encodes a known TIR-NBS-LRR family protein. These proteins recognize and block translation of viral transcripts in the cytoplasm, induce a hypersensitive response leading to cell death, act as a second line of defense if the initial antiviral response fails to restrict virus accumulation, and are involved in signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meyers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhattacharjee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kobayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van de Weyer et al., 2019</xref>). TIR-NBS-LRR genes are the most numerous disease-resistance genes in the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome and are under diversifying selection to respond to as broad a spectrum of pathogens as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ellis et al., 2000</xref>). This gene appears to have a significant role in the development of systemic necrosis during infection with both TuMV strains. Second, <italic>DRP3B</italic> encodes a self-assembling GTPase involved in fission and fusion of membranes in mitochondria and peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fujimoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Its analog, <italic>DRP2B,</italic> has been shown to be co-opted by TuMV to enhance virulence, and treatment with dynamin-specific inhibitors suppresses growth by interfering with VPg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). As previously noted, one of the two amino-acid differences between the ancestral and evolved TuMV isolates is in VPg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Navarro et al., 2022</xref>). These observations make <italic>AT2G14080</italic> and <italic>DRP3B</italic> strong candidate genes for a role in viral resistance, either independently or in tandem.</p><p>To test this possibility, we inoculated the ancestral and evolved isolates into KO mutants <italic>at2g14080</italic> and <italic>drp3b</italic>. We observed that loss of function of <italic>AT2G14080</italic> led to increased disease symptoms in response to the ancestral virus, but not the evolved virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This suggests that <italic>AT2G14080</italic> is efficient for the antiviral defense against the ancestral but not for the evolved isolate. The evolved viral isolate may be able to overcome the response imposed by <italic>AT2G14080</italic> due to the mutations acquired during its adaptation to Col-0, most probably because changes in the VPg viral protein allow it to evade detection by the TIR-NBS-LRR protein encoded by <italic>AT2G14080</italic>. In contrast, loss of function of <italic>DRP3B</italic> decreased symptoms relative to those in Col-0 in response to the evolved, but not the ancestral virus. This points to a possible proviral effect of the dynamin <italic>DRP3B</italic>. Potyviruses are able to recruit <italic>DRP2B</italic>, a homolog of <italic>DRP3B</italic>, for the viral replication complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). One explanation for the reduction in symptoms in <italic>drp3b</italic> plants is that the evolved isolate acquired the ability to co-opt <italic>DRP3B</italic> in a similar way to <italic>DRP2B</italic>, in a way that the ancestral isolate does not. Whether these two loci act independently or in an epistatic manner should be considered as a possibility, considering the complex interplay between viral genetic factors and environmental cues in determining the phenotypic outcomes of viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bomblies et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lalić and Elena, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Thirteen additional loci (besides the major association on chromosome 2) were significantly associated with the common or specific responses to the two viral isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>). The low linkage disequilibrium between these loci indicates that they segregate independently of the major association on chromosome 2, and of each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, minor alleles are also at very low global frequencies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>). On the one hand, this is consistent with the expectation that selection against such deleterious alleles keeps susceptible alleles rare. On the other hand, there is a substantial risk that alleles at such low frequency should be associated with a binary phenotype at a similar frequency just by chance. As such, caution is warranted in interpreting a causative role for these associations without further evidence.</p><p>We found very little overlap with associations found in two previous GWA studies of TuMV resistance in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Butković et al., 2021</xref> identified genome-wide associations for AUDPS, severity of symptoms, and infectivity under very similar experimental conditions to those used here, but using two viral isolates that differed in their host range (one evolved as a specialist in more permissive <italic>A. thaliana</italic> lines and the other evolved as a generalist able to successfully infect more resistant lines) and fewer host lines. That analysis recovered the association with <italic>AT2G14080</italic> for both isolates, and identified eleven additional loci associated with the response to one or both viruses. These eleven loci identified were not recovered in our larger dataset. This lack of consistency can either indicate that these associations were spurious artifacts of a limited sample size or, alternatively, a true biological effect due to the different TuMV isolates used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Butković et al., 2021</xref> and in this study. Second, we did not detect any of the genes associated with viral load or infectivity in 317 lines grown under field conditions identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rubio et al., 2019</xref>, and nor did that study detect the association on chromosome 2 reported here. In this case, the lack of overlap may be explained not only by the differences in sample sizes, but also by the differences in traits measured, viral isolate, and environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The <italic>Copia</italic>-element insertion is a candidate causative variant</title><p>We identified a <italic>Copia-</italic>element polymorphism in the first intron of <italic>AT2G14080</italic> which is strongly associated with severity of symptoms, and especially necrosis. Given this strong association, and the fact that first introns often harbor regulatory elements affecting transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gallegos and Rose, 2017</xref>), this insertion is a strong candidate for a causative mutation. We note also that it need not be the only causal mutation. Whether it turns out to be casual or not, the abundance of structural variation in this region highlights the need for restraint when trying to identify any causal polymorphisms from SNP data alone, and more generally the limitation of reference-biased polymorphism data.</p><p>It is also interesting to consider whether structural variation is driven by selection for diversification of resistance genes, or whether particular structural variants themselves cause variation in disease resistance. It has been previously observed that plant disease-resistance genes often form clusters of duplicated copies within the genome, which would contribute to structural variation between genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leister, 2004</xref>). In particular, TIR-NBS-LRR genes, of which <italic>AT2G14080</italic> is an example, are known to have undergone expansion by numerous large- and small-scale duplication and translocation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leister, 2004</xref>). However, we did not observe widespread duplications of <italic>AT2G14080</italic> or its domains, nor evidence of synteny with other regions of the genome that would indicate translocations, so in this case, a simple transposon insertion remains the most likely explanation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The distribution of susceptible alleles is consistent with frequency-dependent selection</title><p>Given that potyvirus outbreaks are common in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pagán et al., 2010</xref>) and susceptibility to symptomatic infection can be deleterious, it is curious that alleles associated with increase disease symptoms should be at sufficiently high frequency to be detectable. There are three possible explanations for this. First, selection may be sufficiently weak or the virus geographically restricted, such that alleles can arise in one location and increase in frequency by genetic drift. If this were true, we would expect to see a clustered geographic distribution of susceptible alleles, reflected in under dispersion of distances between pairs of susceptible lines. While this is true for most of the loci with small effects on necrosis, susceptible alleles at the major association on chromosome 2 are spatially over-dispersed worldwide, and found throughout unrelated lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These patterns are thus difficult to explain via genetic drift. Second, it may be that the genomic instability in the region surrounding this association leads to a high turnover of new structural mutations that decrease viral resistance. This is implausible because this would not generate a linkage with individual SNPs that could be detected by GWA. Moreover, we found a striking concordance between a single <italic>Copia</italic>-element insertion into <italic>AT2G14080</italic> and necrosis, suggesting that only a single variant is responsible for increased necrosis in this region. Neither genetic drift nor mutation-selection balance can thus explain the persistence of susceptible alleles at the major association for necrosis.</p><p>An alternative explanation is that susceptible alleles are beneficial in the absence of the virus. This would cause a fitness trade-off between alleles in this region, as has been previously demonstrated for many other pathogen-resistance systems in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergelson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Todesco et al., 2010</xref>). TuMV outbreaks are common in natural <italic>A. thaliana</italic> populations, but ephemeral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pagán et al., 2010</xref>), causing susceptible alleles to decrease in frequency during outbreaks, but to increase at other times. This would lead to negative frequency-dependent selection maintaining the susceptible allele at a frequency in proportion to the frequency of TuMV outbreaks. Despite being at low frequency worldwide, the susceptible allele is found across the geographic and genealogical distribution of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, indicating that the polymorphism must either be very old and has been maintained by balancing selection over long periods, or that alleles have spread by adaptive introgression during viral outbreaks. Our data do not allow us to distinguish between these hypotheses, nor are they mutually exclusive, but both are consistent with a fitness trade-off at this locus. Our results indicate that the worldwide geographic distribution of susceptible alleles is, therefore, consistent with negative frequency-dependent selection maintaining the susceptible allele at low, but non-zero, frequency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Viruses and inoculation procedure</title><p>We obtained the ancestral virus from infected <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> <sc>Domin</sc> plants inoculated with a transcript product from a p35STunos infectious plasmid that contains TuMV genome cDNA (GenBank line AF530055.2), corresponding to YC5 isolate from calla lily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2003</xref>).

For AUDPS, we log-transformed the data to improve normality, and fitted a GLM with a Gaussian link function. For severity of symptoms, we applied a cumulative link model with a logit link function using the R package ‘ordinal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christensen RHB, 2022</xref>). Because p-value estimation is sensitive to departures from normality on the scale of the link function, we calculated a null distribution for the difference due to viral isolate by permutation.

The (one-sided) p-value is then the proportion of permuted samples with a greater difference in phenotype between the two viral isolates than was found for the observed data.

LIMIX assesses the response to each virus jointly, and identifies loci associated with (<italic>i</italic>) a shared response to both viruses, and (<italic>ii</italic>) specific responses to individual viral isolates.</p><p>We looked for associations with the 10,709,949 SNPs published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso-Blanco et al., 2016</xref>. We used a liberal minor-allele-frequency cut-off of 3% to allow us to detect rare variants associated with necrosis, since only 3.7% and 4.9% of lines showed necrosis in response to the ancestral and evolved TuMV isolates respectively, leaving 2,257,599 SNPs. We accounted for cohort effects by including these as fixed cofactors, and for population structure by modeling the covariance between lines due to relatedness as a random effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergelson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kang et al., 2008</xref>).

This confirmation cohort was inoculated and grown in the same way as the four previous cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Knock-out lines</title><p>We assessed disease resistance for knock-out (KO) mutants for two candidate genes within the region associated with necrosis and severity of symptoms. <italic>AT2G14080</italic> encodes for a TIR-NBS-LRR protein, and <italic>AT2G14120</italic> for the DRP3B protein. We ordered T-DNA knock-out (KO) mutants from the NASC stock center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arabidopsis.info/BrowsePage">http://arabidopsis.info/BrowsePage</ext-link>). We chose mutants that (<italic>i</italic>) were to be in the Col-0 background, (<italic>ii</italic>) had T-DNA inserts that cause gene knock-outs, (<italic>iii</italic>) were homozygous, and (<italic>iv</italic>) had already been related to virus infection and selected SALK homozygous line SALK_105230 C (NASC ID: N656836) to study <italic>AT2G14080</italic> and SALK_112233 C (N667049) for <italic>DRP3B</italic>. We grew mutant and wild-type plants as previously described with 10 replicates per mutant/control, as well as two replicates of mock-inoculated controls. We visually inspected inoculated plants daily for 21 dpi noting the number of infected plants and the severity of their symptoms.

We extracted sequences around the peak of association, close to <italic>AT2G14080</italic>. We identified the precise location of that gene, as well as eight annotated genes and transposable elements on each side from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.araport.org/">Araport 11 database</ext-link>, using BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Camacho et al., 2009</xref>) if they showed 70% identity and were at least 70% of the length of the gene or transposable element in the reference genome. When comparing whole genomes, it is not meaningful to plot SNP positions with the coordinate system of a reference genome, so to visualize the results we plotted haplotypes on a relative scale centered at the midpoint between <italic>AT2G14080</italic> and <italic>AT2G14120</italic> (<italic>DRP3B</italic>), since these genes were largely syntenic between lines and flanked most of the region associated with necrosis. Finally, we sorted lines based on the distance between those two genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the insertions observed in the necrotic/susceptible lines 351, 870, 7346, and 9102, we mapped the raw PacBio reads to the new assembly using Minimap2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li and Alkan, 2021</xref>) with the option ‘-ax map-pb’ and checked if any breaks coincided with the insertion position that would suggest an artifact of the assembly. This was not the case.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Genotyping the insertion in the 1001 Genomes</title><p>We attempted to confirm the presence of the insertion in the full sample using existing short-read sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso-Blanco et al., 2016</xref>). We used multiple approaches, all based on the flanking sequence of the insertion. First, using two different mappers, bwa-mem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>) and bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>), we mapped all the short-read data to the insertion sequence plus 5 Kb of flanking sequence (on either side) from line 870, filtering the bam files using samtools ‘rmdup’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonfield et al., 2021</xref>) to remove duplicates. For each line, the number of paired reads mapping to each side of the insertion borders were extracted and counted. We assumed that the presence of such reads would confirm the presence of the insertion, whereas lines without the insertion would only have paired reads flanking the whole insertion. However, the mapping quality at the flanking regions was too low for this approach to work. Many flanking regions had no coverage from short-read sequencing (even when duplicated reads were kept). The reasons for this are not clear, but presumably reflect high levels of repetitiveness and high levels of polymorphism in the region. In a second approach, we use bbmap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bushnell et al., 2017</xref>) to look for the exact sequence at the insertion site (±50 bp) within the raw fastq file. However, when we used the four lines with a confirmed insertion from de novo long-read assemblies as a control, this approach only worked in two cases. Again, the reasons are not clear, but the approach is clearly too unreliable for genotyping.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Geographic distribution of major and minor necrosis alleles</title><p>We plotted the worldwide distribution of necrosis phenotypes and genotypes at the most strongly associated SNP using R packages ‘maps’ and ‘mapdata’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker et al., 2021</xref>). To test whether the lines harboring minor alleles are more or less geographically dispersed than would be expected by chance, we identified 10,000 loci with similar minor allele counts (between 33 and 178) to the SNPs associated with necrosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>), and the lines that harbor those alleles. We then compared the mean distance between lines harboring the SNP associated with necrosis to the distribution of distances between lines with the randomly chosen alleles.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Full list of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> lines for the GWAS analysis.

The paper identifies a 1.5 MB region in the chromosome associated with disease, including SNPs, structural variation, and transposon insertions. Studies further validate the association experimentally with a separate experimental infection procedure with several lines and specific T-DNA mutants. Finally, the paper presents a geographic analysis of the minor disease allele and the major association. The major take-home message of the paper is that structural variants and not only SNPs are important changes associated with disease susceptibility. The manuscript also makes a strong case for negative frequency-dependent selection maintaining a disease susceptibility locus at low frequency.</p><p>Strengths and Weaknesses</p><p>A major strength of this manuscript is the large sample sizes, careful experimental design, and rigor in the follow-up experiments. For instance, mentioning non-infected controls and using methods to determine if geographic locus associations were due to chance. The strong result of a GWAS-detected locus is impressive given the complex interaction between plant genotypes and strains noted in the results. In addition to the follow-up experiments, the geographic analysis added important context and broadened the scope of the study beyond typical lab-based GWAS studies. I find very few weaknesses in this manuscript.</p><p>Support of Conclusions</p><p>The support for the conclusions is exceptional. This is due to the massive amount of evidence for each statement and also due to the careful consideration of alternative explanations for the data.</p><p>Significance of Work</p><p>This manuscript will be of great significance in plant disease research, both for its findings and its experimental approach. The study has very important implications for genetic associations with disease beyond plants.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89749.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Butkovic</surname><given-names>Anamarija</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>CSIC: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paterna</named-content></addr-line><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ellis</surname><given-names>Thomas James</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Gregor Mendel Institute of Molecular Plant Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Vienna</named-content></addr-line><country>Austria</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Ruben</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>CSIC: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paterna</named-content></addr-line><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jaegle</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Gregor Mendel Institute, Austrian Academy of Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Vienna</named-content></addr-line><country>Austria</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nordborg</surname><given-names>Magnus</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Gregor Mendel Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Vienna</named-content></addr-line><country>Austria</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Elena</surname><given-names>Santiago F</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Spanish National Research Council</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paterna</named-content></addr-line><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this manuscript, Butkovic et al. perform a genome-wide association (GWA) study on <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> inoculated with the natural pathogen turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) in laboratory conditions, with the aim to identify genetic associations with virus infection-related parameters.

I suggest that the authors consider the following points in future versions of this manuscript:</p><p>1. Major allele and minor allele definition: When these two concepts are mentioned in the figure, there is no clear definition of the two words in the text. Especially for major alleles, there is no clear definition in the whole text. It is recommended that the author further elaborate on these two concepts so that readers can more easily understand the text and figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the distinction between major/minor alleles and major/minor associations in our previous manuscript may have been confusing.

Possible confusion caused by three words (Major focus / Major association and major allele): Because there is no explanation of the major allele in the text, it may cause readers to be confused with these two places in the text when trying to interpret the meaning of major allele: major locus (line 149)/ the major association with disease phenotypes (line 183).</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to the previous comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Stacked bar chart for the Fig 1F. It is recommended that the author use the form of a stacked bar chart to display the results of Fig 1F. On the one hand, it can fit in with the format of Fig 1D/E/G, on the other hand, it can also display the content more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We think the results are easier to interpret without the stacked bar chart.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
