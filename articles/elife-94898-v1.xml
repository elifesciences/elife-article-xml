During this process, the interactions between viral receptors and viruses have garnered significant interest since viral receptors are cell surface proteins exploited by viruses to initiate infection. Our study sheds light on the arms race between the MDA5 receptor and 5’ppp-RNA virus in a lower vertebrate fish, <italic>Miichthys miiuy</italic>. Firstly, the frequent and independent loss events of RIG-I in vertebrates prompted us to search for alternative immune substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation response (HDGCR) being the main pathway. Our further analysis suggested that MDA5 of <italic>M. miiuy and Gallus gallus</italic>, the homolog of RIG-I, can replace RIG-I in recognizing 5’ppp-RNA virus, which may lead to redundancy of RIG-I and loss from the species genome during evolution. Secondly, as an adversarial strategy, 5’ppp-RNA SCRV can utilize the m<sup>6</sup>A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability, thus promoting its own replication and immune evasion. In summary, our study provides a snapshot into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering valuable perspectives on the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Before the immune system can eliminate a bacterium, virus or other type of pathogen, it needs to be able to recognize these foreign elements. To achieve this, cells in the immune system have proteins called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which can identify distinct molecular features of certain pathogens.</p><p>One specific group of PRRs is a family of retinoic acid-induced RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), which help immune cells detect different types of viruses. Members of this family recognize distinct motifs on the genetic material of viruses known as RNA. For instance, RIG-I recognizes a marker known as 5’ppp on the end of single-stranded RNA molecules, whereas MDA5 recognizes long strands of double-stranded RNA.</p><p>Many vertebrates – including various mammals, birds, and fish – lost the RIG-I receptor over the course of evolution. However, Geng et al. predicted that some animals lacking the RIG-I receptor may still be able to activate an immune response against viruses that contain the 5’ppp-RNA motif.</p><p>To investigate this possibility, Geng et al. studied chickens and miiuy croakers (a type of ray-finned fish) which no longer have a RIG-I receptor. They found that both animals can still sense and eliminate two 5’ppp-RNA viruses called VSV and SCRV. Further experiments revealed that these two viruses are detected by a modified MDA5 receptor that had evolved to bind to 5’-ppp and activate the antiviral response.</p><p>Viruses are also continuously evolving new ways to escape the immune system. This led Geng et al. to investigate whether SCRV, which causes serious harm to marine fish, has evolved a way to evade the MDA5 protection mechanism. Using miiuy croakers as a model, they found that SCRV causes the transcripts that produce the MDA5 protein to contain more molecules of m6a. This molecular tag degrades the transcript, leading to lower levels of MDA5, reducing the antiviral response against SCRV.</p><p>The findings of Geng et al. offer valuable perspectives on how the immune system adapts over the course of evolution, and highlight the diversity of antiviral responses in vertebrates. Chickens and miiuy croakers are commonly farmed animals, and further work investigating how viruses invade these species could prevent illnesses from spreading and having a negative impact on the economy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RIG-I</kwd><kwd>MDA5</kwd><kwd>5'ppp-RNA</kwd><kwd>genetic compensation response</kwd><kwd>pattern recognition receptors</kwd><kwd>immune evasion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31822057</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Tianjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>5’ppp-RNA, a traditional ligand for RIG-I, can be recognized by MDA5 in species such as <italic>Miichthys miiuy</italic> and Gallus gallus that lack RIG-I.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) motifs, including proteins, lipids and nucleotides, resulting in activation of innate immune responses of host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pichlmair and Reis e Sousa, 2007</xref>). Retinoic-acid-induced RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) are a specific group of PRRs belonging to the family of DExD/H-box RNA helicases, and they play a crucial role in the innate antiviral response. There are three members in the RLR family: retinoic-acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2). RIG-I and MDA5 exhibit similar signaling characteristics and structural homology, including two N-terminal caspase-recruitment domains (CARDs), a DExD/H box RNA helicase domain, and a C-terminal repressor doma in (RD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yoneyama et al., 2005</xref>). However, LGP2 lacks CARD domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yoneyama et al., 2005</xref>). The specific roles of RIG-I and MDA5 in response to virus stimulation are not redundant: RIG-I detects short blunt-end RNA with a 5'-triphosphate motif (5’ppp-RNA), while MDA5 specifically recognizes long forms of viral dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hornung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Loo and Gale, 2011</xref>). In contrast, the involvement of LGP2 in cytosolic RNA sensing remains a topic of debate. Some studies have proposed that LGP2 is crucial for the production of type I interferon (IFN-I) in response to several RIG-I- and MDA5-dependent viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Satoh et al., 2010</xref>), whereas others have described LGP2 as a negative regulator of RIG-I signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Saito et al., 2007</xref>). However, surprisingly, despite the important immune functions of RLR members, they have been lost from the genome in many species including mammals, birds, and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liang and Su, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krchlíková et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>5’ppp-RNA is present in a wide variety of RNA viruses, including Flaviviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hornung et al., 2006</xref>). These viruses widely infect all kinds of life and cause various harmfulness and serious diseases, and the infected hosts range from the highest vertebrates to the lowest vertebrate, teleost fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Millet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Walker et al., 2022</xref>). 5’ppp-RNA viruses are expected to be recognized and trigger an antiviral immune response by RIG-I. However, RIG-I is lacking in many vertebrates, so who then recognizes 5’ppp-RNA in these species? When a gene is functionally inactive or lost, other genes or pathways may undergo homology-dependent genetic compensation response (HDGCR) to maintain organismal balance. The pressure from viral infections has led to the evolution of the immune system, and the loss of RIG-I may be accompanied by functional substitution by homologous genes in order to compensate for the loss of RIG-I function. <italic>Tupaia belangeri</italic>, a mammal lacking RIG-I, has been reported to possess the MDA5 protein, which has undergone positive selection and exhibits the ability to sense Sendai virus (an RNA virus posed as a RIG-I agonist) for inducing type I IFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). This study provides insights into the compensatory mechanism of RIG-I deficiency in vertebrates, however, considering the dynamic nature of host-virus dynamics, further research is urgently needed to validate and expand these insights.</p><p>For millions of years, viruses have coevolved with their hosts, leading to the development of various mechanisms for immune evasion in response to the mutual evolutionary pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Naz et al., 2021</xref>). Recently, it is reported that N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification plays a crucial role in enabling viruses to evade the interferon (IFN) response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lou et al., 2021</xref>). m<sup>6</sup>A methylation is an important epigenetic modification that involves the dynamic and reversible process of RNA methylation, regulated by methylase (writer), demethylase (eraser), and reader proteins that recognize m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shi et al., 2019</xref>). N6-methylation deposition on mRNA primarily relies on the enzymatic ‘writing’ complex within the cell, with a key composition featuring methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and METTL14. Conversely, N6-demethylation is chiefly modulated by ‘eraser’ proteins, with fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) and AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) being the identified enzymes for this role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jia et al., 2011</xref>). The functional impact of N6-methylation on RNA characteristics typically remains latent until recognition by ‘reader’ proteins, such as members of the YTHDF protein family, encompassing YTH domain family 1 (YTHDF1), YTHDF2, and YTHDF3. In mammals, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 are recognized for their involvement in the degradation of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA targets, as well as their association with mRNA localization and phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). By utilizing these m<sup>6</sup>A-related enzymes in the host, viruses can not only use m<sup>6</sup>A modification to hide themselves and avoid recognition by host receptors but also manipulate host gene expression to enable immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Fish and birds are commonly observed to exhibit ‘RIG-I deficiency’ phenomena, and they are also the most abundant groups of aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates respectively, giving them certain evolutionary advantages. As a result, the research of the immune evolution of them helps us to understand the immune evolution of the entire vertebrates. Meanwhile, fish and birds are major source of high-quality protein for human consumption, viral diseases in aquaculture and livestock industry pose serious obstacles to the industry’s healthy development. Among them, the 5’ppp-RNA virus, as mentioned earlier, is a highly pathogenic group. Within this group, <italic>siniperca cheats</italic> rhabdovirus (SCRV) is an important pathogen that can cause huge economic losses and serious threats to aquaculture in freshwater and marine fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang and Gui, 2015</xref>). In addition, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is also a highly infectious and widely prevalent 5’ppp-RNA virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Walker et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, in this study, we selected teleost fish miiuy croaker (<italic>Miichthys miiuy</italic>) and bird chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>), two vertebrates lacking RIG-I, as well as two 5'ppp-RNA viruses (SCRV and VSV), to investigate the evolutionary strategies and interactions between 5’ppp-RNA virus and host. The final results demonstrated that the MDA5 of <italic>M. miiuy</italic> and <italic>G. gallus</italic> lacking RIG-I both evolved the ability to recognize 5’ppp-RNA. In addition, SCRV virus can in turn utilize the m<sup>6</sup>A strategy to degrade MDA5 of <italic>M. miiuy</italic> for immune evasion. In summary, these findings shed light on the functional diversity of innate antiviral activity and unveil a complex arms race between virus replication and the innate immunity of its reservoir hosts in vertebrates. In addition, since the loss of RIG-I in vertebrates is a widespread event, our research also provides a new perspective for vertebrate groups that have lost RIG-I.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genetic compensation response model for RIG loss</title><p>In previous studies, it has been reported that a few vertebrates lost the RIG-I gene during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liang and Su, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krchlíková et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). To investigate this further, we analyzed the genomes of various species, and determined the presence and absence of the RIG-I gene. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the absence of the RIG-I gene does not appear to be uncommon in vertebrates, with at least three independent loss events observed in mammals, birds and fish, respectively. These gene-loss events occurred over a long evolutionary timescale. Based on the minimum age of the common ancestor of RIG-I-missing species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.timetree.org/">http://www.timetree.org/</ext-link>), the oldest recorded losses occurring in species like <italic>Erpetoichthys calabaricus</italic>, can be traced back to approximately 330 million years ago (MYA). Conversely, the detected loss in <italic>G. gallus</italic> took place less than 42 MYA. To gain a deeper understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of vertebrate RIG-I, we explored the conservation of the genes surrounding RIG-I. We analyzed the genome sequences of <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Callorhinchus milii</italic>, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, <italic>T. belangeri</italic>, <italic>G. gallus</italic>, and <italic>M. miiuy</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similar to the slow-evolving <italic>C. milii</italic>, humans possess RIG-I with TOPORS and ACO1 as its upstream and downstream genes, respectively. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krchlíková et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>T. belangeri</italic>, <italic>G. gallus</italic>, and <italic>M. miiuy</italic> do not have RIG-I. Interestingly, zebrafish has a RIG-I with its upstream gene being TOPORSb, seemingly a result of chromosome fragment duplication. However, one RIG-I gene was lost in the downstream region of TOPORSa, indicating that one of the RIG-I copies has been lost in zebrafish, similar to <italic>M. miiuy</italic>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A genetic compensation response model for RIG loss.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Loss of RIG-I in vertebrates.

Specifically, we extracted virus RNA from SCRV and VSV viruses and obtained their dephosphorylated RNA derivatives (SCRV-RNA-CIAP and VSV-RNA-CIAP) through Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (CIAP) treatment. Next, these RNAs were transfected into MKC cells of <italic>M. miiuy</italic> and DF-1 cells of <italic>G. gallus</italic> respectively to detect the dimerization form of IRF3. Results showed that virus RNA are more potent than dephosphorylated virus RNA in activating IRF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). And further qPCR experiments showed that the induction ability of IFN-1 by SCRV-RNA is significantly higher than that of SCRV-RNA-CIAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results indicate the presence of viral receptors in <italic>M. miiuy</italic> and <italic>G. gallus</italic> that can recognize 5’ppp-RNA. Next, we compared the structural domains of human RIG-I and <italic>M. miiuy</italic> MDA5 (mmiMDA5) and LGP2 (mmiLGP2) proteins, and observed that mmiLGP2 lacks the CARD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We next co-transfected mmiLGP2 plasmids or si-mmiLGP2 with MDA5 plasmids into MKC cells. The results showed that mmiLGP2 can actively regulate mmiMDA5’s immune response to the SCRV virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>), which further indicates that it participates in antiviral immunity as an intermediate regulatory factor of MDA5 rather than a downstream signal transmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Saito et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, these results prompted us to investigate whether MDA5, a structurally similar homolog to RIG-I, can substitute for RIG-I in recognizing 5'ppp-RNA in vertebrates without RIG-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MDA5 promotes host antiviral innate immunity</title><p>To further investigate the alternative immune function of MDA5, we first investigated the <italic>M. miiuy</italic> MDA5-mediated signaling pathway in response to SCRV virus and double-stranded mimetic poly(I:C)-HMW infection. Two siRNA molecules (si-MDA5-1 and si-MDA5-2) were designed to assess the function of MDA5. si-MDA5-1 demonstrated higher inhibitory efficiency compared to si-MDA5-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, si-MDA5-1 (referred to as si-MDA5) was selected for subsequent experiments. Subsequently, we constructed the MDA5 expression plasmid and confirmed its protein overexpression efficiency and cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Considering that mammalian MDA5 activates NF-κB and IRF3/IRF7 to induce IFNs, we investigated whether <italic>M. miiuy</italic> MDA5 could impact these pathways. Dual-luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that knockdown of MDA5 significantly inhibits NF-κB, IRF3, IRF7, and IFN-1 reporter genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, we investigated the role of MDA5 in regulating the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are crucial effectors. As shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>), we observed that knockdown or overexpression of MDA5 can significantly inhibit or promote the expression levels of IFN-1, Mx1, ISG15, and Viperin upon SCRV infection or poly(I:C)-HMW stimulation. To visually represent the biological significance of MDA5 in SCRV-induced host cells, we utilized the virus plaque and qPCR methods to examine whether it could influence viral replication. As demonstrated in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–K</xref>), knockdown of MDA5 led to a significant increase in viral plaque formation and promoted SCRV replication in SCRV-infected cells, while overexpression had the opposite effect. Next, we explored that how MDA5 conducts signal transduction, and results showed that MDA5 is capable of binding not only to MAVS but also to STING (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L and M</xref>). In our previous laboratory investigations, we have substantiated the induction effect of STING on IFN under SCRV infection or poly(I:C) stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chu et al., 2021</xref>). Under the infection of SCRV virus, co-transfection of STING plasmids or si-STING with MDA5 plasmids can significantly increase or decrease the induction of IFN-1, indicating the important role of STING in MDA5-mediated immune transmission in response to RNA virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N and O</xref>). Finally, through the determination of IRF3 dimer and IFN induction, our results showed that the induction of antiviral innate immunity by SCRV-RNA depends on MDA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P and Q</xref>). Overall, these findings indicated that MDA5 plays a positive role in regulating the antiviral responses of <italic>M. miiuy</italic>.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>MDA5 promotes host antiviral innate immunity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Silence efficiency of si-MDA5 measured by qRT-PCR and Western blotting.

The bound RNA was then amplified using SCRV-specific primers or β-actin primers as a control. Our results showed that MDA5 interacted with SCRV RNA, while β-actin mRNA did not associate with MDA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Gel analysis and nuclease sensitivity confirmed the generation of RNA products of the expected size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The RNA pull-down experiment showed that 5’ppp-SCRV can be recognized by mmiMDA5, similar to 112 bp blunt end dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we transfected wild-type 5’ppp-SCRV and dephosphorylated mutant SCRV RNAs (5’-OH-SCRV and 5’pppGG-SCRV) into MKC cells to detect the dimer of IRF3, and found that the activation ability of 5'ppp-RNA on IRF3 depends on its triphosphate structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). in addition, knockdown of mmiMDA5 blocked the induction of IRF3 by 5’ppp-SCRV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

However, evolution is a continuous battle between hosts and viruses, viruses often evolve complex escape mechanisms to evade immune surveillance and destruction, in which the m<sup>6</sup>A modification mechanism is an important way. To investigate the impact of SCRV infection on the overall methylation dynamics of fish hosts, we utilized methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq, GenBank accession number: PRJNA819945) to measure changes in m<sup>6</sup>A modification of host transcripts during SCRV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). From the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, we identified 3060 differentially m<sup>6</sup>A methylated peaks (p-value&lt;0.05) and 2082 differentially expressed genes (p-value&lt;0.05) between the non-infected and SCRV-infected group, indicating that infection significantly alters the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of specific host transcripts. It is worth noting that hyper-methylated m<sup>6</sup>A peaks were also observed in the MDA5 mRNA transcripts during SCRV infection (fold change &gt;1.5, p&lt;0.05), and <bold>t</bold>he expression level of MDA5 was higher in the infection group compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05).

Next, we tested the concrete m<sup>6</sup>A modification sites of MDA5 mRNA. We used the SRAMP database to predict potential m<sup>6</sup>A sites in MDA5-exon1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Four potential sites were predicted and two specific primers were designed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), then m<sup>6</sup>A quantitative real-time PCR and semiquantitative PCR were performed.

After being infected with SCRV or poly(I:C)-HMW, the methylation level of MDA5 increased in MKC cells, further confirming the sequencing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We further inserted the MDA5-exon1 into pmirGLO, and results showed that the infection of SCRV can reduce the luciferase activity of pmirGLO-MDA5-exon1, and the use of cycloleucine (CL, an amino acid analogue that can inhibit m<sup>6</sup>A modification) hindered the degradation of MDA5-exon1 by SCRV, indicating that SCRV can regulate MDA5 expression through a methylation mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). MDA5 is classified as an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG). Consistently, in spleen and kidney tissues infected with SCRV, the expression level of MDA5 demonstrates fluctuation.

To investigate this, the regulatory effects of METTL3 and METTL14, the main components of the methyltransferase complex, on MDA5 were explored. Three siRNAs targeting METTL3 and METTL14 were designed, and si-METTL3-2 and si-METTL14-3 showed higher knockdown efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). METTL3 and METTL14-overexpressing plasmids were also constructed, and the interaction between them confirmed their cooperative role in m<sup>6</sup>A modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Subsequently, the global m<sup>6</sup>A levels were measured in cells after knockdown or overexpression of METTL3 and METTL14. Consistent with expectations, the knockdown of METTL3 and METTL14 significantly decreased the global m<sup>6</sup>A level, while their overexpression significantly increased the overall methylation level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To investigate their role in the process of virus infection, we used the virus plaque and qPCR methods to explore whether it could affect SCRV replication. As shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>), overexpression of METTL3 or METTL14 significantly enhances viral plaque formation and promotes SCRV replication in SCRV-infected cells. And as m<sup>6</sup>A writers, METTL3 and METTL14 can directly regulate the methylation level of MDA5 and induce MDA5 degradation by reducing its mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–I</xref>). We further inserted the MDA5-exon1 into pmirGLO and mVenus-C1 vector, and results showed that si-METTL3&amp;14 can reduce the luciferase activity of pmirGLO-MDA5-exon1, and METTL3&amp;14 could suppress the levels of GFP, further indicating the presence of methylation sites in MDA5-exon1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and D</xref>). To investigate the potential m<sup>6</sup>A sites on MDA5-exon1, we constructed mutant MDA5-exon1 reporter plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As expected, our results showed that the luciferase activity of wild-type pmirGLO-MDA5-exon1 reporter, but not of mutant pmirGLO-MDA5-exon1 reporter, was markedly increased upon METTL3&amp;14 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the use of cycloleucine hindered the degradation of MDA5 by METTL3 and METTL14, indicating that these proteins regulate MDA5 expression through a methylation mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J and K</xref>). Additionally, MDA5 expression was degraded by METTL3&amp;14 in both SCRV-infected and uninfected groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). To investigate the impact of this mechanism on viral infection, we co-transfected METTL3&amp;14 and MDA5 plasmids and found that METTL3&amp;14 partially suppressed the antiviral immune benefit of MDA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M–O</xref>).

In this study, we hypothesized that YTHDF readers (YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3) may recognize m<sup>6</sup>A-modified MDA5 and destabilize it. We examined the binding ability of YTHDF proteins to MDA5 mRNA and found that YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 exhibited stronger binding compared to YTHDF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We then designed two siRNAs targeting YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3 respectively, and selected si-YTHDF1-1, si-YTHDF2-si-2, si-YTHDF3-2 with better knockdown effects for subsequent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Results showed that the knockdown or overexpression of YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 led to the increase or decrease of the expression levels of MDA5, whereas YTHDF1 did not appear to influence MDA5 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and C</xref>).

Specifically, we have observed at least three independent loss events in mammals, birds, and fish, respectively. Regarding the loss of RIG-I in avian species, previous studies have provided more comprehensive and accurate information than ours, indicating that birds have experienced more than 16 instances of RIG-I loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krchlíková et al., 2022</xref>). However, it should be noted that we have not found the loss of RIG-I in reptiles and amphibians (not displayed). But this does not imply that there has been no loss event among them, but rather, there is insufficient information regarding the genomes of reptiles and amphibians to draw the conclusions. As the abundance of genomic data continues to grow, there will be an increasing amount of evidence available to verify the presence or absence of RIG-I in these taxonomic groups. Additionally, the presence of RIG-I in current species does not guarantee that RIG-I loss has not occurred previously. For instance, our research has indicated that zebrafish may have experienced RIG-I loss. However, prior to the loss event, the zebrafish RIG-I has undergone repetitive events. These findings collectively highlight that the loss of RIG-I is not a random occurrence, but rather bears significant biological and evolutionary implications that deserve further investigation.</p><p>The evolutionary loss of RIG-I raises the question of a possible compensation of its function by other gene products. RIG-I deficiency instances in mammals were scarcer compared to those in fish and birds. Previous research has revealed that in <italic>T. belangeri</italic>, concurrent with the loss of RIG-I, both MDA5 and LGP2 have undergone notable positive selection, and MDA5 or MDA5/LGP2 could sense Sendai virus (an RNA virus posed as a RIG-I agonist) for inducing type I IFN. This proposed an immune substitution model for RIG-I deficiency in mammals, though direct evidence of MDA5/LGP2 binding to 5’ppp-RNA was lacking. In this study, we characterized the consequences resulting from the loss of RIG-I in the <italic>M. miiuy</italic> and <italic>G. gallus</italic> (two representative species of vertebrates lacking RIG-I) and provided direct functional evidence for the alternative immune recognition function of MDA5. SCRV and VSV belongs to the class of rhabdovirus, which is a negative-strand virus with a non-segmented genome and initiate both replication and transcription de novo leading to 5′-triphosphate RNA in the cytosol, was expected to trigger an IFN response without the need for replication and presumed dsRNA formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hornung et al., 2006</xref>). Then, we synthesized 5’ppp-RNA probes from the SCRV and VSV genome sequences and purified recombinant MDA5 of <italic>M. miiuy</italic> and <italic>G. gallus</italic>. Results demonstrated that MDA5 detect the 5’ppp-RNA in <italic>M. miiuy</italic> and <italic>G. gallus</italic> and is disrupted when RNA is capped at the 5'-triphosphate end or dephosphorylated. Furthermore, the recognition of RNA by MDA5 depends on its RD domain, which not only indicates that the RD domain of MDA5 has evolved functions similar to RD domain of RIG-I, but also excludes the possibility of MDA5 binding to 5’ppp-RNA through intermediate ligands. Furthermore, in vertebrates that possess RIG-I, STING exclusively binds to RIG-I rather than MDA5. However, similar to the interaction observed between MDA5 and STING in tree shrews and chickens that lacking RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xu et al., 2019</xref>), the MDA5 of M. miiuy can also interact with STING protein, indicating that in vertebrates lacking RIG-I, MDA5 may utilize STING to facilitate signal transduction in the antiviral response. Next, by linking the immune replacement ability evolved by MDA5 with the common RIG-I loss event in vertebrates, we propose a straightforward explanation for this evolutionary event: In the lengthy process of vertebrate evolution, MDA5 gradually acquired new functionalities to effectively detect viruses such as 5’ppp-RNAs, which were initially recognized by RIG-I. As a result, there was functional redundancy of RIG-I, which eventually led to its gradual disappearance from the vertebrate genome. This hypothesis is supported by two viewpoints: first, MDA5 and RIG-I can both recognize overlapping viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schoggins et al., 2015</xref>; secondly, in fish without RIG-I deficiency, MDA5 has stronger antiviral ability compared to RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wan et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, although MDA5 has a compensatory effect on RIG-I, the absence of RIG-I may still have a significant impact on the immune system of vertebrates. Ducks are often resistant to influenza viruses capable of killing chicken, and the loss of RIG-I in chickens provides a plausible explanation for their increased susceptibility to influenza viruses compared with ducks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barber et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, SCRV virus, the virus model used in this study, mainly affects the Siniperca chuatsi, which is a fish species that also lacks RIG-I like <italic>M. miiuy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Viruses are constantly co-evolving with hosts. Our available data suggested that the vertebrate has evolved MDA5 with alternative functions to recognize and resist 5’ppp-RNA virus in the absence of RIG-I. As a response, virus has also evolved to use the m<sup>6</sup>A mechanism to evade the host immune response. Previous study indicated that m<sup>6</sup>A modification plays a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gan et al., 2023</xref>). During the infection process, the virus may disrupt the m<sup>6</sup>A level and disrupt the immune balance, thereby facilitating its own replication and invasion. Viruses may utilize the m<sup>6</sup>A mechanism in two ways to evade immunity. On the one hand, many studies suggested a role for m<sup>6</sup>A in shielding RNA species from detection by PRRs. There are numerous viruses recognized in RIG-Idependent manner, but m<sup>6</sup>A modification increases the possibility of immune evasion. For example, the loss of m<sup>6</sup>A site or removing m<sup>6</sup>A from human metapneumovirus may weaken its immune evasion ability, prevent it from evading detection by RIG-I, and result in higher levels of IFN release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, it has been reported that the RNA containing m<sup>6</sup>A modifications binds to RIG-I poorly, and it failed to trigger the RIG-I conformational changes associated with downstream immune signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Durbin et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, m<sup>6</sup>A-mediated viral strategies for inhibiting IFN induction pathways appear to exist. For instance, following infection by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the IFN-β transcript was modified by m<sup>6</sup>A, and this methylation decreased its half-life, suggesting that HCMV can exploit this control of IFN-β expression to facilitate its replication by increasing m<sup>6</sup>A modification of the IFN-β transcript and thus decreasing its production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rubio et al., 2018</xref>). In another study, the m6A reader YTHDF3 could restrain the type I IFN response and ISG expression by involving enhancement of FOXO3 translation in a m6A-independent mechanism, which acts as a negative regulator of immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, previous study reports that IFN-α and IFN-β mRNA encoding cytokines that promote IFN response are modified by m6A, and the loss of METTL3 and YTHDF2 could increase the IFN expression and ISG activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Winkler et al., 2019</xref>). In summary, viruses can utilize m<sup>6</sup>A to evade the immune response by shielding the recognition of RIG-I or reducing the host’s immune reaction, thus counteracting the host’s defense mechanisms. In our previous study, we discovered that SCRV infection can not only increase overall cellular methylation levels but also upregulate the expression of METTL3, thereby suggesting its potential to regulate host gene expression through the m<sup>6</sup>A mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geng et al., 2023</xref>). While changes in m<sup>6</sup>A modification and the expression of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified transcripts are biologically relevant, identifying bona fide m<sup>6</sup>A alterations during viral infection will allow us to understand how m<sup>6</sup>A modification of cellular mRNA is regulated. As our m<sup>6</sup>A change analysis pipeline controls for changes in gene expression, these data should represent true changes in m<sup>6</sup>A modification rather than changes in the expression of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified transcripts. In this study, we found that SCRV virus infection alters m<sup>6</sup>A modification of specific cellular transcripts, including MDA5. MDA5 plays a crucial role as a receptor in recognizing the SCRV virus and controlling IFN activation. The aberrant m<sup>6</sup>A levels of MDA5 subsequently affect the expression of antiviral genes, thereby compromising its ability to mount an effective antiviral immune response. It is plausible that SCRV also impacts the production of antiviral genes, such as IFN-1 or other cytokines, by manipulating m<sup>6</sup>A modification on the transcripts of cytokines or molecules involved in their production. This interesting aspect warrants further investigation in future research.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated a co-evolutionary arms race between 5’ppp-RNA virus and virus receptors. Specifically, we conducted an evolutionary analysis and provided functional evidence to confirm that MDA5 of M. miiuy and G. gallus has acquired an additional function of sensing 5’ppp-RNA, thus compensating for the loss of RIG-I. Additionally, we found that SCRV infection can regulate the m<sup>6</sup>A level of MDA5 in the M. miiuy, leading to its degradation and subsequently affecting the immune response for immune evasion. Fish and birds, as the most abundant aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates respectively, are also the two lineages with the most frequent occurrence of RIG-I deficiency, the investigation of host-pathogen interactions of them offers valuable insights into the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Then the cleaved RNA fragments were incubated for 2 hr at 4℃ with m<sup>6</sup>A-specific antibody (Synaptic Systems) in IP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 750 mM NaCl and 0.5% Igepal CA-630). For sequencing data analysis, we used HISAT2 to map reads to the reference genome of <italic>M. miiuy</italic>. Mapped reads of IP and input libraries were provided for R package exomePeak, which identifies m<sup>6</sup>A peaks with bed or bigwig format that can be adapted for visualization on the IGV software. The differentially expressed mRNAs were selected with log2 (fold change)&gt;1 or log2 (fold change) &lt;-1 and p-value &lt;0.05 by R package edgeR. The circus map of m<sup>6</sup>A peaks in untreated and SCRV-infected spleen tissues of <italic>M. miiuy</italic> was showed by TBtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>MeRIP-qPCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Methylated m<sup>6</sup>A RNA immunoprecipitation (Me-RIP) was performed according to the protocol of EpiQuik CUT&amp;RUN m<sup>6</sup>A RNA Enrichment Kit (Epigentek). qPCR analysis of the methylated RNA was performed to detect methylated MDA5 mRNA levels. Relative m<sup>6</sup>A level for each transcript was calculated as the percent of input in each condition normalized to that of the respective positive control spike-in.

Additionally, it is noted that the main claims put forth in the manuscript are only partially supported by the data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>After meticulous revisions of the manuscript, including adjustments to the title, abstract, results, and discussion, the main claim of our study now is the arm race between the MDA5 receptor and SCRV virus in a lower vertebrate fish, <italic>M. miiuy</italic>. This mainly includes two parts: Firstly, the MDA5 of <italic>M. miiuy</italic> can recognize virus invasion and initiate host immune response by recognizing the triphosphate structure of SCRV. Secondly, as an adversarial strategy, 5’ppp-RNA SCRV virus can utilize the m6A mechanism to degrade MDA5 in <italic>M. miiuy</italic>. Based on the reviewer's suggestions, we have further supplemented the critical experiments (Figure 3F-3G, Figure 4D, Figure 5G) and provided a more detailed and accurate explanation of the experimental conclusions, we believe that our existing manuscript can support our main claims. In addition, because virus-host coevolution complicates the derivation of universal conclusions, we will further expand our insights in future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This manuscript by Geng et al. aims to demonstrate that MDA5 compensates for the loss of RIG-I in certain species, such as teleost fish miiuy croaker. The authors use siniperca cheats rhabdovirus (SCRV) and poly(I:C) to demonstrate that these RNA ligands induce an IFN response in an MDA5-dependent manner in m.miiuy derived cells. Furthermore, they show that MDA5 requires its RD domain to directly bind to SCRV RNA and to induce an IFN response. They use in vitro synthesized RNA with a 5'triphosphate (or lacking a 5'triphosphate as a control) to demonstrate that MDA5 can directly bind to 5'-triphosphorylated RNA. The second part of the paper is devoted to m6A modification of MDA5 transcripts by SCRV as an immune evasion strategy. The authors demonstrate that the modification of MDA5 with m6A is increased upon infection and that this causes increased decay of MDA5 and consequently a decreased IFN response.</p><p>One critical caveat in this study is that it does not address whether ppp-SCRV RNA induces IRF3-dimerization and type I IFN induction in an MDA5 dependent manner. The data demonstrate that mmiMDA5 can bind to triphosphorylated RNA (Fig. 4D). In addition, triphosphorylated RNA can dimerize IRF3 (4C). However, a key experiment that ties these two observations together is missing.</p><p>Specifically, although Fig. 4C demonstrates that 5'ppp-SCRV RNA induces dimerization (unlike its dephosphorylated or capped derivatives), this does not proof that this happens in an MDA5-dependent manner. This experiment should have been done in WT and siMDA5 MKC cells side-by-side to demonstrate that the IRF3 dimerization that is observed here is mediated by MDA5 and not by another (unknown) protein. The same holds true for Fig. 4J.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the referee's professional suggestions. In fact, we have transfected SCRV RNA into WT and si-MDA5 MKC cells, and subsequently assessed the dimerization of IRF3 and the IFN response (Figure 2P-2Q). The results indicated that knockdown of MDA5 prevents immune activation of SCRV RNA. However, considering the potential for SCRV RNA to activate immunity independent of the triphosphate structure, this experimental observation does not comprehensively establish the MDA5-dependent induction of IRF3 dimer by 5’ppp-RNA. Accordingly, in accordance with the referee's recommendation, we proceeded to investigate the inducible activity of 5'ppp-SCRV on IRF3 dimerization in WT and si-MDA5 MKC cells, revealing that 5'ppp-SCRV indeed elicits immunity in an MDA5-dependent manner (Figure 4D). Additionally, poly(I:C)-HMW, a known ligand for MDA5, demonstrated a residual, albeit attenuated, activation of IRF3 following MDA5 knockdown, potentially attributed to its capacity to stimulate immunity through alternative pathways such as TLR3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Fig 1C-D: these experiments are not sufficiently convincing, i.e. the difference in IRF3 dimerization between VSV-RNA and VSV-RNA+CIAP transfection is minimal.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reconstituted the necessary materials and repeated the pertinent experiments depicted in Fig 1C-1D. The results demonstrate that SCRV-RNA+CIAP and VSV-RNA+CIAP exhibit a mitigating effect on the induction activity of SCRV-RNA and VSV-RNA on IRF3 dimerization, albeit without complete elimination (Figure 1C and 1D). These findings suggest the presence of receptors within <italic>M. miiuy</italic> and <italic>G. gallus</italic> capable of recognizing the viral triphosphate structure; however, it is worth noting that RNA derived from SCRV and VSV viruses does not exclusively depend on the triphosphate structure to activate the host's antiviral response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 2N and 2O: why did the authors decide to use overexpression of MDA5 to assess the impact of STING on MDA5-mediated IFN induction? This should have been done in cells transfected with SCRV or polyIC (as in 2D-G) or in infected cells (as in 2H-K). In addition, it is a pity that the authors did not include an siMAVS condition alongside siSTING, to investigate the relative contribution of MAVS versus STING to the MDA5-mediated IFN response. Panel O suggests that the IFN response is completely dependent on STING, which is hard to envision.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous laboratory investigations, we have substantiated the induction effect of STING on IFN under SCRV infection or poly(I:C) stimulation, as documented in the relevant literature (10.1007/s11427-020-1789-5), which we have referenced in our manuscript (lines 177-178). While we did assess the impact of STING on MDA5-mediated IFN induction in SCRV-infected cells, as indicated in the figure legends, we have revised Figure 2N-2O for improved clarity, and similarly, Figure 1H-1I has also been updated. Furthermore, considering that RNA virus infection can activate the cGAS/STING axis (10.3389/fcimb.2023.1172739) and the significant role of MAVS in sensing RNA virus invasion in the NLR pathway (10.1038/ni.1782), it is challenging to ascertain the respective contributions of STING and MAVS to the immune signaling cascade mediated by MDA5 during RNA virus infection. We intend to explore this aspect further in future research endeavors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 3F and 3G: where are the mock-transfected/infected conditions? Given that ectopic expression of hMDA5 is known to cause autoactivation of the IFN pathway, the baseline ISG levels should be shown (ie. In absence of a stimulus or infection). Normalization of the data does not reveal whether this is the case and is therefore misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the reviewer's suggestions, we have rerun the experiment. We examined the effects of MDA5 and MDA5-ΔRD on antiviral factors in both uninfected, SCRV-infected, and poly(I:C)-HMW-stimulated MKC cells. Results showed that overexpression of both MDA5 and MDA5-ΔRD stimulated the expression of antiviral genes. However, when cells were infected or stimulated with SCRV or poly(I:C)-HMW, only the overexpression of MDA5, not MDA5-ΔRD, significantly increased the expression of antiviral genes (Figure 3F-3I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 4F and 4G: can the authors please indicate in the figure which area of the gel is relevant here? The band that runs halfway the gel? If so, the effects described in the text are not supported by the data (i.e. the 5'OH-SCRV and 5'pppGG-SCRV appear to compete with Bio-5'ppp-SCRV as well as 5'ppp-SCRV).</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for any confusion. The relevant areas in the gel pertaining to the experimental findings were denoted with asterisks and elaborated upon in the figure legends (Figure 4G, 4H, and 4M). The findings indicated that 5'ppp-SCRV, in contrast to 5'OH-SCRV and 5'pppGG-SCRV, demonstrated the ability to compete with bio-5'ppp-SCRV.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My concerns about Fig. 5 remain unaltered. The fact that MDA5 is an ISG explains its increased expression and increased methylation pattern. The authors should at the very least mention in their text that MDA5 is an ISG and that their observations may be partially explained by this fact.</p></disp-quote><p>First, as our m6A change analysis pipeline controls for changes in gene expression, these data should represent true changes in m6A modification rather than changes in the expression of m6A-modified transcripts (10.1038/s41598-020-63355-3). Similar studies demonstrated that m6A modification in RIOK3 and CIRBP mRNAs are altered following <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> infection (10.1016/j.molcel.2019.11.007). The specific calculation method is as follows: relative m6A level for each transcript was calculated as the percent of input in each condition normalized to that of the respective positive control spike-in. Fold change of enrichment was calculated with mock samples normalized to 1. Therefore, changes in the expression level of MDA5 can partially explain the increase in m6A modification on all MDA5 mRNA in cells, but it cannot indicate changes in m6A modification on each mDA5 transcript. We have supplemented the calculation method process in the manuscript and cited relevant literature (Lines 606-608). In addition, we have elaborated on the fact that MDA5 is an ISG gene in the experimental results (lines 260-261), and emphasized its compatibility with enhanced m6A modification of MDA5 in the discussion section (lines 405-409).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors explored the interaction between the pattern recognition receptor MDA5 and 5'ppp-RNA in the Miiuy croaker. They found that MDA5 can serve as a substitute for RIG-I in detecting 5'ppp-RNA of Siniperca cheilinus rhabdovirus (SCRV) when RIG-I is absent in Miiuy croaker. Furthermore, they observed MDA5's recognition of 5'ppp-RNA in chickens (Gallus gallus), a species lacking RIG-I. Additionally, the authors documented that MDA5's functionality can be compromised by m6A-mediated methylation and degradation of MDA5 mRNA, orchestrated by the METTL3/14-YTHDF2/3 regulatory network in Miiuy croaker during SCRV infection. This impairment compromises the innate antiviral immunity of fish, facilitating SCRV's immune evasion. These findings offer valuable insights into the adaptation and functional diversity of innate antiviral mechanisms in vertebrates.</p></disp-quote><p>We extend our sincere appreciation for your professional comments and insightful suggestions on our manuscript, as they have significantly contributed to enhancing its quality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The interpretation of Figures 1H and I, along with the captions, seems unclear. Particularly, understanding the meaning of the X-axis in Figure I is challenging. Additionally, the designation of &quot;H2O = 1&quot; on the Y-axis in Figure 1E lacks clarity. It would be helpful if the author could revise and clarify these figures for better comprehension.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your reminder and have corrected and clarified these figures and figure legends (lines 768-772). We have replaced the Y-axis of Figure 1I with &quot;Relative mRNA expression&quot; instead of &quot; Relative IFN-1 expression&quot; (Figure 1I). In addition, we have added an explanation of &quot;H2O=1&quot; in the legend of Figure 1E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The interpretation of Figure 5 in section 2.5 seems incomplete. The author mentioned that both m6A levels and MDA5 expression levels are increased (lines 256-257), prompting questions about the relationship between m6A and MDA5 expression. If higher m6A levels typically lead to MDA5 mRNA instability and lower MDA5 expression, observing both increasing simultaneously appears contradictory. Considering the dynamic changes shown in Figure 5, it would be more appropriate to propose an alteration in both m6A levels and MDA5 expression levels. Given the fluctuating nature of these changes, definitively labeling them as solely &quot;increased&quot; is challenging. Therefore, offering a nuanced interpretation of the results and clarifying this aspect would bolster the study's conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>While changes in m6A modification and the expression of m6A-modified transcripts are biologically relevant, identifying bona fide m6A alterations during viral infection will allow us to understand how m6A modification of cellular mRNA is regulated. As our m6A change analysis pipeline controls for changes in gene expression, these data should represent true changes in m6A modification rather than changes in the expression of m6A-modified transcripts (10.1038/s41598-020-63355-3). Similar studies demonstrated that m6A modification in RIOK3 and CIRBP mRNAs are altered following Flaviviridae infection (10.1016/j.molcel.2019.11.007). The specific calculation method is as follows: relative m6A level for each transcript was calculated as the percent of input in each condition normalized to that of the respective positive control spike-in. Fold change of enrichment was calculated with mock samples normalized to 1. Therefore, the upregulation of MDA5 expression can partially explain the increase in m6A modification on all MDA5 mRNA in cells, but it cannot indicate changes in m6A modification on each mDA5 transcript. We have supplemented the calculation method process in the manuscript and cited relevant literature. I hope to receive your understanding.</p><p>In addition, although higher m6A levels often lead to unstable MDA5 mRNA and lower MDA5 expression, SCRV can affect MDA5 expression through multiple pathways. For example, since MDA5 is an interferon-stimulated gene, the infection of SCRV virus can cause strong expression of interferon and indirectly induce high-level expression of MDA5. Therefore, the expression of MDA5 is not contradictory to the simultaneous increase in MDA5 modification (24 h). In order to further enhance our experimental conclusions, we supplemented the dual fluorescence experiment. The results indicate that, the infection of SCRV can inhibit the fluorescence activity of MDA5-exon1 reporter plasmids containing m6A sites but not including the promoter sequence of the MDA5 gene, and this inhibitory effect can be counteracted by cycloleucine (CL, an amino acid analogue that can inhibit m6A modification) (Figure 5G). This further indicates that SCRV can reduce the expression of MDA5 through the m6A pathway.</p><p>Finally, in light of the fluctuations in MDA5 expression levels, we have changed the subheadings of Results 2.5 section and provided a more comprehensive and precise elucidation of the experimental outcomes. We are grateful for your valuable feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In the discussion section, it would indeed be advantageous for the author to explore the novelty of this work more comprehensively, moving beyond merely acknowledging the widespread loss of RIG-I and suggesting MDA5 as a compensatory mechanism. Considering the well-established roles of MDA5 and m6A in host-virus interactions, the findings of this study may seem familiar in light of previous research. To enhance the discussion, it would be valuable for the author to delve into the implications of this evolutionary model. For instance, does the compensation or loss of RIG-I impact a species' susceptibility to specific types of viruses? Exploring such questions would provide insight into the broader significance of this compensation model and its potential effects on host-virus interactions, thus adding depth to the study's contribution.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the expert advice provided by the referee. In response, we have expanded our discussion in the relevant section, addressing the potential influence of RIG-I deficiency and MDA5 compensation on the antiviral immune system in vertebrates (lines 371-376). Furthermore, we underscore the significance of exploring the impact of SCRV infection on MDA5 m6A modification, considering its compatibility with MDA5 as an ISG gene, in elucidating the host response to viral infection (lines 405-409).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) To improve the manuscript, it would be beneficial if the editors could aid the author in refining the language. Many descriptions in the article are overly redundant, and there should be appropriate differentiation between experimental methods and results.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We have carefully revised the manuscript and removed redundant descriptions in the experimental results and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The authors have addressed all of my concerns.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
