largely independent of each other. Using microfluidics and single-cell imaging approaches, we observed that, during the replicative aging of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a challenge to proteostasis occurs specifically in the fraction of cells with decreased stability within the ribosomal DNA (rDNA). A screen of 170 yeast RNA-binding proteins identified ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-binding proteins as the most enriched group that aggregate upon a decrease in rDNA stability induced by inhibition of a conserved lysine deacetylase Sir2. Further, loss of rDNA stability induces age-dependent aggregation of rRNA-binding proteins through aberrant overproduction of rRNAs. These aggregates contribute to age-induced proteostasis decline and limit cellular lifespan. Our findings reveal a mechanism underlying the interconnection between chromatin instability and proteostasis stress and highlight the importance of cell-to-cell variability in aging processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-cell aging</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>time-lapse imaging</kwd><kwd>chromatin stability</kwd><kwd>microfluidics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG056440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsimring</surname><given-names>Lev S</given-names></name><name><surname>Pillus</surname><given-names>Lorraine</given-names></name><name><surname>Hasty</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name><name><surname>Hao</surname><given-names>Nan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM111458</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hao</surname><given-names>Nan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG068112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hao</surname><given-names>Nan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007240</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paxman</surname><given-names>Julie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB1716841</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pillus</surname><given-names>Lorraine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The interaction between rDNA instability and proteostasis stress, two major aging hallmarks, underlies single-cell aging trajectories in yeast.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular aging is a complex biological phenomenon characterized by damage accumulation, leading to loss of homeostatic cellular function and ultimately cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirkwood, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ogrodnik et al., 2019</xref>). As cellular aging has been studied, macromolecular changes have been identified as hallmarks of aging, including mitochondrial dysfunction, genomic instability, aberrant protein expression and aggregation, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). It has been generally accepted that these changes occur together during aging, contributing to cellular decline and death. However, from a single-cell perspective, what remains unclear is whether these hallmarks concur in an individual aging cell. And, if so, is there a cascade of molecular events driving the aging of single cells, in which these hallmark factors interact with and influence one another to induce aging phenotypes, functional deterioration, and ultimately cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crane and Kaeberlein, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kirkwood and Kowald, 1997</xref>).</p><p>We have used replicative aging of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as a genetically tractable model to investigate the dynamic interactions among aging-related processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">OLaughlin et al., 2020</xref>). Yeast replicative aging is characterized as the finite number of cell divisions before cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mortimer and Johnston, 1959</xref>). Previous studies have identified many conserved features in yeast aging that also accompany human aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Janssens and Veenhoff, 2016</xref>). Among these, chromatin instability and mitochondrial dysfunction are considered major drivers of aging in yeast. In particular, the instability of ribosomal DNA (rDNA), driven by decreased rDNA silencing, was among the first to be identified as a causal factor of yeast aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Defossez et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Saka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction, driven by early-life decreases in vacuolar acidity and intracellular heme level, was also identified as a major contributor to yeast aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Veatch et al., 2009</xref>). Adding to these observations, our recent single-cell analyses revealed that rDNA instability and mitochondrial dysfunction are mutually exclusive in individual aging cells. In an isogenic population, about half of aging cells show loss of rDNA stability and nucleolar decline, whereas the other half experience mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>A decline in proteostasis is another well-recognized hallmark of cellular aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hipp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Taylor and Dillin, 2011</xref>) and age-related diseases, including a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Höhn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kurtishi et al., 2019</xref>). During aging, the cell gradually loses the ability to maintain proteostasis, resulting in damaged protein accumulation, protein aggregation, and eventually cell death. However, how aging causes challenges to proteostasis and how these challenges interplay with other age-induced processes remain largely elusive. Here, we combined microfluidic platforms with advanced imaging techniques to investigate proteostasis and protein aggregation during yeast aging at the single-cell level. We observed that a challenge to proteostasis occurred almost exclusively in the aging cells that also experienced loss of rDNA stability. Because many RNA-binding proteins are aggregation-prone and hence sensitive to proteostatic changes, we performed a systematic screen for aggregation of yeast RNA-binding proteins and identified ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-binding proteins as the most enriched group of proteins that aggregate upon decreased rDNA stability. We further found that loss of rDNA stability leads to rRNA-binding protein aggregation through excessive rRNA production and that these age-induced aggregates contribute to loss of proteostasis and accelerate aging, providing a new mechanistic connection between chromatin instability and proteostasis decline.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A challenge to proteostasis concurs with loss of rDNA stability during cell aging</title><p>To track the challenges to proteostasis in single aging cells, we monitored Hsp104-GFP, a canonical protein stress reporter that forms aggregates (visualized as fluorescent foci) upon proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lum et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tkach and Glover, 2004</xref>).

To examine the effects on rRNA-binding protein aggregation, we began with Rpn4, a transcriptional regulator of the 26S proteasome components that is required for normal levels of proteasome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Xie and Varshavsky, 2001</xref>). In cells lacking Rpn4, which are characterized by a reduced proteasome pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ju et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Xie and Varshavsky, 2001</xref>), we found increased, earlier, and more severe Nop15 aggregation during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left).

These results suggest that the proteasome participates in the process of removing age-induced rRNA-binding protein aggregates, probably through degradation of intrinsically disordered protein monomers as in the case of other misfolded protein aggregates or aberrant RNA-binding protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berke and Paulson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Kaganovich, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hjerpe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Reiss et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Thapa et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the roles of Sir2 and rDNA stability on rRNA-binding protein aggregation.

Whereas rDNA is the site of active RNA polymerase (Pol) I-mediated rRNA transcription, it is also one of the three heterochromatin regions in yeast that are subject to distinct forms of transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Smith and Boeke, 1997</xref>). During aging, loss of silencing at the rDNA enhances the rate of DNA double-strand breaks and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lindstrom et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Saka et al., 2013</xref>), leading to the formation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) excised from this fragile genomic site. ERCs are self-replicating DNA circles, asymmetrically segregated to mother cells during cell division. As a result, ERCs accumulate exponentially in aging mother cells and have been proposed to be a causal factor of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>). To determine whether loss of Sir2 or loss of rDNA stability drives rRNA-binding protein aggregation through ERC accumulation, we monitored Nop15 aggregation in the absence of Fob1, a replication fork-barrier protein that, when deleted, prevents rDNA recombination and abolishes ERC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Defossez et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johzuka and Horiuchi, 2002</xref>). We observed a dramatic reduction in Nop15 aggregation in the <italic>fob1∆</italic> strain, indicating that ERC accumulation can be a major driver of age-dependent rRNA-binding protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right).</p><p>ERCs can impact various aspects of cellular functions, such as cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Neurohr et al., 2018</xref>) and nuclear pore integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>). However, how ERCs mechanistically limit cellular lifespan is not clear. A recent study showed that ERC accumulation dramatically increases the number of transcriptionally active rDNA copies, resulting in a massive increase in pre-rRNA levels in the nucleolus. These pre-rRNAs, however, cannot mature into functional ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Morlot et al., 2019</xref>). Because increasing the level of RNA content generally promotes phase transition and aggregation of ribonucleoprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), we hypothesized that excessive production of rRNAs could induce age-dependent aggregation of rRNA-binding proteins. To test this, in the <italic>fob1</italic>Δ mutant where ERC formation is abolished, we overexpressed Rrn3, the RNA Pol I-specific transcription factor that promotes rRNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Moorefield et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Philippi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yamamoto et al., 1996</xref>).

However, an increasing number of recent studies suggest that these two processes may be interconnected. For example, Sir2, a conserved deacetylase encoded by the best-studied longevity gene to date, mediates deacetylation and silencing of heterochromatin regions and serves as a major regulator of chromatin stability and lifespan in yeast. Deletion of Sir2, which causes a loss of chromatin stability, dramatically elevates damaged protein accumulation and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilaniu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erjavec et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting potential interplays between processes that mediate chromatin stability and proteostasis. In line with this, similar patterns of co-regulation have been observed in mammals upon perturbations that target the sirtuin family of deacetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Min et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tomita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Westerheide et al., 2009</xref>). However, the molecular basis underlying these connections has remained largely unclear.</p><p>In this study, we exploited the power of single-cell imaging technologies, which enabled us to track the state of proteostasis throughout lifespans of a large number of single yeast cells. Interestingly, we observed that a challenge to proteostasis, visualized by Hsp104 and Sis1 aggregation, occurs specifically in the fraction of aging cells that undergo loss of rDNA stability (Mode 1), and the <italic>sir2Δ</italic> mutant with decreased rDNA stability show accelerated and exacerbated protein aggregation. We further found that loss of rDNA stability causes age-dependent aggregation of rRNA-binding proteins through aberrant overproduction of rRNAs. These aggregates impair nucleolar integrity and promote proteostasis decline in aged cells. We noted that some cells showed transient Hsp104 foci very early in their lifespans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). We speculate that these aggregates might be caused by spontaneous early-life molecular or cellular changes, such as vacuolar pH changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>) or oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanzén et al., 2016</xref>). Aggregation of rRNA-binding proteins occurs during the later stages of aging, contributing to the increasing frequency of Hsp104 aggregate appearance with age and limiting the cellular lifespan. Importantly, throughout our analyses, the fraction of aging cells that undergo mitochondrial dysfunction (Mode 2) did not show rRNA-binding protein aggregation and therefore provided a powerful isogenic control for evaluating the regulation and effects of age-induced aggregation.</p><p>Aging and aging-related processes can also be associated with other types of proteostasis stress that do not trigger Hsp104 aggregation. In fact, we observed that <italic>ubr2</italic>Δ, which increases proteasome capacity, extended the lifespan of Mode 1 (Mode 1 replicative lifespans [RLSs] in <italic>ubr2</italic>Δ vs. WT: 29 vs. 26) as well as that of Mode 2 cells that undergo mitochondrial biogenesis decline (Mode 2 RLSs in <italic>ubr2</italic>Δ vs. WT: 20 vs. 17), suggesting potential interactions between proteostasis stress and mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Indeed, a specific mitochondrial chaperone system, which mediates import, folding, and removal of aggregation-prone mitochondrial proteins, plays an important role in maintaining proteostasis in mitochondria during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Moehle et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our findings establish a mechanistic connection between chromatin stability and proteostasis stress during aging and highlight the importance of cell-to-cell variability when considering aging hallmarks and longevity-modulating perturbations. In addition, our working model can help interpret some previous intriguing yet unresolved observations. For instance, it has been puzzling why overexpression of Hsp104, a disaggregase that clears protein aggregation, can dramatically extend the lifespan of <italic>sir2</italic>Δ, but not WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erjavec et al., 2007</xref>). Based on our results, only a fraction of WT cells (Mode 1) experience chromatin instability and proteostasis decline at late stages of aging and therefore the effect of Hsp104 overexpression on lifespan is rather modest. In contrast, the majority of <italic>sir2</italic>Δ cells age with accelerated and severe rRNA-binding protein aggregation and proteostasis decline due to sustained loss of chromatin stability. As a result, Hsp104 overexpression, which alleviates protein aggregation, exhibits a much more dramatic pro-longevity effect.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge that chromatin stability could be linked with proteostasis through other mechanisms, beyond that reported in this study. For example, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, age-dependent changes in epigenetic landscape and chromatin accessibility lead to a repression of the heat-shock response (HSR) that combats protein misfolding, resulting in proteostasis decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>). During human cell senescence, the losses of silencing and repression on transposon and satellite repeat activation cause disorganized nuclear distribution of HSF1 (the central transcription factor that mediates HSR), contributing to HSR suppression and proteostasis decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaglia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jolly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Swanson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Van Meter et al., 2014</xref>). A very recent report showed that ERC-like DNA circles in yeast cells impair nuclear pore integrity, causing aberrant pre-mRNA nuclear export and translation and consequently contributing to loss of proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Meinema et al., 2021</xref>). We speculate that multiple different mechanisms may operate in parallel to mediate the interplay between chromatin stability and proteostasis during aging. Further investigation will be needed to determine the relative contributions and dynamic coordination among these mechanisms.</p><p>We have focused our investigation of protein aggregation specifically on RNA-binding proteins. Recently, substantial interest has focused on the emerging connections between RNA-binding protein aggregation and age-related diseases. For example, aberrant formation and persistence of RNA-binding protein aggregates have been found to contribute to degenerative diseases, including multi-system proteinopathy, Paget’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and Alzheimer’s disease, making RNA-binding protein aggregates promising therapeutic targets for treating degenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Khalil et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ramaswami et al., 2013</xref>). However, a systematic analysis of age-dependent RNA-binding protein aggregation remained missing, in part due to a lack of quantitative and high-throughput cellular reporters. In this study, we took advantage of a recently developed synthetic genetic system, yTRAP, which couples protein aggregation states to fluorescent reporter output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Newby et al., 2017</xref>), and a high-throughput microfluidic platform, DynOMICS, which enables simultaneous time-lapse measurements of a large number of fluorescent strains over an extended period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graham et al., 2020</xref>). We screened the yTRAP RNA-binding protein sensor library, which encompasses most of the confirmed yeast RNA-binding proteins, and identified rRNA-binding proteins as the most enriched group of proteins that aggregate in response to loss of Sir2 activity. These rRNA-binding protein candidates have been independently confirmed and further analyzed, uncovering a mechanistic link between chromatin instability and proteostasis decline.</p><p>In addition to the rRNA-binding proteins, our screen has also identified a number of mRNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These proteins bind to mRNAs and form ribonucleoprotein complexes, which play important roles in post-transcriptional control of gene expression and a wide array of physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakravarty et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee and Lykke-Andersen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mitchell and Parker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ramaswami et al., 2013</xref>). Age-dependent aggregation of mRNA-binding proteins may affect their regulatory functions, contributing to aging phenotypes and cellular decline. For example, previous studies showed that the yeast RBP Whi3 forms aggregates during aging, resulting in sterility in aged yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schlissel et al., 2017</xref>). Future studies will be poised to confirm age-induced aggregation of each mRNA-binding protein identified from our screen and determine the regulation and consequence of their aggregation. In particular, proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing are highly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and would be of special interest for in-depth analyses. These investigations, combined with our current analyses of rRNA-binding proteins, will lead to a comprehensive understanding of the role of RNA-binding protein aggregation in yeast aging.</p><p>Research on aging biology has benefited tremendously from the development of genomic sequencing and systematic analyses, which have revealed many conserved genes and hallmarks that change during cell aging and influence cellular lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hendrickson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janssens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McCormick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McCormick and Promislow, 2018</xref>). An emerging challenge is to understand how these genes and factors interact and operate collectively to drive the aging process. Furthermore, it has been increasingly recognized that cell aging is a highly dynamic and stochastic process in which isogenic cells age with distinct molecular and phenotypic changes, and thereby markedly different lifespans. Such complexity has hindered progress in the mechanistic understanding of aging biology and the rational design of effective intervention strategies to promote longevity. Recent advances in single-cell technologies provide enabling tools for tracking the aging processes of a large number of individual cells and defining the core aging networks that govern the fate and dynamics of deterioration in aging cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">OLaughlin et al., 2020</xref>). As an example, the study presented here showcases how these technologies were applied to identify a cascade of events linking chromatin instability with proteostasis decline, two major age-induced processes in single cells, which allowed us to propose a simple molecular network that underlies single-cell aging in yeast populations. Importantly, this network model can be used to guide the design of combinatorial perturbations that target multiple core network nodes, rather than single genes, to dramatically extend cellular lifespan. We envision that systems-level single-cell analyses will become increasingly appreciated and adopted in aging research to unravel comprehensive regulatory networks that determine aging dynamics and advance a mechanistic understanding of the causes, progression, and consequences of aging.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

growth, maintenance, and transformation of yeast and bacteria were used throughout. The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> yeast strains used in this study were generated from the BY4741 strain background (MATa <italic>his3∆1 leu20∆ met15∆0 ura3∆0</italic>). Yeast integrative transformations were performed using the standard lithium acetate method and confirmed by PCR. To make the Hsp104-GFP reporter, yEGFP-<italic>HIS3</italic> was amplified by PCR and integrated at the C-terminus of <italic>HSP104</italic> at the native locus by homologous recombination. To make the Sis1-mNeon reporter, pKT209 (ref) was subcloned to replace yEGFP with mNeon, and then mNeon-<italic>URA3</italic> was PCR-amplified and integrated into the C-terminus of <italic>SIS1</italic> at the native locus by homologous recombination. The plasmid pRS316-∆ssCPY*-GFP was generated in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Park et al., 2007</xref>). We subcloned into pRS306 by digesting both pRS306 vector and ∆ssCPY*-GFP using SalI and HindIII and then ligating together. The newly assembled plasmid pRS306-∆ssCPY*-GFP was linearized using StuI and integrated into the <italic>ura3-1</italic> locus by homologous recombination. This strain background was BY4741 in which <italic>ura3∆0</italic> was replaced by the W303 <italic>ura3-1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2020</xref>). The strain library used in the screen for RNA-binding protein aggregation was generated in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Newby et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To create the strains carrying each of the mNeon-tagged rRNA-binding proteins, we used Gibson assembly or traditional cloning to assemble plasmids containing the coding sequences for rRNA-binding proteins tagged C-terminally with mNeon under their native promoters. These plasmids were linearized using a restriction enzyme that would specifically cut within the promoter sequence, and then integrated into the genome by homologous recombination. Integration was verified using PCR and microscopy, and the copy number of the plasmid integrated was verified using PCR to ensure single-copy insertion. These strains were used to generate the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. The rRNA-binding protein overexpression strains were similarly created. The plasmids containing the coding sequences for rRNA-binding proteins under their native promoters were constructed without any fluorescent protein tagging (to avoid potential interference of protein function by tags) and were also digested in the promoter region and integrated into the native genomic loci using homologous recombination. Integration and copy number were verified by PCR to ensure single-copy plasmid integration. These strains were used to generate the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</p><p>The <italic>sir2</italic>∆ mutant was created by amplifying either <italic>CgURA3</italic> or <italic>CgHIS3</italic> fragment to replace the <italic>SIR2</italic> open-reading frame by homologous recombination. Other genetic deletions were similarly created where each open-reading frame was replaced with a specific nutrient marker: <italic>fob1∆</italic> was created using <italic>CgURA3</italic> or <italic>CgHIS3</italic>, <italic>rpn4∆</italic> was created using <italic>CgHIS3</italic>, and <italic>ubr2</italic>∆ was created using <italic>CgHIS3</italic> or <italic>CgLEU2</italic>. The <italic>HAP4</italic> overexpression strain was constructed and verified previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Because constitutive overexpression of <italic>RRN3</italic> or <italic>NOP15</italic> adversely affects cellular physiology and condition, we constructed doxycycline-inducible expression plasmids for both genes to conditionally activate their overexpression during aging. For plasmid construction, we used the MoClo toolkit of yeast gene parts and followed the gene assembly strategy as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Any Tet-On expression system consists of the same basic components: a constitutive promoter driving the transactivator rtTA expression and a promoter with a TetO element driving a gene of interest. More specifically, the ORF of <italic>RRN3</italic> or <italic>NOP15</italic> was PCR-amplified and assembled into the entry vector pYTK001 by Golden Gate Assembly. Then it was assembled with the following plasmids by Golden Gate Assembly to create a specific combination of promoter-ORF-fluorescent tag-terminator: pYTK003 (ConL1), NHB1016 (TetO7-P<italic><sub>LEU2m</sub></italic>), pYTK-ORF (<italic>RRN3</italic> or <italic>NOP15</italic>), pYTK034 (mRuby2), pYTK065 (T<italic><sub>ENO2</sub></italic>), pYTK072 (ConRE), and pYTK095 (AmpR-ColE1). Meanwhile, the coding sequence of rtTA3 was put under the <italic>P<sub>RPL18B</sub></italic> promoter from the MoClo yeast toolkit, creating the <italic>P<sub>RPL18B</sub>-rtTA3</italic> plasmid (NHB1028). The resulting two plasmids and NHB0980, which is a backbone plasmid containing <italic>LEU2</italic> as a nutritional selection marker, were then assembled by Golden Gate Assembly to get the final plasmid, <italic>P<sub>RPL18B</sub>-rtTA3-T<sub>ADH1</sub>-TetO7-P<sub>LEU2m</sub>-RRN3-mRuby2-T<sub>ENO2</sub>-LEU2</italic> (NHB1148) or <italic>P<sub>RPL18B</sub>-rtTA3-T<sub>ADH1</sub>-TetO7-P<sub>LEU2m</sub>-NOP15-T<sub>ENO2</sub>-LEU2</italic> (NHB1150).

The inducible overexpression yeast strains were then created through genomic integration of NHB1148 or NHB1150 (linearized using <italic>NotI</italic>) by homologous recombination with the flanking sequences of the <italic>leu2∆0</italic> locus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Microfluidic device fabrication</title><p>Design and fabrication of the microfluidic device for yeast replicative aging followed previously published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, 4-inch silicon wafers (University Wafer Inc) were patterned with SU8 2000 series (Kayakli Advanced Materials, Inc) photoresists using standard photolithography techniques in general accordance with the guidelines provided by the manufacturer. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) device was made from the silicon wafer mold by mixing 33 g of Sylgard 184 (Dow Inc) and pouring it on the wafer surrounded with aluminum foil. The wafer and PDMS are then degassed in a vacuum chamber and cured on a level surface for at least 1 hr. Design and fabrication of the DynOMICS device were carried out using techniques described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graham et al., 2020</xref>). This PDMS device was made from the silicon wafer mold by mixing 77 g of Sylgard 184 and pouring it on the wafer centered on a level 5″ × 5″ glass plate surrounded by an aluminum foil seal. The degassed PDMS is placed on a level surface and allowed to cure at 95°C for 1 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Single-cell aging microfluidics setup</title><p>A PDMS aging device was cleaned and sonicated in 100% ethanol for 15 min, followed by a rinse sonication in Milli-Q water. The device was dried and cleaned with an adhesive tape. A glass coverslip was cleaned in a series of washes with heptane, followed by methanol, then Milli-Q water, and subsequently dried with an air gun. Both the coverslip and the PDMS device were exposed to oxygen plasma to bond and create a fully assembled device. Once assembled, each single-cell aging device was inspected to ensure no defects or dust contamination were present.</p><p>To begin the experiment setup, the device was first placed under vacuum for 20 min. All media ports covered were then immediately covered by 0.075% Tween 20 for approximately 10 min. The device was then placed on an inverted microscope with a 30°C incubator system. Media ports were connected to plastic tubing and 60 mL syringes with fresh SCD media (prepared from CSM powder from Sunrise Science, #1001-100, with 2% glucose) medium containing 0.04% Tween-20. Initially the height of the syringes was approximately 2 ft above the microscope stage. The waste ports of the device were also connected to plastic tubing, which were attached by tape to stage height. Yeast cells were inoculated into 1.5 mL of SCD and cultured overnight at 30°C. This saturated overnight culture was then diluted 1:10,000 and grown at 30°C overnight until cells reached approximately OD600nm 0.6. For loading, cells were diluted approximately twofold and transferred to a 60 mL syringe (Luer-Lok Tip, BD) and connected to plastic tubing (TYGON, ID 0.020 IN, OD 0.060 IN, wall 0.020 IN). Cells were loaded by temporarily replacing the input media port with the syringe filled with yeast culture. The syringe containing the yeast is also placed approximately 2 ft above the stage. The media and cells flow into the device using gravity-driven flow. Cell traps are generally filled with cells in under a minute, at which point the loading tubing is replaced with the media tubing and syringe. Once cells are loaded, syringes are raised to be approximately 60 inches above the stage. Waste tubing is lowered to the floor and waste is collected in a 50 mL tube to measure flow rate of about 2.5 mL/day. Note that Tween-20 is a non-ionic surfactant that helps reduce cell friction on the PDMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferry et al., 2011</xref>). We have validated previously that this low concentration of Tween-20 has no significant effect on cellular lifespan or physiology. This setup protocol was developed and described in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Time-lapse microscopy</title><p>Time-lapse microscopy experiments were performed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-2 inverted fluorescence microscope with Perfect Focus and a back-illuminated sCMOS camera (Teledyne Photometrics Prime 95B). The light source is a Lumencor SpectraX. Images were taken using a CFI plan Apochromat Lambda DM ×60 oil immersion objective (NA 1.40 WD 0.13MM). Microfluidic devices were taped to a custom-built stage adapter and placed on the motorized stage. In all experiments, images were acquired using Nikon Elements software every 15 min for the duration of the yeast lifespan, typically 80 hr or longer, unless otherwise stated. The exposure and intensity settings were as follows for each of the fluorescence channels: GFP 10 ms with 10% light intensity, mCherry 50 ms with 5% light intensity, and Cy5 (iRFP) 200 ms with 2% light intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Confocal microscopy</title><p>Confocal images were acquired using a CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal module on the Nikon Eclipse Ti2-E scope used for aging experiments. The excitation light is controlled using an Agilent laser box with 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, or 640 nm lasers. Laser light is focused through the microlenses of the spinning excitation disk (Yokogawa CSU-X1). Images were taken using either Plan Apo lambda ×60 NA 1.40 oil, or SR HP APO TIRF ×100 1.49 NA objectives. Laser intensity settings were 30% for 488 nm, 50% for 561 nm, and 50% for 640 nm. For time-lapse confocal imaging in aging cells, we acquire the images every 13 hr to minimize phototoxicity generated from confocal laser scanning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>DynOMICS and yTRAP screen setup</title><p>Four 48-strain yeast DynOMICS devices were cleaned with 70% ethanol, DI water, and Scotch tape (3M), and each was aligned to a custom Singer ROTOR-compatible fixture. Both the fixture and a clean glass slide sonicated with 2% Hellmanex III were exposed to oxygen plasma. Cells were spotted from the previously arrayed agar plate to the aligned PDMS device using the Singer ROTOR spotting robot. The device and glass slide were bonded together and cured for 2 hr. Bonded chips were placed in a vacuum for 20 min before removal and covering of the inlet and outlet ports with SCD without folic acid or riboflavin media with 0.04% Tween-20. The microfluidic devices were then placed on two Nikon Ti microscopes, with two chips being placed on each Ti microscope. Media ports were then connected using plastic tubing and 60 mL syringes containing SCD media (without folic acid or riboflavin) with 0.04% Tween-20. At this point, we began imaging using a ×4 objective on each microscope as yeast cells began to grow to fill the ‘bulb’ regions of each position of the device and eventually fill the downstream ‘HD biopixels.’ Both scopes were equipped with CoolSnap HQ2 cameras (Photometrics). Initial imaging conditions on the first Ti scope containing half of the yTRAP library were as follows: phase contrast 10 ms, GFP 400 ms, and RFP 300 ms. For the second Ti microscope, phase contrast was 20 ms, GFP 600 ms, and RFP 300 ms. Approximately 2 days after initial setup of the experiment, yeast had grown to fill the downstream biopixels at each position across the four devices. At this point, the GFP exposure time for each scope was increased to 700 ms, and we marked this point as the starting point for future data analysis of fluorescent trajectories. Images were acquired every 20 min throughout the length of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Classification of Mode 1 and Mode 2 aging cells</title><p>We classified Mode 1 and Mode 2 aging cells based on the age-dependent changes in their daughter morphologies, as described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Mode 1 cells produce elongated daughters at the late stage of lifespan, whereas Mode 2 cells produce small rounded daughters until death. The classification was further confirmed by iRFP fluorescence (indicating the intracellular heme level) and cell cycle lengths during aging. Mode 1 and Mode 2 cells exhibit distinct dynamics of iRFP fluorescence during aging – the iRFP fluorescence increases toward the late stage of Mode 1 aging; in contrast, iRFP signal sharply decreases at the early stage of Mode 2 aging and remains extremely low throughout the entire lifespan. Mode 1 and Mode 2 cells show age-dependent extension of cell cycle length with different timing and extents. Mode 1 cells show a gradual extension of cell cycle length at the late stages of aging; in contrast, Mode 2 cells show a much earlier and more dramatic extension of cell cycle length during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2020</xref>). These age-dependent iRFP fluorescence and cell cycle length dynamics provide robust and quantitative metrics to further confirm the classification of the two aging modes, independent of the need for specific microfluidic devices or imaging setup.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Experiments with doxycycline-induced protein overexpression</title><p>Doxycycline was used as an activator to induce expression of TetO promoter-driven constructs including <italic>RRN3</italic> and <italic>NOP15</italic>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Martin Sebastian Denzel as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Peter Tessarz (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The link between rDNA instability and protein aggregation is intriguing and important. The reviewers agree, however, that this link between two hallmarks of aging (which is the key selling point for the manuscript), is not fully supported and other explanations of the data are possible.</p><p>1. A clear and convincing causal link between rDNA instability and protein aggregation is needed.</p><p>2. It would be important to address if hsp104 puncta in fact indicate protein homeostasis defects.</p><p>3. The nature of the RBP aggregates remains unclear. Might they be deteriorating nucleoli?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To better support the conclusions made in the paper I would suggest the following experiments.</p><p>1. Loss of sir2 exacerbates hsp104 aggregation (Figure 1). To demonstrate a direct involvement, it would be great to also analyze sir2 o/e yeast. They have an extended lifespan and it would be interesting to know if they show reduced hsp104 aggregation.</p><p>2. NAM was used in the screen to inhibit sir2. It would be helpful to confirm some of the screen results in the sir2 mutant background. This is done for Nop15, but it would be good to confirm the results more generally, e.g. for the top 15 decreased RBPs.</p><p>3. Figure 4 analyses the contribution of rDNA circles and of rDNA transcription to Nop15 aggregation. These data are very important to illuminate the mechanistic link between rDNA silencing and protein aggregation. For this reason, it would be important to directly measure the levels of rRNA and of the rDNA circles.<italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Previous studies showed that the formation of Hsp104 foci does not mean a proteostasis decline, instead, it is probably an adaptation or resolution to the proteostasis stress. For example, Barral's lab published an <italic>eLife</italic> paper in 2015 using microfluidics and imaging to show that protein aggregates associated with replicative aging without compromising protein quality control. In addition, the field generally considers protein aggregation as a protective solution that resolves proteostasis defect by concentrating toxic misfolded proteins into a deposition. Fail to form foci is correlated with cytotoxicity and death (e.g., Finkbeiner's 2004 nature paper, PMID15483602). This probably explains why the Model 1 cells, which show Hsp104 foci, actually have longer lifespan than the Model 2 cells that failed to assemble a Hsp104 foci.</p><p>2. It is not clear if the condensation of RBPs they showed are really protein aggregates. The example images in Figure 3A shows that these RBPs form several condensates instead of one that found in young and Model 2 cells. It is known that nucleolus fragment during aging, therefore, the condensates they saw are likely just an outcome of nucleolus fragmentation. This will make sense given that model 1 cells have rDNA silence defects, the accumulation of ERCs and their transcription help nucleate multiple condensates. By definition, protein aggregates accumulate misfolded proteins that do not carry their original functions. If these RBP condensates contains ERCs and there is active transcription of rRNA going on inside these RBP condensates, then they are not protein aggregates. Based on the logic of this manuscript, the RBP form multiple condensates because of rRNA transcription, which nucleate the condensation of these RBPs. If so, it implies that these condensates are active rRNA transcription center and/or ribosome assembly cores, but not protein aggregations. The authors should study the biophysical property of the condensates to see if cells with different number of condensates indeed have different condensates, such as FRAP etc, and compare them to the real protein aggregates such as Hsp104 foci. The other assays, such as the ones used by Barral's 2015 <italic>eLife</italic> paper (PMC4635334) to check if different chaperones are enriched on these condensates. This would be recommended for the authors to classify &quot;moderate&quot; vs &quot;severe&quot; condensates in figure 4.</p><p>3. There is not enough evidence that RBP condensation contributes to the cytosolic proteostasis reported by Hsp104 foci in their results. As explained below in #7, the % cells with multiple RBP condensates (in Figure 3 and Figure 4) are less than cells with Hsp104 foci (in Figure 1), which starts to appear at different life stage in wild type cells. Instead of investigating the temporal correlation between these RBP condensates and Hsp104 foci via single cell trajectories in wild type cells, the authors focus on the correlations between the different level of rDNA silence defect in mutant strains with different probability of showing Hsp104 foci in figure 5. However, it is not surprising to see short lived cells develop Hsp104 foci earlier while long lived strains delay their appearance. This correlation applies to other mutants that do not have direct effect on rDNA silence and ERC accumulation and therefore cannot exclusively support a casual effect here in their model. In the end, the reviewer cannot see how or whether rDNA instability causes proteostasis defect, especially the Hsp104 foci are in the cytosol. In fact, the authors do not consider the opposite hypothesis that the loss of proteostasis leads to the RBP condensation as shown in the rpn4∆ cells (figure 4).</p><p>In addition to these major concerns, there are several important things the authors have to resolve:</p><p>4. Figure 1 is critical to show the enrichment of Hsp104 foci in Model 1 cells and author implies that rDNA silence defect correlates with the Hsp104 foci. The example cells shown in Figure 1A shows that rDNA-GFP increase happens at age of 30 but the appearance of Hsp104 foci happens at 19. It is not clear to the reviewer how can rDNA instability contributes to hsp104 foci if the instability happens &gt;10 generations later. I think the authors should include the information of rDNA-GFP fluctuation in the quantification showing in Figure 1B as well to quantitively show such correlation between rDNA-GFP and Hsp104 foci. A correlation between them should be calculated as well.</p><p>5. Figure 1-supplement 2 should show the trajectories of foci like Figure 1B as well. Being quantitive is the strength of single cell microfluidics and the authors should include the individual trajectory when the microfluidics data contain such information.</p><p>6. the correlation shown in Figure 1-supplement 3 is a result of mixed WT and ∆sir2. The author should calculate the correlation for each strain independently. The inclusion of ∆sir2 data point seems to increase the correlation shown in this figure. In the other words, the RLS and age for the first foci appearance in WT is much weaker. That was my impression when looking at Figure 1B as I can see the cells with longer RLS is not free of Hsp104 foci. Instead, these long-lived cells are associated with more Hsp104 foci. This goes back to my first point that Hsp104 foci is an indication of cellular adaptation but not defect.</p><p>7. Figure 3A needs quantification to show % cells showing these phenotypes. In fact, related to this question, the authors showed the trajectory of individual cells in figure 4A and I think the % of cells showing multiple RBP condensates (they refer to as &quot;severe aggregation&quot;) are less than 5% before age 21-25. However, about 40% cells started to show Hsp104 foci around 10-15 generations and more cells with Hsp104 foci in figure 1A. If these multiple RBP condensates indeed contribute to Hsp104 foci formation in the cytosol, this connection is 10 generations apart. For this reason, it is highly recommended to analyze the trajectory of RBP condensation and rDNA-GFP/Hsp104 foci formation together for individual cells from the microfluidics to show/calculate temporal correlation.</p><p>8. Figure 4B has a quantification error: the ∆ubr2 cells have 1 out of 5 cells showing blue lines (so called &quot;moderate aggregation&quot;) between 4680-5460 min in the single cell trajectory, but the quantification showing that cells with 26+ have 50% with blue lines (so called &quot;moderate aggregation&quot;).</p><p>9. in page 11, line 3, it says the Nop15-mNeon was visualized every 13 hours? I think that's not right.</p><p>10. The authors use Rrn3 OE to show that increased rRNA production correlates with appearance of multiple RBP condensates. However, Rrn3 itself is a low complex protein (between a.a. 250-306 etc) and therefore its OE could seed/promote the condensation of other proteins like other people shown in liquid phase separation studies.</p><p>11. Figure 5C shows a synergistic effect between ubr2∆ and HAP4OE. The authors showed in their previous paper that HAP4 OE change the Model 2 cells, how about ubr2∆? From the logic presented in the manuscript, ubr2∆ should increase the RLS of Model 1 cells but not Model 2 cells. This is not tested.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The Hsp104-GFP foci shown throughout the paper are convincing. Given that the authors focus on rRNA-binding proteins later in the manuscript, it would be good to understand if the majority of foci are cytoplasmic or nuclear. Cytoplasmic foci might be more difficult to reconcile with aggregating nucleolar proteins.</p><p>sir2 enhances Hsp104 foci, but does fob1 decrease them – so, is enhanced stability able to prevent protein aggregation? As sir2D will impact other heterochromatic regions in the genome (mating type locus, telomeres), the authors would need to provide more evidence that the observed loss in proteostasis is indeed mediated by an increase in rDNA instability. One simple way would be to use strains that have lower rDNA copy numbers, which leads to instability specifically at this locus (see Ida et al., Science 2010). How would Hsp104-GFP look like in these strains?</p><p>Specificity of NAM-mediated Sir2 inhibition: NAM inhibits all NAD-depdendent deacetylases in yeast, incl.

We monitored Nop15-mNeon and Hsp104-mCherry in the same cells (new Figure 5A).

Figure 4 analyses the contribution of rDNA circles and of rDNA transcription to Nop15 aggregation. These data are very important to illuminate the mechanistic link between rDNA silencing and protein aggregation. For this reason, it would be important to directly measure the levels of rRNA and of the rDNA circles.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we monitored changes in rDNA copy number (as an indication of the number of rDNA circles; see PMID:31291577) during aging using a rDNA::lacO, LacI-GFP strain from the Kobayashi group (Miyazaki and Kobayashi, 2011) and showed its temporal relationship with rRNA-binding protein aggregation (new Figure 4 —figure supplement 1). The same approach has been used to show age-induced increases in rDNA circles during yeast aging (see Morlot et al., 2019; PMID:31291577).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Previous studies showed that the formation of Hsp104 foci does not mean a proteostasis decline, instead, it is probably an adaptation or resolution to the proteostasis stress. For example, Barral's lab published an eLife paper in 2015 using microfluidics and imaging to show that protein aggregates associated with replicative aging without compromising protein quality control. In addition, the field generally considers protein aggregation as a protective solution that resolves proteostasis defect by concentrating toxic misfolded proteins into a deposition. Fail to form foci is correlated with cytotoxicity and death (e.g., Finkbeiner's 2004 nature paper, PMID15483602). This probably explains why the Model 1 cells, which show Hsp104 foci, actually have longer lifespan than the Model 2 cells that failed to assemble a Hsp104 foci.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that Hsp104 foci indicate the presence of “proteostasis stress” or “challenges to proteostasis” during aging, rather than “loss of proteostasis”. To address this, we have revised the text and data interpretation throughout the manuscript (see tracked changes throughout the main text) and our working model (new Figure 6A) accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is not clear if the condensation of RBPs they showed are really protein aggregates. The example images in Figure 3A shows that these RBPs form several condensates instead of one that found in young and Model 2 cells. It is known that nucleolus fragment during aging, therefore, the condensates they saw are likely just an outcome of nucleolus fragmentation. This will make sense given that model 1 cells have rDNA silence defects, the accumulation of ERCs and their transcription help nucleate multiple condensates. By definition, protein aggregates accumulate misfolded proteins that do not carry their original functions. If these RBP condensates contains ERCs and there is active transcription of rRNA going on inside these RBP condensates, then they are not protein aggregates. Based on the logic of this manuscript, the RBP form multiple condensates because of rRNA transcription, which nucleate the condensation of these RBPs. If so, it implies that these condensates are active rRNA transcription center and/or ribosome assembly cores, but not protein aggregations. The authors should study the biophysical property of the condensates to see if cells with different number of condensates indeed have different condensates, such as FRAP etc, and compare them to the real protein aggregates such as Hsp104 foci. The other assays, such as the ones used by Barral's 2015 eLife paper (PMC4635334) to check if different chaperones are enriched on these condensates. This would be recommended for the authors to classify &quot;moderate&quot; vs &quot;severe&quot; condensates in figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this question. As suggested, we monitored the localization of Nop15, a representative rRNA-binding protein, and Sis1, the Hsp40 co-chaperone that functions in clearance of misfolded proteins in the nucleus. We showed that Sis1 clearly accumulated in Nop15 condensates in aged cells, whereas no such colocalization was observed in young cells (new Figure 3B). These results, together with the data showing (1) increased rRNA-binding protein aggregation shortens lifespan (Figure 3C), and (2) the proteasome capacity influences the kinetics and extent of rRNA-binding protein condensation (Figure 4B), indicate that age-induced rRNAbinding protein condensates are <italic>bona fide</italic> protein aggregates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There is not enough evidence that RBP condensation contributes to the cytosolic proteostasis reported by Hsp104 foci in their results. As explained below in #7, the % cells with multiple RBP condensates (in Figure 3 and Figure 4) are less than cells with Hsp104 foci (in Figure 1), which starts to appear at different life stage in wild type cells. Instead of investigating the temporal correlation between these RBP condensates and Hsp104 foci via single cell trajectories in wild type cells, the authors focus on the correlations between the different level of rDNA silence defect in mutant strains with different probability of showing Hsp104 foci in figure 5. However, it is not surprising to see short lived cells develop Hsp104 foci earlier while long lived strains delay their appearance. This correlation applies to other mutants that do not have direct effect on rDNA silence and ERC accumulation and therefore cannot exclusively support a casual effect here in their model. In the end, the reviewer cannot see how or whether rDNA instability causes proteostasis defect, especially the Hsp104 foci are in the cytosol. In fact, the authors do not consider the opposite hypothesis that the loss of proteostasis leads to the RBP condensation as shown in the rpn4∆ cells (figure 4).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we monitored Nop15-mNeon and Hsp104-mCherry in the same cells (new Figure 5A). We found continuous co-occurrence of Nop15 aggregation and Hsp104 foci during the later stage of aging in the majority of Mode 1 cells (Figure 5A, left). Furthermore, in 66% of these cells, Nop15 aggregation (indicated by green bars in Figure 5A) immediately preceded the co-occurrence phase (indicated by yellow bars in Figure 5A), suggesting that rRNA-binding protein aggregation leads to global proteostasis stress in a large fraction of aging cells. We also observed occasional, transient appearance of Hsp104 foci during the early stage of aging in both Mode 1 and Mode 2 cells, which did not show any obvious relationship to Nop15 aggregation that occurred much later in aging. We have added a discussion about the potential sources of these early-life events (Page 17, Line 14-17).</p><p>To confirm that the different patterns of Hsp104 foci formation observed in various mutants (e.g. <italic>sir2</italic>D and <italic>fob1</italic>D) are not a side-effect of lifespan modulation, we examined Hsp104 foci during aging in additional mutants that influence rDNA stability.

Figure 1 is critical to show the enrichment of Hsp104 foci in Model 1 cells and author implies that rDNA silence defect correlates with the Hsp104 foci. The example cells shown in Figure 1A shows that rDNA-GFP increase happens at age of 30 but the appearance of Hsp104 foci happens at 19. It is not clear to the reviewer how can rDNA instability contributes to hsp104 foci if the instability happens &gt;10 generations later. I think the authors should include the information of rDNA-GFP fluctuation in the quantification showing in Figure 1B as well to quantitively show such correlation between rDNA-GFP and Hsp104 foci. A correlation between them should be calculated as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Hsp104-GFP and rDNA-GFP were not measured in the same cells or in the same experiments, and hence cannot be directly compared. We included representative images of rDNA-GFP in the previous version of Figure 1 to illustrate the difference in rDNA silencing between Mode 1 and Mode 2 aging cells. To avoid confusion, we removed the representative images of rDNA-GFP in new Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 1-supplement 2 should show the trajectories of foci like Figure 1B as well. Being quantitive is the strength of single cell microfluidics and the authors should include the individual trajectory when the microfluidics data contain such information.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we quantified the single-cell aging trajectories for aggregation of the nuclear chaperone Sis1, as an additional proteostasis stress reporter in the nucleus (new Figure 1, C and D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The correlation shown in Figure 1-supplement 3 is a result of mixed WT and ∆sir2. The author should calculate the correlation for each strain independently. The inclusion of ∆sir2 data point seems to increase the correlation shown in this figure. In the other words, the RLS and age for the first foci appearance in WT is much weaker. That was my impression when looking at Figure 1B as I can see the cells with longer RLS is not free of Hsp104 foci. Instead, these long-lived cells are associated with more Hsp104 foci. This goes back to my first point that Hsp104 foci is an indication of cellular adaptation but not defect.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we replotted the correlation between first Hsp104 foci appearance and lifespan for WT and <italic>sir2</italic>∆ separately (new Figure 1 —figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 3A needs quantification to show % cells showing these phenotypes. In fact, related to this question, the authors showed the trajectory of individual cells in figure 4A and I think the % of cells showing multiple RBP condensates (they refer to as &quot;severe aggregation&quot;) are less than 5% before age 21-25. However, about 40% cells started to show Hsp104 foci around 10-15 generations and more cells with Hsp104 foci in figure 1A. If these multiple RBP condensates indeed contribute to Hsp104 foci formation in the cytosol, this connection is 10 generations apart. For this reason, it is highly recommended to analyze the trajectory of RBP condensation and rDNA-GFP/Hsp104 foci formation together for individual cells from the microfluidics to show/calculate temporal correlation.</p></disp-quote><p>As addressed above in pt3, we monitored Nop15-mNeon and Hsp104-mCherry in the same cells (new Figure 5A) and observed that Nop15 aggregation (indicated by green bars in Figure 5A) immediately preceded continuous co-appearance of Nop15 aggregation and Hsp104 aggregation during later stages of aging in a large fraction of cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 4B has a quantification error: the ∆ubr2 cells have 1 out of 5 cells showing blue lines (so called &quot;moderate aggregation&quot;) between 4680-5460 min in the single cell trajectory, but the quantification showing that cells with 26+ have 50% with blue lines (so called &quot;moderate aggregation&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewer for pointing this out.

We have added a clarification in the Methods (Page 29, Line 16-18).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The authors use Rrn3 OE to show that increased rRNA production correlates with appearance of multiple RBP condensates. However, Rrn3 itself is a low complex protein (between a.a. 250-306 etc) and therefore its OE could seed/promote the condensation of other proteins like other people shown in liquid phase separation studies.</p></disp-quote><p>Proteins with putative low complexity domains do not necessarily affect proteostasis or aggregation of other proteins, and we cannot find any previous evidence in support of the possibility that Rrn3 forms aggregates or contributes to proteostasis decline. Therefore, we stand with our interpretation of the data and our working model, which are supported by a series of other data together.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Figure 5C shows a synergistic effect between ubr2∆ and HAP4OE. The authors showed in their previous paper that HAP4 OE change the Model 2 cells, how about ubr2∆? From the logic presented in the manuscript, ubr2∆ should increase the RLS of Model 1 cells but not Model 2 cells. This is not tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a discussion about the effects of <italic>UBR2</italic> deletion in lifespans in Mode 1 and Mode 2 cells and proteostasis in cells aging with mitochondrial defects in the text (Page 17, Line 22 – Page 18, Line 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The Hsp104-GFP foci shown throughout the paper are convincing.

We indeed observed that, similar to Hsp104, the nuclear chaperone Sis1 also forms aggregates predominantly in Mode 1 aging cells (new Figure 1, C and D). In addition, Sis1 aggregates colocalize with Nop15 aggregates in aged cells (new Figure 3B). Our working model to interpret the Hsp104 data is that rRNA-binding protein aggregation contributes to global proteostasis stress by exacerbating ribosomal dysfunction and increasing the burden on the proteostasis network, including chaperons and proteasomes (Page 15, Line 16 – Page 16, Line 1), as demonstrated in many examples from previous studies (Andersson et al. 2013, PMID: 24243762; Bence et al. 2001, PMID: 11375494; Outeiro and Lindquist, 2003, PMID: 14657500; Stefani and Dobson, 2003, PMID: 12942175; Verhoef et al. 2002, PMID: 12374759; Yu et al. 2019, PMID: 30936201).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>sir2 enhances Hsp104 foci, but does fob1 decrease them – so, is enhanced stability able to prevent protein aggregation? As sir2D will impact other heterochromatic regions in the genome (mating type locus, telomeres), the authors would need to provide more evidence that the observed loss in proteostasis is indeed mediated by an increase in rDNA instability.
