Taste receptors that sense high-calorie sugars are essential to this process. Typically, when food tastes sweet, it signals that the food contains nutrients and promotes consumption. However, eating too much sugar can be detrimental because the animal wastes time and energy eating food that it does not need, and could eventually lead to obesity and other metabolic diseases. This raised the question: are there any taste receptors that, once they detect sugars, cause animals to eat less?</p><p>Joseph et al. worked with the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and identified one such taste receptor called IR60b. The experiments showed that this taste receptor responds selectively to sucrose (a high-calorie sugar), and that it activates nerve cells that cause fruit flies to eat less food, rather than more. When the receptor was experimentally inactivated, the fruit flies ate for longer and ate too much sucrose. This indicates that the flies need this receptor to control their sugar intake.</p><p>A next step will be to see if mammals similarly use sweet-sensing taste receptors to limit the amount of food they eat. A better insight into how mammals can control what they eat could provide a deeper understanding of how to tackle major health issues, such as obesity, in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24992.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24992.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>taste</kwd><kwd>feeding inhibition</kwd><kwd>dietary regulation</kwd><kwd>ionotropic receptor</kwd><kwd>gustatory receptor</kwd><kwd>pharynx</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5F32DC013507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joseph</surname><given-names>Ryan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jennifer S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jennifer S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carlson</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Although sugar-sensing taste neurons typically promote feeding, a taste neuron in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pharynx limits feeding via the IR60b receptor; thus, revealing a new element in the circuit logic of feeding control.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Feeding regulation is a critical problem in animal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morton et al., 2006</xref>). Organisms must consume sufficient levels of nutrients to thrive, but overconsumption can have severe consequences. The initiation of feeding has been studied in the model genetic system <italic>Drosophila,</italic> whose taste system has many parallels to that of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liman et al., 2014</xref>). A variety of molecular and cellular mechanisms must operate for feeding to be initiated. Discrete classes of taste receptors and neurons assess the molecular composition of a potential food source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thorne et al., 2004</xref>). Receptors sensitive to sugars signal the presence of nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dahanukar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freeman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wisotsky et al., 2011</xref>); receptors sensitive to bitter-tasting compounds signal the danger of toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>). If nutrient levels are sufficiently high and toxin levels sufficiently low, the animal begins to feed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">French et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The termination of feeding, once begun, is poorly understood. When nutrients are readily available and toxins are absent, what mechanisms terminate feeding? Previously described mechanisms that terminate feeding are based in central neural circuits that act downstream from taste neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hergarden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pool et al., 2014</xref>). Some involve internal sensors that monitor post-ingestive nutrient concentrations in the hemolymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyamoto et al., 2012</xref>) or mechanical tension in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olds and Xu, 2014</xref>), while others involve cells in the taste center of the brain that are controlled by the satiety state of the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yapici et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It would seem advantageous for an animal to have an additional means of inhibiting feeding, a mechanism that operates on a fast time-scale and functions directly in the gustatory organs. Such a mechanism could prevent overconsumption at an early stage, before the animal has invested in the ingestion of nutrients that may be not only unnecessary, but detrimental.</p><p>The gustatory organs of the fly include the legs, the labellum, and the pharyngeal sense organs, which include the labral sense organ (LSO)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gendre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stocker, 1994</xref>). Taste reception in these organs is mediated by a large number of receptors, including those of the Gustatory receptor (Gr) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clyne et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scott et al., 2001</xref>), which detect a variety of sugars and bitter compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liman et al., 2014</xref>). Members of an ancient class of sensory receptors called the ionotropic receptors (IRs) were recently found be expressed in taste organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Croset et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, a large clade of IRs called the IR20a clade were mapped to taste neurons in the legs, labellum, and pharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stewart et al., 2015</xref>). The functions of the <italic>IR20a</italic> clade genes are virtually unexplored, although analysis of two that are expressed in the male leg has revealed roles in male mating behavior, presumably as pheromone receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koh et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Among the ~35 members of the <italic>IR20a</italic> clade, one gene, <italic>IR60b,</italic> is exceptional in two ways.

Strikingly, these IR60b neurons inhibit sucrose consumption, in contrast to other sugar-sensitive taste neurons that promote sucrose consumption. Silencing the IR60b neurons increases sucrose uptake, while activating these neurons reduces sugar uptake. Sucrose detection by these neurons depends on the IR60b receptor, as revealed in behavioral and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging analysis of an <italic>IR60b</italic> mutant. The <italic>IR60b</italic> phenotype shows a high degree of specificity when tested with a broad panel of tastants. An automated analysis of feeding behavior in freely moving flies shows that IR60b acts to limit the duration of feeding bouts. Taken together, this study identifies a novel function for an understudied class of receptor and taste neuron.

IR60b is expressed in the LSO in sensillum 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>), which houses eight neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gendre et al., 2004</xref>).

These two neurons promote the consumption of sweet foods. The other six neurons have not been assigned a molecular identity, and their function is unknown.</p><p>To determine whether <italic>IR60b</italic> is expressed in an orphan neuron, we performed a systematic double-driver analysis. We first combined <italic>IR60b-GAL4</italic> with <italic>Gr-GAL4</italic> drivers and used <italic>UAS-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee and Luo, 1999</xref>) to count the number of labeled cells in the LSO. The neurons in this sensillum are tightly grouped, but careful analysis of the confocal z-stacks allowed us to determine the number of labeled neurons. We found that while <italic>IR60b-GAL4</italic> labels a single neuron in the LSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; the arrowhead indicates a labeled cell body in one of the two bilaterally symmetric neurons), and <italic>Gr64a-GAL4</italic> labels two neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), together the two drivers label three neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

We verified that flies exhibit robust consumption of sucrose solutions in this paradigm across a wide range of concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The total time of feeding increased with sucrose concentration and saturated at ~100 mM. The rate of pumping in this paradigm, that is the swallowing rate, was independent of concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), consistent with previous results that pumping rate is not impeded by viscosity at sucrose concentrations less than 1M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manzo et al., 2012</xref>). To confirm the constant pumping rate, we plotted the number of swallows against total time of feeding for each fly, pooled across all sucrose concentrations and found a strong correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91; p&lt;0.001). To determine whether the time of feeding in turn correlated with the volume of food ingested, we made extracts from individual flies after recording the time of feeding. We measured the light absorbance of each extract to measure the amount of blue dye consumed, and from this value calculated the volume of sucrose solution consumed (Materials and methods). The feeding time was in fact correlated with the volume ingested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.76; p&lt;0.001). Thus, the total feeding time serves as a reasonable measure of the amount of consumption in this paradigm.</p><p>To test whether the IR60b neuron acts in feeding regulation, we used <italic>IR60b-GAL4</italic> to drive <italic>UAS-tetanus toxin (TNT)</italic>, which blocks synaptic signaling from neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sweeney et al., 1995</xref>).

At all sucrose concentrations, the silenced flies showed greater feeding times than the parental controls, which were equivalent to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Feeding time was equivalently low among the three genotypes when tested with a control water solution, arguing that the silencing of IR60b neurons did not affect baseline levels of thirst or satiety. The silencing of the IR60b neuron did not affect pumping rate at any concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), arguing that increased feeding times were not due to motor defects that caused flies to swallow at a lower rate.

Further analysis shown below confirmed that sucrose activates the IR60b neuron directly (Figure 7F,G). We therefore wished to test a stimulus that did not activate the IR60b neuron but that elicited a substantial baseline feeding level.

The current study extends the functions of this clade to include sugar-sensing, which has not previously been observed for any member of the entire IR family.</p><p>The simplest interpretation of our results is that IR60b is a sucrose receptor or co-receptor. IR60b maps to a pharyngeal neuron that does not express any previously defined Gr sugar receptors such as Gr43a and Gr64a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>). Although we have not identified any Gr receptors that map to the IR60b neuron, both IR94f and IR94h co-mapped with IR60b.

Sucrose is a dissaccharide composed of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose, and it is possible that at high concentrations glucose may bind to a site that has evolved to bind sucrose.</p><p>We note that the high specificity of the IR60b phenotype argues against a role for the IR60b receptor in signaling osmolarity, viscosity, or mechanosensory stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A new element in the logic of feeding control</title><p>Fifty years of research on fly taste has enshrined the orthodoxy that sugars act on taste organs to stimulate feeding, whereas bitter compounds act on them to inhibit feeding. In this study, we have identified a peripheral taste neuron that detects sucrose but that inhibits feeding. That is, sucrose assumes a negative rather than a positive valence with respect to this neuron.</p><p>We note that both loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments suggest that the IR60b neuron does not alone dictate the level of consumption. In the absence of <italic>IR60b,</italic> the fly does not feed continuously, and when the IR60b neuron is activated optogenetically the fly does not terminate all feeding. Rather, the IR60b neuron appears to act as a brake, to temper the activity of other neurons that promote feeding. These other neurons include the pharyngeal neurons that coexpress Gr sugar receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Sucrose has high-caloric value. Why after detecting and locating a source of sucrose would it be advantageous for a fly to have a taste neuron that inhibits its consumption? First, although sucrose is an energy-rich nutrient, a large increase in sucrose levels may disrupt the nutrient homeostasis in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyamoto et al., 2012</xref>). The IR60b neuron may provide a mechanism for moderating the rate of sucrose intake and thereby helping to maintain homeostasis.</p><p>There may be special advantages to activating an inhibitory circuit from a peripheral taste receptor. The inhibition can begin quickly, in contrast to the post-ingestive inhibition that occurs only after sugars reach nutrient sensors in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyamoto et al., 2012</xref>). A fast-acting inhibition could prevent a rapid influx of sugar into the system. By tempering the dynamics of sugar intake, the circuit could prevent the system from quickly moving far from equilibrium and requiring major metabolic costs to restore. A similar mechanism could exist in mammals to limit water ingestion: peripheral osmolarity detectors may be responsible in part for the cessation of water drinking before systemic osmolarity levels are affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourque, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In a more general sense, there are advantages to a system that has circuit mechanisms of both activation and inhibition. Dual control may allow the system to be fine-tuned more precisely. For example, changes in the internal state of the fly could in principle affect feeding by modulation of both positive and negative control mechanisms. Positive control mechanisms in this system have recently been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yapici et al., 2016</xref>), and now IR60b neurons identify a negative control mechanism; together, these mechanisms may allow for a more precise orchestration of feeding behavior. For example, satiety negatively modulates Gr43a neurons, and it will be interesting to determine whether satiety positively modulates IR60b neurons.</p><p>Flies encounter many sugars in their environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Das et al., 2016</xref>). Why might it be advantageous to have a mechanism that is tuned to sucrose as opposed to other sugars? As fruits ripen, sucrose levels decline and the levels of other sugars increase in many cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akazawa and Okamoto, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chareoansiri and Kongkachuichai, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hardy, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schwieterman et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> prefers feeding on fruits that are at advanced stages of ripening. Perhaps a circuit that inhibits feeding on sources rich in sucrose might tend to favor feeding on food sources with low sucrose concentrations. Such food sources might be richer in monosaccharides or other nutrients, or in microbial species to which <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is well adapted.</p><p>How is this new circuit element integrated into the overall circuit logic of feeding regulation? One possibility is that under natural conditions the dynamics of the IR60b response are slower than those of the pharyngeal Gr43a neuron, a neuron that promotes feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yapici et al., 2016</xref>). According to this model, after the fly encounters an acceptable food source, the Gr43a neuron would be activated and promote a feeding response. The IR60b neuron would be excited subsequently and activate a circuit that inhibits the Gr43a neuron, thereby limiting feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). The absence of IR60b would lead to overconsumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>).</p><p>We note finally that the central projections of the IR60b neuron differ from those of other pharyngeal neurons. <italic>GAL4</italic> drivers representing receptors of the <italic>IR20a</italic> clade label projections in the dorsoanterior subesophageal zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koh et al., 2014</xref>).

It will be interesting to determine by mutational analysis whether either IR94f or IR94h act in the same neuron to limit overconsumption of other tastants not considered in the present analysis. Likewise, it will be interesting to determine if other taste neurons in the fly play analogous roles, perhaps limiting overconsumption of other taste stimuli.</p><p>It is striking that sucrose has a negative valence that is mediated via IR60b neurons but a positive valence via the Gr43a neuron. In both flies and mammals, NaCl has a negative valence with some taste neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amrein and Thorne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hiroi et al., 2004</xref>), and a positive valence with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).

(2012)</xref>. Mated females were aged for 10–14 days to allow for tetanus toxin (TNT) or Chrimson (CHR) to accumulate via expression from the relatively weak <italic>IR60b-GAL4</italic> driver. Flies were also aged for 10–14 days in <italic>IR60b<sup>1</sup>, IR60b<sup>2</sup>,</italic> and <italic>IR94f-GAL4</italic> experiments. Before testing, flies were placed in a 1000-μl pipette tip. A second 1000-μl pipette tip was inserted into the first tip so as to contain the fly for a starvation period of 12–14 hr. Flies were placed in a 100-mm Petri dish with three Kimwipes wetted with 5 ml water, and then transferred to a humidity-controlled room to prevent dehydration.</p><p>After starvation, the fly was aspirated into another 1000-μl pipette tip such that it was immobilized with its head and proboscis exposed. Occasionally, ends of the 1000-μl pipette tips were trimmed with a razor blade to widen the opening for the fly’s head. Flies were mounted on a micromanipulator for video recording under a Nikon SMZ800 microscope with an attached Sony HD Camcorder. Before food was delivered, the fly was presented a water droplet to ensure the animal was not overly desiccated from starvation. If it consumed water for longer than 10 s, the animal was discarded. Only ~5% of flies were discarded by this criterion.</p><p>We added 0.4 μg/μl erioglaucine blue dye to the liquid food to facilitate data acquisition. Food was presented with a P20 PipetteMan mounted on a micromanipulator, allowing for fine adjustments during delivery. The fly was offered food for 2 s. Flies that ingested liquid were allowed to continue feeding until they freely terminated feeding. After breaking contact with the drop, flies were given 3 s of rest before a subsequent presentation, in which they were given another 2 s to initiate a second bout. This process was repeated until the fly no longer responded to food. Typically, 2 s is sufficient presentation time to initiate feeding, as longer presentations did not increase the likelihood of initiating a feeding bout. On average, flies engaged in 1–3 bouts. If a fly did not initiate feeding after four attempted presentations, it was discarded as a non-responder. When testing different concentrations and tastants, the fraction of non-responders did not differ significantly between control, mutant, or transgenically manipulated flies, indicating there were no differences in the capacity to initiate feeding between the different genotypes. Typically, the fraction of non-responders was less than ~10% for appetitive sugars like sucrose.</p><p>Each fly was used for only one experiment to prevent previous experience from influencing its responses. The investigator was blind to the genotypes of the flies. The video was analyzed using QuickTime Media Player. Within each experiment, responses of different genotypes were measured in parallel, at the same time of day, by the same investigator, and within the same 3–5 day time window.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Optogenetic activation</title><p>Experiments with <italic>UAS-CsChrimson</italic> were performed as described for the pharyngeal pumping assay, except that flies were kept in the dark prior to testing, including a 24-hr period during which flies were given cornmeal food supplemented with 0.5 mM all-trans-retinal, followed by a 12-hr starvation period. After being presented a water droplet, the whole fly was illuminated by high-intensity 626 nm red LEDs at an intensity of ~5 W/m<sup>2</sup> for the duration of the assay.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Calculation of ingested volumes</title><p>The volumes ingested by single flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>) were measured as follows: 10 serial two-fold dilutions of 0.4 μg/μl erioglaucine were prepared for spectrophotometer analysis using a NanoDrop 2000c Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific: Wilmington, DE). The average optical density (OD<sub>630</sub>) was determined for 1 μl of each dilution (n ≥ 3 for each concentration). Average ODs were then used to plot a standard line for absorbance of blue dye (OD) versus the dye concentration. The resulting slope was 0.14 ± 0.001 OD/μl, and was used as a factor for converting OD values of 0.4 μg/μl erioglaucine to volume of fluid ingested by the fly.</p><p>A single mated female was fed 900 mM sucrose with 0.4 μg/μl erioglaucine blue dye in the pharyngeal pumping assay. After feeding, the fly was homogenized in water and samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 RPM to pellet the cuticle. 1 μl of supernatant from homogenized flies were then assayed with the NanoDrop Spectrometer, and an average OD value was used to determine the amount of blue dye present in each fly (n ≥ 4 OD values were averaged for each fly). The slope of the standard line for 0.4 μg/μl erioglaucine was then used to convert average OD values into volumes ingested. To control for endogenous absorbance of the extract, four females were fed 900 mM sucrose without blue dye, and OD values for each fly were obtained. The calculated values for these control flies were averaged, yielding a standard absorbance value in the OD<sub>630</sub> range. This standard value was subtracted from each measurement from the flies that were fed 900 mM sucrose with 0.4 μg/μl erioglaucine, before determining the final calculated ingested volumes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Calcium imaging</title><p>To image the cell bodies of IR60b neurons directly in the pharynx, we first removed the heads of mated females. To increase access to the esophagus and pharyngeal sensilla, the labellum lobes were carefully excised while leaving the rest of the proboscis and pharynx intact. Heads were mounted in water on a slide with three 18 × 18 mm bridging slips, positioned such that two gaps were left between the bridging slips, so liquid stimulant could be perfused through the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). A minimal amount of water was used to minimize dilution of the stimulus during the perfusion process. The head and bridging slips were then secured with a 22 × 40 mm coverslip, positioned with roughly 10 mm of overhang from the microscope slide, which would later allow for liquid stimulant to be delivered to the preparation when the sample was inverted. The three non-overhanging sides of the coverslip were secured with nail polish.</p><p><italic>UAS-GCaMP6s</italic> fluorescence was viewed with an inverted Zeiss 510 Meta confocal microscope. The IR60b neurons were visualized with a 20X objective, with a digital zoom of 2.5. Images were acquired such that a single 512 × 512 resolution frame was scanned each second, with single-line averaging. The pinhole was opened to 3.42 Airy Units (7.3 μm), with the 488 nm laser at 15%. Stimulus was perfused into the sample by delivering tastant solution to the overhanging portion of the coverslip, using a P20 PipetteMan. Changes in fluorescent activity were recorded for 5 m after delivery of the stimulus.</p><p>Scanned images were binned into 30 s intervals, and a maximum change in fluorescence (∆F/F) was calculated for each bin in order to generate a response curve as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. ∆F/F for each binned time interval was calculated as the maximum fluorescence change divided by the average baseline fluorescence of the 10 consecutive frames taken immediately before stimulation. Fluorescent intensities were obtained by using open-source Fiji/ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fiji.sc">https://fiji.sc</ext-link>) to draw a region-of-interest (ROI) around cell bodies, and measuring an average pixel intensity for the ROI in each frame using the Time-Series Analyzer Plugin written by Balaji, J. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/time-series.html">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/time-series.html</ext-link>).</p><p>When imaging single cell bodies, false positives can occur if the preparation shifts out of the initial plane of focus, along the z-axis, thereby causing changes in the baseline fluorescence levels during the assay. To prevent false positives, care was taken to ensure that cell bodies remained in the correct plane of focus. Before the stimulus, we selected focal landmarks in both the DIC and green fluorescent channels, and closely monitored them during the experiment. If the sample shifted, it was refocused to the reference landmarks, and the out-of-focus frames were excluded from the ∆F/F calculations. Typically, refocusing took 5–10 s, which is less than the binned 30 s time segments used in ∆F/F calculations. Thus, we recorded sufficient information to measure the maximum ∆F/F for each 30 s time interval depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–G</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>FLIC assay</title><p>The FLIC <italic>Drosophila</italic> Behavior System was from Sable Systems International (North Las Vegas, NV) and was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ro et al. (2014)</xref>. The FLIC Monitor Software (version 2.1, downloaded from wikiflic.com) was used to collect raw data from the Drosophila Feeding Monitor (DFM).</p><p>Before the assay, mated females were starved in 1000-μl pipette tips using the same protocol as for the pharyngeal pumping assay. After loading 900 mM sucrose into the DFM, the FLIC Monitor Software was initialized. Six mutant and six control flies were then quickly aspirated into the FLIC system (12 single-well setup). Typically, loading took no longer than 2 min. We analyzed the first 15 m of feeding, a period chosen to reduce the influence of post-ingestive effects that modulate hunger state and feeding behavior.</p><p>To automate the analysis of raw FLIC data, we wrote custom software in the R programming language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tam, 2017</xref>). Feeding events were detected as peaks in raw FLIC traces using the open-source numerical analysis R package ‘pracma’ (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pracma/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pracma/index.html</ext-link>). Thresholds and parameters of the software are user-customizable. To assess the accuracy of our software, we selected 10 FLIC traces randomly for manual ground-truth scoring. Our algorithm correctly identified 97.6% of the peaks with a false-positive rate of 1.8%.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Paul A Garrity (Reviewer #2); Craig Montell (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very interesting manuscript that describes a new taste neuron and associated putative molecular receptor, IR60b, with a strong specificity for sucrose in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The experiments show convincingly that this neuron/receptor combo acts to limit sucrose consumption in the flies. The neuron when activated optogenetically limits sugar consumption of a sugar that does not activate the neuron. When the neuron or receptor are inactivated then the fly consumes more than the wildtype amount of sucrose. Experiments in freely moving flies show that inactivation of the receptor (loss of function mutation) causes longer duration feeding bouts. Ca imaging experiments show that sucrose activates the neuron and that the dynamics of the activation are slow. Because the activation of neurons/receptors that promote sucrose feeding are more rapid, the authors propose a push pull model where rapidly activating neurons that convey the positive valence of sucrose for promoting feeding are gradually inhibited by the slowly activating neuron/receptor that conveys a negative valence for sucrose to limit feeding.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper is well written and clearly illustrated, and presents all necessary data without clutter by using figure supplements, although there might be some consolidation of figures. The experiments appear carefully controlled and appropriate statistical methods are used. The findings are novel and should be of wide interest to the feeding and sensory community.</p><p>1) The authors used CsChrimson to activate the Ir60b neurons. However, rather than testing the effects on sucrose consumption they used trehalose, which they justified by stating that &quot;trehalose elicits a substantial level of feeding, and whose consumption was not affected by silencing of IR60b activity.&quot; However, the effects of activation on sucrose consumption should still be presented as this is central to their paper. We strongly suggest that the authors perform this experiments, which should be rather quick given that all fly lines needed are still available.</p><p>2) Provide an explanation as to why the feeding times are so different between figures, even when using the same genotype? Examples include <italic>UAS-TNT</italic>/+ for sucrose feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and IR60b/+ for trehalose feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and 4E</xref> for IR60b/+)? If the experimental results vary considerably from day to day or with different investigators, indicate whether or not all of the data in a given panel were performed at the same time by the same person.</p><p>3) To explain the existence of such an inhibitory sugar neuron, the authors state in the Discussion that, &quot;The IR60b neuron may provide a mechanism for moderating the rate of sucrose intake and thereby helping to maintain homeostasis.&quot; Along these lines, is the effect of activating these neurons on behavior affected by the state of satiation? It should also be feasible to test whether the level of activation of these neurons (using GCaMP6s) is affected by the state of satiation. If these or similar experiments have been performed they should be reported, otherwise Discussion should be altered to include discussion of how satiation might be expected to affect the responses of the IR60b cell system.</p><p>4) In Abstract (similarly in other sections of the paper) the authors say &quot;…we identify a taste neuron that is necessary and sufficient to limit sucrose consumption in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.&quot; We understand how they arrive at sufficiency but they are over simplifying in their claim of necessity. Sucrose consumption is larger in flies where the neuron/receptor is inactivated, <italic>but</italic> sucrose consumption is nevertheless limited albeit it at a higher amount. Here and throughout the manuscript, it seems to be important to make this distinction and not convey a simplistic impression to readers, who might go for the punch line and not dig deeper. Some qualifying phrase like 'to normal wild type levels' seems in order for each claim of necessity. Moreover, the statements in the Abstract and Introduction implying the relevance these findings to human sugar consumption and obesity seem too strong. Given the dramatic differences in anatomy between the systems along with the paucity of information about how the IR60b cell system operates in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it is not compelling and perhaps best left to the Discussion. The paper is interesting enough without it.</p><p>5) The text is sometimes phrased as though IR60b = sucrose receptor (as in the Abstract: &quot;IR60b shows a high degree of chemical specificity when tested with a broad panel of tastants&quot;). It is not formally established whether IR60b directly participates in the formation of the sucrose receptor or might have some other role in the neuron that is necessary for the function of the receptor. Also, they observe two other IRs expressed in the neuron, but don't test whether these IRs are also required for sucrose detection.</p><p>6) The notion that these neurons can serve as a brake on consumption is demonstrated, but its significance is never really explored. One can imagine at least two roles of such a receptor. On the one hand, this neuron might provide a level of feeding control that responds to physiological state (becoming less active as the animal becomes sated). Another possibility is that it is not so much about controlling feeding but rather about shifting flies toward foods that have less sucrose (and perhaps are richer in monosaccharides). [In Discussion, there is a paragraph &quot;Flies encounter many sugars in their environment (Das et al. 2016). Why might it be advantageous to have a mechanism that is tuned to sucrose as opposed to other sugars? As fruits ripen, sucrose levels decline and the levels of other sugars increase in many cases (Akazawa and Okamoto 1980, Chareoansiri and Kongkachuichai 2009, Hardy 1967, Schwieterman et al. 2014). <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> prefers feeding on fruits that are at advanced stages of ripening. Perhaps a circuit that inhibits feeding on sources rich in sucrose might tend to favor feeding on food sources with low sucrose concentrations.&quot;] These are interesting issues, but are not explored experimentally. At least they could be explored more fully in Discussion; Why go for sucrose in the first place (positive valence sensory neurons)? What might be the disadvantage of feeding on sucrose rich fruit?</p><p>7) In Abstract (similarly in other sections of the paper) the authors say &quot;…we identify a taste neuron that is necessary and sufficient to limit sucrose consumption in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.&quot; We understand how they arrive at sufficiency but they are over simplifying in their claim of necessity.

Sucrose activates the IR60b neuron, and it is likely that this activation is sufficiently strong that red light does not produce a demonstrable incremental effect in the reduction of consumption. The revised manuscript explains in more detail that a more sensitive assay is provided by trehalose, which does not activate the IR60b neuron but elicits feeding (subsection “Activation of the IR60b neuron decreases feeding time”, first paragraph). In the absence of sucrose-induced activation of IR60b, the effect of optogenetic activation is easily discernible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Provide an explanation as to why the feeding times are so different between figures, even when using the same genotype?

For this reason, we were extremely careful to compare different genotypes in parallel and have indicated this by adding the following statement:</p><p>“Within each experiment, responses of different genotypes were measured in parallel, at the same time of day, by the same investigator, and within the same 3-5 day time window.”</p><p><italic>3) To explain the existence of such an inhibitory sugar neuron, the authors state in the Discussion that, &quot;The IR60b neuron may provide a mechanism for moderating the rate of sucrose intake and thereby helping to maintain homeostasis.&quot; Along these lines, is the effect of activating these neurons on behavior affected by the state of satiation?

We have not carried out these experiments, in part because in our preparation the flies are decapitated and the IR60b neurons are not in contact with the body hemolymph, but we have added a statement to the Discussion of how satiety might affect the responses of IR60b neurons (subsection “A new element in the logic of feeding control”, seventh paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) In Abstract (similarly in other sections of the paper) the authors say &quot;…we identify a taste neuron that is necessary and sufficient to limit sucrose consumption in Drosophila.&quot; We understand how they arrive at sufficiency but they are over simplifying in their claim of necessity.
