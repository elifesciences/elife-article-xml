Here, we characterize PPP1R35 as a novel bona fide centrosomal protein and demonstrate that it is critical for centriole elongation. Using quantitative super-resolution microscopy mapping and live-cell imaging we show that PPP1R35 is a resident centrosomal protein located in the proximal lumen above the cartwheel, a region of the centriole that has eluded detailed characterization. Loss of PPP1R35 function results in decreased centrosome number and shortened centrioles that lack centriolar distal and microtubule wall associated proteins required for centriole elongation. We further demonstrate that PPP1R35 acts downstream of, and forms a complex with, RTTN, a microcephaly protein required for distal centriole elongation. Altogether, our study identifies a novel step in the centriole elongation pathway centered on PPP1R35 and elucidates downstream partners of the microcephaly protein RTTN.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37846.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most animal cells contain a structure called the centrosome, which plays a vital role in helping cells to divide for producing new cells. Early in the cell division process, cells make a copy of their centrosome. Each centrosome includes two cylindrical structures called centrioles encased in a complex web of other proteins.

In somatic dividing cells, the centrosome is critical for ensuring faithful and timely chromosome segregation and establishment of the correct cell division axis, whereas in non-dividing and differentiated cells, it is critical for cellular polarization and cilia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conduit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vertii et al., 2016</xref>). Centrosomes are essential for normal human development and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nigg and Holland, 2018</xref>). Loss of function mutations in centrosomal proteins, including components of the centriolar cartwheel, elongation machinery, appendages, and pericentriolar material, are responsible for developmental defects such as primary recessive microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbelanne and Tsang, 2014</xref>), primordial dwarfism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Care4Rare Canada Consortium et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rauch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zheng et al., 2016b</xref>), and ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>). Defects in centrosome number and structure are a major hallmark of tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gönczy, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Cárcer and Malumbres, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nigg and Holland, 2018</xref>). Recently, studies in mouse models indicated that centrosome over-duplication concomitant with mutations in <italic>p53</italic> drives tumor formation in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Serçin et al., 2016</xref>) and can drive tumor formation in certain other tissues, even in the absence of concurrent <italic>p53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Levine et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is essential to characterize the critical set of proteins required for centrosome assembly to understand the molecular mechanism of disease and identify therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nigg and Holland, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Due to its important role in cell and tissue homeostasis, the centrosome is built in a highly-regulated, stepwise manner through the assembly of a multiplicity of protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conduit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mennella et al., 2014</xref>). Significant progress has been made in understanding how centrosome duplication begins in most somatic cells—at the G1/S phase boundary—with the assembly of the cartwheel, a nine-fold symmetrical scaffold made of SAS6, STIL, and CEP135. While SAS6 molecules can undergo remarkable self-assembly in vitro, the kinase Plk4 promotes cartwheel formation and centriole duplication by phosphorylating STIL to favor its interaction with SAS6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vulprecht et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lin et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dzhindzhev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arquint and Nigg, 2016</xref>). The initial binding of Plk4 to the centriole is governed by CEP63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2013</xref>), CEP152 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sonnen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dzhindzhev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hatch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cizmecioglu et al., 2010</xref>), and CEP192 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sonnen et al., 2013</xref>). After cartwheel formation, CPAP, recruited by STIL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tang et al., 2011</xref>), aids in the formation of the centriole microtubule wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pelletier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>) by regulating centriolar microtubule plus-end dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basten and Giles, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng et al., 2016a</xref>). CEP135 facilitates the stabilization of the centriole structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ohta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basten and Giles, 2013</xref>) but may also play a more direct role in initial cartwheel formation as recombinant <italic>Drosophila</italic> SAS6 and Bld10 (<italic>Drosophila</italic> CEP135 homolog) can self-organize into a nine-fold symmetrical cartwheel structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guichard et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Once the initial steps of procentriole formation occur, centriole elongation can proceed. However, we have a limited understanding of the essential components required for centriole elongation, which happens between S and G2 phases, and how they are assembled in a stepwise manner. CPAP has been shown to interact with CEP120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lin et al., 2013a</xref>) and SPICE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Comartin et al., 2013</xref>) in a complex that regulates centriole elongation at the centriolar microtubule wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Archinti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lin et al., 2013b</xref>). Centrobin has also been implicated in directly regulating centriolar microtubule elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zou et al., 2005</xref>) and stability by binding to α-Tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gudi et al., 2011</xref>) and by regulating CPAP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gudi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gudi et al., 2014</xref>). Centrobin is further required to recruit CP110, a protein forming a cap-like structure on the distal end of the centriole that suppresses centriole elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>). Proximal to CP110, several proteins localized to the distal luminal end of centrioles such as POC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azimzadeh et al., 2009</xref>), POC1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Venoux et al., 2013</xref>), and OFD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Singla et al., 2010</xref>) have been implicated in promoting the elongation of the centriole’s distal region. More recently, additional proteins have been identified, namely CEP295 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2016</xref>) and RTTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), which have been proposed to play a scaffolding role in the elongation process by connecting the centriole wall to the luminal centriolar region. However, it remains unclear if there are components in the lumen of the centriole that stabilize interactions with centriolar wall proteins.</p><p>RTTN (rotatin) was originally identified as a protein critical for axial rotation and left-right symmetry specification in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Faisst et al., 2002</xref>). Subsequently, mutations in human RTTN have been shown to cause primary microcephaly and primordial dwarfism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kheradmand Kia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grandone et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Care4Rare Canada Consortium et al., 2015</xref>). Recent reports have shed light on the cellular function of RTTN. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> RTTN homolog, Ana3, was demonstrated to be a centrosomal component critical for maintaining the structural integrity of centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stevens et al., 2009</xref>), whereas human RTTN, localized near the centriolar cartwheel, has been shown to be dispensable for initial centriole assembly, but critical for formation of a full-length centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). It remains unclear what factors are downstream of RTTN and how they promote the elongation and stabilization of the centriole once the cartwheel is formed.</p><p>Here, we characterize human PPP1R35, the product of the gene <italic>C7orf47</italic>, which was previously identified in fractions co-purifying with centrosomes in a high-throughput mass spectrometry study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jakobsen et al., 2011</xref>). Our study demonstrates that PPP1R35 is a centrosomal component located in the proximal centriolar lumen above the cartwheel. We further demonstrate that PPP1R35 is not important for early centriole assembly but is critical for centriole elongation by impacting the recruitment of the microtubule-binding elongation machinery. In addition, we show that PPP1R35 is downstream of RTTN in the elongation pathway and that they form a protein complex. Altogether, we describe a novel centriolar component essential for centriole formation and identify a new mechanistic step downstream of RTTN in the pathway to reach a fully elongated centriole and functional centrosome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PPP1R35 is stably associated with the centrosome</title><p>To examine if PPP1R35 is a bona fide centrosomal protein, we generated a U2OS cell line constitutively expressing GFP-PPP1R35 under the control of a low copy protein expression promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), integrated into the genome through the Flp-In system. GFP-PPP1R35 showed two main protein populations: one enriched in a diffraction limited spot located in the middle of the cell adjacent to the nucleus, consistent with centrosomal localization, and a cytoplasmic pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To verify that the observed PPP1R35 was located at the centrosomes, we transfected the GFP-PPP1R35 U2OS Flp-In cell line with a vector expressing Centrin 1-mCherry and observed co-localization of Centrin 1-mCherry with GFP-PPP1R35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To examine the dynamics of PPP1R35 during the cell cycle, we conducted long-term live-cell imaging by spinning disc confocal fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). PPP1R35 was found on two centrosomes (grandmother and mother) throughout the entire cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We observed some cells that have four GFP-PPP1R35 spots prior to mitosis (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) and noted that a second GFP-PPP1R35 spot was always present after mitosis, suggesting that PPP1R35 is recruited on daughter centrioles prior to mitosis. To verify that both the mother and daughter centrioles have recruited GFP-PPP1R35, we leveraged the ~1.5 x resolution increase of sub-diffraction live cell imaging. In all G2 cells examined, prior to centrosome separation, two GFP-PPP1R35 spots are resolvable on each of the centrioles (grandmother and mother), confirming that PPP1R35 resides on both the mother and daughter centrioles and must be recruited early in the duplication cycle, in S or early G2 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). To confirm that GFP-PPP1R35 localization is consistent with the endogenous protein, we imaged U2OS cells labeled with antibodies against PPP1R35 and γ-tubulin by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) and cells labeled with antibodies against PPP1R35 and CETN1 by 3D structured illumination microscopy (3DSIM), and observed co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Since the anti-PPP1R35 antibody showed high background staining we used GFP-PPP1R35 to conduct further studies. To ensure that the GFP tag did not impact the localization of the protein, we examined the morphology of the centrosome by 3DSIM and did not observe a difference between WT and GFP-PPP1R35-expressing U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Furthermore, we verified that the GFP-PPP1R35 construct did not alter centrosome biogenesis by measuring the total number of CEP152-labeled centrosomes in WT and GFP-PPP1R35-expressing U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). In addition, the GFP-PPP1R35 construct rescues the centriole duplication phenotype when PPP1R35 levels are knocked down by siRNA targeting the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR, see below Figure 3c).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37846.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PPP1R35 localizes to the centrosome.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Confocal microscopy images of live U2OS cells transfected with GFP-PPP1R35 and Centrin1-mCherry.

Comparison of the fluorescence recovery curves of the cytoplasmic versus centrosomal PPP1R35 pools revealed that centrosomal PPP1R35 did not fully recover to pre-bleach levels after photobleaching, therefore indicating that the protein has low turnover and is stably associated at the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f,g</xref>). This observation is consistent with a previous analysis that identified PPP1R35 as co-purifying with centrosomal components and observed only a 22% turnover in centrosomal PPP1R35 as measured by stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jakobsen et al., 2011</xref>). Altogether, our imaging experiments demonstrate that PPP1R35 is a resident protein of the centrosome and is recruited to the nascent daughter centriole early in the duplication cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PPP1R35 localizes to the under-characterized proximal centriolar lumen above the cartwheel</title><p>To further dissect the role of PPP1R35 at the centrosome, we used super-resolution microscopy to precisely map the position of PPP1R35 relative to several reference markers, whose position at the centrosome has been previously characterized by EM and fluorescence imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To perform these experiments, we used linear 3DSIM, a technique that provides a 2-fold resolution increase over standard confocal/widefield fluorescence microscopy, which is sufficient to resolve the relative distribution of many centrosomal proteins and allows for straightforward multicolor imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sydor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mennella et al., 2012</xref>). 3DSIM imaging showed that GFP-PPP1R35 is located in the centrosomal lumen, as suggested by the position of PPP1R35 in the middle of the ring structure formed by CEP152 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hatch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cizmecioglu et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Next, we used several proximal (SAS6, CEP135, CPAP, CEP250) and distal (CETN1, POC1B, POC5) proteins to locate the position of PPP1R35 along the centrosomal longitudinal axis. Qualitative assessment of the 3DSIM micrographs showed that the position of PPP1R35 is biased toward proximal markers such as CPAP and CEP135 more than either the utmost proximal (i.e. CEP250) or distal (i.e. CETN1) ends of the centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). To precisely map PPP1R35, we performed a quantitative analysis of the distance between PPP1R35 and many centriolar reference markers. We collected hundreds of 3DSIM images and analyzed micrographs with centriole side views where PPP1R35 was in the same z-plane of the protein of interest for measurement to avoid distortions due to anisotropic resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). 3DSIM molecular mapping shows that PPP1R35 is located furthest from the distal end proteins (Centrin-1: 230 ± 50 nm; POC5: 160 ± 50 nm; POC1B: 140 ± 60 nm), but closer to proximal end markers such as CEP135 (90 ± 40 nm) and CPAP (60 ± 30 nm), yet not as proximal as SAS6 (120 ± 40 nm) or CEP250 (170 ± 50 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).

To test this possibility, we depleted PPP1R35 protein levels in U2OS cells by targeting the mRNA with two non-overlapping siRNA strands, one designed to be complementary to an exon in the conserved C-terminal region and the second to the 3’ UTR of the PPP1R35 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>). The specificity of the siRNA strands toward PPP1R35 was validated by western blotting of cells expressing GFP-PPP1R35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We opted to deplete cells of PPP1R35 via siRNA rather than CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing since previous studies demonstrated cell lethality in the absence of PPP1R35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Neumann et al., 2010</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we performed FLAG immunoprecipitation (IP) of the N- and C-terminal tagged PPP1R35 constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Notably, RTTN was found to form a complex with the N-terminally tagged BirA*-PPP1R35. RTTN was the only protein identified with high confidence by BioID that also co-immunoprecipitated with PPP1R35, suggesting a strong link between this microcephaly protein and PPP1R35 function. Interestingly, IP-mass spectrometry data using the N-terminal FLAG-tagged PPP1R35, but not the C-terminal FLAG-tag construct, detected a high-confidence interaction with RTTN. IP with the PPP1R35 C-terminal FLAG-tag construct still identified RTTN peptide counts above that of the controls, but below our confidence level cut-off (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), indicating that the interaction between the two proteins has been severely impaired but not completely abolished.

Specifically, RTTN has been shown to localize to the proximal lumen of centrioles near CEP135 and the cartwheel (H.-Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). To further characterize the structural and functional relationship of PPP1R35 and the microcephaly protein RTTN, we mapped the position of RTTN relative to PPP1R35 by 3DSIM imaging and quantitative analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). To detect RTTN we used both an N-terminal mCherry-RTTN construct and an antibody recognizing residues 50–150 of RTTN. Our data show that RTTN localizes to the proximal centriole and it is located in close proximity to PPP1R35, consistent with our BioID findings (PPP1R35 distance from mCherry-RTTN, 80 ± 50 nm; anti-RTTN, 110 ± 50 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).</p><p>To further explore the functional relationship between PPP1R35 and RTTN, we depleted PPP1R35 from U2OS cells by siRNA and examined RTTN recruitment. The presence of RTTN at the centrosome is moderately, yet significantly, diminished upon PPP1R35 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). When the reciprocal recruitment was explored by RTTN depletion, a major reduction in centrosomal PPP1R35 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). This phenotype appears to be unrelated to the decrease in centriole number expected as a result of RTTN knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), because the number of cells with at least 2 centrin spots remains unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), yet the number of cells lacking GFP-PPP1R35 is significantly reduced. These results show that the two proteins co-localize at the centriole and that both proteins are mutually required for each other’s recruitment to the centriole, with RTTN exerting a more significant impact on PPP1R35 recruitment to the centriole. Altogether, our data suggest that RTTN and PPP1R35 form a complex and that RTTN acts upstream of PPP1R35.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conserved serine phosphorylation sites and the canonical PP1-binding site in PPP1R35 are not critical for centrosome duplication</title><p>PPP1R35 is a highly conserved protein whose homologs are found across a wide range of eukaryotic species, ranging from the simple multicellular organism <italic>Trichoplax adhaerens</italic> to <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Despite its variability across evolution, the N-terminus contains several highly conserved residues in mammalian species including three serine residues (S45, S47, S52 in <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> PPP1R35) previously found phosphorylated in large scale phospho-proteomic studies in both human and mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dephoure et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chi et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

As such, we hypothesized that these residues could be candidates for regulating PPP1R35 activity during centrosome duplication, as Cdk2 ensures that centrosome duplication takes place concomitantly with DNA synthesis in S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To probe the importance of these residues in the interaction with RTTN, we mutated all three serine residues to either non-phosphorylatable alanines (S45A, S47A, S52A) or to phospho-mimetic aspartic acids (S45D, S47D, S52D) and generated inducible HEK293 T-Rex Flp-In cell lines expressing the mutant N-terminal BirA*-PPP1R35 constructs.

Furthermore, co-IP demonstrated that neither phospho-mutant impacted the interaction between PPP1R35 and RTTN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We further evaluated the role of PPP1R35 phosphorylation on centriole duplication by examining whether the above phospho-mutants are able to rescue our centriole defect phenotype. When cells were depleted of endogenous PPP1R35 by the 3’ UTR-targeting siRNA and expressed the triple aspartic acid mutant (S45D, S47D, S52D) GFP-PPP1R35 in trans, we did not observe any reduction in centrosome number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).

Analysis of individual alanine mutants (S45A and S47A) in U2OS cells is also consistent with the notion that that despite their conservation, these resides are not playing a critical for PPP1R35’s function in centriole biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).</p><p>PPP1R35 is predicted to contain a canonical RVxF PP1-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Peti et al., 2013</xref>), encompassing residues 77–81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hendrickx et al., 2009</xref>) in the N-terminal domain.

To this effect, we used 3DSIM to measure the distance between the proximal end of centrioles labeled with acetylated tubulin to CP110, which localizes to the centriole’s distal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Acetylated tubulin has been suggested to be an early tubulin modification during centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balashova et al., 2009</xref>) and it has been previously used for conducting centriole length measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, we verified that tubulin acetylation is unaffected when PPP1R35 is knocked down by siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To ensure that we were examining mature centrioles, we focused our analysis only on mother centrioles in G2 phase cells in which a clear mother and daughter centriole were present. The length of mother centrioles was determined to be 356 ± 65 nm in control-RNAi treated cells, in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Thauvin-Robinet et al., 2014</xref>). When PPP1R35 levels are knocked down by siRNA, we see a significant reduction in centriole length to 263 ± 69 and 246 ± 83 nm for the exon and 3’ UTR siRNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). On the contrary, overexpression of PPP1R35 does not significantly change centriole length (382 ± 89 nm). Due to the small effect observed on RTTN recruitment when PPP1R35 levels are reduced, we hypothesized that the shorter centriole length may be due to the inability of nascent centrioles to recruit proteins involved in elongation. We then examined cells treated with PPP1R35 siRNA for recruitment of proteins involved in either microtubule stabilization/recruitment such as CPAP and SPICE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Archinti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Comartin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lin et al., 2013b</xref>) or the elongation of the distal portion of the centriole such as POC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azimzadeh et al., 2009</xref>) and both proteins were significantly reduced in the absence of PPP1R35. Consistently, CP110, a negative regulator of centriole elongation recruited early in the elongation pathway, was not significantly changed relative to control RNAi-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>).

In addition, we demonstrate that the ultimate downstream effect of PPP1R35 loss is shortened centrioles, suggesting that PPP1R35 directly controls the elongation pathway. It is interesting to note that this diminished centriole duplication defect takes several days to become very pronounced suggesting that either the short centrioles are still competent to duplicate but to a diminished degree, or that only low levels of PPP1R35 are needed for proper biological activity.

Furthermore, BioID, IP, and 3DSIM data show that PPP1R35 and RTTN form a protein complex and that this complex is likely a result of a direct interaction as RTTN is the only protein identified in both BioID and IP experiments.</p><p>Whereas several distal luminal proteins have been reported to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azimzadeh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Venoux et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Paoletti et al., 1996</xref>), PPP1R35 is the first to be mapped to the proximal luminal region, an uncharacterized ‘outpost’ right above the cartwheel. Since most proteins involved in centriole elongation are localized along the microtubule wall or the distal end of the centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Comartin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hatzopoulos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azimzadeh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>), the interesting distribution of PPP1R35 suggests that it likely acts directly through RTTN, which our imaging show luminal localization for the N-terminus of the protein, in close proximity to PPP1R35.</p><p>Our phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that PPP1R35 is conserved in a wide range of species, including <italic>Drosophila</italic>, parasitic worms, and mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). PPP1R35 is likely the human homolog of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein Reduction of Cnn dots 4 (Rcd4), a protein identified in a large RNAi screen aimed at discovering novel proteins impacting centrosome formation and PCM assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dobbelaere et al., 2008</xref>). Alignment of <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> PPP1R35 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rcd4 results in an overall similarity of 24%, with the greatest homology in the conserved C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In all identified PPP1R35 homologs, the N-terminus exhibits a large degree of variability, hinting at an organism-specific specialization for this domain. We probed several conserved residues in PPP1R35 including several conserved serines (S45, S47, S52), but none of these mutants appeared to drastically impact centriole biogenesis. Intriguingly, the aforementioned serines and putative PP1-binding site, which are well conserved in <italic>Chordata</italic>, are not conserved in Rcd4. Furthermore, changes to the phosphorylation state did alter the overall BioID proximity map of PPP1R35, including altering the proximity to CEP85, AZI1, and OFD1, the latter two shown to have important roles in ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ma and Jarman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wilkinson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Romio et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ferrante et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The centrosomal duplication cycle is closely linked to the cell cycle and tightly controlled by a host of kinases and phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pihan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fujita et al., 2016</xref>). While kinases inherently possess temporal and spatial specificity, protein phosphatases require a regulatory component to properly function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Heroes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Peti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Korrodi-Gregório et al., 2014</xref>). To date, only a handful of centrosomal PP1 regulatory components have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Katayama et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Meraldi and Nigg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Helps et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DeVaul et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huang et al., 2005</xref>) and overall knowledge of their interaction and role with PP1 is limited in scope. PPP1R35 is annotated to be a PP1-regulatory protein and contains a canonical PP1-binding site. Despite previous reports that demonstrated PP1-binding and inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hendrickx et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fardilha et al., 2011</xref>), we were unable to identify any PP1 isoform in our BioID or IP screens using HEK293 cycling cells. This is not completely surprising as previous studies have encountered similar difficulties in identifying interactions between protein phosphatases and their interactors, frequently due to the transient nature of binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">St-Denis et al., 2016</xref>). We tested the role of this interaction in regard to centriole duplication by mutating the canonical PP1-binding site but found that this interaction with PP1 does not appear to be critical for PPP1R35’s role at the centrosome. Overall, this suggests that despite PPP1R35’s annotation and previous demonstration as a PP1 regulator, this activity may not be related to centriole biogenesis. However, we cannot yet rule out the possibility that a second, non-canonical PP1-binding site is involved or that the PP1-regulating activity of PPP1R35 is required only in specific cellular functions not investigated here, such as ciliogenesis. Nonetheless, the large number of robust, non-centrosomal BioID hits suggests that PPP1R35 may serve other functions in the cell apart from centriole duplication and perhaps these other functions require PPP1R35’s PP1-regulation activity.</p><p>Despite the importance of centriole elongation to numerous human diseases, the exact mechanisms through which elongation takes place is still poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Loncarek and Bettencourt-Dias, 2018</xref>). To date, two major pathways governing centriole elongation have been described, one positive-growth mechanism acting on assisting microtubule elongation (CPAP/CEP120/SPICE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kohlmaier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lin et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Comartin et al., 2013</xref>) and a second negative-growth mechanism involving CP110 and CEP97, which form a cap-like structure on the centriole to restrict microtubule growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Spektor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Franz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). However, even with the discovery of additional proteins such as POC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azimzadeh et al., 2009</xref>), CEP295 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2016</xref>), and Centrobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gudi et al., 2015</xref>), all of which impact centriole elongation, we apparently have yet to acquire a complete picture of this process. Here, we have identified a novel key player of this process, PPP1R35. Our data suggest that PPP1R35 primarily impacts the CPAP/CEP120/SPICE and RTTN/CEP295 pathways of centriole elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d,e</xref>). Previously, RTTN was proposed to be critical for stabilizing the early procentriole containing STIL, CPAP, and SAS6 and for recruiting CEP295, which in turn can recruit POC5 and POC1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Our data are consistent with a model where the impact on centriole elongation occurs primarily through PPP1R35’s interaction with RTTN. Such a role is consistent with the localization of both PPP1R35 and RTTN, which are uniquely positioned just above the cartwheel in the region where elongation following initial centriole formation would occur. PPP1R35 could be involved in either modulating RTTN’s turnover or interactions with other proteins. This reasoning is supported by the observation that RTTN loss has been shown to cause lack of proper CEP295, POC1B, and POC5 recruitment and an interdependency with CPAP and CEP135 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), consistent with our observed phenotype when PPP1R35 is knocked down.</p><p>Mutations in numerous centriolar proteins have been linked to microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbelanne and Tsang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kaindl et al., 2010</xref>), including components involved in centriole elongation such as CPAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Leal et al., 2003</xref>) and RTTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Care4Rare Canada Consortium et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grandone et al., 2016</xref>). The discovery of additional microcephaly proteins will aid in our understanding of the disease and assist in the development of future therapies. Our data show that that PPP1R35 impacts the process of centriole elongation through a close relationship with a known microcephaly protein, RTTN, therefore suggesting that PPP1R35 may be one such candidate microcephaly gene. Future DNA sequencing of microcephaly patients and animal model studies are needed to address this issue.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The construct pIRES Centrin1 mCherry was a gift from Matthieu Piel (Addgene plasmid # 64338). For cloning experiments, PCR products were amplified from plasmid cDNA (PPP1R35 cDNA, MGC clone Image ID 4773899; RTTN cDNA, GE Dharmacon ORFeome cDNA 25914), verified for specificity of amplification on an agarose gel and purified using the PureLink PCR Purification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or gel-extracted (Qiagen DNA Gel Extraction Kit) when necessary. All cloning experiments were conducted using Gibson Assembly (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Site-directed mutagenesis for the single serine mutants was conducted using QuikChangeII XL Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). Gene synthesis (Invitrogen GeneArt) was used to generate mutant PPP1R35 containing the triple Ala, Asp, and V79A, F81A mutations and were subsequently cloned into the GFP-containing FRT vector via Gibson Assembly as described above.

Cells were mounted with 0.5% n-propyl gallate in 80% glycerol mounting media.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>3D structured illumination microscopy</title><p>3DSIM data were collected using an ELYRA PS.1 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) with a Plan-Apochromat 63x or 100x/1.4 Oil immersion objective lens with an additional 1.6x optovar. An Andor iXon 885 EMCCD camera was used to acquire images with 101 nm/slice z-stack intervals over a 5–10 µm thickness. The fluorophores were excited with 405, 488, 555 and 647 nm wavelengths and band-pass 420–480, 495–550, 570–620, long-pass 655 and 750 nm filters were used to collect the emission wavelengths. Laser powers at the objective focal plane of 52.6 mW in the 2–12% range, exposure time between 50–250 ms and EMCCD camera gain values between 5 and 50 were used during image acquisition. For each image field, grid excitation patterns were collected for five phases and three rotation angles (−75<sup>o</sup>; −15<sup>o</sup>, +45<sup>o</sup>). The raw data were reconstructed using the SIM module of ZEN Black Software (version 8.1) with noise filter values between −6 and −3. Channel alignment was conducted using calibrated file generated from super-resolution Tetraspec beads (Carl Zeiss Microscopy). If appropriate, whole-volume images or maximum intensity projections were exported as tiff files to be further analyzed in ImageJ/Fiji (NIH).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Protein mapping and centriole length measurements by 3DSIM</title><p>To measure the position of PPP1R35 relative to various centriolar markers, only 3DSIM images in which both the fluorescence maxima of PPP1R35 and the corresponding reference protein were on the same z-slice were analyzed. The distance between the peak maxima for the two markers were determined using the caliper function built in to the Zeiss Zen Black software (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> for an example). The centriole length measurements were conducted in an identical manner using CP110 as a distal end marker and the acetylated tubulin signal as a proximal end marker (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> for an example).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Proximity-dependent biotinylation</title><p>BioID was conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Firat-Karalar and Stearns, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>). To generate stable cell lines expressing recombinant BirA fusion proteins for BioID experiments, HEK293 Flp-In T-Rex cells were co-transfected with the pcDNA5/FRT/TO PPP1R35-FLAG-BirA* or pcDNA5/FRT/TO FLAG-BirA*-PPP1R35 plasmid and Flp Recombinase Expression plasmid pOG44 in a 1:20 ratio, and then selected for multiple passages with increasing antibiotics concentrations to reach final concentrations of 400 µg/ml Hygromycin B (Invitrogen) and 15 µg/ml Blasticidin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific). HEK293 TREX Flp-In cells expressing the appropriate transgene were cultured until 90–100% confluency and treated for 24 hr with 1 µg/ml tetracycline to induce BirA expression and 50 µM biotin to allow biotinylation of proteins. HEK293T TREX Flp-In cells transfected with a vector containing either the N- or C-terminal FLAG-BirA* but no PPP1R35, were processed in parallel as controls.</p><p>Cells were collected, pelleted, and washed three times with PBS prior to freezing. Cell pellets were processed for Bio-ID and FLAG ImmunoPrecipitation (IP) experiments as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coyaud et al., 2015</xref>). Interactor classification: bona fide interactors were defined as high confidence protein identifications (ProteinProphet p&gt;0.85) with a SAINT score ≥0.75, based on 4 independent MS runs. Histone hits were eliminated. Fold-change was calculated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coyaud et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Western blot</title><p>Total cell lysates were collected using RIPA lysis buffer (Pierce) supplemented with mammalian protease inhibitor (BioBasic; 100 mM PMSF, 1 mM Bestatin, 1.5 mM Pepstatin A, 1.4 mM E-64, 0.08 mM Aprotinin, 1 mM Leupeptin) and cell debris pelleted by spinning for 30 min at 12,000 rpm. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Protein lysate containing ~15–30 µg of total protein was loaded onto well of 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for 2 hr on an Invitrogen Bolt Minigel Apparatus at 10 V and blocked with 5% skim milk for 1 hr. Membranes were subsequently incubated with specific antibodies overnight at 4°C. Secondaries conjugated with HRP (Cell Signalling) were used at a 1:2000 dilution. Blots were developed using the ECL Chemiluminescent Substrate Kit (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)</title><p>RNA was extracted from cells using the GeneJet RNA Purification kit (Thermo Scientific) and subsequently treated with the RapidOut DNA Removal kit (Thermo Scientific). Purified RNA was quantitated and only RNA with an A260/A280 ratio greater than 1.8 was used for reverse transcription with the BioRad iScript cDNA Synthesis kit with 1 µg of RNA as the template. All quantitative PCR was performed using a CFX Connect Real-Time System (BioRad) with SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad) and 500 nM combined primer concentration per well. The relative expression of the target genes were normalized to RNA polymerase II and TATA binding protein transcript levels for each condition and then relative to expression in the scrambled siRNA-treated sample. Primer sequences can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. No-template and no-reverse transcriptase controls were run for each primer pair to confirm the lack of primer–dimer formation/DNA contamination and genomic DNA contamination, respectively. At least three biological replicates were run per condition. Data were analyzed using the CFX Maestro software (BioRad). All kits were conducted as per the manufacturer’s protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All siRNA experiments were analyzed as 2 × 2 contingency tables in which all cells for a given population (i.e. cells with &gt;1 CEP152 spots) were pooled for all replicates. To determine the p-values compared to the scrambled siRNA control for each dataset, Barnard’s Test was used in R with unpooled variances (package by Kamil Erguler; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kerguler/Barnard">https://github.com/kerguler/Barnard</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erguler, 2015</xref>). A summary of all statistics for the siRNA experiments can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>. For all other statistical tests, the Student’s T-Test was used. Error bars represent the standard deviation for all replicates. For all figures, the following conventions were used: ns (p&gt;0.05), * (p≤0.05), ** (p≤0.01), *** (p≤0.001), **** (p≤0.0001).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Phylogenetics</title><p>The NCBI protein database was queried with the search term ‘PPP1R35’ and all resultant hits were downloaded. For species with multiple annotated isoforms, the longest was selected. Any entries that were also annotated as a protein of known function (i.e. transposase, helicase, etc) were removed. Furthermore, only one organism per genus was selected to ensure broad coverage yet avoiding artifacts caused by over-sampled genera. All entries were from the <italic>Holozoa</italic> group of Eukaryotes. In order to ensure that no sequences from other major eukaryotic groups were missed, Delta Blastp searches using both the <italic>Homo sapien</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> PPP1R35 sequences were used to search for homologs in representative genera from the remaining eukaryotic groups (exact genera probed are those found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hodges et al., 2010</xref>]). No additional homologs were identified outside of the <italic>Holozoa</italic>. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using Clustal Omega (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sievers et al., 2011</xref>) with the default settings. The phylogeny was inferred using the Bayesian method implemented with MrBayes v. 3.2.6 (mixed amino acid rate mode) and run for 2.5 million generations until the standard deviation of split frequencies was 0.199. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Sds22, a PP1 regulator protein identified to have diverged early from homologous PP1 regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ceulemans et al., 2002</xref>), was used as the outgroup.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Yukiko M Yamashita as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1 and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors identified PPP1R35 as a novel regulator for centriole formation. They demonstrated that PPP1R35 is a resident centriole protein using live-cell imaging. Using 3DSIM, the authors localize PPP1R35 to an under-characterized portion of the centriole: the inner lumen, immediately distal to the cartwheel. Functional analysis with specific siRNAs against the ORF and 3' UTR revealed that PPP1R35 reduction of function led to a moderate decrease in the number of CEP152 spots and consistently defects in recruitment of components for centriole elongation such as CEP295, SPICE, CPAP and RTTN. Furthermore, BioID and co-IP experiments provided evidence for interactions of PPP1R35 with known centrosomal proteins especially with a significant hit of RTTN, a recently-characterized protein for centriole elongation. Indeed, their localization at centrioles is mutually dependent each other with RTTN having a more significant impact for the PPP1R35 centriolar localization, suggesting that RTTN may be upstream of PPP1R35. Overall, this work will significantly impact the field through the characterization of a novel centriole protein which exists in the centriolar lumen and is essential for centriole growth, two poorly understood aspects of centriole biology. Additionally, this work further details and maps the proteins within distinct regions of the centriole along the proximal-distal axis.</p><p>We would like to ask the following issues to be addressed in revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers are concerned that PPP1R35's localization is assessed only by overexpression of a GFP tagged version, leaving the possibility that this localization might not reflect endogenous one. To address this issue, the authors should (1) use antibody (if a validated one is readily (e.g. commercially) available, but we do not ask to try all possible commercially available ones); (2) if the localization study of the endogenous protein cannot be examined, then the authors should characterize centriole morphology etc. whether or not the overexpression of GFP construct does not interfere centriole/centrosome biogenesis.</p><p>2) The efficiency of siRNA knockdown is somewhat unclear (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 only shows siRNA efficiency using cells expressing GFP-tagged protein). We don't know the endogenous level, and how it compares to the expression level of GFP-tagged version. And accordingly, we don't know how much endogenous protein is depleted upon siRNA. Thus, we would like to see a bit more of validation of the phenotype and/or siRNA efficiency. One can try RT-qPCR to see the knockdown efficiency (using wild type cells + siRNA).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37846.042</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers are concerned that PPP1R35's localization is assessed only by overexpression of a GFP tagged version, leaving the possibility that this localization might not reflect endogenous one.

One antibody (ProteinTech 24214-1-AP) generated consistent results to demonstrate co-localization at the centrosome with centriolar markers despite high cytoplasmic and punctate background. To further validate that GFP-PPP1R35 localization reflects the endogenous one, we also examined centrosome morphology of WT and GFP-PPP1R35-expressing U2OS cells labeled with various centrosomal markers by 3DSIM microscopy (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1). In these experiments, we did not observe centriolar defects in the U2OS GFP-PPP1R35 expressing line. Furthermore, in the same line we did not observe defects in centrosome biogenesis relative to WT cells, when comparing the distribution of cells with 0, 1, 2 or &gt; 2 CEP152-labeled centrosomes, since nearly identical distributions of centrosome number were observed. These observations, taken together with the ability of the GFP-PPP1R35 construct to rescue PPP1R35 siRNA knock-down, strongly suggest that this construct is localizing similarly to the endogenous protein and does not impact centrosome structure or biogenesis.</p><p>To specifically address this point in the manuscript, we added new panels to Figure 1 (Figure 1D and E) and a new supplemental figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), which includes micrographs comparing WT and GFP-PPP1R35-expressing U2OS cells and a graph comparing the distribution of centrosome number in the two cell lines. Furthermore, we added the following to subsection “PPP1R35 is stably associated with the centrosome throughout the cell cycle”:</p><p>“To confirm that GFP-PPP1R35 localization is consistent with the endogenous protein, we imaged U2OS cells, stained with antibodies against PPP1R35 and γ-tubulin, by confocal microscopy (Figure 1D) and cells labeled with antibodies against PPP1R35 and CETN1 by 3D structured illumination microscopy (3DSIM), and observed proximity or co-localization (Figure 1E). […] In addition, the construct rescues the centriole duplication phenotype when PPP1R35 levels are knocked down by siRNA (see below; Figure 3C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The efficiency of siRNA knockdown is somewhat unclear (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 only shows siRNA efficiency using cells expressing GFP-tagged protein). We don't know the endogenous level, and how it compares to the expression level of GFP-tagged version. And accordingly, we don't know how much endogenous protein is depleted upon siRNA. Thus, we would like to see a bit more of validation of the phenotype and/or siRNA efficiency. One can try RT-qPCR to see the knockdown efficiency (using wild type cells + siRNA).</p></disp-quote><p>To verify the efficiency of the RNAi knockdown, we conducted RT-qPCR experiments using two sets of primers specific for <italic>c7orf47</italic> (PPP1R35). Using both primer sets, we observed a pronounced knockdown of the endogenous mRNA. We updated the text subsection “PPP1R35 is critical for centriole component recruitment” to reflect this data, which is included as a new figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). The Materials and methods section was also updated with the corresponding experimental methodology and the sequences of the primers used are now included in Supplementary file 2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
