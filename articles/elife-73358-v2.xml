inaccessible sites and then recruit non-pioneer factors (non-PFs) that activate batteries of silent genes. The PFH predicts that ectopic gene activation requires the sequential activity of qualitatively different TFs. We tested the PFH by expressing the endodermal PF FOXA1 and non-PF HNF4A in K562 lymphoblast cells. While co-expression of FOXA1 and HNF4A activated a burst of endoderm-specific gene expression, we found no evidence for a functional distinction between these two TFs. When expressed independently, both TFs bound and opened inaccessible sites, activated endodermal genes, and ‘pioneered’ for each other, although FOXA1 required fewer copies of its motif for binding. A subset of targets required both TFs, but the predominant mode of action at these targets did not conform to the sequential activity predicted by the PFH. From these results, we hypothesize an alternative to the PFH where ‘pioneer activity’ depends not on categorically different TFs but rather on the affinity of interaction between TF and DNA.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells only use a fraction of their genetic information to make the proteins they need. The rest is carefully packaged away and tightly bundled in structures called nucleosomes. This physically shields the DNA from being accessed by transcription factors – the molecular actors that can read genes and kickstart the protein production process. Effectively, the genetic sequences inside nucleosomes are being silenced.</p><p>However, during development, transcription factors must overcome this nucleosome barrier and activate silent genes to program cells. The pioneer factor hypothesis describes how this may be possible: first, ‘pioneer’ transcription factors can bind to and ‘open up’ nucleosomes to make target genes accessible. Then, non-pioneer factors can access the genetic sequence and recruit cofactors that begin copying the now-exposed genetic information.</p><p>The widely accepted theory is based on studies of two proteins – FOXA1, an archetypal pioneer factor, and HNF4A, a non-pioneer factor – but the predictions of the pioneer factor hypothesis have yet to be explicitly tested. To do so, Hansen et al. expressed FOXA1 and HNF4A, separately and together, in cells which do not usually make these proteins. They then assessed how the proteins could bind to DNA and impact gene accessibility and transcription.</p><p>The experiments demonstrate that FOXA1 and HNF4A do not necessarily follow the two-step activation predicted by the pioneer factor hypothesis. When expressed independently, both transcription factors bound and opened inaccessible sites, activated target genes, and ‘pioneered’ for each other. Similar patterns were observed across the genome. The only notable distinction between the two factors was that FOXA1, the archetypal pioneering factor, required fewer copies of its target sequence to bind DNA than HNF4A.</p><p>These findings led Hansen et al. to propose an alternative theory to the pioneer factor hypothesis which eliminates the categorical distinction between pioneer and non-pioneer factors. Overall, this work has implications for how biologists understand the way that transcription factors activate silent genes during development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human k562 cell line</kwd><kwd>pioneer factors</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>cellular reprogramming</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM092910</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Barak A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HG000045</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Barak A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>Jeffrey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pioneering activity may be a property of all transcription factors with sufficient affinity for their targets rather than a property of specific classes of transcription factors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription factors (TFs) face steric hindrance when instances of their motifs are occluded by nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kornberg, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaplan et al., 2009</xref>). This barrier prevents spurious transcription but must be overcome during development when TFs activate batteries of silent genes. The pioneer factor hypothesis (PFH) describes how TFs recognize and activate nucleosome-occluded targets. According to the PFH, categorically different TFs cooperate sequentially to activate their targets. Pioneer factors (PFs) bind to and open inaccessible sites and then recruit non-pioneer factors (non-PFs) that are responsible for recruiting additional factors to initiate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McPherson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cirillo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cirillo et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>PFs also play a primary role in cellular reprogramming by first engaging silent regulatory sites of ectopic lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iwafuchi-Doi and Zaret, 2014</xref>). Continuous overexpression of PFs and non-PFs can lead to a variety of lineage conversions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsuda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soufi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Soufi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sekiya and Suzuki, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morris et al., 2014</xref>). The conversion from embryonic fibroblasts to induced endoderm progenitors offers one clear example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sekiya and Suzuki, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morris et al., 2014</xref>). This reprogramming cocktail combines the canonical PF FOXA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cirillo et al., 2002</xref>) and non-PF HNF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karagianni et al., 2020</xref>) and is suggested to rely upon the sequential activity of FOXA1 followed by HNF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Horisawa et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The PFH makes strong predictions about the activities of ectopically expressed PFs and non-PFs. Because PFs are defined by their ability to bind nucleosome-occluded instances of their motifs, the PFH predicts that PFs should bind to a large fraction of their motifs. However, similar to other TFs, PFs only bind a limited subset of their inaccessible motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barozzi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mayran et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donaghey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manandhar et al., 2017</xref>). There are chromatin states that are prohibitive to PF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mayran et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zaret and Mango, 2016</xref>), and, in at least two cases, FOXA1 requires help from other TFs to bind at its sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donaghey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Swinstead et al., 2016</xref>). These examples suggest that PFs are not always sufficient to open inaccessible chromatin. The PFH also predicts that non-PFs should only bind at accessible sites, yet the bacterial protein LexA can pioneer inaccessible sites in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller and Widom, 2003</xref>). These observations, and the absence of direct genome-wide interrogations of the PFH, prompted us to design experiments to test major predictions made by the PFH using FOXA1 and HNF4A as a model PF and non-PF.</p><p>To test these predictions, we expressed FOXA1 and HNF4A separately and together in K562 lymphoblast cells and then measured their effects on DNA-binding, chromatin accessibility, and gene activation. In contrast to the predictions of the PFH, we found that both FOXA1 and HNF4A could independently bind to inaccessible instances of their motifs, induce chromatin accessibility, and activate endoderm-specific gene expression. The only notable distinction between the two factors was that HNF4A required more copies of its motif to bind. When expressed together, co-binding could only be explained in a minority of cases by sequential FOXA1 and HNF4A activity. Instead, most co-bound sites required concurrent co-expression of both factors, which suggests cooperativity between these TFs at certain repressive genomic locations. We suggest that our findings present an alternative to the PFH that eliminates the categorical distinction between PFs and non-PFs and instead posits that the energy required to pioneer occluded sites (‘pioneer activity’) comes from the affinity of interaction between TFs and DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of FOXA1 and HNF4A clonal lines</title><p>We tested predictions of the PFH using FOXA1 as a model endoderm PF and HNF4A as a model non-PF. Because PFs are defined by their behavior in ectopic settings, we expressed FOXA1 and HNF4A in mesoderm-derived K562 lymphoblast cells. These cells express neither FOXA1 nor HNF4A and present a different complement of chromatin and cofactors. Thus, any ectopic signature that we observe is due primarily to the TFs themselves. We focused only on the initial response to TF expression to capture primary mechanisms of TF behavior and not the secondary effects that can lead to cellular conversion and that may confound our analyses.</p><p>To perform these experiments, we created lentiviruses that inducibly express either FOXA1 or HNF4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We created cassettes in which a doxycycline-inducible promoter drives either FOXA1 or HNF4A and cloned these cassettes separately into a lentiviral vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meerbrey et al., 2011</xref>) that constitutively expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP). Although PFs are typically expressed at supraphysiological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 1987</xref>), we infected K562 cells with each vector at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 to limit the degree of nonspecific effects. We then used flow cytometry to sort single cells and selected FOXA1 and HNF4A clones that had similar GFP levels to ensure that our clones carried a similar transgene load. Finally, we performed both doxycycline titration induction and time-course experiments to identify the minimum doxycycline concentration and treatment time for robust TF activity. We observed that 0.5 µg/ml doxycycline for 24 hr was the minimal treatment condition that allowed <italic>FOXA1</italic> and <italic>HNF4A</italic>, and their respective target genes <italic>ALB</italic> and <italic>APOB</italic>, to reach a plateau of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We tested this prediction by infecting our FOXA1 clonal line with HNF4A-expressing lentivirus to generate a double expression clonal line, hereafter referred to as FOXA1-HNF4A. Upon co-induction in K562 cells, we observed strong enrichment for both liver- and intestine-specific gene activation; FOXA1-HNF4A activated 91 liver-specific genes (18 expected, p&lt;10<sup>–38</sup>, cumulative hypergeometric) and 38 intestinal genes (9 expected by chance, p&lt;10<sup>–13</sup>, cumulative hypergeometric) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The dual liver and intestine enrichment that we observed is consistent with the finding that intestinal gene regulatory networks appear during reprogramming experiments that aim to use FOXA1-HNF4A to convert embryonic fibroblasts to the liver lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morris et al., 2014</xref>). We conclude that FOXA1 and HNF4A are sufficient to activate endoderm-specific gene expression in the ectopic K562 line.</p><p>Where ectopic genes are activated in K562 cells, the PFH predicts co-binding of FOXA1 and HNF4A at inaccessible sites and induction of chromatin accessibility. Alternatively, FOXA1 and HNF4A may not be able to overcome the K562 chromatin environment and instead activate gene expression by binding exclusively to accessible K562 sites. To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured FOXA1 and HNF4A binding by CUT&amp;Tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaya-Okur et al., 2019</xref>) after induction, and chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>) both before and after doxycycline induction. At the liver-specific locus <italic>ALB</italic>, FOXA1 and HNF4A co-bound at inaccessible sites and increased accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This pattern was consistent surrounding FOXA1-HNF4A-activated liver genes: 43 of the 53 co-bound sites within 50 kb of a FOXA1-HNF4A-activated gene were inaccessible prior to induction, and the accessibility signal at these co-bound sites increased substantially upon induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>).</p><p>Although we focused on functional binding surrounding activated liver genes, these patterns were consistent across the genome. The vast majority of both FOXA1 and HNF4A binding sites fell within sites that were inaccessible prior to induction (-dox) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and both FOXA1 and HNF4A opened the majority of the inaccessible sites to which they bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results show that despite an entirely ectopic complement of chromatin and cofactors within mesoderm-derived K562 cells, the endodermal TFs FOXA1 and HNF4A can find and activate the correct genes. Most individual binding by FOXA1 and HNF4A near their co-activated genes occurred at the same sites bound in HepG2 liver cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Partridge et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Altogether we conclude that when co-expressed, FOXA1 and HNF4A conform to the predictions of the PFH and that cis-regulatory sequences are sufficient to guide their activity within an ectopic cell type.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Both FOXA1 and HNF4A individually activate many liver-specific genes</title><p>We next sought to test whether ectopic tissue-specific gene expression in K562 cells results from the sequential activity of FOXA1 and HNF4A, as predicted by the PFH. The sequential activity model predicts that HNF4A will not bind to its sites without FOXA1, and that FOXA1 will not activate expression without HNF4A, such that neither FOXA1 nor HNF4A should activate tissue-specific gene expression when expressed alone. To test this prediction, we used the single-expression K562 lines to induce either FOXA1 or HNF4A alone and measured mRNA expression by RNA-seq. FOXA1 induction resulted in strong liver-specific enrichment (p&lt;10<sup>–4</sup>, cumulative hypergeometric) and weak intestinal-specific enrichment (not significant) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), while HNF4A induction resulted in both strong liver-specific enrichment (p&lt;10<sup>–8</sup>, cumulative hypergeometric) and strong intestinal-specific enrichment (p&lt;10<sup>–15</sup>, cumulative hypergeometric) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Importantly, neither FOXA1 nor HNF4A are expressed within K562 cells nor did they induce expression of the other TF, suggesting that the expression changes we observed were due to the independent effects of either FOXA1 or HNF4A.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>FOXA1 and HNF4A activate independent liver- and intestine-specific genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The number of tissue-specific genes predicted from the hypergeometric distribution to be activated by FOXA1 compared to the number actually activated.

We first considered whether, in the absence of FOXA1, native K562 TFs were ‘pioneering’ for HNF4A. A de novo motif discovery analysis of the 500 bp centered on inaccessible FOXA1 or HNF4A binding sites revealed strong enrichment for each TF’s motif, but no other strong signals. Similarly, we found no evidence for enrichment of predicted K562 PFs AP1 (FOS/JUN; MA0099.2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biddie et al., 2011</xref>), GATA1 (MA0035.4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iwafuchi-Doi and Zaret, 2014</xref>), MYB (MA0100.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lemma et al., 2021</xref>), or SPI1 (PU.1; MA0080.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iwafuchi-Doi and Zaret, 2014</xref>) either in inaccessible binding sites over randomly chosen sites or in HNF4A over FOXA1 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, the similar activities of FOXA1 and HNF4A are not explained by pioneering activity provided by endogenous K562 TFs.</p><p>We next considered whether differences in FOXA1 and HNF4A motif content could explain our results. We focused on binding sites surrounding activated liver genes and used FOXA1 and HNF4A position weight matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) to count occurrences in the 500 bp of sequence surrounding these sites. Sites independently pioneered by FOXA1 contained between 2–4 motifs, while sites pioneered by HNF4A contained 3–6 motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). This is despite the fact that the FOXA1 motif occurs more frequently across the genome than the HNF4A motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This observation is consistent with data showing that FOXA1 has higher affinity for its binding site than HNF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernandez Garcia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rufibach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 1997</xref>) and suggests that there may not be anything categorically different about FOXA1 and HNF4A, but rather that ‘pioneer activity’ may depend on the affinity of interaction between TF and DNA.</p><p>Another possible explanation for our results could be that at the concentrations TFs are expressed in cellular reprogramming, the differences between PFs and non-PFs are no longer apparent. We took advantage of our doxycycline-inducible system to test this hypothesis by lowering the doxycycline concentration from 0.5 µg/ml to 0.05 µg/ml, thus dropping the TF concentration significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then remeasured binding and expression. We found that lower induction resulted in far fewer FOXA1 and HNF4A genome-wide binding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). This effect was even more pronounced when we subset the binding events into sites that were either accessible or inaccessible prior to induction. Both FOXA1 and HNF4A shifted from binding predominantly inaccessible sites to binding predominantly accessible sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, binding of both factors depends on a balance of TF concentration and accessibility state, and the results from expression profiling in the lower induction regime are consistent with this idea. Whereas FOXA1 and HNF4A previously activated 33 and 47 liver genes, at the lower induction rate they activated 8 and 30, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, lowering the induction levels had strong effects on the activities of both FOXA1 and HNF4A, but did not reveal qualitative differences between the two TFs. These results suggest that the induction conditions in cellular reprogramming do not mask differences between the TFs, a result consistent with the fact that the PFH was developed to explain the properties of cellular reprogramming cocktails.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Some liver genes require cooperative FOXA1-HNF4A activity</title><p>In addition to those genes independently activated by FOXA1 and HNF4A, there is an additional set of 31 liver genes that are not activated until both FOXA1 and HNF4A are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We therefore asked whether these 31 liver genes are activated sequentially, as predicted by the PFH. If these genes conform to the PFH, then we would expect that at every gene there are nearby sites where FOXA1 binds individually and where FOXA1 and HNF4A co-bind when expressed together. This would be evidence for FOXA1 ‘pioneering’ sites for later HNF4A binding and so we have called these sites ‘FOXA1 pioneered’ (FP).

Some endodermal genes require the joint activity of both TFs, but the predominant mode of action at these targets does not conform to the predicted sequential activity of FOXA1 followed by HNF4A. These observations suggest that we do not need to invoke the PFH to explain FOXA1 and HNF4A’s behavior in ectopic K562 cells and that instead we may use the affinity of interaction between each TF and its target sites to explain its behavior.</p><p>An affinity model assumes that there is nothing categorically different between FOXA1 and HNF4A. We hypothesize that differences still exist between TFs’ abilities to bind at nucleosome-occluded sites but that ‘pioneer activity’ is a spectrum not a binary classifier. The probability of a binding event depends on the intrinsic binding ability of the TF and the motif count at a potential binding site. Previous measures of intrinsic binding strength that show FOXA1 binds more tightly than HNF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernandez Garcia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rufibach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 1997</xref>) may explain why in our assays FOXA1 requires fewer copies of its motif to bind. In fact, FOXA1 has a three-dimensional, histone-like structure that may explain its superior binding strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>However, given the right sequence context, HNF4A also displays pioneer activity. We hypothesize that HNF4A was misclassified because of both developmental timing and indirect assays of pioneer activity. FOXA1 precedes HNF4A during hepatic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lau et al., 2018</xref>) and studies have traditionally established PF status by using endogenous binding or genome-wide chromatin marks. Perhaps sequential activity of FOXA1 and HNF4A is necessary during hepatic development, but our data show that both TFs are sufficient to independently activate silent genes.</p><p>We further hypothesize that our findings may extend to other reprogramming cocktails that combine PFs and non-PFs. While our study is limited to two TFs at two concentrations in one cell line, other data support our hypothesis. Early reprogramming of fibroblasts to myoblasts relied solely upon the ectopic overexpression of MyoD, without an accompanying non-PF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 1990</xref>) and new reprogramming cocktails have been tested and validated in a large-scale screen for single, cell-autonomous reprogramming TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ng et al., 2021</xref>). Increasing the efficiency of reprogramming cocktails that depend on multiple TFs will require distinguishing between the independent and cooperative effects of TFs. For example, our finding that HNF4A independently activates more intestine-specific genes than FOXA1 raises the possibility that titrating down HNF4A activity during reprogramming could result in a more liver-specific profile. Such fine-tuning of TF activities has been suggested as an option to improve the success of other reprogramming cocktails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vaseghi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although we found clear instances of sites independently pioneered by either FOXA1 or HNF4A, not all sites containing multiple motifs were pioneered in K562 cells, which comports with studies showing that the sequence context in which motifs occur also plays an important role in determining whether sites will be pioneered or not. GAL4’s ability to bind nucleosomal DNA templates depends both on the number of copies of its motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taylor et al., 1991</xref>) and the positioning of the motif in the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vettese-Dadey et al., 1994</xref>).

A TF’s motif affinity, motif count, and the presence of cofactor motifs are all strong predictors of pioneer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manandhar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donaghey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyes and Felsenfeld, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Minderjahn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meers et al., 2019</xref>) and certain types of heterochromatic patterning have been labeled ‘pioneer resistant’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mayran et al., 2018</xref>).

Because co-binding occurred less frequently, we attributed co-binding sites to genes if they were within 100 kb of the gene’s TSS. ‘FOXA1 pioneered’ sites were those where we identified overlapping FOXA1 and HNF4A binding peaks within 100 kb of a gene that was only activated by FOXA1 and HNF4A and where there was also an overlapping FOXA1 binding peak, when FOXA1 was expressed alone. ‘HNF4A pioneered’ sites were those where we identified overlapping FOXA1 and HNF4A binding peaks within 100 kb of a gene that was only activated by FOXA1 and HNF4A and where was also an overlapping HNF4A binding peak, when HNF4A was expressed alone.

factor model is not sufficient to explain most of the gene activation when liver transcription factors (TFs) are ectopically expressed. These results provide a new standard for testing the degree to which a TF acts as a pioneer factor. Moreover, they suggest that cis elements (i.e., motif density) are critical to open a locus upon transcription factor expression. How motif density and TF binding contribute to nucleosome eviction will be interesting to unravel in future studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73358.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Churchman</surname><given-names>L Stirling</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03vek6s52</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.08.17.456650">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.17.456650v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Tone down and clarify conclusions. See reviewer comments below for details. In particular, the title is misleading and should be edited to reflect the more narrow scope of the manuscript. Also, the limitations of the experimental system should be made clear. Finally, there should be more of an attempt to reconcile their findings with prior studies.</p><p>2) Various data analyses to address reviewer comments, specifically address the following ones:</p><p>A) Are the sites that are independently activated by FOXA1 or HNF4A bound by other TFs as well? Specifically, is it the case that FOXA1 and HNF4A are acting like solo pioneering factors at these sites, or are FOXA1 and HNF4A similarly &quot;cooperatively co-bound&quot; at these sites with TFs that are endogenously expressed in K562 cells but on their own do not open up these elements?</p><p>B) A more thorough analysis could substantially strengthen the manuscript. Most features in this manuscript are classified in a Boolean OFF/ON manner, which creates clean analysis, but limits the scope of interpretations. By oversimplifying the assumptions, this limits the ability to explain the results in the context of sequence affinity. Do Foxa1 and Hnf4a bind with equal amounts to co-bound accessible sites? Does their binding enrichment (characterized by CUT&amp;Run) correlate with differential pre- and post- induction ATAC-seq enrichment? It is mentioned in the discussion that &quot;not all sites containing multiple motifs were pioneered in K652 cells&quot; and suggests many possible explanations such as (1) TF affinity to its motif, (2) sequence context, (3) motif orientation relative to the nucleosome. However, aside from running FIMO to scan for motif instances, there is limited follow-up analysis. At the very least, FIMO could be used to quantitatively score motif matches in the genome in order to explore the role of sequence affinity.</p><p>3) Determine how TF concentration impacts the results. The TF concentration very likely determines the degree by which chromatin is made accessible. Since the authors have the perfect experimental system to address this question, it would be straightforward to determine whether changing TF concentration influences the ability of Hnf4a to open chromatin comparably to Foxa1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Please provide data on the level of expression of FOXA1 and HNF4A relative to their physiological expression levels in human tissue/cell lines.</p><p>The presentation of Supplementary Figure 2 and 3 is confusing. Is Supplementary Figure 3a stating that there are ~35,000 FoxA1 CUT&amp;Tag peaks in uninduced cells? Or is this showing the ATAC-seq chromatin accessibility in uninduced cells for FoxA1 CUT&amp;Tag peaks that were identified in induced cells?</p><p>Page 6, line 137. The line &quot;The vast majority of both FoxA1 and Hnf4a binding sites fell within inaccessible regions…&quot; is confusing, as it implies that the FoxA1 and Hnf4a CUT&amp;Tag peaks were outside of ATAC-seq peaks in the same sample. I am assuming that you meant to say that the &quot;The vast majority of both FoxA1 and Hnf4a binding sites in the induced sample matched inaccessible regions in the uninduced sample…&quot;</p><p>Please provide quality summary statistics for ATAC-seq and CUT&amp;Tag data. Were these samples sequenced to a similar degree? Do the ATAC-seq samples have a similar proportion of reads surrounding TSSs, or within peaks? Were a similar number of peaks called in each ATAC-seq sample?</p><p>Pg 12, line 235. &quot;cooperative&quot; is a better word than &quot;collaborative&quot; to describe this phenomenon. Similarly, the term &quot;collaboratively co-bound&quot; is better represented using the term &quot;cooperatively co-bound&quot;. Note that the term cooperative does not necessitate direct protein-protein interactions between TFs, but can rather merely reflect their cooperative ability to stabilize a nucleosome free stretch of DNA (PMID 21149679).</p><p>Please provide further description on how you define the list of organ-specific genes?</p><p>Per convention, please use uppercase protein names as K562 is a human cell line.</p><p>Are the sites that are independently activated by FOXA1 or HNF4A bound by other TFs as well?

They find that Hnf4a, which was classified previously as non-pioneer, is able to open chromatin in their assay. Furthermore, they do not sufficiently explore the similarities and differences between the binding behavior of Foxa1 and Hnf4a to provide more insights. As it is, they do not refute the pioneer factor hypothesis and thus the title is misleading. There are several main points that would strengthen the manuscript:</p><p>1) If Hnf4a is also able to open chromatin, why has it previously been categorized as a non-pioneer? Is it because of its role as &quot;differentiation TF&quot;, thus a TF that is expressed relatively late in development? Or are there physical properties of the TF that make it a non-pioneer? Some of the cited papers actually describe Hnf1a whose behavior is quite similar to pioneer TFs. Without exploring this, the simplest explanation for the observed results is that Hnf4a has previously been misclassified.</p><p>2) A more thorough analysis could substantially strengthen the manuscript. Most features in this manuscript are classified in a Boolean OFF/ON manner, which creates clean analysis, but limits the scope of interpretations. By oversimplifying the assumptions, this limits the ability to explain the results in the context of sequence affinity. Do Foxa1 and Hnf4a bind with equal amounts to co-bound accessible sites?

At the very least, FIMO could be used to quantitatively score motif matches in the genome in order to explore the role of sequence affinity.</p><p>3) What is the effect of TF concentration? I understand the rationale of the experimental design to express Foxa1 and Hnf4a at similar levels in order to test their ability to open chromatin at the same concentration. However, the TF concentration very likely determines the degree by which chromatin is made accessible. Since the authors have the perfect experimental system to address this question, there is a missed opportunity to explore whether changing TF concentration influences the ability of Hnf4a to open chromatin comparably to Foxa1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73358.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Tone down and clarify conclusions.

We show that the total motif count distinguishes between binding sites and random DNA, between inaccessible binding sites and accessible binding sites, and between sites “pioneered” or “cooperatively bound” sites.

The lower induction conditions reduce binding and liver gene activation for both FOXA1 and HNF4A, but does not qualitatively alter the results: the effects are still the same for both FOXA1 and HNF4A (lines 214-231 and Figure 3—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Please provide data on the level of expression of FOXA1 and HNF4A relative to their physiological expression levels in human tissue/cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>It is unclear what expression levels of FOXA1 and HNF4A are physiological, as their levels in HepG2 or even primary fibroblasts are not physiological. It was partly for this reason that we chose to study the PFH in the context of cellular reprogramming (where it was first conceived) and why we followed protocols used during reprogramming assays. Our concentrations may be higher than during development, but they are the same as the levels used in cellular reprogramming protocols. To address the concern that our results might be an artifact of overexpression, we lowered the induction conditions 10-fold and re-measured binding and ectopic expression for both FOXA1 and HNF4A. As discussed above, the lower induction conditions reduce binding and liver gene activation for both FOXA1 and HNF4A, but does not qualitatively alter the results: the effects are still the same for both FOXA1 and HNF4A. We also have taken careful steps to limit the degree of over-expression and to express FOXA1 and HNF4A at similar levels (line 109 and Figure 1-figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The presentation of Supplementary Figure 2 and 3 is confusing.
