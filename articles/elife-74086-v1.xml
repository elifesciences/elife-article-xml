cooperation and cultural learning, involve eye-gaze signaling through joint attentional interaction and ostensive communication. The gaze-signaling and related cooperative-eye hypotheses posit that humans evolved unique external eye morphologies, including uniformly white sclera (the whites of the eye), to enhance the visibility of eye-gaze for conspecifics. However, experimental evidence is still lacking. This study tested the ability of human and chimpanzee participants to discriminate the eye-gaze directions of human and chimpanzee images in computerized tasks. We varied the level of brightness and size in the stimulus images to examine the robustness of the eye-gaze directional signal against simulated shading and distancing. We found that both humans and chimpanzees discriminated eye-gaze directions of humans better than those of chimpanzees, particularly in visually challenging conditions. Also, participants of both species discriminated the eye-gaze directions of chimpanzees better when the contrast polarity of the chimpanzee eye was reversed compared to when it was normal; namely, when the chimpanzee eye has human-like white sclera and a darker iris. Uniform whiteness in the sclera thus facilitates the visibility of eye-gaze direction even across species. Our findings thus support but also critically update the central premises of the gaze-signaling hypothesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>From an early age, we are able to detect the direction others are looking in (known as eye-gaze) and make eye contact with each other to communicate.

Some researchers believe that the white sclera of the human eye may have evolved to make it easier for other individuals to detect the direction of our gaze. However, there is a lack of experimental evidence as to whether white sclerae actually helps humans to distinguish the direction of eye-gaze.</p><p>Here, Kano, Kawaguchi and Yeow presented human and chimpanzee participants with images of other humans and chimpanzees on a computer screen and asked them to indicate the direction of eye-gaze in each image.

This is likely because humans use eye-gaze in key social activities (including learning languages, coordinating to complete complex tasks and transmitting cultural information), indicating that white sclerae may have evolved to enhance human-specific communication. To learn more about this type of communication, future research could focus on finding out when white sclerae first evolved.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>eye color</kwd><kwd>eye-gaze</kwd><kwd>comparative study</kwd><kwd>communication</kwd><kwd>cooperation</kwd><kwd>joint attention</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Chimpanzee</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H01772</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kano</surname><given-names>Fumihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20H05000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kano</surname><given-names>Fumihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18J20077</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawaguchi</surname><given-names>Yuri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experiments showed that uniformly white sclera, one distinguishing feature of human eyes, facilitates gaze perception across species, suggesting that this eye feature evolved for conspecific communication in humans.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In humans, eye-gaze is employed in critical ways for conspecific communication during social activities such as cooperation, teaching, and language learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Csibra and Gergely, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tomasello et al., 2005</xref>). Humans excel at detecting another’s direct gaze and following another’s gaze directions from early infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farroni et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farroni et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, during social interactions, humans exchange communicative intentions with one another via eye contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Senju and Johnson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kleinke, 1986</xref>), and an experience of being watched by another affects one’s reputational concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bateson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelmann et al., 2012</xref>). Comparative studies have found that closely related species such as nonhuman great apes also excel at detecting another’s direct gaze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Myowa-Yamakoshi et al., 2003</xref>) and following another’s gaze directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bräuer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okamoto et al., 2002</xref>), and adjust their gaze-following behaviors flexibly and cognitively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kano and Call, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okamoto-Barth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Povinelli and Eddy, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tomasello et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, they make eye contact with other individuals at critical moments of social interactions, such as when requesting food from an experimenter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomez, 1996</xref>) and initiating affiliative social interactions with conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heesen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamagiwa, 1992</xref>). However, several potential differences might exist between humans and nonhuman apes in their use and interpretation of gaze behaviors. For example, in the gaze-following/cueing experiments, while humans primarily relied on another’s eye-directional cues, nonhuman apes relied on head-directional rather than eye-directional cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomasello et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tomonaga, 2007</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Povinelli and Eddy, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deaner and Platt, 2003</xref>). In general, reliance on eye-directional rather than head-directional cues indicates one’s inclination/ability to identify a specific spot that another’s foveae are directing at, rather than a large area that another’s field of view covers. Thus, the former strategy leads to efficient identification of the interaction partners’ focused objects during joint attentional interaction and ostensive communication. Relatedly, a previous study observed that, while both human infants and nonhuman apes alternately looked at both the interaction partner’s face and the focused object during joint-attentional interactions, nonhuman apes made only brief looks to the interaction partner’s face while human infants made more long-lasting looks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carpenter and Tomasello, 1995</xref>). Furthermore, in a communicative gaze-following task, while human infants responded to an agent’s eye contact as if they interpreted it as an ostensive signal preceding referential information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Senju and Csibra, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Okumura et al., 2020</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gredebäck et al., 2018</xref>), great apes did not show any evidence supporting this understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kano et al., 2018</xref>). These potential differences between human and nonhuman apes might be partly related to differences in their sociocognitive skills but also humans’ specialization to eye-gaze signals in conspecific communication.</p><p>Relatedly, one influential hypothesis, the gaze-signaling hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobayashi and Kohshima, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kobayashi and Kohshima, 1997</xref>), proposes that humans have evolved special morphological features in the eye, including uniform whiteness in the exposed sclera, to enhance the visibility of eye-gaze directions and thereby help conspecifics communicate via eye-gaze without much attentional effort. This hypothesis is based on comparative analyses showing that (1) uniformly white sclera is a unique feature of the human eye among primates and that (2) the human eye is horizontally more elongated, and the human sclera is horizontally more exposed compared to other primates’ eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobayashi and Kohshima, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kobayashi and Kohshima, 1997</xref>). The cooperative-eye hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomasello et al., 2007</xref>) extended this gaze-signaling hypothesis based on the results from their gaze-following study, proposing that humans evolved these morphological features as well as a special sensitivity to these features to facilitate joint-attentional and communicative interactions in a cooperative context. Others discussed that humans’ white sclera not only signals gaze direction but also emotional cues in combination with fine musculatures around the eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Whalen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baron-Cohen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jessen and Grossmann, 2014</xref>), and also emotional and health-status cues by its color variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Provine et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Provine et al., 2013b</xref>). Moreover, typically developing human adults and children show basic preferences for an animal agent having white sclera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Segal et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Despite the widespread popularity of the gaze-signaling and related cooperative-eye hypotheses in the literature, these hypotheses have been severely challenged by recent quantitative morphological studies showing that certain eye features of humans are not necessarily unique among great ape species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mayhew and Gómez, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perea-García et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caspar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mearing and Koops, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2021</xref>). Accordingly, there is currently a heated debate over whether the external eye morphology of humans has any communicative function. Specifically, those studies have shown that (1) the sclera of humans is not necessarily more exposed than that of other great ape species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mayhew and Gómez, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caspar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2021</xref>), that (2) the color contrast/difference between the iris and the sclera is similar between humans and other great apes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perea-García et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caspar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mearing and Koops, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2021</xref>), and that (3) there is substantial individual variation in the extent to which sclera is unpigmented among some nonhuman ape species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mayhew and Gómez, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caspar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mearing and Koops, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perea García, 2016</xref>). Given these new findings, one recent study suggested that one (and possibly only) eye feature that both distinguishes humans from other great apes and contributes to the visibility of eye-gaze direction is <italic>uniform</italic> whiteness in humans’ exposed sclera; i.e., depigmentation all the way from the iris edge to the eye corners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2021</xref>). This previous study used image analysis and computer vision techniques and identified that uniformly white sclera characterizes clear visibilities of both iris and eye-outline edges – the two essential features that contribute to the visibility of eye-gaze directions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1</xref> for the illustration of this aspect). More specifically, while the iris is highly visible in all great ape species, the visibility of eye-outline edges is limited in nonhuman apes because most nonhuman ape individuals have darker or more graded/patchy sclera colors compared to humans’ sclera colors, which more easily blend into the adjacent skin/hair colors. On the other hand, nearly all human individuals have uniformly white sclera, which is clearly distinguished from the adjacent skin/hair colors around the eyes (irrespective of the skin color variations) even when the eyes are viewed in visually challenging conditions (e.g., shading, distancing). However, experimental evidence is lacking to support these findings.</p><p>Previously, several experimental studies demonstrated that humans’ white sclera facilitates gaze perception at least in human participants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ricciardelli et al., 2000</xref> tested human participants in a gaze-discrimination task and found that reversing the contrast polarity of human eye images makes the judgment of gaze direction less accurate. Specifically, the gaze directions were more accurately judged in eyes having a positive (normal) contrast polarity (white sclera with a darker iris) than those having a negative (reversed) contrast polarity (black sclera with a bright iris), even though these two eye images were composed of the same colors. Ricciardelli et al. thus suggested that humans have perceptual expertise in positive contrast polarity of eyes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Itier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoshizaki and Kato, 2011</xref> for related results). Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yorzinski and Miller, 2020</xref> tested human participants in a gaze-discrimination task in which the sclera colors of human faces were manipulated to be either conspicuous (white or lighter than the iris color) or inconspicuous (similar or darker than the iris color); human participants detected the faces with conspicuous sclera colors faster and more accurately. Yorzinski and Miller thus suggested that humans’ white sclera facilitates their gaze perception. Importantly, although these two studies found similar results, it remains unclear whether humans’ white sclera facilitates their gaze perception by its perceptual properties per se or by human participants’ perceptual expertise in the positive contrast polarity of human eyes. To answer this question, a comparative approach is helpful.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tomonaga and Imura, 2010</xref> tested whether a chimpanzee could be trained to discriminate eye-gaze directions of human facial images, and in one of their experimental conditions, they replicated the results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ricciardelli et al., 2000</xref>. Specifically, they showed that the chimpanzee’s task performance dropped when the contrast polarity of the eyes was reversed in the stimulus human faces. Unfortunately, however, the conclusion from this result is severely limited because the chimpanzee was trained to discriminate the gaze directions of the human positive eyes (positive contrast polarity) before being tested in the trials presenting the human negative eyes (reversed contrast polarity). Therefore, it remains unclear whether the chimpanzee’s performance was affected by the change in the eye contrast polarity or merely the change in the trained color pattern. Critically, no previous study adopted a fully crossed design for species comparison to examine the effect of sclera colors on primate gaze perception; namely, a study design that presents the stimuli of both species to the participants of both species. Chimpanzees are a suitable species for this design because their eyes have relatively uniformly dark sclera and a bright iris, namely, having a negative contrast polarity opposite to the positive contrast polarity that human eyes have. Therefore, in a fully crossed design with chimpanzees and humans, one can test whether the uniformly white sclera of human positive (normal) eyes and chimpanzee positive (reversed) eyes facilitates the gaze-discrimination performances of both chimpanzee and human participants. Such a question would clarify whether the uniformly white sclera has a perceptual advantage independently from perceptual advantages of other eye features or the participants’ perceptual expertise in a certain eye contrast polarity (as we will detail below).</p><p>Consequently, this study tested both humans and chimpanzees on their ability to discriminate the gaze direction of both chimpanzee and human faces with the eyes manipulated to have both normal and reversed contrast polarities. The contrast polarity of both species’ eyes (only the eyeball regions) was reversed by inverting the lightness (or grayscale) values of the eyeball images in the faces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig3">Appendix 3—figure 3</xref>). This manipulation created artificial white sclera in chimpanzee eyes and artificial dark sclera in human eyes, while not affecting the iris-sclera (or pupil-iris) color differences in each species’ eyes. The task for human and chimpanzee participants was to discriminate the gaze direction of human and chimpanzee eye images on a computer monitor (either in a keypress or visual search task; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Our experimental procedures followed a previous study adopting training procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tomonaga and Imura, 2010</xref>) instead of spontaneous gaze-following/cueing procedures for chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomasello et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tomonaga, 2007</xref>) because, while the former study successfully trained a chimpanzee to discriminate eye-gaze directions of a stimulus (human) face, the latter studies reported that chimpanzees predominantly rely on head-directional cues but not eye-gaze directional cues in the spontaneous tasks. Also, as the strength of the visual signal generally depends on its degradation caused by natural noises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Endler, 1990</xref>), we tested the robustness of eye-gaze signals against shading and distancing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), namely the simulated visual conditions where stimulus eyes were presented darker (in shadows) and smaller (in the distance), following a previous study on great ape eye color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental stimuli and procedures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental stimuli used in this study.

H2 posits the perceptual advantage of the iris-sclera color difference. As the iris-sclera color difference (note the difference between the contrast and difference measures employed by previous studies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perea-García et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caspar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mearing and Koops, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2021</xref>) was similar between chimpanzees and humans in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2021</xref>) and did not differ between our chimpanzee and human stimuli with both positive and negative eyes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig2">Appendix 3—figure 2</xref> for the quantitative evaluation of our stimuli), we predicted no performance difference between the stimulus types in participants of both species. H3 posits the perceptual advantage of the horizontally elongated shape. As human eyes were horizontally longer than chimpanzee eyes in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mayhew and Gómez, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caspar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2021</xref>) and also in our stimulus set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig2">Appendix 3—figure 2</xref>), we predicted increased performance for the human stimuli (with both positive and negative eyes) in participants of both species. H4 posits the participants’ perceptual expertise in the contrast polarity of own-species eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ricciardelli et al., 2000</xref>) and thus predicted increased performance for the positive eyes of both species in human participants and the negative eyes of both species in chimpanzee participants. H5 addressed a general possibility arising from our manipulation of both species’ eye colors, namely, that participants of both species perform more poorly in such artificial conditions, and thus predicted increased performance for the human positive eyes and the chimpanzee negative eyes in participants of both species. Related to this last hypothesis, our chimpanzee participants had extensive experiences in interacting with both conspecifics and humans from youth and thus were familiar with both species’ eyes. We also ensured that our human participants had a minimum of a few months (to decades) of experiences in interacting with chimpanzees and thus were familiar with both species’ eyes.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Hypotheses predicting the effect of eye color and shape on the visibility of eye-gaze in chimpanzee and human participants.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Hypothesis</th><th align="left" valign="top">Assumption</th><th align="left" valign="top">Participant</th><th align="left" colspan="2" valign="top">Eyes with normal contrast polarity</th><th align="left" colspan="2" valign="top">Eyes with reversed contrast polarity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>Human eye</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>Chimpanzee eye</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>Human eye</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>Chimpanzee eye</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top">H1</td><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top">Perceptual advantage of uniformly white sclera</td><td align="left" valign="top">Humans</td><td align="char" char="plus" valign="top"><bold>+</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">–</td><td align="left" valign="top">–</td><td align="char" char="plus" valign="top"><bold>+</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chimpanzees</td><td align="char" char="plus" valign="top"><bold>+</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">–</td><td align="left" valign="top">–</td><td align="char" char="plus" valign="top"><bold>+</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top">H2</td><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top">Perceptual advantage of the iris-sclera color difference</td><td align="left" valign="top">Humans</td><td align="left" valign="top">~</td><td align="left" valign="top">~</td><td align="left" valign="top">~</td><td align="left" valign="top">~</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chimpanzees</td><td align="left" valign="top">~</td><td align="left" valign="top">~</td><td align="left" valign="top">~</td><td align="left" valign="top">~</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top">H3</td><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top">Perceptual advantage of the horizontally elongated eye shape</td><td align="left" valign="top">Humans</td><td align="char" char="plus" valign="top"><bold>+</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">–</td><td align="char" char="plus" valign="top"><bold>+</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">–</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chimpanzees</td><td align="char" char="plus" valign="top"><bold>+</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">–</td><td align="char" char="plus" valign="top"><bold>+</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">–</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top">H4</td><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top">Perceptual expertise in the contrast polarity of own-species eyes</td><td align="left" valign="top">Humans</td><td align="char" char="plus" valign="top"><bold>+</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">–</td><td align="left" valign="top">–</td><td align="char" char="plus" valign="top"><bold>+</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chimpanzees</td><td align="left" valign="top">–</td><td align="char" char="plus" valign="top"><bold>+</bold><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn1">*</xref></td><td align="char" char="plus" valign="top"><bold>+</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">–</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top">H5</td><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top">Perceptual expertise in the normal contrast polarity of eyes</td><td align="left" valign="top">Humans</td><td align="char" char="plus" valign="top"><bold>+</bold></td><td align="char" char="plus" valign="top"><bold>+</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">–</td><td align="left" valign="top">–</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chimpanzees</td><td align="char" char="plus" valign="top"><bold>+</bold></td><td align="char" char="plus" valign="top"><bold>+</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">–</td><td align="left" valign="top">–</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table1fn1"><label>*</label><p>+ denotes a higher performance than –, and ~ denotes a similar performance in within-species (row-wise) comparisons.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In Study 1, we tested 25 adult human participants (14 females, 11 males) in two experiments. Experiment 1 presented participants with the stimuli of both humans and chimpanzees with normal contrast polarity at four stimulus levels (L1–4) varying in size and brightness. We tested the effect of stimulus level and species on participants’ correct responses (correct, incorrect) in a binomial generalized linear mixed model (GLMM; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref> for the formulas) and found that human participants performed better in trials presenting the human stimuli than those presenting the chimpanzee stimuli (χ<sup>2</sup> = 37.08, df = 1, p&lt;10<sup>–8</sup>). We also found that their performance was worse in trials presenting smaller and more shaded stimuli (χ<sup>2</sup> = 45.85, df = 3, p&lt;10<sup>–9</sup>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref> for the full GLMM results; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Experiment 2 presented the same participants with the stimuli of both species with both normal and reversed contrast polarities at stimulus levels L3 and L4.

Only three (Natsuki, Hatsuka, Pendesa) passed all the required training and subsequently participated in test phases (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref> for details about participants; also see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app4table1">Appendix 4—table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for the number and performance of training sessions for each chimpanzee). Study 2 involved two experiments. Experiment 1 tested those three chimpanzees and presented them with the human and chimpanzee eye images with normal contrast polarity. To test chimpanzees at stimulus levels higher than L1 (i.e., smaller and more shaded), we gradually incremented the stimulus level (by 0.5) across sessions when individuals showed high performance in target trials presenting a given stimulus level (above 85% in two successive sessions). The test phase was defined as the sessions presenting stimulus level higher than (or equal to) L2.5, given that we observed clear performance differences between stimulus species at stimulus levels higher than L2 in Study 1 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app4table3">Appendix 4—table 3</xref> for the number of sessions in the pre-test and test phases). We tested chimpanzees’ correct responses during the test phase across repeated sessions at the individual level (with the <italic>α</italic> level corrected for the number of individuals in the Bonferroni correction, <italic>α</italic> = 0.05/3). Each chimpanzee completed a minimum of 20 test sessions. To avoid the ceiling effect, we incremented the stimulus level also during the test phase when chimpanzees showed high performance in target trials based on the same criteria. We tested the effect of stimulus species in binomial GLMM on each chimpanzee’s correct responses (correct, incorrect) during the test phase and found that all three chimpanzees performed significantly better for the human stimuli than the chimpanzee stimuli (Natsuki: χ<sup>2</sup> = 8.28, df = 1, p=0.004; Hatsuka: χ<sup>2</sup> = 9.50, df = 1, p=0.002; Pendesa: χ<sup>2</sup> = 21.94, df = 1, p&lt;10<sup>–5</sup>; also see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>).</p><p>Experiment 2 tested two (Natsuki and Hatsuka) out of the three chimpanzees. Pendesa was dropped from this experiment because she took about twice as many training sessions as the other two chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app4table2">Appendix 4—table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Experiment 2 presented them with eye stimuli having reversed contrast polarity in the first test phase (Test B) and then eye stimuli having normal contrast polarity in the next test phase (Test A2); thus, together with the results from Experiment 1 (also called Test A1 phase), we tested chimpanzees in the ABA design. The Test A2 phase started from stimulus level L3, which these two chimpanzees reached during the Test A1 phase. The other procedures were identical with Experiment 1 (with <italic>α</italic> = 0.05/2). We compared each chimpanzee’s correct responses in target trials across Test A1 and Test B in GLMM and found a significant interaction effect between stimulus species and phase in both chimpanzees (Natsuki: χ<sup>2</sup> = 34.61, df = 1, p&lt;10<sup>–8</sup>; Hatsuka; χ<sup>2</sup> = 8.39, df = 1, p=0.004; also see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>). We then compared each chimpanzee’s performance across Test B and Test A2 and found a significant interaction effect between the two factors in both chimpanzees (Natsuki: χ<sup>2</sup> = 37.04, df = 1, p&lt;10<sup>–8</sup>; Hatsuka; χ<sup>2</sup> = 33.75, df = 1, p&lt;10<sup>–8</sup>). To examine these observed interaction effects further, we performed simple effects tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>). Critically, we found that both chimpanzees’ performance significantly increased from Test A1 (normal contrast polarity) to Test B (reversed contrast polarity) and then their performance decreased from Test B to Test A2 (normal contrast polarity) in trials presenting the chimpanzee stimuli. Natsuki’s performance significantly decreased from Test A1 to Test B and then increased from Test B to Test A2 in trials presenting the human stimuli. Hatsuka’s performance did not significantly decrease from Test A1 to Test B but significantly increased from Test B to Test A2 in those trials.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Performance of chimpanzee participants (Natsuki, Hatsuka, and Pendesa) in Study 2, represented as mean proportion correct calculated from all sessions (bar graphs) and each session (line graphs).</title><p>Participants were tested in the ABA design.

Our results thus supported H1 (perceptual advantage of uniformly white sclera). We also found that, although both human and chimpanzee eye-gaze directions are reliably discernible when those eyes were presented sufficiently large and bright (i.e., L1–2 stimuli), the human eye-gaze directions were more discernible than the chimpanzee eye-gaze particularly when those eyes were presented smaller and more shaded (i.e., L3–4 stimuli).</p><p>Our alternative hypotheses (H2–5) cannot explain the overall patterns of our results. H2 (perceptual advantage of the iris-sclera color difference) cannot explain our results likely because it supposes clear visibility of only iris but not that of eye-outline edges, another critical feature that contributes to the visibility of eye-gaze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobayashi and Kohshima, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2021</xref>) (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1</xref>). H3 (perceptual advantage of the horizontally elongated eye shape) also cannot explain our results likely because small variations in the horizontal eye length do not critically affect the visibility of eye-gaze. However, it should be noted that humans can take more extreme sideway eye positions than chimpanzees due to their horizontally elongated eye shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobayashi and Kohshima, 2001</xref>), and such mechanistic difference may be one advantage of the human eye in eye-gaze signaling. Yet, this fact might be of limited relevance to real-life social interaction because previous eye-tracking studies measuring eye movements of chimpanzees and humans in naturalistic conditions indicated that the majority of eye positions fall within 20°, the eye position adopted in our stimuli, in both species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kano and Tomonaga, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kothari et al., 2020</xref>). H4 and H5 (perceptual expertise in own-species and normal eye contrast polarity) also cannot largely explain our results. Finally, one pattern of our results could not be explained by H1 alone, specifically that the negative human eyes and positive chimpanzee eyes affected participants’ task performance similarly in some conditions. More specifically, human participants (collectively) performed similarly in trials presenting the human and chimpanzee stimuli in the L4-reversed condition (i.e., the negative human eye and positive chimpanzee eye in the darkest and smallest images). Also, chimpanzee Hatsuka performed similarly in trials presenting the human and chimpanzee stimuli during the Test B (reversed contrast polarity) phase (unlike Natsuki). These partial results are explained by either H2 or the combination of H1 and H3. Overall, however, our results indicate that the presence of the uniformly white sclera (and a darker iris) in our stimuli is the primary factor affecting the similarity of our results between the participants of both species in our study design.</p><p>Our results thus suggest that the visibility of human eye-gaze is primarily supported by basic color properties of the eyes, and thus by a basic perceptual mechanism shared among human and chimpanzee participants. Relatedly, there are a number of previous studies documenting the similarities in visual perception, including spectrum sensitivity, visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity, between humans and nonhuman apes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deeb et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dulai et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacobs et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsuno et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matsuno and Tomonaga, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsuzawa, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bard et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2017</xref>) though small differences might exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacobs et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2017</xref>). One notable aspect of our results is that chimpanzees required extensive training to distinguish between different gaze directions of human and chimpanzee eyes, and many of our chimpanzees were unable to pass all the required training phases. Given that many of our chimpanzees were already trained for simple color and form perception tasks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsuno et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsuzawa, 1990</xref>), this difficulty might suggest that chimpanzees may generally find it more difficult attending to detailed perceptual features of the eyes compared to humans, consistent with the previous training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tomonaga and Imura, 2010</xref>) and gaze-following/cueing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomasello et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tomonaga, 2007</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Povinelli and Eddy, 1996</xref>). In this sense, consistent with the previous experimental studies in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomasello et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Whalen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Provine et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ricciardelli et al., 2000</xref>), our results also suggest that gaze perception in humans is supported by both the uniformly white sclera of eyes and their perceptual expertise in such detailed eye features.</p><p>One clear limitation of this study is that only a small number of chimpanzees could participate in our test conditions, which hampers the generalization of our results. Nonetheless, if the performance of the current task is supported by simple color properties of eyes and basic visual perception of great apes as argued above, our results should be replicated in other (trained) individuals and likely also in other great ape species. However, further tests are necessary to confirm this prediction. Finally, it remains unanswered whether our results are generalizable to other stimuli with some variations in sclera color, specifically given that some chimpanzee individuals have partly unpigmented (white) sclera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perea-García et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caspar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mearing and Koops, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2021</xref>). However, such sclera is typically characterized as more graded or patchy compared to humans’ uniformly white sclera. Moreover, as noted earlier, the previous simulation study demonstrated that the visibility of eye-gaze (especially that of eye-outline edges) is limited with the eyes of all nonhuman ape species without the human-like uniformly white sclera, particularly in visually challenging conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2021</xref>). We thus expect a similar pattern of results even when using eyes with partly unpigmented sclera in our experiments. Again, however, further experimental studies are necessary to confirm this prediction.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that uniform whiteness in the exposed sclera enhances eye-gaze signaling. We thus provided experimental support for the gaze-signaling hypothesis despite recent criticisms on this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perea-García et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caspar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mearing and Koops, 2021</xref>). However, we also propose several significant updates on this hypothesis. Specifically, we found that it is the uniformly white sclera but not necessarily other distinguishing features, such as iris-sclera color difference and some variation in horizontal eye elongation, that critically distinguishes the human eye from the chimpanzee eye in terms of the visibility of eye-gaze direction. Moreover, we found that one function of the uniformly white sclera is to equip the eye-gaze signal with robustness against degradation caused by natural noises (e.g., shading, distancing). These new findings, when combined with the original and related hypotheses, suggest that humans have evolved special external eye morphology for conspecific communication and that it is a vital part of communication for humans to read conspecific eye-gaze cues during their everyday cooperative and cultural activities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Study 1 tested 25 human adults (14 females, 11 males; 23 East/South Asians and 1 Caucasian male) who had moderate to extensive experience in caretaking or studying chimpanzees (3 months = 1; 1–5 years = 10; 5–10 years = 4; &gt;10 years = 10). Although our human participants were mostly from similar cultural backgrounds, two related experimental studies tested participants from other cultural backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ricciardelli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yorzinski and Miller, 2020</xref>), and thus our results are complementary to those previous results. Our participants included 10 individuals who had extensive experience interacting with chimpanzees over a decade. We confirmed the same results when we restricted our analyses to those participants. All human participants were workers or students at Kumamoto Sanctuary (KS) or Primate Research Institute (PRI) who were directly invited to participate in this experiment. All were naïve to the experimental hypotheses in this study. All reported having normal to corrected-to-normal vision and no color blindness. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before the study. The experimental protocol was approved by the internal ethical committee for human experiments in PRI (no. 2020-05).</p><p>Study 2 trained 10 chimpanzees (nine females, one male). Among them, three chimpanzees (Natsuki, Hatsuka, Pendesa) passed all the training stages and participated in Experiment 1. Two of these three chimpanzees (Natsuki, Hatsuka) participated in Experiment 2. Daily veterinary checks indicated no specific visual problems (including color blindness) that may have interfered with the execution of current experiments in our chimpanzee participants (though some minor visual problems may exist in Pendesa; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaneko et al., 2013</xref>). Chimpanzees lived in a social group of conspecifics at KS or PRI. All chimpanzees were tested in a dedicated testing room at each facility, and their daily participation was voluntary, in that they could decide whether to enter the testing room on a given testing day. They received regular feedings, daily enrichment, and had ad libitum access to water. Animal husbandry complied with institutional guidelines (KS: Wildlife Research Center ‘Guide for the Animal Research Ethics’; PRI: 2002 version of ‘The Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Primates’), and the research protocol was approved by the institutional research committee (KS: WRC-2020-KS008A/009A; PRI: 2020-193/209).

They received the same task program online and performed the task on their computer in a standard office. Although slight differences existed in experimental setups between these two and the other participants (detailed below), we confirmed that including or not including them in our analysis yielded the same results. Participants sat in front of a 23-inch monitor (52.7 × 29.6 cm, SE2416H, Dell, Round Rock, TX; for one online participant, 52.2 × 29.3 cm, 243V5QHABA/11, Phillips, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; for the other online participant, 50.9 × 28.6 cm xub2390hs-b3, Iiyama, Japan; all monitors were in 1920 × 1080 pixels and set at 100% brightness and 50% contrast). They placed their second- to fourth-digit fingers on the left, down, and right keys of a standard keyboard connected to the computer. With this setup, the viewing distance was about 60–70 cm. Participants were told to sit in front of the monitor as they normally would and not to move their original head position throughout the experiments.</p><p>Study 2 tested chimpanzee participants in a testing room equipped with touch panels (ET1790L-7CWB-1-ST-NPB-G, Touch Panel Systems, Yokohama, Japan, in KS; LCD-AD172F2-T, IO-DATA, Kanazawa, Japan, in PRI; both 34.5 × 26.0 cm; both 1280 × 1024 pixels; both 100% brightness and 50% contrast) installed with their centers 45 cm from the floor. With this position, the eye level of the chimpanzees was roughly at the center of the monitor when they sat on the floor. The monitor was installed 15 cm behind transparent polycarbonate panels, and there was a rectangle hole sized 40 × 15 cm on the panel so that chimpanzees could view the stimuli through the panel while making a touch response by inserting their arm through the hole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). With this setup, the viewing distance was about 30–40 cm. This visual distance for chimpanzee participants is shorter than that for human participants, and thus overall task difficulty should be lower for them, consistent with other procedural differences that we made to ease the task difficulty for chimpanzees.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Stimuli</title><p>We prepared chimpanzee and human facial images with different levels of sizes and brightness.

To create the chimpanzee stimuli, we selected 10 high-resolution facial images of chimpanzees of both sexes from image collections obtained from colleagues at KS. As we sampled images from KS chimpanzees, some of our stimulus chimpanzees were familiar to KS chimpanzees (half of the stimulus chimpanzees used in both training and test sessions), while all stimulus chimpanzees were unfamiliar to PRI chimpanzees. Yet, we confirmed that KS and PRI chimpanzees did not systematically differ in their performance during the training sessions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig1">Appendix 4—figure 1</xref>). All stimulus chimpanzees were familiar to KS human participants, while most stimulus chimpanzees were unfamiliar to PPI human participants. Yet, we confirmed that KS and PRI human participants performed similarly in trials presenting the chimpanzee stimuli.</p><p>The selection criteria of stimulus photographs were as follows: (1) the photographed individual oriented both head and eyes directly to the camera, (2) all eye features of the individual were clearly visible, (3) no strong shade was visible on the face, and (4) no expression was shown in the face. See the author’s online repository for the full set of chimpanzee stimuli (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/2xny3/">https://osf.io/2xny3/</ext-link>). The selected chimpanzee individuals included juveniles and adults of both sexes, and their sclera colors were uniformly dark (from the iris edge to the eye corner). Although some chimpanzee individuals have unpigmented spots in their sclera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perea-García et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caspar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mearing and Koops, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2021</xref>), we selected individuals having relatively uniformly dark sclera to simplify our experimental comparisons (and manipulated them to have dark sclera in eye corners of averted gaze faces; see below for details). To create the human stimuli, we selected 10 high-resolution facial images of humans from the image collections published for research use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egger et al., 2011</xref>) based on the same criteria as above. The selected human individuals were teenagers of both sexes in various ethnicities with various skin and eye colors, and their sclera colors were uniformly white (from the iris edge to the eye corner). All stimulus humans were unfamiliar to both chimpanzee and human participants. We balanced the selection of human stimulus individuals so that we could include a wide variety of skin and eye colors among them. Study 1 used the whole sets of chimpanzee and human stimuli, which consisted of 10 stimulus individuals in each stimulus species, and Study 2 used six stimulus individuals in each stimulus species (due to procedural differences between studies; see below).</p><p>The facial images of both chimpanzees and humans were then cropped to include only the face and hair and auto-level adjusted to reduce the variations in overall brightness and contrast across images using Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA). The cropped images were then pasted into a uniform 50% gray background sized 400 × 400 pixels. The size of each cropped facial image (for both chimpanzee and human image) was adjusted based on its iris diameter, which was set at 16 pixels (4.2–4.4 mm on the monitors used in both studies 1 and 2). This size adjustment was performed to test the effect of eye shape (horizontal elongation of eye-opening, related to H3) independently from its absolute size and also to test the effect of white sclera independently from its exposed area size (see below for the quantification of these parameters). It should be noted that, due to these controls, our chimpanzee stimuli were presented as slightly larger than the size proportional to human stimuli because the eyeball size of humans is generally slightly larger (about 5–10%) in that of chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ross and Kirk, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekerman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirk, 2004</xref>). To create facial images with averted gaze, the eyeball part of each face (with direct gaze) was cropped and then shifted six pixels to the side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig3">Appendix 3—figure 3</xref>; this corresponded to the rotation of the eyeball of about 20° in both stimulus species). We then filled the blank areas in the shifted eye by copying the sclera colors of the original image using the ‘stamp’ tool in Photoshop. To create the facial images in which the eyes had reversed contrast polarity, we first cropped the eyeball part of each face (with both direct and averted gaze) and then inverted the lightness (or grayscale) component of the cropped part while keeping its chromaticity component unchanged (to avoid unnatural bluish appearance in the eyes) in a custom-made MATLAB program (MathWorks, Natick, MA).</p><p>We then evaluated the shape and color of the eyes in our images following a previous method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2021</xref>). We first created the region-of-interest (ROI) mask respectively for iris and sclera by tracing and filling the edge of each feature in Photoshop and a custom-made MATLAB program. We then calculated the color of each ROI as the mean of CIELAB color in all pixels within that ROI. CIELAB color system is created to simulate a perceptually uniform color space in humans and is also considered applicable to nonhuman primates with human-like trichromatic color vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stevens et al., 2009</xref>). We then calculated the color difference between iris and sclera in each image as a Euclidean difference between the mean values of these ROIs. We confirmed that, as found in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2021</xref>), the iris-sclera color differences did not significantly differ between our human and chimpanzee stimuli (with both normal and reversed contrast polarities; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig2">Appendix 3—figure 2</xref>). We also measured the shape of the eyes in each image using the same ROIs. We confirmed that, as found in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2021</xref>), the human eye was horizontally longer than the chimpanzee eye, but the size of the sclera ROI did not differ between the human and chimpanzee eye in our stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig2">Appendix 3—figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we converted the facial images to various levels of sizes and brightness. Study 1 used four stimulus levels (L1–4). L1 stimuli measured 400 pixels in width (original) and 100% brightness (original), L2 stimuli measured 200 pixels in width (1/2) and 50% brightness (1/2), L3 stimuli measured 100 pixels in width (1/4) and 33% brightness (1/3), and L4 stimuli measured 50 pixels in width (1/8) and 25% brightness (1/4). These size and brightness levels were determined based on pilot experiments with two human participants (who did not participate in Study 1) so that the gaze direction of L4 stimuli was recognizable to both participants at least in one of the stimulus species with either positive or negative eyes. In Study 2, we prepared three additional stimulus levels, L1.5, L2.5, and L3.5, which were the intermediate between L1 and 2, L2 and 3, and L3 and 4, respectively, in terms of size and brightness (i.e., L1.5: 300 pixels in width, 75% brightness; L2.5: 150 pixels in width, 42% brightness; L3.5: 75 pixels in width, 29% brightness) so that chimpanzees could move to the next stimulus level without showing substantial drops in their performances (see details about the test procedures below). Studies 1 and 2 used identical stimuli except that Study 1 presented the whole face in a 1:1 square image (e.g., 400 × 400 pixels), while Study 2 presented only the eye region in a 4:1 rectangle image (e.g., 400 × 100 pixels) to reduce attentional demands on chimpanzees.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Task procedures</title><p>We made the task procedures of studies 1 and 2 as similar as possible, although several unavoidable differences existed because chimpanzees required extensive training to master the gaze-detection task. In Study 1, the task for the human participants was to indicate the direction of gaze (left/front/right) in the stimulus face presented at the center of the screen by keypress in each trial. They were instructed to answer as accurately and quickly as possible.</p><p>Study 1 consisted of two experiments. All participants completed experiments 1 and 2 in this order. Experiment 1 presented stimuli with normal eye contrast polarity at L1–4 levels. Experiment 2 presented stimuli with eyes having both normal and reversed contrast polarities at L3–4 levels. Before each experiment, they completed 20 practice trials presenting L1 stimuli (with the stimuli with normal eye contrast polarity for Experiment 1 and those with both normal and reversed eye contrast polarities for Experiment 2). Each experiment consisted of a total of 96 trials with eight blocks (12 trials within each block). In both experiments, each block presented the stimuli of the same species, and the eight blocks alternately presented chimpanzee and human stimuli. In Experiment 1, each block started with three consecutive trials presenting L1 stimuli of either species (with normal eye contrast polarity) and then increased the stimulus level every three trials; namely, 1st–3rd trials, 4th–6th trials, 7th–9th trials, and 10th–12th trials respectively presented L1, L2, L3, and L4 stimuli of either species. Thus, in Experiment 1, 12 trials presented stimuli of either species (chimpanzee, human) at each stimulus level (L1–4). In Experiment 2, each block (12 trials) started with six consecutive trials presenting L3 stimuli of either species and then six consecutive trials presenting L4 stimuli of the same species. The first two blocks (first and second blocks) presented stimuli of the two species with normal eye contrast polarity (each block presented one species), and then the next two blocks (third and fourth blocks) presented stimuli of the two species with reversed eye contrast polarity. The fifth and sixth blocks and the seventh and eighth blocks again presented stimuli of the two species with normal eye contrast polarity and then those with reversed eye contrast polarity. Thus, in Experiment 2, 12 trials presented stimuli of either species (chimpanzee, human) at each stimulus level (L3, L4) in either eye contrast polarity (normal, reversed). Each participant completed all experiments in 25–30 min. All experiments were conducted in November 2020.</p><p>The number of times in which each gaze direction (left/front/right) was presented was balanced in each participant (i.e., each direction was presented in 32 trials per participant), and the number of times in which each stimulus individual was presented was also balanced both within each participant and across participants (i.e., each stimulus individual was presented on average 4.8 times per participant). The order of presenting the chimpanzee or human stimuli in the first block was counterbalanced across participants. The orders of gaze directions (left/front/right) and stimulus individuals were pseudorandomized so that the same gaze direction was not presented in more than two successive trials, and the same stimulus individual was not presented in any successive trials.</p><p>In Study 2, the task for the chimpanzee participants was to indicate the image with averted gaze (shifted to the right; called the target image) among two other images with direct gaze (called the distractor images) by a touch response in each trial (i.e., three-item visual search task, following the task design by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tomonaga and Imura, 2010</xref>). The target and distractor images differed only in their eye-gaze direction (but not in their eye contrast polarity or brightness/size). The three images were centered at 220, 640 (center), and 860 pixels horizontally and 512 pixels vertically on a 1280 × 1024 pixels monitor. Chimpanzees were given a sip of grape juice or a piece of apple (depending on their preference) when they answered correctly in each trial (the same amount of reward was given for each chimpanzee throughout the study). Before training, we performed a pilot experiment (200–600 trials for each chimpanzee) to decide the general task design, especially in terms of the number of distractors in each trial, the number of trials in each session, and the features of initial stimuli, so that the chimpanzees could gradually learn the task.</p><p>As in Study 1, Study 2 consisted of two experiments. Experiment 1 presented stimuli with normal eye contrast polarity, and Experiment 2 presented those with reversed eye contrast polarity and then those with normal eye contrast polarity. Thus, these two experiments presented stimuli with normal and reversed eye contrast polarities in the ABA design. Throughout Study 2 (both training and test), each session consisted of 48 trials and four blocks. Each block (12 trials) presented stimuli of the same species, and the four blocks alternately presented the chimpanzee and human stimuli. Each chimpanzee performed 1–8 sessions per day depending on their motivation. Each session lasted about 10 min. Study 2 took about 8 months from August 2020 to March 2021 including both training and test periods.</p><p>Training performed before these two experiments in Study 2 consisted of six training stages, and chimpanzees were trained for the task in a step-by-step manner through these stages. Training stage 1 presented the target image with no iris with the distractor images with irises (direct gaze; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig4">Appendix 3—figure 4</xref> for the examples). Training stages 2–4 presented the target image in which the iris was positioned in 38°, 30°, and then 20° (the final iris position was 20°; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig4">Appendix 3—figure 4</xref>), following the training procedure employed by a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tomonaga and Imura, 2010</xref>). Training stages 1–4 used two stimulus individuals per stimulus species, and training stages 5 and 6 added two new stimulus individuals per stimulus species in each stage; thus, training stages 5 and 6 respectively presented four and six stimulus individuals per stimulus species (the final stimulus set in training stage 6). The criterion of passing each training stage was either scoring over 90% in one session or 80% in two consecutive sessions both in trials presenting the chimpanzee stimuli and those presenting the human stimuli. We trained chimpanzees in the same number of trials for the human and chimpanzee stimuli to avoid biasing their learning for either stimulus species. Eight chimpanzees learned this visual search task with the most basic stimulus set (training stage 1) and continued to the next training stages (training stages 2–6). During the latter training stages, there was no consistent bias across individuals in their performances for the trials presenting the human and chimpanzee stimuli. However, some chimpanzees performed notably better in trials presenting the chimpanzee stimuli than those presenting the human stimuli (Cleo, Iroha, Mizuki) and some showed the opposite pattern (Pendesa), while others performed similarly in those trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig1">Appendix 4—figure 1</xref>). These observed individual differences do not appear to be related to the particular backgrounds of each individual (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). Three chimpanzees (Natsuki, Hatsuka, Pendesa) passed all training stages after extensive training (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app4table2">Appendix 4—table 2</xref>) and learned to reliably differentiate the eye-gaze directions of both humans and chimpanzee stimuli (L1, normal eye contrast polarity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig1">Appendix 4—figure 1</xref>). Three chimpanzees passed all the training stages, namely, that they performed reliably in both trials presenting the chimpanzee and human stimuli and then participated in Experiment 1. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="app4table2">Appendix 4—table 2</xref> for the number of sessions each chimpanzee had in each training stage.</p><p>Experiment 1 was divided into pre-test and test phases (pre-Test A1 and Test A1 phases). To test chimpanzees at stimulus levels higher than L1, we incremented the stimulus level by 0.5 when the chimpanzee scored above 85% in two successive sessions (in all trials at stimulus level L1 and test trials at stimulus level higher than L1; see below for details about the test and baseline trials). The pre-test phase started from stimulus level L1 and the test phase started from stimulus level L2.5. We used stimulus levels higher than (or equal to) L2.5 for the test phase because the results from Study 1 (human participants) indicated that clear performance differences between the stimulus species (i.e., test conditions) emerged at stimulus levels higher than L2. To examine individuals’ performance across sessions, each individual completed a minimum of 20 test sessions. To avoid the ceiling effect, we incremented the stimulus level by 0.5 when the individual scored above 85% in two successive sessions in test trials during the test phase. Two chimpanzees (Natsuki and Hatsuka) participated in Experiment 2. The other chimpanzee (Pendesa) took more than twice as many sessions as the other two chimpanzees for training and thus was dropped from Experiment 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app4table2">Appendix 4—table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Experiment 2 first presented stimuli with reversed eye contrast polarity (pre-Test B and Test B phases) and then presented those with normal eye contrast polarity (pre-Test A2 and Test A2 phases). As in Experiment 1, the pre-Test B and pre-Test A2 presented L1–2 stimuli, and the Test B and Test A2 phase presented L2.5–4 stimuli. Each chimpanzee completed a minimum of 20 test sessions respectively in the Test B and Test A2 phases. The other procedures were identical to those in Experiment 1. It should be noted that, although the number of these test sessions varied across individuals and test phases, we confirmed that limiting the dataset to 20 sessions in all individuals and sessions yielded the same results. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="app4table3">Appendix 4—table 3</xref> for the number of sessions each chimpanzee had in each pre-test and test stage.</p><p>In both experiments 1 and 2, (pre-)test sessions presenting stimulus levels higher than or equal to L1.5 consisted of 24 baseline and 24 test trials. The baseline trials presented L1 stimuli, and the test trials presented the stimuli at higher levels. Each block (12 trials) presented six baseline trials consecutively and then six test trials. Thus, in each test session, 12 trials presented stimuli of either species (chimpanzee, human) at the L1 (baseline trials) or higher levels (test trials). Chimpanzees maintained high performances in baseline trials across sessions for both human and chimpanzee stimuli in the Test A1 phase (L1 stimuli with normal color; Natsuki: 89% ± 12% vs. 90% ± 8%; Hatsuka: 91% ± 10% vs. 89% ± 8%; Pendesa; 97% ± 5% vs. 91% ± 7%; mean ± SD), Test B phase (L1 stimuli with reversed eye contrast polarity; Natsuki: 91% ± 7% vs. 94% ± 7%; Hatsuka: 92% ± 10% vs. 96% ± 6%; mean ± SD), and Test A2 phase (L1 stimuli with normal eye contrast polarity; Natsuki: 91% ± 10% vs. 94% ± 7%; Hatsuka: 92% ± 7% vs. 96% ± 5; mean ± SD).</p><p>As in Study 1, the number of times in which the target image (with averted gaze) was presented on each location (left/center/right) was balanced in each session (i.e., each gaze direction was presented in 16 trials per session), and the number of times in which each stimulus individual was presented was balanced in each session (i.e., each stimulus individual was presented four times per session). The order of presenting chimpanzee or human images in the first block was counterbalanced across sessions. The locations of the target images and the order of presenting the stimulus individuals were pseudorandomized so that the target image did not appear on the same location in more than two successive trials, and the same stimulus individual was not presented in any successive trials. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="app4table1">Appendix 4—table 1</xref> for the summarized descriptions of each stage at the training and (pre-)test phases and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app4table2">Appendix 4—table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app4table3">Appendix 4—table 3</xref> for the number of sessions in each stage at the training and (pre-)test phases, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>To test the participants’ performance differences between conditions, we ran a binomial GLMM in R (version 4.0.5). In Experiment 1 of Study 1, the model included participants’ correct response (correct, incorrect) as the response variable, stimulus species (chimpanzee image, human image), and stimulus level (L1–4) as test fixed factors, the interaction between those test factors, block and (within-block) trial, which was nested in each block, as control fixed factors, and participant and stimulus individual as random factors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref> for the formulas). In Experiment 2 of Study 1, we used the same model with eye contrast polarity (normal, reversed) as an additional test fixed factor (and its interaction with the other test factors; <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). In Study 2 (chimpanzees), as we evaluated chimpanzees’ performance in repeated sessions and adjusted their performances by incrementing stimulus levels according to their performance, we treated the session as a random factor and did not include stimulus level in the model. Therefore, the model included stimulus species as a test fixed factor, block and (within-block) trial as control fixed factors, and stimulus individual and sequence as random factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). Study 2 performed statistical tests for each chimpanzee with the <italic>α</italic> level adjusted for the number of individuals in the Bonferroni correction; namely, 0.05/3 in Experiment 1 and 0.05/2 in Experiment 2. For all models in studies 1 and 2, we included all possible random slope components, although we removed the correlations between random slopes and intercepts to ease the nonconvergence issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barr et al., 2013</xref>). Overdispersion was checked using the dispersion parameters derived from the R package ‘blmeco’ and did not seem to be an issue in any of our models (they ranged between 0.77 and 1.12). The significance of a given term was tested using a likelihood ratio test. Nonsignificant interaction terms were dropped to test the significance of lower-order terms. When the interaction term was significant, post-hoc comparisons were performed to examine simple effects at each factor level.

previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2021</xref>). The colors of the iris and sclera were the means of CIELAB colors of all pixels respectively in the iris and sclera regions of interest (ROI). The iris-sclera color difference was the difference between those two means. The color brightness of the iris and sclera was the difference between the mean of each color and the black (L = 0, a = 0, b = 0). The iris-sclera color difference did not significantly differ between the stimulus species in either normal or inverted color (<italic>t</italic>-test; normal: t18 = 0.26, p=0.80, d = 0.12; inverted: t18 = 0.39, p=0.70, d = 0.17). The eye shape was evaluated using the Sclera Size Index (SSI), calculated as the longest length of eye-opening divided by the iris diameter (Kobayashi and Kohshima, 2001). The human eye was horizontally longer than the chimpanzee eye, as indicated by higher SSI (t18 = 11.34, p&lt;10<sup>-3</sup>, d = 5.07). We also measured the area size of the sclera in the human and chimpanzee eye as the number of pixels in the sclera ROI. The area size did not significantly differ between the stimulus species (t18 = 1.08, p=0.29, d = 0.48). These statistical comparisons were performed using the full stimulus set used for Study 1 (20 images), but the same results were obtained using the stimulus set used for Study 2 (12 images).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-74086-app3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="app3fig3" position="float"><label>Appendix 3—figure 3.</label><caption><title>Stimulus preparation.</title><p>To create the facial images with averted gaze, we first cropped the eyeball part of each face with a direct gaze and then shifted it 6 pixels to the side (this corresponded to the rotation of the eyeball of about 20° in both stimulus species). We then filled the blank areas in the shifted eye by copying the sclera colors of the original image.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Ammie K Kalan as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kai R Caspar (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers found this study well executed with carefully designed experiments and transparent reporting of procedures. However a number of key issues require some attention during revisions:</p><p>1) Can you clarify and spend more time in the introduction explaining the general aim of your study followed by the justification and rationale for your experimental design given each one of your hypotheses. At the moment the hypotheses are encountered without a clear, overarching picture of the study's aims. Some hypotheses/tests are also not clearly explained. Why for example was inverted eye colour tested? (see also point 3).</p><p>2) Contextualize your results and findings better given that other nonhuman primates also have depigmented sclera and the fact that chimpanzees' dark sclera may not have been the ancestral condition (see Reviewer 2's detailed concerns). Can the authors spend more time to discuss potential alternative explanations given the variation observed in sclera colouration in other great apes?</p><p>3) Regarding your stimuli of inverting colours, the design procedure does not match the stimuli shown in Figure 1. If there was an inversion of iris and sclera color (including contrast and hue), then the inverted chimpanzee would need to have an amber-colored sclera and a blackish iris. Yet, the inverted chimp model apparently has a human-like white sclera and retains the amber-colored iris. Additionally, the pupil colors were also inverted for both species. Can you please explain this discrepancy and provide a clear explanation as to why these stimuli were edited in this manner, which hypotheses specifically they relate to, and whether you controlled for contrast and hue in this inverted/edited stimuli for the chimps given that the contrast values for the humans were equal in the two conditions. Please also provide additional examples of stimuli in the methods to aid clarification.</p><p>4) Clarify the GLMM code by adding the R script to aid transparency. It was not clear for example what the exact response variable was in your models.</p><p>5) Expand upon your limitations of the study section by explicitly stating the inability to generalize for chimpanzees given the low sample size and specific experience with touchscreens these chimps have, and the need for a cross cultural sample of human participants as well.</p><p>6) Clarify the differences between eye gaze and glancing/head direction with respect to communication and cooperation (see also Reviewer 2's comments re: conflation of these two concepts in the manuscript), and the potential implications/limitations of this for your experimental design and its interpretations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall I find the study by Kano and colleagues will be a solid contribution to the literature on this important topic.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Introduction</p><p>There is some confusion in the primate cognition literature when it comes to the differentiation between glancing/eye gaze and gazing/head direction. From my impression, the authors are perfectly aware of this distinction and refer to it in several sections of the manuscript. Still, they do not adequately differentiate it in the text. For instance, in the first section of the introduction, they refer to &quot;eye gaze&quot; in humans, then switch to &quot;gaze&quot; in great apes without indicating that two fundamentally different signals are described. Later on, the authors equate &quot;eye gaze&quot; with &quot;gaze&quot; (l. 65) which should not be done to avoid further confusion. The clarity of the text would be significantly improved by briefly stating the differences between the two phenomena and how they are referred to throughout the text.</p><p>l. 52: Please note that the conjunctiva, which contribute to the dark-eyed phenotypes of many primate eyes, is also depigmented in humans.</p><p>l. 56: &quot;eye shape&quot; is an ambiguous expression. What exactly is meant here?</p><p>l. 64: perhaps replace &quot;our&quot; with &quot;a&quot;.</p><p>l. 83: Please be precise when referring to &quot;color&quot;. The studies you cite here did, for instance, not study hue, but exclusively relied on differences in gray values. In the supplements, you refer to the lab color space that I am unfamiliar with (and probably many readers as well). Does it allow a differentiation between (gray value) contrast and hue? Furthermore, chimpanzee eyes and human eyes indeed significantly deviate from each other in absolute irido-scleral contrast. They do not differ in relative iris luminance, which is way of iridoscleral contrast quantification that should not be applied for interspecific comparisons (see Caspar et al., 2021).</p><p>Figure 1: I'm not exactly sure if I understood what you mean by inverting eye color &quot;without affecting the iris-sclera color contrast&quot;. The inverted chimpanzee figure does not look color inverted to me (shouldn't it have an amber-colored sclera and a black iris?).</p><p>Please also note that you inverted pupil color and explain why you did it. This decision leads to visibility of the pupil in the inverted chimp picture but not in the one of the inverted human. This might have implications for the experimental results. I suggest to at least briefly mention this issue.</p><p>Just out of curiosity: Is there a specific rationale behind the order in which you present the hypotheses? Why is the core hypothesis not #1?</p><p>Results</p><p>The study impressively demonstrates that chimpanzees have enormous difficulties to differentiate between glancing conditions, as shown by the extensive training needed to reliably accomplish this task and the high percentage of drop-outs. It has been prominently argued recently, that chimpanzee eyes are optimized to convey eye-gaze cues and that the role of glancing in chimpanzee social behavior has been underestimated (Perea-García et al., 2019). I believe it is important to point out how the new results challenge these proposals, which – if true – would bear important ramifications for chimpanzee communication.</p><p>You report only minor effects of eye shape – wouldn't this be expected, given the comparatively modest displacement of the iris relative to a direct glance condition is in your test stimuli?</p><p>Discussion</p><p>l. 237: Please note that critics of the gaze-signaling hypothesis do not deny that the human eye is more conspicuous than that of chimpanzees (Perea-García et al., 2019 are an exception). The key problem of this hypothesis is that it assumes a functional link between eye pigmentation and socio-cognition although there is no evidence for this. Humans are the only species in which this connection has been shown and it is not clear, whether this is a coincidental correlation. For instance, the hypothesis cannot explain extensive scleral depigmentation in non-human primates such as orangutans and howler monkeys. I would suggest to be more transparent when it comes to discussing recent criticisms of said hypothesis and how the results from this paper can add to the debate.</p><p>Methods</p><p>l. 430: &quot;Training 431 stage 1 presented the target image with no iris with the distractor images with irises (in direct gaze).&quot; Was pupil color affected as well? Perhaps an example of these test stimuli would be a good addition to the supplements, to give readers a better impression.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74086.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers found this study well executed with carefully designed experiments and transparent reporting of procedures.

Although our experimental study was independently performed from this related study, we have built some of our experimental designs based on the results from this related study. Yet, we could not refer to it extensively in our previous manuscript because this related study has not been out for a while (we apologize for any unclarity of our previous manuscript arising from this publication timing issue).

Please note that we did not swap the color of the iris and sclera in the eye image but reversed the contrast polarity of the eye image (by inverting their grayscale values) following Ricciardelli et al., (2000). One advantage of our method is that we could change only contrast polarity but not any color differences within the eye image, namely the iris-sclera and pupil-iris color differences (thus this manipulation does not change the conspicuousness of iris or pupil <italic>per se</italic>). Please also note that the visibility of eye-gaze directions depends on the visibility of both iris and eye-outline edges, not that of only iris or pupil. To clarify this aspect, we added Figure S1.</p><p>To visually clarify this stimulus-making procedure, we added Figure S4.</p><p>We also added the complete set of chimpanzee stimuli in our online repository (https://osf.io/2xny3/?view_only=b03f2ee4adf549aea09d8df5ab88f126).
