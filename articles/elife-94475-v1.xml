variants circulation. In Bolivia, sustained genomic surveillance capacities were lacking, especially at the beginning of the pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Methods:</title><p>In 2021 and 2022 we estimated the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Bolivian blood donors and explored the feasibility of using virus serum neutralization data for variants thought to have circulated to map their circulation across all departments over a year-long follow-up period. Anti-S1 and anti-NCP SARS-CoV-2 IgGs were studied, along with virus neutralization tests for ancestral-D614G, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 lineages of SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Results:</title><p>Between 2021 and 2022, the overall prevalence of anti-S1 and anti-NCP antibodies increased, reaching values over 90%, demonstrating that a large proportion of the Bolivian population was no longer naïve to the virus. Viral neutralization data, analyzed through multiple approaches, revealed the spread of the Gamma variant up to 2021, particularly impacting northern departments. In 2022, Gamma continued to circulate in southernmost departments of the country, and the emergence of Omicron BA.1 was detected. These trends align with publicly available genomic data from neighboring countries.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our serological analyses successfully identified both new antigenic groups, such as Omicron BA.1, and individual variants related to previously circulating groups, such as Delta. The study contributes insights into overall population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and variant-specific immunity levels across different regions of Bolivia. It also emphasizes the potency of seroprevalence studies in informing public health decisions and underscores their value in capturing the initial phases of emerging epidemics when variant diversity is limited, facilitating timely genomic surveillance setup.</p></sec><sec id="abs6"><title>Funding:</title><p>This study was supported by the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD), the project EMERGEN-PRI #22275 of the ANRS I MIE (INSERM), and the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (European Virus Archive Global, grant agreement No. 871029).

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started in South America with the detection of the first case on February 26, 2020, at São Paulo, Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Melo et al., 2020</xref>). Although it was initially thought that the pandemic would have less of an impact on this region due to its younger population structure, the pandemic eventually had a significant impact, accounting for 25% of infections worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">The Lancet, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Seroprevalence studies are a valuable adjunct to active surveillance because they allow analysis of the level of immunity of a population to a specific pathogen without the need for prospective testing and also provide information on the frequency of cases that do not attract medical attention (asymptomatic infections) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu and Riley, 2014</xref>). During the first years of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a few South American population-based seroprevalence studies were conducted in Colombia, Perú, Chile, and Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reyes-Vega et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Álvarez-Antonio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vial et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mercado-Reyes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nicolete et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buss et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Prete et al., 2022</xref>). Reported seroprevalence values varied through time and geographical location. Notably, high prevalence was observed in locations such as Iquitos-Perú (70%) or Manaus-Brazil (54%) after the first wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Álvarez-Antonio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buss et al., 2021</xref>). However, an unexpected violent second wave occurred concomitantly with the emergence of the Gamma variant, despite the high levels of seroprevalence reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buss et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Prete et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sabino et al., 2021</xref>). Despite the serious impact of COVID-19 on public health in Bolivia, research studies are still lacking: one study reported a seroprevalence of 43.4% in January 2021 among healthcare workers in the city of Cochabamba (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Saba Villarroel et al., 2022</xref>), but no nationwide seroprevalence study is currently available.</p><p>To date, the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants has mainly been studied through molecular surveillance, giving the proportion of circulating variants in real time. Therefore, genomic surveillance and serology offer distinct yet complementary insights thus far. However, in countries without significant genomic surveillance capabilities at the start of the epidemic, it has become difficult to assess the spread and impact of variants. Here, we have attempted to reconstruct parts of the history of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Bolivia by studying the prevalence and specific neutralizing capacity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood donors from all Bolivian departments after the second and third COVID-19 waves. Based on the results obtained, we discuss the potential contribution of seroprevalence and seroneutralization studies of viral variants and their complementarity with viral genomics data during the different phases of dissemination of a pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Background</title><p>In Bolivia, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on March 10, 2020, and to date, 1,209,619 cases and 22,407 deaths have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">WHO, 2023</xref>). As for the rest of South America, Bolivia has experienced five waves of SARS-CoV-2 cases: the initial wave (May-September 2020), followed by a second (January-July 2021), a third (December 2021 to February 2022), a fourth (June-August 2022) and the most recent (November 2022 to January 2023). Data on variants circulating in each wave in South America is available in several free-access databases (e.g., the PAHO dashboard) but Bolivian genomic data are scarce and only a few sequences have been deposited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">PAHO, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">GISAID, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hodcroft, 2023</xref>).</p><p>During the first wave, COVID-19 cases in Bolivia neighboring countries were due to ancestral and D614G SARS-CoV-2 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">PAHO, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">GISAID, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hodcroft, 2023</xref>). During the second wave<italic>,</italic> Alpha, Gamma, Lambda, and Mu variants were the main types identified, with variable distribution among countries. In contrast to Europe, the Alpha variant was not the most prevalent in any country of South America. Moreover, no specific wave was produced, and no associated increase in mortality was observed due to the circulation of the Delta variant. The start of the third wave, as in the rest of the world, was concomitant with the emergence and spread of the Omicron (BA.1) variant. The next two waves were mainly caused by the Omicron variants BA.2/BA.5 and BQ.1/XBB, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Specimens and ethical considerations</title><p>Samples were collected from volunteer blood donors who agreed to participate in the study and provided written consent.

VNTs were performed for samples with a positive or equivocal result in the anti-Spike S1 ELISA as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gallian et al., 2020</xref>). Four separate VNT assays were performed in duplicate with strains representative of the D614G, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 variants. Briefly, the test consisted of mixing 110 µL of a serially diluted (from 1/20 to 1/40960) patient serum sample (in DMEM with 1% of penicillin/streptomycin, Non-Essential Amino Acids and Glutamine), with 110 µL of a fixed quantity of a given SARS-CoV-2 strain, to reach a final concentration of 0.5 TCID<sub>50</sub>/µL of plasma dilution. This mixture was incubated for 1 hr at 37 °C. One hundred µL was then transferred onto a confluent Vero E6 TMPRSS2 + cells monolayer and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. On day 5 post-infection, dilutions showing a cytopathic effect (CPE) were considered negative (no neutralization), and those without CPE were considered positive (complete neutralization of the SARS-CoV2 inoculum). The neutralization titer referred to as the highest serum dilution with a positive result. Specimens with a VNT titer ≥ 20 were considered positive.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence</title><p>Prevalence values for anti-S1 and anti-NCP antibodies, and for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against the ancestral D614G (D614G), Gamma (γ), Delta (δ), and Omicron BA.1 (ο) variants were calculated using the Prevalence package RStudio version R-4.0.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Devleesschauwer et al., 2013</xref>).

The base 2 logarithm of VNT titer ratios (log2-ratios) for the following variant pairs was calculated: D614G/Gamma (D614G/γ), D614G/Delta (D614G/δ), D614G/Omicron BA.1 (D614G/ο). Negative log2-ratio indicated that the variant in the denominator (γ, δ, ο) had a higher titer than D614. A log2-ratio of 0 indicated that both variants presented the same titer. To evaluate the circulation level of γ, δ, and ο variants under increasingly stringent conditions, we calculated the proportion of the population with log2-ratio values of ≤0 (variant titer equal to or greater than D614G), ≤–1 (variant titer at least twice that of D614G), and ≤–2 (variant titer at least four times that of D614G) for each department.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Quantification of the circulating variants according to antigenic groups</title><p>Antigenic mapping of SARS-CoV-2 based on the neutralizing activity of each variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mykytyn et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilks et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van der Straten et al., 2022</xref>) enables us to group the ancestral variants D614G, Alpha, Delta, Lambda, and Epsilon in one group (GI), Beta, Gamma, Mu, Iota, and Zeta in a second group (GII), and Omicron and its derivatives into a third group (GIII). To initiate the quantification of the variants circulating in Bolivia, we initially employed a straightforward approach to estimate the percentage of samples in each antigenic group within each department of Bolivia using two different methods (the ‘Average titer method’ and the ‘Variant assignment method’).</p><sec id="s2-8-1"><title>Average titer method</title><p>To assess the neutralizing response across distinct antigenic groups, we used the average VNT titer for the D614G and Delta variants to delineate antigenic group I (GI). Antigenic group II (GII) was established based on the VNT titer for the Gamma variant, while antigenic group III (GIII) was defined by the VNT titer for the Omicron BA.1 variant. For evaluating the percentage of each antigenic group within different regions of Bolivia, GI was considered dominant if its titer surpassed those of GII and GIII. Similarly, GII was considered if its titer exceeded those of GI and GIII, and GIII was considered if its titer equaled or surpassed those of GI and GII. Additionally, the prevalences of GI (from ancestral, Alpha, Delta, Lambda, and Epsilon variants), the prevalences of GII (from Beta, Gamma, Mu, Iota, and Zeta variants), and the prevalences of GIII (from all Omicron-derived variants) were obtained for neighboring countries of Bolivia using publicly accessible genomic data when available.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8-2"><title>Variant assignment method</title><sec id="s2-8-2-1"><title>Assignment rules</title><p>We implemented several rules taking into account the previously described decrease in neutralizing activity of variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mykytyn et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilks et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van der Straten et al., 2022</xref> to determine which of the four variants tested was expected to be responsible for the main or last infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Main rules relied on D614G/γ, D614G/δ, and D614G/ο log2-ratios to differentiate between D614G, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants. Given that Tarija had the lowest variant circulation level and the highest vaccination coverage among the departments analyzed as of October 2021, this department was chosen as a reference for establishing the D614G cut-off values for the subsequent rules defining the infection by γ, δ, and ο variants. Given that approximately 90% of the population in this department exhibited D614G/γ, D614G/δ, and D614G/ο log2-ratios ≥0, ≥0, and ≥1 respectively, the D614G variant was assigned to compliant samples. If any of these log2-ratios fell below these threshold values, the corresponding variant (γ, δ, or o) was assigned. Secondary rules were applied on a fraction of samples when the log2-ratios for two pairs were below the threshold values. Additional log2-ratios for Delta/Gamma (δ/γ), Gamma/Omicron BA.1 (γ/ο), and Delta/Omicron BA.1 (δ/ο) pairs were thus considered to differentiate between the two variants. If both the D614G/γ and D614G/δ log2-ratios were ≤ –1, a δ/γ log2-ratio≤0 was chosen to indicate a Gamma infection, while a δ/γ log2-ratio≥1 indicated a Delta infection. When the D614G/ο log2-ratio was ≤0 and the D614G/γ log2-ratio was also ≤ –1, a γ/ο log2-ratio≥1 indicated a Gamma infection; otherwise (γ/ο log2-ratio≤0), Omicron BA.1 was assigned. Similarly, if the D614G/ο log2-ratio was ≤0 and the D614G/δ log2-ratio was ≤ –1, a δ/ο log2-ratio≥1 suggested a Delta infection; otherwise (δ/ο log2-ratio≤0), Omicron BA.1 was assigned.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8-2-2"><title>Quantification according to assignment rules</title><p>Variants assigned as D614G and Delta were grouped in the antigenic group I, Gamma was set as the antigenic group II, and Omicron BA.1 as the antigenic group III.

In the department of Cochabamba, no significant change in D614G prevalence was observed (28.3% in October 2020 to 26.6% in June 2022).

This study enabled us to estimate the level of immunity of the population to SARS-CoV-2 nationwide and in the different regions of the country, thus providing valuable information on the circulation of these variants in Bolivia.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>Firstly, the study was limited to blood donors in the major cities of Bolivia and may therefore not be fully representative of the populations of the country as a whole. Furthermore, in Bolivia, blood donation is unrewarded, and blood donors appear to be quite representative of the general population. Indeed, routine screening for several infection markers (such as HIV or HBV) is conducted in all donors, and the prevalences of these markers do not differ from those observed in the general population. For example, UNAIDS data highlights a 0.4% HIV prevalence within the Bolivian general population, with significantly higher rates exceeding 25% observed in high-risk groups such as men who have sex with men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">UNAIDS, 2022</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sheena et al., 2022</xref> estimated a 0.6% prevalence of HBsAg in Bolivia in 2019. Bolivian national statistics of National Blood Program of the Ministry of Health and Sports indicate that between 2019 and 2023, the proportion of HIV- and HBV-reactive units among screened blood donors ranged from 0.26% to 0.41% and 0.16% to 0.25%, respectively (Dr. Lissete Bautista’s personal communication).</p><p>Secondly, our results are based on serological data and may not be strictly identical to the genomic data from a quantitative point of view, although they are likely to reflect similar trends and distributions (see below). The results could also be influenced by various factors, including significant individual variation in antibody responses, as well as the decline in antibody titers during the first months following infection or vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iyer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hartley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Turner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peghin et al., 2021</xref>) and could therefore be slightly underestimated. As the complexity of SARS-CoV-2 antigen exposure histories increased among tested individuals, we observed a tendency for serological data to start diverging from genomic data. This suggests, as expected, that the effectiveness of this method would be greater if implemented early in an epidemic when the occurrence of multiple infections with different variants or the administration of varying doses of vaccine in the analyzed population before or after infection (resulting in hybrid immunity) is still limited. However, to mitigate the potential challenges arising from complex antigen exposure, we employed straightforward criteria to identify the variant among the four tested in VNT that exhibited the highest value (cf methods), thereby likely indicating the main or most recent infection and minimizing the influence of cross-neutralization on the final outcomes. In addition, several approaches were used to analyze the results, including quantification of circulating antigenic groups and individual variants, yielding results that were comparable and closely aligned with the genomic data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Epidemiological assessment</title><p>As of October 2021, our data showed an anti-S1 SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 86.3%, indicating that a large part of the population had immunity against SARS-CoV-2 following infection, vaccination, or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Comparing the vaccination coverage with the anti-S1 antibody prevalence, we can infer that significant viral transmission occurred in the population before October 2021 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These epidemiological data are in agreement with other population-based studies performed on the first half of 2021 in Perú and in the northwest of Brazil that reported high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (63.6% and 65.0%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Álvarez-Antonio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buss et al., 2021</xref>). In Bolivia, the prevalence observed a few months later was even higher, suggesting sustained virus circulation. By June 2022, although our sample was limited to four departments, the data showed a clear trend towards saturation in the prevalence of anti-S1, suggesting that almost the entire population had been vaccinated and/or infected by that time. With vaccination coverage having increased by around 13% (both for those who had received two doses and those who had received the booster), the significant increase (+31.2%) in the seroprevalence of anti-NCP antibodies indicates that a large proportion of the population has been exposed to the virus between October 2021 and June 2022 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Even if a proportion of newly vaccinated individuals had received an inactivated vaccine likely to generate an anti-NCP response, this cannot explain the observed increase in the prevalence of anti-NCP antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Muena et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dashdorj et al., 2021</xref>). This corresponds to the emergence of the Omicron BA.1 variant, which has been shown to cause a high rate of infection worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Silva et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karim and Karim, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Consistently, as of October 2021, the prevalence of nAbs against the ancestral D614G (83.1%) and Gamma (80.8%) variants was very high throughout the country (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The three northern departments (Pando, La Paz, and Beni) were the most exposed to the Gamma variant, as reflected by the highest Gamma GMTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). By June 2022, the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against all variants had increased, reaching values higher than 90%, demonstrating that a large proportion of the Bolivian population was no longer naïve to the virus.</p><p>When looking at nAbs with high neutralization titers, new variant circulation patterns emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Some departments in the northern part of Bolivia, especially Pando, may have suffered a greater impact during the first two waves, since nAbs titers were higher for both the D614G and Gamma variants as of October 2021. To gain further insight into the variant circulation, we proposed additional analyses (‘VNT Titers ratio method’, ‘Average titer method’, ‘Variant assignment method’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>).</p><p>As of October 2021, a higher circulation of GII/Gamma was confirmed in northern Bolivia. Moreover, it is likely that the first two waves had a significant impact on Pando, since (despite having the lowest vaccine coverage in the country) high percentages of nAbs responses to the ancestral D614G and Gamma variants were observed. On the other hand, the southernmost department (Tarija) was probably the least affected, as it had the highest percentage of neutralizing response to ancestral viruses and the lowest to Gamma, which is consistent with its high vaccination coverage (the highest in the country). As for Delta, limited circulation was observed across the country, corresponding to the beginning of its circulation in Latin America (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, no evidence of Omicron BA.1 was observed.</p><p>By June 2022, analyses showed that GII/Gamma continued to circulate in southernmost departments (Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, and Tarija). Besides, the high level of nAbs against GII/Gamma, observed in the first sampling period, in the population of La Paz seems to have waned, and on the contrary, GI/D614G nAbs have risen (+40%). This observation cannot be explained solely by an increase in vaccination coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), since vaccination increased by only 13%. GI/D614G nAbs augmentation could be related to the circulation of another GI variant, such as Lambda (which has circulated in the neighboring country of Perú), or alternatively, the infection by the Delta and/or Omicron BA.1 variant may have boosted the level of pre-existing anti-D614G nAbs in the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Quandt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaku et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stamatatos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gallian et al., 2023</xref>). This boost of pre-existing Abs phenomenon, known as antigenic sin, has been extensively documented in the context of influenza infections and vaccinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Viboud and Epstein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Monto et al., 2017</xref>). As for Delta, prevalences did not change significantly between October 2021 and June 2022, reflecting the limited Delta wave in Latin America compared to Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Giovanetti et al., 2022</xref>). Despite a significant global wave of the Omicron BA.1 variant in South America, less than 9% of the Bolivian population tested displayed a neutralizing antibody response against Omicron BA.1. This lower-than-expected nAbs response could be attributed to the possibility that this variant increased the levels of pre-existing nAbs to previous variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Quandt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaku et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stamatatos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gallian et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Significance of serological results</title><p>To assess the significance and robustness of our serological results, we compared the results obtained with the different methods used and with genomic data from neighboring countries. We found that the patterns of circulation of antigenic groups/variants were consistent across the different serological methods used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>) and that they nicely aligned with the percentage of each antigenic group/variants in the neighboring countries as computed from accessible genomic surveillance data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Serological analyses allowed detecting the emergence of a new antigenic group (e.g., Omicron BA.1), but also of an individual variant related to a previously circulating antigenic group (e.g. Delta). Overall, the accuracy of the mapping seems to have diminished with time, the number of variants that have been circulated, vaccination, and the saturation of prevalence estimates. As an example, the prevalence values found for Omicron BA.1 in June 2022 are likely to be underestimated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). Although the detection of a new antigenic group remained possible in this specific study during the late period of variants circulation, our results argue in favor of the greater usefulness of seroepidemiological studies for documenting the early stages of a new epidemic. This is of great interest because it gives time to setup genomic surveillance in countries with limited sequencing capacity at the start of an epidemic emergence.</p><p>In conclusion, our study represents the first large-scale survey conducted in all the departments of Bolivia, with a follow-up period of almost a year. This has enabled us to document ongoing viral circulation and better characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Latin America, as well as providing essential information on the successive waves that have occurred in Bolivia. In particular, despite a high prevalence in 2022, which could suggest the development of herd immunity, subsequent waves demonstrate the virus's ability to adapt and continue circulating in a population that is no longer naïve. Our results confirm and reiterate that seroprevalence studies are a powerful tool for informing public health decision-making. Our findings strongly support the idea that seroepidemiological studies are valuable for capturing the initial phases of a new epidemic, giving time for the establishment of genomic surveillance in countries with limited sequencing capacity at the onset of an emerging epidemic.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Samples were collected randomly from volunteer blood donors who agreed to participate in the study.

S1 and NCP antibodies were used to distinguish between vaccination and natural infection and virus-specific neut titers were used to determine which variants the antibodies respond to. The study reports almost universal antibody prevalence and increases in antibodies against specific variants at different points corresponding to circulating variants identified phylogenetically in neighbouring countries. The authors propose this approach for settings like Bolivia where genetic sequencing is not readily available. Unfortunately, there are significant limitations to this approach that limit its utility - serological data are available after the fact in a fast-moving pandemic and so are a poor alternative to phylogenetic data. Rather, serological information can supplement phylogenetic data and is most useful in estimating population-level immunity.</p><p>(1) Considerations in interpreting the results:</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's valuable feedback, which will certainly enhance the quality of our manuscript.

Serology provides different information to phylogenetic sequencing of the viruses and so both are important. Viral sequencing provides real-time information on circulating variants and indicates the proportion of each variant in circulation at any point as there are almost always multiple variants spreading but it is the fastest spreading variant that comes to dominate. Importantly serology measures asymptomatic infections as well, providing population estimates of infection that are not available through viral gene sequencing.</p></disp-quote><p>We underscored this point in the introduction by incorporating the following sentences:</p><p>“Seroprevalence studies are a valuable adjunct to active surveillance because they allow analysis of the level of immunity of a population to a specific pathogen without the need for prospective testing, and also provide information on the frequency of cases that do not attract medical attention (asymptomatic infections)(4).” and “To date, the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants has mainly been studied through molecular surveillance, giving the proportion of circulating variants in real time. Therefore, genomic surveillance and serology offer distinct yet complementary insights thus far.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. A major concern in the interpretation of serology is that antibody titers vary markedly over time with rapid declines in the first year post-infection or post-vaccination. However, these declines vary depending on whether hybrid immunity is present. Disentangling this retrospectively is a challenge. A low antibody titer could reflect an infection that occurred a few months ago but may be below the threshold for positivity at the time of testing. There is also substantial individual variability in antibody responses.</p></disp-quote><p>This limitation merits emphasis and has consequently been elaborated upon in the discussion section:</p><p>“Secondly, our results are based on serological data and may not be strictly identical to the genomic data from a quantitative point of view, although they are likely to reflect similar trends and distributions (see below). The results could also be influenced by various factors, including significant individual variation in antibody responses, as well as the decline in antibody titers during the first months following infection or vaccination(31-34) and could therefore sligly underestimated. As the complexity of SARS-CoV-2 antigen exposure histories increased among tested individuals, we observed a tendency for serological data to start diverging from genomic data. This suggests, as expected, that the effectiveness of this method would be greater if implemented early in an epidemic when the occurrence of multiple infections with different variants or the administration of varying doses of vaccine in the analyzed population before or after infection (resulting in hybrid immunity) is still limited. However, to mitigate the potential challenges arising from complex antigen exposure, we employed straightforward criteria to identify the variant among the four tested in VNT that exhibited the highest value (cf methods), thereby likely indicating the main or most recent infection and minimizing the influence of crossneutralization on the final outcomes. In addition, several approaches were used to analyze the results, including quantification of circulating antigenic groups and individual variants, yielding results that were comparable and closely aligned with the genomic data.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Serology becomes increasingly difficult to untangle when an individual has had doses of vaccine and multiple natural infections with different variants. Due to the importance of hybrid immunity in population risk to new variants, it would be useful for estimates of hybrid immunity to be generated based on anti-S1 and anti-NCP antibodies. From a population immunity perspective, this could be important in guiding future protection and boosting strategies.</p></disp-quote><p>We estimated the hybrid immunity for each department in 2021 and 2022 based on the prevalence of anti-S1 and anti-NCP antibodies and added a new Supplementary Table 1. We also added a description of this table in the result section: “The estimated hybrid immunity, based on the prevalence of anti-S1 and anti-NCP antibodies, ranged from 51.4% in Pando to 73.6% in Potosí in 2021. By 2022, this increased to between 83.3% in Santa Cruz and 90.6% in Tarija (Supplementary Table 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Since there is cross-neutralization by the antibodies stimulated by each variant, it is important to establish the sensitivity and specificity of each of the neutralization assays in a panel comprising multiple variants. An assessment of the accuracy of the neut assay for each variant is needed to be confident that it is able to distinguish between variants.</p></disp-quote><p>Assessing the performance of a the VNT for each SARS-CoV-2 variants is a highly complex task. This evaluation requires samples with comprehensive data on vaccination and infection specific to each variant to determine the specificity of each VNT for each variant. However, the access to such samples for every newly emerging variant remains challenging. In order to circumvent this issue, we evaluated the circulation level of γ, δ, and ο variants under increasingly stringent conditions, by calculating the proportion of the population with log2-ratio values of ≤0 (variant titer equal to or greater than D614G), ≤-1 (variant titer at least twice that of D614G), and ≤-2 (variant titer at least four times that of D614G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. Blood donors are notoriously poor representations of the general population in many countries, driven partly by whether donation is financially rewarded. For example, in the USA, drug addicts are disproportionately over-represented in blood donor populations as they use it as a source of money. The authors provide no information on whether the blood donor population in Bolivia is representative of the entire population. Comparison of the prevalence of specific disease markers in the general population and in blood donors could provide a signal of their comparability.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a significant aspect addressed in point 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Please provide the sensitivity and specificity of each of the assays so that the reader can assess the degree of accuracy in the assay that claims that the prevalent antibodies are due to, for example, omicron.</p></disp-quote><p>The sensitivity and specificity of the in vitro assays are now referenced in a previous study: “The sensitivity and specificity of the in vitro assays were described previously(23).”</p><p>Neutralization assays are considered the gold standard for measuring neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, and they are widely used in seroprevalence studies. However, until now, no one has successfully evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of this assay for SARS-CoV-2 variants, as it requires sera from individuals exposed to a single variant, which are increasingly difficult to collect for each newly emerging variants. Nevertheless, using sera from laboratory-infected animals (primarily hamsters) with a single variant exposure has enabled the antigenic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 variants through viral neutralization. This approach has shown that it is possible to distinguish between sera from individuals infected with different variants, even among the Omicron subvariants (Anna Z. Mykytyn et al. Antigenic cartography of SARS-CoV-2 reveals that Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 are antigenically distinct.Sci. Immunol.7,eabq4450(2022); Samuel H. Wilks et al. Mapping SARS-CoV-2 antigenic relationships and serological responses.Science382,eadj0070(2023)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Please provide an assessment of the representativity of the blood donor population eg. Is the prevalence of hepatitis B serological markers in the blood donor population comparable with the prevalence of hepatitis B serological markers in the general population from community-based studies?</p></disp-quote><p>A new sentence was included in the discussion to offer support for considering the blood donor population as a representative sample of the general population: “In addition, in Bolivia, blood donation is unrewarded, and blood donors appear to be quite representative of the general population. Indeed, routine screening for several infection markers (such as HIV or HBV) is conducted in all donors, and the prevalences of these markers do not differ from those observed in the general population. For example, UNAIDS data highlights a 0.4% HIV prevalence within the Bolivian general population, with significantly higher rates exceeding 25% observed in high-risk groups such as men who have sex with men(29). Moreover, Sheena et al. estimated a 0.6% prevalence of HBsAg in Bolivia in 2019(30). Bolivian national statistics of National Blood Program of the Ministry of Health and Sports, indicate that between 2019 and 2023, the proportion of HIV- and HBV-reactive units among screened blood donors ranged from 0.26% to 0.41% and 0.16% to 0.25%, respectively (Dr. Lissete Bautista’s personal communication).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
