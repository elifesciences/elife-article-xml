However, the mechanisms regulating neurogenesis after seizures remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) from mossy cells is a major source of Shh signaling activity after seizures, by which mossy cells contribute to seizure-induced neurogenesis and maintenance of the NSC pool. Deletion of <italic>Shh</italic> from mossy cells attenuates seizure-induced neurogenesis. Moreover, in the absence of Shh from mossy cells, NSCs pool are prematurely depleted after seizure-induced proliferation, and NSCs have impaired self-renewal. Likewise, lack of Shh from mossy cells accelerates age-related decline of the NSC pool with accompanying reduction of self-renewal of NSCs outside the context of pathology such as seizures. Together, our findings indicate that Shh from mossy cells is critical to maintain NSCs and to prevent exhaustion from excessive consumption in aging and after seizures.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>seizure</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>quiescence</kwd><kwd>Sonic hedgehog</kwd><kwd>mossy cell</kwd><kwd>activity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS118995</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pleasure</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hilar mossy cells control seizure-dependent dentate neurogenesis and stem cell quiescence by activity-dependent control of Sonic hedgehog production and signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the dentate gyrus (DG) of the adult hippocampus, neural stem cells (NSCs) are preserved beyond development in a special niche where newborn neurons are generated and integrated into the hippocampal circuit throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Imayoshi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ming and Song, 2011</xref>). NSCs in the adult DG are maintained in a quiescent state, thus adult neurogenesis begins by activating NSC proliferation, followed by differentiation and maturation of newborn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Encinas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lugert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Urbán et al., 2019</xref>). NSC proliferation and subsequent differentiation in the adult DG are influenced by neuronal activity and the processing of multiple external stimuli and have been shown to be dysregulated after brain insults and in disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kempermann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lugert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moreno-Jiménez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Praag et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sierra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tobin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Epileptic seizures are known to strongly induce adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jessberger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jessberger and Parent, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parent et al., 1997</xref>). Normally, increased neurogenesis has been shown to contribute to hippocampus-dependent learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ming and Song, 2011</xref>). However, seizure-induced newborn neurons have morphological abnormalities, and many ectopically migrate into the hilus of the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parent et al., 1997</xref>) contributing to formation of aberrant neuronal circuits in the hippocampus. These ectopic neurons are implicated in cognitive impairment as well as in the development of repeated spontaneous seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lybrand et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, previous studies showed that once NSC proliferation is activated, NSCs are consumed after a series of cell divisions for neuronal production, resulting in the reduction of neurogenesis and the decline of the NSC pool with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Encinas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lugert et al., 2010</xref>). Excessive neuronal production induced by neuronal hyperactivity has been linked to accelerated consumption of NSCs and leads to depletion of the NSC pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sierra et al., 2015</xref>). Despite these studies, little is known about the mechanisms by which seizures induce neurogenesis and how NSCs are regulated in pathogenic conditions to result in NSC pool depletion.</p><p>NSCs are regulated by numerous signaling molecules from other niche cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonafina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morales and Mira, 2019</xref>). Dysregulation of the NSC niche in pathological conditions has been suggested to contribute to aberrant NSC behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li and Guo, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salta et al., 2023</xref>). There are several different types of neurons in close proximity to NSCs in the DG. A recent series of studies demonstrated that hippocampal neuronal networks between these niche neurons regulate neuronal activity-induced neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asrican et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Song et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Song et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yeh et al., 2018</xref>). Mossy cells are excitatory neurons in the dentate hilus that provide glutamatergic inputs to newborn granule neurons and GABAergic interneurons in the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chancey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scharfman, 2016</xref>). Mossy cells are among the most sensitive neurons to afferent excitation in the hippocampus and are vulnerable to continuous seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scharfman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scharfman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sloviter et al., 2003</xref>). Mossy cell activity modulates NSC proliferation depending on the intensity of activation: only highly activated mossy cells increase NSC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yeh et al., 2018</xref>). These studies suggest a potential connection between seizure-induced mossy cell hyperexcitation and the aberrant neurogenesis seen after seizures.</p><p>We previously found that Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a morphogen inducing cell proliferation, is expressed by mossy cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Dysregulation of Shh signaling activity has been reported in epileptic seizures where increased Shh signaling and Shh expression were observed in the hippocampus of temporal lobe epilepsy patients and epileptic rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pitter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Manipulation of Shh receptors in NSCs has shown that increased Shh signaling in NSCs drives NSC proliferation and neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonelli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choe and Pleasure, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daynac et al., 2016</xref>). These findings may indicate contributions of Shh in seizure-induced neurogenesis. However, the source and regulation of Shh that regulates neurogenesis, especially during seizure activity, remains undefined. Direct evidence connecting Shh signaling and neural activity with seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis has not been examined.</p><p>In this study, we identify mossy cells as a major source of Shh during epileptic seizures and find that activation of Shh signaling promotes neurogenesis following seizures. Seizure-induced neurogenesis is attenuated by selective deletion of <italic>Shh</italic> in mossy cells. Our data also show that Shh from mossy cells is needed to preserve the NSC pool after seizure-induced neurogenesis. Interestingly, even though seizure-induced neurogenesis is reduced in the absence of Shh from mossy cells, deletion of <italic>Shh</italic> also results in premature depletion of the NSC pool after seizures. We find that Shh from mossy cells is important for NSCs to return to the stem cell state after seizure-induced proliferation. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that <italic>Shh</italic> deletion in mossy cells results in premature decline of NSC pool with age even without seizures, and that NSCs are less able to return to the stem cell state after proliferation without mossy cell supplied Shh. Together, our results indicate that Shh derived from mossy cells increases proliferation and self-renewal of NSCs during seizure-induced neurogenesis, thereby ensuring that the NSC pool is sustained.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Shh signaling is activated by seizures and contributes to seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis</title><p>To understand the role of Shh signaling in seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis, we first investigated whether Shh signaling is activated upon induction of seizure activity. Expression of <italic>Gli1</italic>, a downstream transcription factor of Shh signaling, is transcriptionally induced upon activation of Shh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 1997</xref>). In the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the DG, <italic>Gli1</italic> expression and activation of Shh signaling are seen exclusively in NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn and Joyner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bottes et al., 2021</xref>). To confirm this, using <italic>Gli1<sup>CreER</sup></italic> mice crossed with Cre-dependent red fluorescent protein (tdTomato) reporter mice Rosa<italic><sup>AI14</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn and Joyner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>), we labeled <italic>Gli1</italic> expressing cells in the DG with tdTomato. One day after a 3-day tamoxifen treatment, we observed that about 90% of tdTomato-labeled cells in the SGZ were Sox2+ S100B− cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), comprising Sox2+ GFAP+ radial glial cell population.

Since inhibitory interneurons and mossy cells are both prominent dentate hilar cell types, we explored which of these are included in the tdTomato+ cells. Co-immunostaining with the cell-type markers showed that the majority of tdTomato+ cells were GluR2/3+ mossy cells but with a much smaller number of Parvalbumin+ interneurons expressing tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Furthermore, the cell types reflected in the population of tdTomato+ cells did not change with seizure induction, thus indicating that in the hilus, seizures did not lead to ectopic expression of Shh in cells that normally do not express the ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, we found that tdTomato+ cells were dominantly observed in the dorsal GluR2/3+ mossy cells but not in the ventral hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggest that dorsal mossy cells are the major source of Shh in DG in both the naive and post-seizure hippocampus. We also observed increased numbers of Shh-responding NSCs of the SGZ upon seizure induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Therefore, we next tested the possibility that the amount of <italic>Shh</italic> expression is upregulated by seizures in mossy cells. To address this, we visualized <italic>Shh</italic> mRNA in the DG using RNAscope in situ hybridization technology. Consistent with the results from <italic>Shh<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>;Rosa<italic><sup>AI14</sup></italic> mice, we observed that <italic>Shh</italic> mRNA is enriched in the dentate hilus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Shh</italic> expression was dramatically increased throughout the dentate hilus from anterior to posterior of dorsal DG at 24 hr after seizure induction. Combining RNAscope with immunofluorescence, we analyzed the number of <italic>Shh</italic> mRNA puncta in the GluR2/3+ mossy cells and found significantly increased <italic>Shh</italic> in mossy cells after seizure induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>).

Since mossy cells undergo hyperactivation during seizures, we hypothesized that once activated by seizures, mossy cells increase secretion of Shh and contribute to seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis. To test whether neuronal activity in mossy cells increases neurogenesis, we used a chemogenetic approach to activate mossy cells. <italic>Crlr-Cre</italic> mice were crossed with Cre-dependent Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) activator mice (<italic>Rosa<sup>DIO-hM3Dq</sup></italic>) which express excitatory G-protein-coupled receptor hM3Dq with mCherry upon Cre recombination (from here on referred as <italic>Crlr-Cre;hM3Dq</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sciolino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Since the high dose of Clozapine-<italic>N</italic>-oxide, frequently used in the DREADD system has a risk of causing behavioral abnormalities and might have contributory effects on neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gomez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacLaren et al., 2016</xref>), we instead used Clozapine (CLZ) to induce neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gomez et al., 2017</xref>).

To investigate the effect of mossy cell neuronal activity on neurogenesis, the mice received BrdU for 5 days concomitant with CLZ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) and were analyzed 3 days after the last BrdU injection.

To address this, we stereotaxically injected Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing the excitatory G-protein-coupled receptor hM3Dq-mCherry under the human synapsin promoter (AAV::hSyn-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry, from here on referred as AAV::hM3Dq-mCherry) into the DG of <italic>Crlr-Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Since Shh is important for proliferation and self-renewal of NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn and Joyner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choe and Pleasure, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lai et al., 2003</xref>), we investigated whether Shh from mossy cells is involved in maintenance of NSCs after proliferation. We labeled proliferating NSCs with BrdU in the drinking water for 5 days after seizure induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Four weeks after BrdU administration, we analyzed the number of NSCs retaining BrdU, as previously addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2021</xref>). Proliferated NSCs labeled by BrdU are eliminated from the NSC pool once they differentiate into neurons, whereas NSCs that have returned to the stem cell state after proliferation will be detected as BrdU-retaining Sox2+ GFAP+ radial NSCs even 4 weeks after proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We found that seizure induction increases the number of BrdU+ Sox2+ proliferating NSCs at day 0 (last day of BrdU labeling) in both control and <italic>Shh</italic>-cKO mice compared with the no seizure condition, although it was significantly attenuated in <italic>Shh</italic>-cKO mice compared with control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). Four weeks after BrdU labeling, we found that the number of BrdU-retaining Sox2+ GFAP+ radial NSCs was increased in seizure-induced mice compared with no seizure-induced mice, as expected from the increased proliferation after seizure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, E</xref>). However, the number of BrdU-retaining Sox2+ GFAP+ radial NSCs in <italic>Shh</italic>-cKO mice was significantly reduced compared with seizure-induced control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, E</xref>). To assess the persistence of NSCs’ identity after seizure-induced proliferation, we calculated the fraction of NSCs that persist as NSCs 4 weeks after proliferation by dividing the number of BrdU-retaining Sox2+ GFAP+ radial NSCs at 4 weeks with the number of BrdU+ Sox2+ proliferating NSCs at day 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We found that the fraction of NSCs that retain stem cell identity after proliferation was comparable in control mice with and without seizure induction.

This suggests that there must be additional signaling molecules and factors inducing neurogenesis following seizures in addition to Shh. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is also upregulated after seizures and has also been suggested to be important in seizure-induced neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Madsen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mardones and Gupta, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qu et al., 2017</xref>).

Our previous findings demonstrated that activation of Wnt signaling contributes to both NSCs and intermediate progenitor expansion whereas Shh signaling activity increases NSC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choe and Pleasure, 2013</xref>). Thus, these signaling pathways may function together to induce and regulate neurogenesis following seizures, and Shh from mossy cells may contribute to proliferation of NSCs during seizure activity.</p><p>Previous research has demonstrated that mossy cell neuronal activity increases NSC proliferation through direct excitatory glutamatergic signaling onto NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yeh et al., 2018</xref>).

This raises the possibility that in addition to increasing Shh signaling activity in NSCs, Shh from mossy cells may also contribute to increasing glutamatergic signaling onto NSCs. Our results show that neurogenesis induced by mossy cell neuronal activity was compromised in <italic>Shh</italic>-cKO mice. Considering this together with our findings, this may be the result of concomitant reduction of Shh signaling activity and glutamatergic signaling onto NSCs in the absence of Shh from mossy cells. Whether Shh from mossy cells influences glutamatergic signaling to NSCs needs further investigation. However, the combination of increased Shh signaling and glutamatergic signaling activity by Shh from mossy cells may be an additional mechanism for mossy cell-mediated neurogenesis with seizures.</p><p>Previous studies indicated that NSCs in the adult DG proliferate multiple times once they are activated, and that NSCs display self-renewal through both symmetric and asymmetric cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonaguidi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bottes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2021</xref>).

However, there are several findings suggesting that Shh signaling activity is involved in symmetric self-renewal and in regulating the number of cell divisions. In vivo live imaging of NSCs in adult DG using two different <italic>Cre</italic> lines for labeling NSCs demonstrated that NSCs undergo symmetric self-renewal only at the first cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bottes et al., 2021</xref>).

In chick spinal cord development, high Shh signaling activity has been shown to increase symmetric self-renewal of neuroepithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saade et al., 2017</xref>). Although whether similar mechanism is adapted to regulate NSC proliferation in adult DG needs to be elucidated, this raises the possibility that increased Shh from mossy cells following seizures promotes the self-renewal of NSCs though symmetric cell division and contribute to maintaining the NSC pool. Furthermore, a study pulse-labeling NSCs by H2B-GFP demonstrated that NSCs in 6-month-old mice undergo a greater number of cell divisions compared with 1.5-month-old juvenile mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2021</xref>). Single-cell RNA sequencing results showed that direct Shh signaling target genes, <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic> expression are enriched in NSCs of aged mice compared to young mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, there is a possibility that Shh signaling activity is elevated in aged NSCs, which may contribute to self-renewal and increase of cell division with age. Given this, the reduced self-renewal and number of cell divisions may be a plausible explanation for the decreased ratio of NSCs that retain stem cell state in <italic>Shh</italic>-cKO mice after seizure induction and aging. Our data showed that the number of NSCs was significantly reduced in <italic>Shh</italic>-cKO aged mice, whereas it was comparable with control mice at 2 months of age. Accordingly, we found that NSCs were less likely to return to their stem cell state in aged, but not 2-month-old <italic>Shh</italic>-cKO mice. These observations suggest that Shh from mossy cells becomes especially critical for maintaining the NSC pool with age. NSC pool reduction in <italic>Shh</italic>-cKO mice may result from accumulated impairment of NSC self-renewal over time. Together, our results support the conclusion that Shh signaling activity is important for maintaining the NSC pool during both seizure and aging, and that mossy cell-derived Shh promotes long-term stem cell potency of NSCs.</p><p>Previous studies showed that mossy cells receive inputs intrinsic and extrinsic to the hippocampus and are involved in hippocampus-dependent behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azevedo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scharfman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). There is great interest in whether mossy cell-mediated neurogenesis is involved in other forms of activity that can induce neurogenesis, such as exercise and environmental enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kempermann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Praag et al., 1999b</xref>). Whether neurogenesis induced by these types of activity leads to depletion of the NSC pool requires further investigation. We believe that mossy cell-derived Shh-mediated NSC regulation provides new insight into the mechanisms regulating the maintenance of the NSC pool while also increasing neurogenesis. In addition, there is evidence that Alzheimer’s disease model mice with seizures have premature deletion of the NSC pool after increased neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings provide a potential role for Shh to prevent the depletion of NSC after seizures, in which mossy cells function as a major source of Shh in the DG. Thus, modulation of mossy cell <italic>Shh</italic> expression in neurodegenerative diseases may be a therapeutic approach for maintaining the NSC pool and preserving neurogenesis during neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings contribute important new insights to further understand how seizures and aging lead to dysregulation in NSC behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All mice used in this study were maintained on a 12-hr light/dark cycle with free access to food and water.

However, the identity and source of extrinsic signals is still incompletely understood. The work by Noguchi et al., demonstrates that Shh from mossy cells is a major source of Shh signaling after KA-mediated acute seizures. This work is interesting because mossy cells undergo hyperactivation during seizures, so this study provides a mechanistic link between mossy cell neuronal activity control of neurogenesis through Shh signaling. Weaknesses are that only male mice were analyzed in the seizure induction experiments and several control groups are missing for seizure induction, tamoxifen induction, and the DREADD experiment.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1. The study uses rigorous and specific genetic approaches (e.g., GliLacZ/+ mice; ShhEGFP-Cre/+ mice; mossy cell selective conditional Shh knockout using Crlr-Cre mice) to demonstrate Shh signaling is activated by seizures in mossy cells and contributes to aberrant neurogenesis.</p><p>2. Use of DREADDs (Crlr-Cre; hM3Dq) to show mossy cells control adult neurogenesis through Shh in an activity-dependent manner.</p><p>3. Demonstration that Shh deletion in mossy cells leads to reduction of the NSC pool uses stringent methods and analysis, including BrdU pulse-chase and co-labeling with NSC markers.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. The analysis of Shh deletion in mossy cells and influences of aging related NSC pool decline is not well connected with the rest of the study on the expression/requirement of Shh in mossy cells to regulate seizure-induced neurogenesis. To promote cohesion, the authors should examine/discuss what happens to mossy cells during aging - it is similar or different to what happens to mossy cell neuronal activity during seizures?</p><p>2. Only male mice were analyzed in the seizure induction experiments, leaving open the possibility of sex differences since previous reports suggest sex differences in adult neurogenesis.</p><p>3. Several control groups are missing:</p><p>-For seizure induction: missing vehicle (instead of no KA treatment).</p><p>-For TAM induction: missing corn oil only to check leakiness and specificity of transgene.</p><p>-For DREADD experiment: missing vehicle (to control for hM3 non-specific effects)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91263.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The mechanisms by which seizures induce neurogenesis has remained unclear. Prior work from the authors demonstrated Mossy cell expressed Shh, that altered Shh expression follows epileptic seizures, and that Shh is a neural mitogen. Here authors show that Shh from mossy cells, which are well positioned between the pyramidal and granule cell layers, are a major source of signaling after seizures, contributing to seizure-induced neurogenesis. Moreover, they find that Mossy cell-sourced Shh is required for self-renewal of NSCs even outside of the context of seizures.</p><p>SVZ Gli1 expression was detected in NSCs and Gli1 reporter activity follows kainate-induced seizures. Heterozygous Shh mice show reduced seizure induced Shh signaling and reduced neurogenesis. After localizing Shh production to Mossy cells, authors removed Shh from Mossy cells and found reduced neurogenesis. By activating mossy cells through chemogenetic DREADD, they found that the effect of mossy cells on SVZ neurogenesis is activity-dependent, that Shh signaling activity is upregulated in NSCs by mossy cell neuronal activity, and that the induction of neurogenesis by mossy cell neuronal activity is compromised in the absence of Shh from mossy cells. In a series of experiments incorporating AAV DREADD, they find that mossy cell activity can contribute to neurogenesis in contralateral DG, and that seizure induced Shh may be transported along mossy axons. To examine long-term effects, they study mice several weeks after seizure, and find that suggesting that NSCs are less likely to return to their stem cell state after seizure-induced proliferation in the absence of Shh from mossy cells, and that Shh from mossy cells contributes to persistence of the NSC state during aging.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The results are compelling and impactful, and the study is extremely well done.

The analysis of Shh deletion in mossy cells and influences of aging related NSC pool decline is not well connected with the rest of the study on the expression/requirement of Shh in mossy cells to regulate seizure-induced neurogenesis. To promote cohesion, the authors should examine/discuss what happens to mossy cells during aging - it is similar or different to what happens to mossy cell neuronal activity during seizures?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that both are similar mechanisms. Seizure induced neurogenesis increases NSC proliferation, which increases demand of Shh to increase self-renewal. Similarly, we assume that increased NSC decline in Shh cKO mice is due to the increased demand of Shh for self-renewal of NSC with aging. It has been shown that NSCs in young mice generally don’t self-renew and instead are consumed after one or two rounds of cell division. On the other hand, NSCs in old mice are known to undergo more rounds of cell division compared with younger mice. This suggests that NSCs may be more dependent on signals driving self-renewal in aged-mice. Our suggestion is that Shh from mossy cells contributes to minimising the NSC pool decline with aging, and therefore loss of Shh from mossy cells results in increased decline of the NSC pool in aged-Shh cKO mice. This aligns with our hypothesis that Shh from mossy cells contributes to maintenance of the NSC pool.</p><p>What is the exact mechanism regulating the shift of proliferation capacity of NSC with aging remains unclear and would be an interesting topic for future studies. In addition, whether mossy cell neuronal activity is decreased with age or Shh release/expression is compromised in aged animals remains to be elucidated. Considering these factors together, the brain region(s) and other factors that regulate neuronal activity of mossy cell thereby controlling Shh release and how these are dysregulated in pathological conditions and in aging will be important studies for future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Only male mice were analyzed in the seizure induction experiments, leaving open the possibility of sex differences since previous reports suggest sex differences in adult neurogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Seizure induced neurogenesis was observed in both male and female mice. Considering that, we assumed that mossy cell derived Shh regulates seizure induced neurogenesis also in female mice. However, we agree with the reviewers’ comments. We can not exclude the possibility that female mice reacts to KA or seizures differently from male mice, or that Shh from mossy cells might have distinct effects in female mice in that paradigm. It is also an interesting possibility that female specific behaviors may affect mossy cell activation and also regulate neurogenesis though Shh. Because these are large and unresolved questions, we elected to leave potential sex difference in mossy cell regulated neurogenesis for future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Several control groups are missing:</p><p>-For seizure induction: missing vehicle (instead of no KA treatment).</p><p>-For TAM induction: missing corn oil only to check leakiness and specificity of transgene.</p><p>-For DREADD experiment: missing vehicle (to control for hM3 non-specific effects)</p></disp-quote><p>About missing vehicles in KA treatments, we used saline (0.9% NaCl) as a vehicle for Kainic acid, which is commonly used as a vehicle for water soluable reagents in adult neurogenesis experiments. In addition, the average volume of KA solution that mice received intrapenitorially for seizure induction was less than 500ul, which is less than recommended maximum volume in NIH and UCSF. We have not tested if the saline injection makes a difference in our experiments but based on previous reports using saline, we believe that saline would not affect our experimental results.</p><p>About Tamoxifen injections, the Gli1-CreER mice have been widely used for fate tracing analysis including in our previous research where Gli1-CreER mice have shown specific recombination in Gli1-expressing NSCs. Our results in this study have shown consistently that Gli1-CreER;;Ai14 mice label NSCs in the dentate gyrus. Given this, we believe that our result using Gli1-CreER line are not affected by non-specific recombination without tamoxifen.</p><p>About Clozapine (CZL) injection, we decided to administer CLZ in both control and DREADD animals considering the possible side-effects of CLZ. We agree with the reviewer that our experiment cannot exclude the possibility that expression of hM3Dq affects neurogenesis without CLZ or CNO. However, although we have not included the analysis using saline as a control in our experiments, we have tested that both transgenic and virus-injected mice DREADD expressing mice respond to CLZ and activate neuronal activity of mossy cells compared with control animals. Therefore, we believe that it does not affect the interpretation of our data that mossy cell neuronal activity controls neurogenesis.</p><p>We appreciate reviewers' carefully considered comments and we will apply suggested controls to our future research.</p></body></sub-article></article>
