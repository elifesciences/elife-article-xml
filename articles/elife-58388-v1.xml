responsible for the sensation of touch and balance in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Based on a resolved cryo-EM structure, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and electrophysiological experiments to study the atomistic details of NompC gating. Our results showed that NompC could be opened by compression of the intracellular ankyrin repeat domain but not by a stretch, and a number of hydrogen bonds along the force convey pathway are important for the mechanosensitivity. Under intracellular compression, the bundled ankyrin repeat region acts like a spring with a spring constant of ~13 pN nm<sup>−1</sup> by transferring forces at a rate of ~1.8 nm ps<sup>−1</sup>. The linker helix region acts as a bridge between the ankyrin repeats and the transient receptor potential (TRP) domain, which passes on the pushing force to the TRP domain to undergo a clockwise rotation, resulting in the opening of the channel. This could be the universal gating mechanism of similar tethered mechanosensitive TRP channels, which enable cells to feel compression and shrinkage.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sensations initiate from the gating of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels, which regulate the intracellular cation concentration that triggers downstream signaling pathways (<xref

NompC is one of the earliest identified mechanosensitive ion channels belonging to the TRP family, which plays crucial roles in the sensation of light touch, hearing, balance, and locomotion of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Walker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Göpfert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zanini et al., 2018</xref>). NompC is structurally unique as it has the largest number of ankyrin repeats (ARs) among the known TRP channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Montell, 2005</xref>), 29 in total. The AR region is associated with microtubules, and it has been proposed to act as a gating spring to regulate the channel gating according to the so-called ‘tethered gating model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Although NompC orthologs have not been found in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Venkatachalam and Montell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knecht et al., 2015</xref>), it was shown to function in mechanosensation of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Danio rerio</italic> as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sidi et al., 2003</xref>). It therefore serves as a useful model for studying the molecular mechanism of the tethered mechano-gating. The cryo-EM structure of NompC has been resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jin et al., 2017</xref>), showing that four AR chains form an ~15-nm-long supercoiled helix and connect to the transmembrane (TM) pore domain via a linker helix (LH) region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The tethered NompC channel was opened by compression of the intracellular ankyrin repeat domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The simulation systems.

deform. However, what kind of forces (or what type of cell deformation) can open the NompC channel, and how the force is transduced from ARs to the TM region to finally open the pore, are still elusive. In previous studies, it has been suggested that pulling the AR spring may open the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaudet, 2008</xref>). In contrast, there are other models indicating that a pushing force may be required to open the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Howard and Bechstedt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Argudo et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the detailed gating mechanism of this unique tethered ion channel requires clarification. Additionally, the membrane surface tension-induced ion channel gating provides a mechanism by which cells can respond to volume expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martinac et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sukharev, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nomura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martinac et al., 2018</xref>). However, there is no obvious mechano-gating mechanism that can respond to cell compression or volume shrinkage. In this study, we combined molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and electrophysiological experiments to study the detailed gating mechanism of NompC. We provide a plausible push-to-open mechanism for the tethered ion channels, which may be used by cells to sense and respond to compression and shrinkage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TM pore opens under an intracellular pushing force</title><p>To study the atomistic details of how mechanical stimuli can lead to the gating of the tethered NompC channel, we used a divide-and-conquer protocol. We performed all-atom MD simulations on the transmembrane and linker helix (TM + LH) domains, and the linker helix and ankyrin repeat (LH + AR) domains of the cryo-EM NompC structure, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We considered two forms of the most essential forces on the AR helices: pulling and pushing. For the TM + LH system, we applied forces that are normal to the membrane surface on the AR29, which directly connects to the LH region, and we monitored how the TM domain responds by calculating the radius of the TM pore. We observed that the channel remains closed (with a very narrow constriction site, radius &lt;1.0 Å, around the residue I1554) throughout the simulations without any external forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), indicating that the closed-state cryo-EM structure was stable in our ‘force-free’ MD simulations. When the direction of the pulling force was away from the membrane surface, the TM channel also remained closed in our MD simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In fact, the narrow region with a radius of less than 1 Å expanded in the latter part of the trajectory compared to the ‘force-free’ simulations, indicating that the channel was actually more closed than the free NompC in our ‘pulling’ simulations. In contrast, when applying a proper pushing force (toward the membrane) on the AR29, we observed that the narrowest constriction site of the channel was significantly dilated in the latter part of the ‘pushing’ simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The above-mentioned analysis was carried out based on the all-atom structure of NompC in the MD trajectories. We also conducted pore radius analysis based only on the backbone structures, and we observed the same trend as mentioned above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), which confirmed that the pore dilation was due to the global conformational change of the backbone rather than merely a side-chain movement.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-58388-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>The transmembrane (TM) pore size evolution during the 250 ns simulation trajectories (FI0, SI0, and CI0) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>.</title><p>This video shows the TM pore size evolution during the 250 ns ‘free’, ‘pulling’, and ‘pushing’ simulations.</p></caption></media><p>The number of water molecules at the gate region should be increased when the pore is dilated, which is often viewed as an additional indicator for the channel opening.

Since the AR region is associated with microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liang et al., 2013</xref>), it is conceivable that positive pressure will result in a slight compression of the AR region and thus a pushing force on the TM domain, whereas a negative pressure will generate a slight stretch of the AR region and a pulling force on the TM domain in the cell-attached patch-clamp experiments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>, the reference <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells without NompC expressed showed no response to the positive and negative pressure stimuli, while we detected a clear electrical signal through the NompC-expressed S2 cells under positive pressure, whereas the signal under negative pressure was nearly negligible. Similarly, we can detect a clear signal through the NompC-expressed S2 cells from the outside-out patch clamp under negative pressure which corresponds to the cell-attached patch clamp under positive pressure. On the other hand, the signal under inside-out patch clamp with negative pressure was nearly negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>). The electrical signals from cell-attached patch clamp under positive pressure and outside-out patch clamp under negative pressure were nearly completely abolished after adding GdCl<sub>3</sub> (a blocker for NompC) to the bath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10</xref>), confirming that the detected signal was indeed due to the ion permeation through NompC. Our results are consistent with a previous study showing that NompC can be activated by mechanical forces, and the AR regions are crucial for the mechano-gating of NompC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, our experimental results indicated that it is the compression of the AR region and the resulted pushing force that opens the channel, which is consistent with MD simulations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Conformational changes of the TM domain associated with gating</title><p>We investigated how a pushing force from the AR region can open the TM pore by analyzing the TM + LH simulations. The free, pulling, and pushing trajectories were concatenated, and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to visualize the collective motion of the NompC pore domain. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the second PCA eigenvector can distinguish the conformations of the free, pushing, and pulling simulations very well, with the larger values corresponding to the more dilated states. We extracted the two extreme conformations along the second PCA eigenvector, and we overlaid them to visualize the most significant conformational changes of the TM domain under the three mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We observed an evident clockwise rotation (looking from the intracellular side, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) and an obvious upward tilt (looking from lateral side of membrane, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>) of the TRP domain when a pushing force was applied to the AR29.

The overlaid structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> show that the clockwise rotation of the TRP domain induced the S6 helices (which are directly linked to the TRP domain) to rotate clockwise as well, albeit to a lesser extent. The gating constriction site is located at I1554 of the S6 helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jin et al., 2017</xref>), and in our simulations, they were pulled away from the channel axis when the S6 helices rotate clockwise together with the TRP domain, leading to the dilation of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>).

We identified four stable hydrogen bonds throughout the MD simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). Three of the four hydrogen bonds can also be directly identified in the cryo-EM structure, except for the one between Q1253 and S1577, which was more stable only in the presence of a pushing force in the MD simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). These stable hydrogen bonds indicate a conservative interaction network as well as a stable local configuration during the gating process. We then did mutations on the residues forming these hydrogen bonds and performed electrophysiological experiments to determine if any of them play crucial roles in the gating of NompC. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> shows that mutations of most of the eight residues led to some loss-of-function. In the meantime, the mutants showed normal membrane targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). This indicated that most of the mutations changed the mechanosensitivity of NompC. In particular, the W1572A mutation completely abolished the gating behavior of the channel, consistent with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jin et al., 2017</xref>. Interestingly, we found that W1572 may be the rotation pivot of the TRP domain in our MD trajectory, which forms a stable hydrogen bond with the backbone of S1421 on the S4-S5 linker. This highlighted the importance of the interactions between the TRP domain and the S4-S5 linker in the gating process. Notably, this hydrogen bond does not involve the side chain of S1421, so the mutations at S1421 would not be expected to alter the above hydrogen bond and would not lead to significant loss-of-function of NompC. This was confirmed for S1421A, as shown by the dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>. In addition, the mutations S1577A and R1581A on the TRP domain, and K1244A and Q1253A on the LH domain, all resulted in significant loss-of-function, indicating the essential roles of these residues in conveying the forces from the AR region to the TRP domain. Thus, five out of seven residues, whose side chains form hydrogen bonds between the TRP and LH domains bonds as identified in our MD simulations, were crucial for the proper gating behavior of the NompC channel. The other two residues, D1236 and E1571, which are also involved in the hydrogen bonding between the TRP and LH domains, were found to be replaceable by adjacent residues in stabilizing the local conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). These data show that W1572 acts as a rotation pivot by interacting with the S4-S5 linker, while the TRP domain senses a pushing force from the LHs upon AR compression. The force was stabilized by at least four hydrogen bonds, resulting in a clockwise rotation of the TRP domain around W1572. This is consistent with previous findings that the TRP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2016</xref>), as well as the S4-S5 linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cox et al., 2019</xref>), play crucial roles in the gating of TRP or mechanosensitive channels. These results also confirm that a force/conformational change has to be transferred from the AR region to the TRP domain through the LHs when the NompC channel is opening in response to a mechanical stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mechanical properties of the AR region</title><p>To study how a pushing/pulling force is transferred to the LHs from the ARs, we performed multiple MD simulations on the truncated LH and AR domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We applied position restraints on the LHs (orange) and ran simulations with, or without, external forces applied to the terminal AR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Several mechanical properties were obtained from these simulations. First, we analyzed the reaction forces of the position restraints on the LHs, which were identical, in magnitude and direction, to the forces acting on the LHs by ARs. The analysis indicated that when pushing the four AR1 toward the membrane with a total force of 20 pN (5 pN of force on each chain), the four AR29 apply a total torque of ~13 pN·nm on the LH domain pointing to the extracellular side, in addition to a dominant pushing force. This torque would help to rotate the TRP domain clockwise and drive the channel to open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is consistent with a continuum mechanics study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Argudo et al., 2019</xref>. Second, we calculated the force constant of the AR spring by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the force we applied on AR1 and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sotomayor et al., 2005</xref>) <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the distortion of the AR region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>). The spring constant of each AR helix was estimated to be 3.3 ± 0.9 pN nm<sup>−1</sup> in the supercoiled helix bundle formed by the four AR chains. Thus, the whole AR helix bundle has a force constant of ~13 pN nm<sup>−1</sup>. For comparison, previous atomic force microscopy measurements determined a force constant of 1.87 ± 0.31 pN nm<sup>−1</sup> for a single AR chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2006</xref>), and previous steered MD (SMD) simulations obtained a value of ~4.0 pN nm<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sotomayor et al., 2005</xref>). However, our calculation was performed for the supercoiled AR helix complex, while the previous study evaluated a single 24-AR spring. For comparison, we performed SMD on a single 29-AR spring and estimated the spring constant to be 2.5 ± 0.4 pN nm<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The close agreement of the values from the single AR and one AR in the supercoiled complex indicated that the four AR helices are not tightly coupled. We also performed simulations with weaker mechanical forces, ranging from 1 to 4 pN, and the resulting average force constants were all ~3 pN nm<sup>−1</sup> for each AR chain in the helix bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, the AR supercoiled spring remained in its elastic limits in the study, although in the SMD trajectories with larger forces, the ARs showed a degree of distortion (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). Third, we analyzed how fast the forces can be transferred from the AR1 to the LH. The deviation of the directions of the forces exerted on the LH regions when the AR region was stretched or compressed occurred after about 7-8 ps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Considering that the length of the relaxed AR region is about 15 nm, we estimated that the force was transferred through the AR region at a speed of 1.8 ± 0.2 nm ps<sup>−1</sup>. A recent study showed that forces are propagated via membranes at a speed of 1.4 ± 0.5 nm ps<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aponte-Santamaría et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it appears that the force transfer speed in the tethered NompC channel is comparable to, or slightly faster, than that in the membranes.</p><media id="video5" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-58388-video5.mp4"><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>The conformational changes of the AR domain in the “free”, “pulling”, and “pushing” MD simulations as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.</title></caption></media><media id="video6" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-58388-video6.mp4"><label>Video 6.</label><caption><title>The conformational changes of the AR domain in the “free”, “pulling”, and “pushing” MD simulations, in which a 2-pN force was applied to each AR chain.</title></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Key residues at the interface between the AR and LH regions</title><p>We also found two stable hydrogen bonds between the ARs and LHs in the MD trajectories, between W1115 and D1142, and R1127 and E1163, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>).

As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, compression or shrinkage of cells can compress the AR spring, which generates a pushing force and also a torque on the TRP domain with a component pointing to the extracellular side and perpendicular to the membrane surface. The torque is generated by the specific supercoiled structure of the AR region, as demonstrated by the mechanics study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Argudo et al., 2019</xref>. This torque helps drive the TRP domain to rotate clockwise. Our simulations indicate that the pushing force alone may be sufficient to generate a clockwise motion of the TRP domain, which in turn pulls the S6 helices to open the NompC gate. Critical residues between the TRP domain and LH, including R1581, W1572, Q1253, S1577, and K1244, as well as the presence of the S4-S5 linker above the TRP domain, ensure that the TRP domain will rotate clockwise around the pivot W1572 when a pushing force is applied to the LH region. This is consistent with a study showing that a TRPV1 mutant, which has only two ARs, can be mechanically opened by a pushing force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prager-Khoutorsky et al., 2014</xref>). We believe that TRP channels similar to NompC, with a certain number of ARs, can be tethered to microtubules and use the push (-AR)-to-open mechanism to sense and respond to cell shrinkage or compression. This sensing mechanism can be complementary to the well-studied stretch(-membrane)-to-open mechanism that responds to cell expansion.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>A gating model of NompC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The compression of the ankyrin repeat (AR) region will generate a pushing force and a torque on the linker helix (LH) domain, pointing to the extracellular side.

Our analysis on MD simulation trajectories also showed that H1423 can stably interact with a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) lipid molecule. This lipid molecule was not in the interacting pocket in the initial simulation system but rapidly diffused to a location similar to that in the cryo-EM structure and acted as a bridge to link H1423 and S1268 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>).

Therefore, we conducted additional patch-clamping recordings to examine whether NompC is sensitive to the asymmetrical TM stress profile created by OAG. The experiments showed that the addition of OAG to the intracellular monolayer tends to activate NompC, while adding OAG to the extracellular monolayer had the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>). This finding was consistent with previous studies on TRPC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nikolaev et al., 2019</xref>). The unidirectional OAG-induced activation suggests a synergetic gating mechanism. Pushing the AR spring would lead to the intrinsic gating of NompC and could simultaneously generate a membrane curvature and an asymmetrical stress profile that may also facilitate the channel gating. The synergetic gating mechanism between the force-from-tether and force-from-lipids warrants future research.</p><p>Due to limitations of the simulation timescale, we were unable to observe the full gating process of the NompC. Therefore, the ion conductance in the MD simulations was smaller than the experimental results for the fully open state. Nonetheless, a clear and detailed opening trend of the channel in the presence of pushing forces was seen in the MD simulations and this was supported by electrophysiological experiments. The combination of the two methods provides a plausible ‘push-to-open’ gating model for tethered mechanosensitive ion channels.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (D. mel)</td><td valign="top">Schneider 2 (S2) cells</td><td valign="top">CCTCC (China Center for Type Culture Collection)</td><td valign="top">Serial# GDC0138</td><td valign="top">Cell species report and <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> contamination test reports provided</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti-αNOMPC-EC (polyclonoal)</td><td valign="top">Ref.

The data after a sharp change of the distance were discarded for further analysis, where the global conformation was distorted due to the strong pulling forces (gray areas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11</xref>). On the other hand, the overlaid initial and 200 ns conformations from the MD trajectories FI0, SI0, and CI0 indicated that the global conformation remains undistorted before the sharp change of distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s13">Figure 1—figure supplement 13</xref>); 950 protein structures (500 frames from FI0, the first 250 frames from SI0, and the first 200 frames from CI0) were concatenated for the PCA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of the motion of the TRP domain</title><p>The motion of the TRP domain was characterized by the tilt angle and the rotation angle. The tilt angle of the TRP domain was defined as the variation of the angle between the z-axis and the axis of the TRP domain with respect to that of the initial conformation. The rotation angle was defined as the angle between the XY-plane projection of the axis of the TRP domain with that of the initial conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analyzing the role of the AR region in the force convey</title><p>In the simulations of system II, we calculated the reaction forces of the restraint on the LH domain of each chain of the tetramer, whose average magnitude and direction should be the same as the forces exerted on LH by the ARs. After that, these forces were projected on the x-y plane and z-direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The calculation was performed from 20 to 40 ns in the trajectories CII1 and SII1, and from 50 to 100 ns in the trajectories CII8-17 and SII8-17.</p><p>For the calculation of the force constant of the ARs, the distance between the center of the LH and AR1 (the length of the AR region) was monitored in the MD trajectories. After the length of the AR region became stable, the force constant was calculated by using the formula <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> was the applied force on each chain, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> was the variation of the length of the AR region with respect to the same value in the force-free simulations.</p><p>To estimate the force transfer speed through the AR region, we analyzed how long it took for the force applied to the AR1 to impact the LH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). We generated five short trajectories (40 ps each) for the free/pushing/pulling simulations of system II with high output frequency (10 fs per frame). In the first stage of each trajectory, the force on the LH region could not be distinguished by the simulation conditions, and then, at some point, the force values on the LH domain started to deviate among the free/pushing/pulling simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, where gray areas end). This represents the forces applied to AR1 starting to impact the LH domain. With this, we estimated that the forces applied on AR1 required about 6-12 ps to arrive at the LH domain, and the speed of force transfer was estimated to be 1.8 ± 0.2 nm ps<sup>−1</sup> along the AR region.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cell lines</title><p>S2 cells were purchased from China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC), Serial number: GDC0138. The S2 cell line authentication was confirmed by COI authenticate.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Wang et al. describes a worthwhile study proposing a novel mechanism for the NompC ion channel gating by mechanical stimuli. NompC has to date been the only TRP-type ion channel that has convincingly been shown to be gated by the tethered mechanism. In this study, the authors used a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and patch clamp recording to demonstrate that NompC can only be open by application of mechanical force by pushing the bundle of ankyrin repeats outwards (with respect to the cell interior). This is consistent with what the 'rough' model of opening that Argudo et al. published in 2017 based on a combination of their continuum mechanics calculations and comparisons to the open state of the TRPV1 channel structure. The NompC ankyrin repeat bundle is proposed to act as a spring, which when pushed (compression of the spring) should cause the clockwise rotation of the pore helices and thus opening the channel. Pulling on the spring (stretching the spring) has a negligible effect on the channel opening. Simulation results are complemented by electrophysiology experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells carried out to show that positive pressure (corresponding to compression) causes channel gating, but that much less current is evoked from negative compression. The model suggested is interesting and appealing and given the rapid pace at which the mechanotransduction field is currently growing, the reviewers judges that this study will be of interest to a broad readership interested in molecular mechanobiology.</p><p>There are, however, significant scientific issues and issues of presentation that made the manuscript as presented challenging to evaluate. The reviewers have therefore listed several aspects that need to be revised before the paper can be accepted for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The majority of the conclusion stem from the interpretation of the MD simulations. The reviewers, however, expressed concern over the length and small number of repeats. Indeed, the simulations are very short for such large deformations, and the reviewers were unsure if it was possible to extract the true behavior of protein to a mechanical force on the 100 ns time scale, when the true force is applied over the microsecond to millisecond timescale. It is noteworthy that mechanical responses of proteins tend to have a huge dependence on time scale. Given the system size, the reviewers judge that it should be easy enough to double the time scale and collect many replicates to ensure that the results are robust. We note that given the issues related to presentation (see below), it is possible that the reviewers have misinterpreted the results and repeats were indeed carried out. For example, there were simulations of System I with different force constants, but those don't seem to be discussed anywhere in the text. Related to the interpretation of the MD simulations, the reviewers had the following comments:</p><p>The conformational changes observed in Figure 2b,c (and Supplemental Video S1C) are very small (especially panel c). Does this really open the channel? More analysis (with ions moving through the constriction zone for instance or water wetting/dewetting changes) must be done to support this claim. How much water is seen moving back and forth? What about free ion movement into and out of the cavity. Is unbiased ion entry to the cavity observed? Moreover, what about the local pore structure in the pushing experiment shown in Supp Video S1C really starts to open, is it side chain movement or all backbone? What are the backbone radius changes?</p><p>Figure 2d,e – is this based on gazing at the structure itself, or did were these residues identified from changes in the simulations? The authors mention that the values come from the simulations, but one wonders if they could have been guessed from the structure themselves.</p><p>Similarly, are Figure 3e residues identified from simulation or sequence gazing at the structure? Additionally, the authors state 'we found two stable hydrogen bonds between the ARs and LHs in our MD trajectories, between W1115 and D1142, and R1127 and E1163, respectively'. Cheng and Jan did not find potential hydrogen bonds directly from the atomic model of NOMPC at these two sites structure. The two pairs are either too far to establish a hydrogen bond (D1142-W1115: 5.4 Å) or on the borderline (E1163-R1127: 3.9 Å). The authors should comment on this point – perhaps this points to an important role in the simulations, but why do the simulations show h-bonding while the structure does not?</p><p>Looking at the Video S5: in all three simulations illustrated, the AR3-AR4 packing is disrupted. This is not something expected, yet it is not addressed anywhere in the manuscript and should be addressed. This will affect how the forces are transmitted through the protein.</p><p>The simulations of System II seem to suggest that pushing and pulling on AR1 while restraining the LH domain lead to the LH domain experiencing rotational forces (e.g. Figures 3b and S7). It seems like these are the forces that should be applied to System I, rather than pushing or pulling perpendicularly to the membrane plane.</p><p>The authors attempt to provide some experimental evidence that NompC is only pushed open by showing NompC failed to respond to negative pressure using cell-attached patch-clamp. However, previously the Jan lab performed the same experiment (Figure 5F, Zhang et al., Cell 2015), and their data showed NompC in fact could respond to negative pressure. The authors need to explain the inconsistency between their results and what the Jan lab has shown.</p><p>The authors state on p. 5, l. 10-102 that &quot;Previous studies have shown that the AR regions are necessary for the mechano-gating of NompC, and the force from lipids cannot open the channel in the absence of the AR region (15).&quot; However, this statement is incorrect: on p. 1401 of ref. 15, the authors of the Zhang et al., 2015 write: &quot;We wish to emphasize that while our results strongly support the notion that ARs function as a tether for mechanogating of NOMPC, our results do not exclude the potential role of interactions between NOMPC protein and the membrane lipids nearby.&quot; And indeed, in the 2017 Nature paper by Jin et al. there is evidence that His1423 in the S4-S5 linker of NompC coordinates the lipid polar head group and is required for the channel mechanosensitivity because &quot;the His1423Ala mutant is no longer responsive to mechanical stimulation&quot; (p. 2). And further on p. 4 of this paper: &quot;While it is unlikely that membrane deformation alone is the driving force in NOMPC gating, as in the case of other mechanosensitive channels such as Piezo and TRAAK channels, the proximity of a lipid molecule interacting with the functionally important His1423 at the S4-S5 linker suggests that lipid-protein interactions may have an important role in channel activity.&quot; The question is how to reconcile the views of Zhang et al., Jin et al. and the authors of this study, who seem to exclude the possibility of the bilayer involvement in NompC mechanogating? To answer this question, the reviewers have the following suggestion, which can be tested experimentally (and possibly using MD as well) by the authors of this study. Given the unidirectionality of the force causing the channel to open, it is likely that pushing the ankyrin bundle spring would locally curve the membrane bilayer. The local membrane curvature can activate a mechanosensitive channel by changing the asymmetry of the transbilayer pressure profile favouring the channel opening (Cox et al., Cell Reports 29(1): 1-12, 2019). In contrast, the force pulling on the spring would change the local membrane curvature in the opposite direction favouring the closed conformation of the channel. Given that the lipid bilayer is much more compliant compared to a membrane protein the displacement of the NompC channel with respect to the lipid bilayer by pushing the ankyrin spring could trigger the channel open conformation (Kung, Nature 436: 647-654, 2005). As shown by FE modelling (Bavi et al., Membranes 6: 14, 2016) a local curvature corresponding to a radius of less than 50 nm results in membrane tension of several mN/m, which is sufficient to open a mechanosensitive channel. The unidirectionality of the activation force reflecting the pushing vs. pulling the spring in the NompC case can be tested experimentally by inserting an amphipathic molecule, such as OAG (1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycerol), a commercially available diacylglycerol (DAG) analogue, which like other amphipathic molecules can bend the cell membrane and was shown to activate the TRPC6 channel, which could not be activated by membrane stretch (Nikolaev et al. (2019) J Cell Sci 132: jcs238360). By adding OAG into the extracellular monolayer of the membrane bilayer it may be possible to open NompC (corresponding to pushing force), whereas adding it to the intracellular monolayer (corresponding to pulling force) would not open the channel. Thus the request from the reviewers is to perform patch clamp experiments using inside-out patch configuration as described in their manuscript. By adding OAG to the extracellular monolayer of the membrane patch accessible from the bath they should be able to open the NompC channel, whereas adding OAG from the pipette they would not be able to do it. Provided the authors could demonstrate this effect of OAG on NompC gating, these experiments together with the results of their study described in this manuscript would reconcile the tethered mechanism with the force-from-lipids paradigm in the case of NompC and indicate that &quot;sharing the force&quot; between the membrane bilayer and cytoskeleton is the likely mechanism of NompC activation by mechanical force.</p><p>Relatedly, P. 10, l. 205-206: &quot;These results indicate that the interface between the AR and LH regions is also crucial for the force transduction, further confirming the tethered spring model for NompC.&quot; – Further to this statement the authors omitted to mention that His1423 residue within the S4-S5 linker was reported to be functionally important for NompC mechanosensitivity.</p><p>On P. 6, l. 125-128, the authors write: &quot;Thus, consistent with previous structural studies of TRPV1.… it is the pushing force (compression of the intracellular domain) that leads to such a collective gating motion.&quot; – This is correct. However, it does not completely explain the mechanism of opening the channel. As stated above, the force opening the channel can also result from a change in the local membrane curvature causing the channel to open given that the force pushing on the ankyrin bundle spring could generate positive curvature and consequently change asymmetry of the transbilayer pressure profile as indicated by the FE modelling study (Bavi et al., Membranes 6: 14, 2016).</p><p>Additionally, the reviewers judged that many of the conclusions are over-interpreted:</p><p>Many of the mutations resulted in non-responsive channels. These non-responsive channels could be non-responsive for many reasons, not only gating defects (e.g. folding defects). The authors need to show that the membrane localization and quantity of NompC at the membrane is not affected by the mutations at the least.</p><p>The ion conductance in the simulation being lower than experimentally measured is interpreted as the channel conformation being only &quot;partially open&quot;. But many other reasons could explain the observed conductance. Are there properties of these currents that you can extract that are not dependent on current or, more importantly, can single channel recordings be performed to confirm the impact on channel function?</p><p>Hypotheses about compensatory interactions in the hydrogen-bonding networks, etc, are presented as conclusions.</p><p>P. 9, L. 191-196: &quot;Considering the fact that the length of the relaxed AR region is about 15 nm, we estimated that the force was transferred through the AR region at a speed of 1.8 ± 0.2 nm/ps.… the force is propagated via the membrane at a speed of 1.4 ± 0.5 nm/ps (37). Therefore, it appears that the force transfer speed in the tethered NompC channel is faster than that in the membranes.&quot; This statement requires statistical testing to compare quantitatively the two speeds of force propagation. As presented here, the force propagation through AR region does not appear to be significantly faster from the force propagation via the membrane bilayer. In contrary, they seem quite comparable.</p><p>P. 11, l. 232-234: &quot;Nonetheless, a clear and detailed opening process of the channel in the presence of pushing forces was revealed by our MD simulations and validated by electrophysiological experiments.&quot; – MD simulations have not been validated experimentally because in outside-out patches CSK connections to the membrane bilayer/channels are largely disrupted, which has been shown to happen upon gigaohm seal formation (see for example Suchyna et al., Biophys J. 97(3): 738-747, 2009). Consequently, opening NompC by pushing the ankyrin spring is not the likely mechanism of the channel opening in membrane patches as suggested by the model shown in Figure 4A of the manuscript.</p><p>The reviewers identified presentation issues that obscured the message of the paper:</p><p>The methods and Table S1 indicate that three separate simulations with three different force constants were performed. But the authors do not indicate which of these simulations they used in each the figures or analyses. This lack of clarity as to which simulation is used in the analyses is pervasive throughout the manuscript, making a lot of the data difficult to interpret and evaluate. In general, all figure legends or specific mentions of simulations in the main or supplemental text should include a reference to the trajectory labels provided in Tables S1-S3.</p><p>The concatenation for PCA analysis is fine, but the data should be &quot;unconcatenated&quot; clearly in the figures. This is done in Figure 2A (although using saturation gradients to indicate progression through each of the three simulations would be useful). I.e. in Figure S3, for example, the three different simulations should clearly be demarcated.</p><p>The methods section reads more like a mixture of results and methods. The manuscript should be reorganized to separate the two. The methods are also inadequately detailed: Residue numbers should be used to indicate the residues included in various simulations, residues restrained in simulations, residue ranges used as AR1, AR29, LH, TM, etc. The published structure, 5VKQ, is missing residues 1603-1669 between the TRP box and the C-terminal helix that completes the LH domain, how was this handled in building the simulated systems?</p><p>The methods should provide enough detail that the exact full sequence of the expression vectors (including the codons used for the mutations) can be reconstructed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58388.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The majority of the conclusion stem from the interpretation of the MD simulations.

We have also revised the corresponding method section and discussed these new simulations in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to the interpretation of the MD simulations, the reviewers had the following comments:</p><p>The conformational changes observed in Figure 2b,c (and Supplemental Video S1C) are very small (especially panel c). Does this really open the channel? More analysis (with ions moving through the constriction zone for instance or water wetting/dewetting changes) must be done to support this claim. How much water is seen moving back and forth? What about free ion movement into and out of the cavity. Is unbiased ion entry to the cavity observed? Moreover, what about the local pore structure in the pushing experiment shown in Supp Video S1C really starts to open, is it side chain movement or all backbone? What are the backbone radius changes?</p></disp-quote><p>Although the conformational changes were not large enough to fully open the channel, the observation of pore dilation was consistent in all of the pushing simulations (Figure 1D and new Figure 1 —figure supplement 2C ). Following the reviewer’s instructive suggestions, we have:</p><p>1. Analyzed the water distribution around the narrowest constriction zone, and observed an evident increase of the number of water molecules in the pushing simulations (new Figure 1 —figure supplement 5 ), supporting the notion that a pushing force tends to open the gate and thereby make it easier for water molecules to move back and forth around the gate of the channel.</p><p>2. Analyzed ion movement around the gate, and observed two Na<sup>+</sup> spontaneously passing through the partially opened gate in the pushing simulations without any transmembrane potential (new new Figure 1—figure supplement 6).</p><p>3. Analyzed the backbone radius changes, which confirmed that the backbone pore was also dilated under a pushing force (new Figure 1—figure supplement 3 – 4). Thus, the observed pore dilation was not merely a side-chain movement but a global conformational change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2d,e – is this based on gazing at the structure itself, or did were these residues identified from changes in the simulations? The authors mention that the values come from the simulations, but one wonders if they could have been guessed from the structure themselves.</p><p>Similarly, are Figure 3e residues identified from simulation or sequence gazing at the structure? Additionally, the authors state 'we found two stable hydrogen bonds between the ARs and LHs in our MD trajectories, between W1115 and D1142, and R1127 and E1163, respectively'. Cheng and Jan did not find potential hydrogen bonds directly from the atomic model of NOMPC at these two sites structure. The two pairs are either too far to establish a hydrogen bond (D1142-W1115: 5.4 Å) or on the borderline (E1163-R1127: 3.9 Å). The authors should comment on this point – perhaps this points to an important role in the simulations, but why do the simulations show h-bonding while the structure does not?</p></disp-quote><p>The H-bonds shown in Figure 2D-2E and Figure 3E were identified from our MD trajectories (Supplement File 1d), most of which were also present in the cryo-EM structure. The agreement between the MD simulations and cryoEM structure was reasonable and can be viewed as cross-validation between the structure and the simulations. The exception was Q1253-S1577, which formed a hydrogen bond for ~50% of our simulation time but not in the cryo-EM structure (Supplement File 1d). It was noticeable that this H-bond was more stable when the AR region was being pushed, while less stable when the AR region was being pulled or free (Supplement File 1b ). Therefore, the formation of this pair of hydrogen bond was stabilized by the pushing force, partially explaining why it was observed in our MD simulation but not in the “force-free” cryo-EM structure.</p><p>In the meantime, it was also likely that the MD simulations optimized the local structures. As the reviewer pointed out, we also observed another two stable pairs of H-bonds in our MD simulations that were not present in the cryo-EM structure (D1142-W1115 and E1163-R1127, Figure 3E and Supplement File 1d ), and we think this was due to the fact that MD simulations can dynamically explore the free energy surface around the cryo-EM structure, and thus further optimize the local conformation of the structural model. Considering the resolution of the cryo-EM structure (3.55 Å) was not high enough to see the exact side-chain locations, it was possible that our MD simulations further optimized the model to get a better sampling of the side-chain conformations. As can be seen in the newFigure 3—figure supplement 7. , the distances between the side chains of the above two pairs of hydrogen bond-forming residues obtained from the MD simulations trajectories were closer than those in the cryo-EM structure, while the distances between the α carbon atoms were nearly identical, indicating that the differences observed in the MD simulations and cryo-EM structure were due to the side-chain movements in the simulations. As the MD simulations took into account all the atomistic interactions, including water molecules, ions, lipids, and hydrogen atoms of the protein, we believe the MD simulation result may represent a more optimized model. We have discussed this in the relevant result section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Looking at the Video S5: in all three simulations illustrated, the AR3-AR4 packing is disrupted. This is not something expected, yet it is not addressed anywhere in the manuscript and should be addressed. This will affect how the forces are transmitted through the protein.</p></disp-quote><p>This disruption of the ARs packing was probably caused by the strong and fast pulling forces applied to AR1. To validate, we performed many additional simulations with smaller forces applied to AR1 (Supplement File 1b). In the weaker-force simulations, the AR region was not disrupted, and we obtained a similar force constant of around 3 pN/nm, although with larger error bars (new Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ). We have added a new Video 6 and discussed it in the revised text. That being said, it was also possible that the disruption was due to the absence of the microtubule, which may assist to stabilize the terminal ARs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The simulations of System II seem to suggest that pushing and pulling on AR1 while restraining the LH domain lead to the LH domain experiencing rotational forces (e.g. Figures 3b and S7). It seems like these are the forces that should be applied to System I, rather than pushing or pulling perpendicularly to the membrane plane.</p></disp-quote><p>We projected the forces on the Z-axis and XY plane, and the results showed that the pushing force is still the dominant part of the mechanical stimuli appreciated by the LH domain (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). In the meantime, our results showed that a perpendicular pushing force was enough to drive the channel to open (and the TRP domain to rotate), so we mainly focused on these forces in this work.</p><p>The reviewer did raise a very interesting question, and we agree that the rotational forces on the XY plane may assist to drive the TRP domain to move clockwise. This kind of simulation is much more complicated to implement, and we may need to develop a new simulation method to systematically investigate this in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors attempt to provide some experimental evidence that NompC is only pushed open by showing NompC failed to respond to negative pressure using cell-attached patch-clamp. However, previously the Jan lab performed the same experiment (Figure5F, Zhang et al., Cell 2015), and their data showed NompC in fact could respond to negative pressure. The authors need to explain the inconsistency between their results and what the Jan lab has shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Our results of cell-attached (and inside-out) recordings were different from Zhang et al. (Ref 15, Zhang et al., Cell 2015), while our outside-out recordings showed consistent results with Zhang et al. (Ref 15, Zhang et al., Cell 2015), which confirmed that NompC can be activated by pressure (mechanical forces). We noticed that the resistance of the electrodes used by Zhang et al. was 5-7 MΩ, while ours was 12-20 MΩ. The resistance of our electrode is 2-3 times larger compared to the previous work, which might explain the different observations. In such a case, our electrodes were much thinner, meaning the patched area sucked into the electrodes in our recordings was much smaller than in the previous work. Such a big difference in the patched area may cause different physical changes of the membranes when the pressure is applied. For instance, if the patched area is large, the patched membrane may tend to bend rather than move upwards or downwards along the electrode. On the other hand, if the patched area is small, the patched area can be harder to bend, and therefore it may move upwards and downwards fiercely instead, which may cause direct compressing or stretching of the ankyrin repeat domain. Therefore, we believe our recordings with the smaller patched area may better minimize the effect of membrane curvature, and therefore better represent the effects of stretching or compressing of the ankyrin repeat domains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state on p. 5, l. 10-102 that &quot;Previous studies have shown that the AR regions are necessary for the mechano-gating of NompC, and the force from lipids cannot open the channel in the absence of the AR region (15).&quot; However, this statement is incorrect: on p. 1401 of ref. 15, the authors of the Zhang et al., 2015 write: &quot;We wish to emphasize that while our results strongly support the notion that ARs function as a tether for mechanogating of NOMPC, our results do not exclude the potential role of interactions between NOMPC protein and the membrane lipids nearby.&quot; And indeed, in the 2017 Nature paper by Jin et al. there is evidence that His1423 in the S4-S5 linker of NompC coordinates the lipid polar head group and is required for the channel mechanosensitivity because &quot;the His1423Ala mutant is no longer responsive to mechanical stimulation&quot; (p. 2). And further on p. 4 of this paper: &quot;While it is unlikely that membrane deformation alone is the driving force in NOMPC gating, as in the case of other mechanosensitive channels such as Piezo and TRAAK channels, the proximity of a lipid molecule interacting with the functionally important His1423 at the S4-S5 linker suggests that lipid-protein interactions may have an important role in channel activity.&quot; The question is how to reconcile the views of Zhang et al., Jin et al. and the authors of this study, who seem to exclude the possibility of the bilayer involvement in NompC mechanogating? To answer this question, the reviewers have the following suggestion, which can be tested experimentally (and possibly using MD as well) by the authors of this study. Given the unidirectionality of the force causing the channel to open, it is likely that pushing the ankyrin bundle spring would locally curve the membrane bilayer. The local membrane curvature can activate a mechanosensitive channel by changing the asymmetry of the transbilayer pressure profile favouring the channel opening (Cox et al., Cell Reports 29(1): 1-12, 2019). In contrast, the force pulling on the spring would change the local membrane curvature in the opposite direction favouring the closed conformation of the channel. Given that the lipid bilayer is much more compliant compared to a membrane protein the displacement of the NompC channel with respect to the lipid bilayer by pushing the ankyrin spring could trigger the channel open conformation (Kung, Nature 436: 647-654, 2005). As shown by FE modelling (Bavi et al., Membranes 6: 14, 2016) a local curvature corresponding to a radius of less than 50 nm results in membrane tension of several mN/m, which is sufficient to open a mechanosensitive channel. The unidirectionality of the activation force reflecting the pushing vs. pulling the spring in the NompC case can be tested experimentally by inserting an amphipathic molecule, such as OAG (1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol), a commercially available diacylglycerol (DAG) analogue, which like other amphipathic molecules can bend the cell membrane and was shown to activate the TRPC6 channel, which could not be activated by membrane stretch (Nikolaev et al. (2019) J Cell Sci 132: jcs238360). By adding OAG into the extracellular monolayer of the membrane bilayer it may be possible to open NompC (corresponding to pushing force), whereas adding it to the intracellular monolayer (corresponding to pulling force) would not open the channel. Thus the request from the reviewers is to perform patch clamp experiments using inside-out patch configuration as described in their manuscript. By adding OAG to the extracellular monolayer of the membrane patch accessible from the bath they should be able to open the NompC channel, whereas adding OAG from the pipette they would not be able to do it. Provided the authors could demonstrate this effect of OAG on NompC gating, these experiments together with the results of their study described in this manuscript would reconcile the tethered mechanism with the force-from-lipids paradigm in the case of NompC and indicate that &quot;sharing the force&quot; between the membrane bilayer and cytoskeleton is the likely mechanism of NompC activation by mechanical force.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this important question. We focused on the mechanical properties of NompC itself and omitted the possible effect of membrane curvature and lateral pressure changes on the gating of NompC, which was indeed flawed. Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we conducted additional patch-clamp recordings with OAG added. Our results showed that the activation was indeed unidirectional: by adding OAG to the intracellular monolayer, the NompC was more likely to be activated; while adding OAG to the extracellular monolayer showed the opposite effect (new Figure 5 E -F ). This is also consistent with the previous study on TRPC6 (Ref 41, Nikolaev et al., J Cell Sci 2019). Given both NompC and TRPC6 belonging to the TRP family, this may imply a common mechanism of the family.</p><p>We think this is also consistent with the push-to-open mechanism. Given a relaxed and planar bilayer containing NompC, pushing ARs from the intracellular side would lead to larger lateral stress in the intracellular monolayer than the extracellular monolayer. Adding OAG to the intracellular side would make the intracellular monolayer more crowded, and thus a larger lateral pressure than the extracellular monolayer as well. Therefore, adding OAG to the intracellular monolayer would generate a similar effect on the transmembrane stress profile to applying a pushing force on the AR domain toward the extracellular side. Indeed, it is possible that the pushing force would drive the pore to open and at the same time generate an asymmetry of the transbilayer stress profile that can facilitate gating. It is not clear which is more important, but it is highly likely that both effects work together to open the channel.</p><p>We have deleted the statement “the force from lipids cannot open the channel in the absence of the AR region” and edited the text accordingly. Also, we added the new experimental data as well as new text and citations in the Discussion section. We thank the reviewers very much for directing us to give a more comprehensive discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Relatedly, P. 10, l. 205-206: &quot;These results indicate that the interface between the AR and LH regions is also crucial for the force transduction, further confirming the tethered spring model for NompC.&quot; – Further to this statement the authors omitted to mention that His1423 residue within the S4-S5 linker was reported to be functionally important for NompC mechanosensitivity.</p><p>On P. 6, l. 125-128, the authors write: &quot;Thus, consistent with previous structural studies of TRPV1.… it is the pushing force (compression of the intracellular domain) that leads to such a collective gating motion.&quot; – This is correct. However, it does not completely explain the mechanism of opening the channel. As stated above, the force opening the channel can also result from a change in the local membrane curvature causing the channel to open given that the force pushing on the ankyrin bundle spring could generate positive curvature and consequently change asymmetry of the transbilayer pressure profile as indicated by the FE modelling study (Bavi et al., Membranes 6: 14, 2016).</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we further analyzed the interaction between the H1423 and lipid molecules in our MD trajectories. Indeed, it was interesting to see that H1423 can stably interact with a lipid (POPC) molecule in the simulation trajectories, and the lipid molecule was not located at the interaction site in the initial setup but diffused to the right place to act as a bridge to link H1423 and S1268 during the simulations (new Figure 5 A – D ). Therefore, it seems that lipid molecules stabilized the local structure by interacting with H1423, which may be necessary for gating. Also, as discussed above, membrane curvature-induced asymmetrical stress profile may play a role to facilitate gating, and H1423 is probably a key residue for conveying forces from lipids to the NompC channel. We have added the relevant data and rephrased the gating mechanism in the Discussion section to make it more comprehensive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the reviewers judged that many of the conclusions are over-interpreted:</p><p>Many of the mutations resulted in non-responsive channels. These non-responsive channels could be non-responsive for many reasons, not only gating defects (e.g. folding defects). The authors need to show that the membrane localization and quantity of NompC at the membrane is not affected by the mutations at the least.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We performed non-permeablized staining with an antibody targeting the pore-helix (α-NompC-EC) (same as in Ref 15, Zhang et al., Cell 2015) to quantify membranous NompC.</p><p>Our staining results showed that for the mutations that led to significant loss-of-function, there were no significant quantity decreases on membranous NompC, except for S1577A and W1572A (Figure 2—figure supplement 5. ). Notably, these two mutations led to a moderate degree of quantity decreases of membranous NompC, but complete loss-of-function in the outside-out recordings, indicating that the two mutations altered the mechnosensitivity of NompC in addition to the quantity of NompC on membranes. Therefore, the results suggested that the point mutations discussed in our work did influence the intrinsic mechanoactivity of NompC.</p><p>The other special case is S1421A. As discussed in the text for the case of S1421A, the hydrogen bonding with S1421 is on its backbone rather than side chain, so we expected that the activity of S1421A would not be significantly changed if it can still get into the membrane. Therefore, the observation that the abundance of the membranous S1421A (Figure 2—figure supplement 5. ) and the activity of S1421A (Figure 2F) both decreased was reasonable.</p><p>We have added the data in the SI and briefly discussed this in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The ion conductance in the simulation being lower than experimentally measured is interpreted as the channel conformation being only &quot;partially open&quot;.

Are there properties of these currents that you can extract that are not dependent on current or, more importantly, can single channel recordings be performed to confirm the impact on channel function?</p></disp-quote><p>We think the difference of the conductances measured from our simulations and experiments is due to the limitation of the simulation time scale, which is a common problem in the MD simulations: the full gating processes of ion channels usually occur on a time scale of millisecondwhile current MD simulations fall on the timescale of hundreds to thousands of nanoseconds, which is not long enough to obtain a fully opened structure, and therefore the ion conductance in the simulations should be lower than that in the fully open state.</p><p>Nevertheless, the trend of pore opening caused by the pushing force was very clear and well reproducible in the MD simulations, so we believe the push-to-open gating mechanism is solid; and we conducted further qualitative validations that were not dependent on the specific current values:</p><p>1. We conducted cell-attached patch-clamp experiments: from our MD simulation results, we suspected that a positive pressure would activate the NompC channel but not a negative one, and that was what we observed in the cell-attached patch-clamp experiments; adding Gd<sup>3+</sup> to the bath killed the currents (Figure 1—figure supplement 10), which further confirmed the currents were due to the ion permeation through NompC.</p><p>2. By analyzing the interaction networks in MD trajectories, we proposed several potentially important residue pairs involved in the hydrogen bonding that should be important for stabilizing the structure and mechanosensitivity of NompC, and the mutagenesis and electrophysiology experiments validated that these mutations did suppress or abolish the mechanosensitivity of the NompC channel without significantly changing their localization and abundance on membranes ( Figure 2 —figure supplement 5 and Figure 3 – —figure supplement 5).</p><p>The single-channel recordings and conductance measurements were performed thoroughly in previous studies by one of our corresponding authors and his colleagues (Ref 9, Yan et al., Nature 2013; Ref 15, Zhang et al., Cell 2015), and they obtained a single-channel conductance of ~150 pS for NompC (~10 pA under 60 mV). This was also observed in our electrophysiology experiments (Figure 5 E- F ).</p><p>Taken together, we believe that the difference of conductance values observed in the MD simulations and electrophysiology was due to the common problem of insufficient sampling of MD simulations, but our qualitative results and validations were robust to support the push-to-open gating model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Hypotheses about compensatory interactions in the hydrogen-bonding networks, etc, are presented as conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.

Therefore, it appears that the force transfer speed in the tethered NompC channel is faster than that in the membranes.&quot; This statement requires statistical testing to compare quantitatively the two speeds of force propagation.
