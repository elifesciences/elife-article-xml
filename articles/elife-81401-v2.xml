The study of both naturally acquired limited immunity and vaccine induced protection against malaria remains critical for ongoing eradication efforts. Towards this goal, we deployed a customized <italic>P. falciparum</italic> PhIP-seq T7 phage display library containing 238,068 tiled 62-amino acid peptides, covering all known coding regions, including antigenic variants, to systematically profile antibody targets in 198 Ugandan children and adults from high and moderate transmission settings. Repeat elements â short amino acid sequences repeated within a protein â were significantly enriched in antibody targets. While breadth of responses to repeat-containing peptides was twofold higher in children living in the high versus moderate exposure setting, no such differences were observed for peptides without repeats, suggesting that antibody responses to repeat-containing regions may be more exposure dependent and/or less durable in children than responses to regions without repeats. Additionally, short motifs associated with seroreactivity were extensively shared among hundreds of antigens, potentially representing cross-reactive epitopes. PfEMP1 shared motifs with the greatest number of other antigens, partly driven by the diversity of PfEMP1 sequences. These data suggest that the large number of repeat elements and potential cross-reactive epitopes found within antigenic regions of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> could contribute to the inefficient nature of malaria immunity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antibodies</kwd><kwd>phage display</kwd><kwd>repeat regions</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>antigen profiling</kwd><kwd>natural immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Biohub</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeRisi</surname><given-names>Joseph L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A1089674 (East Africa ICEMR)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenhouse</surname><given-names>Bryan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Biohub</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenhouse</surname><given-names>Bryan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI119019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenhouse</surname><given-names>Bryan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI144048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenhouse</surname><given-names>Bryan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The dominant targets of host immune response to malaria are repeat elements, which are short stretches of amino acids repeated within <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> proteins, and these are associated with short-lived and exposure-dependent antibody responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria, a disease caused by the single-celled eukaryotic parasite <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, caused an estimated 241 million cases and 627,000 deaths in 2020, mostly by the species <italic>Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum;</italic> WHO Report 2021). Various strategies have been adopted for elimination of malaria, focusing on vector control, chemoprevention and vaccines. In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) made its first recommendation for widespread use of a malaria vaccine, RTS,S. While this is an encouraging step, there is nevertheless need for improvement as the efficacy of RTS,S is only 30â40% and protection wanes in a few months despite a four-dose regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clinical Trials Partnership, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Olotu et al., 2016</xref>). To design more effective vaccines, a deeper understanding of the nature of acquired immunity to malaria is critical.</p><p>Natural protection against malaria, particularly protection from uncomplicated malaria and ability to control parasitemia, requires multiple exposures and wanes upon cessation of exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doolan et al., 2009</xref>). This naturally acquired immunity develops gradually with age and increasing cumulative exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in endemic settings, where adults may obtain substantial protection from disease, and children under 5 face the highest risk of death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doolan et al., 2009</xref>; WHO Report 2020). While a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the slow development of immunity is still lacking, certain properties of parasite antigens have been proposed to contribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Portugal et al., 2013</xref>). These include, amongst other properties, antigenic variation, antigens containing repeat elements and cross-reactive epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anders, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reeder and Brown, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schofield, 1991</xref>). While antigenic variation has been extensively studied in malaria, a systematic investigation of repeat-containing antigens and cross-reactive epitopes has been lacking.</p><p>Repeat elements are those where identical or similar motifs are repeated in tandem or with spaces within a protein. Repeat elements are widely prevalent in the proteome of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and have been described to be highly immunogenic in a few antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2017</xref>), such as the short, linear âNANPâ repeats from circumsporozoite protein (CSP) present in the RTS,S and R21 vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cockburn and Seder, 2018</xref>). Due to increased valency, epitopes in repeat elements can behave differently in comparison to the presentation of the same epitope as a single copy and have the potential to alter the nature of the resulting response. For instance, increased valency may lead to increased plasmablast formation by increasing the strength of the antigen-B-cell receptor (BCR) interaction, potentially altering the T-dependent response and inducing a T-independent response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feldmann and Easten, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">OâConnor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ochiai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schofield, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwickert et al., 2011</xref>). Although a few repeat antigens in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> have been well characterized, there has not been a comprehensive investigation of repeat elements with respect to their seroreactivity and their associations with humoral development.</p><p>The presence of biochemically similar epitopes can lead to cross-reactivity with antibodies and BCR. While non-identical repeat elements may represent such potential cross-reactive epitopes within a protein, similar epitopes may also be present across different proteins. How the quality of humoral response may be impacted by the presence of cross-reactive epitopes remains largely unexplored, although a study with viral variant antigens points to a frustrated affinity maturation process due to conflicting selection forces from variant epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). A handful of cross-reactive epitopes have been reported in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">WÃ¥hlin et al., 1992</xref>) and have been proposed to negatively impact the affinity maturation process, although direct evidence is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anders, 1986</xref>). To obtain a deeper understanding of how cross-reactive epitopes influence B cell immunity to malaria, a comprehensive atlas of cross-reactive epitopes across the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteome is first needed.</p><p>A systematic proteome-wide investigation of the humoral response to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> would provide important insights to our understanding of malaria immunity, including features such as repeat elements and cross-reactive epitopes. Specific technical challenges have impeded progress in this area. Although high-throughput approaches like protein arrays and alpha screens have reached a high coverage of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camponovo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morita et al., 2017</xref>), they do not allow for high-resolution, characterization of regions within antigenic proteins. In contrast, peptide arrays offer high-resolution antigenic profiling but are inherently limited to the numbers of targets that can be produced and printed on an array, usually in the order of tens of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaenisch et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we customized a programmable phage display system (PhIP-seq; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Larman et al., 2011</xref>), previously used for antigenic profiling in many diseases, including autoimmune disorders and viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mandel-Brehm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rajan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vazquez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zamecnik et al., 2020</xref>), for interrogation of the humoral response to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection. We designed a custom library (âFalciparomeâ) that features over 238,000 individual 62 amino acid peptides encoded in T7 Phage, tiled every 25 amino acids across all annotated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> open reading frames from 3D7/IT genomes with additional variant antigenic sequences. Importantly, PhIP-seq leverages advances in next-generation sequencing to effectively convert serological assays into digital sequence counts. Furthermore, programmable phage display allows iterative enrichment, driving a high signal to background ratio with high specificity and sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">OâDonovan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We performed PhIP-seq with the Falciparome phage library to characterize the targets of the naturally acquired antibody response to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in high-resolution, leveraging well-defined cohorts composed of 198 Ugandan children and adults from two different transmission settings and compared these to a large set of US anonymous blood donors. The resulting high-resolution atlas of seroreactive peptides suggest that antibody responses to repeat-containing regions are more exposure-dependent and/or less durable in children, compared to antibody responses to regions without repeats. Further, an extensive presence of potential cross-reactive motifs was identified among antigenic peptides from many proteins highly targeted by the immune system. These results have important implications for understanding the nature of humoral response in malaria and the future vaccine designs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>PhIP-seq was performed on plasma samples selected from two Ugandan cohorts with household level data on entomologic exposure as well as detailed individual characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). For this study, we selected a single sample from each of 200 age-stratified individuals (children aged 2â11 years and adults) from two different sites in Uganda: Tororo, a region which had very high malaria transmission at the time of sampling (annual entomological inoculation rate [EIR] - 49 infective bites per person) and Kanungu, a region of moderately high transmission (EIR - 5 infective bites per person; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kamya et al., 2015</xref>). While the majority of individuals from Tororo were positive for infection at the time of sampling, those from Kanungu were sampled at a median of 100 days after their previous infection. We have previously shown that children acquire clinical immunity to malaria more rapidly in Tororo than Kanungu, consistent with higher rates of exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rodriguez-Barraquer et al., 2018</xref>), and that adults at both sites have substantial immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rek et al., 2016</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the Ugandan cohorts.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Region</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Age group (yrs)</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">No. of people</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Proportion positive for infection at the time of sample collection</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Time since last infection (days) - <italic>median (IQR)</italic></th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Incidence of symptomatic malaria per year - <italic>median (IQR)</italic></th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Household annual EIR<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn1">*</xref> (infective bites / person) - <italic>median (IQR)</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="4"><bold>Tororo</bold></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">2â3</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">10</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0.5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">18.5 (0,85)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5.8 (2.9,7.7)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">56 (33,148)</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">4â6</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">30</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0.66</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0 (0,45)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3.6 (2.6,4.8)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">59 (38,84)</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">7â11</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">30</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0.63</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0 (0,45)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">2.3 (2,4.3)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">46 (30,110)</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">&gt;18</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">30</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0.7</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0 (0,45)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1.2 (0.9,1.6)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">49 (35,94)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="center" valign="bottom"/><td align="center" valign="bottom"/><td align="center" valign="bottom"/><td align="center" valign="bottom"/><td align="center" valign="bottom"/><td align="center" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="4"><bold>Kanungu</bold></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">2â3</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">10</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0.1</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">155 (61,190)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1.7 (0.9,2)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">4.3 (4, 14)</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">4â6</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">30</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0.2</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">114 (43,289)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1.5 (0.7, 2.3)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">7.3 (4.5, 15)</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">7â11</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">30</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0.13</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">121 (41,263)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1.5 (0.6, 2)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5.2 (4, 7)</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">&gt;18</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">30</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0.2</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">109 (38, 223)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1.1 (0.8, 1.3)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">6.8 (4.8, 15.4)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table1fn1"><label>*</label><p>EIR â Entomological Inoculation Rate.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><sec id="s2-1"><title>Falciparome library design</title><p>We constructed a T7 phage display library programmed to display the entire proteome of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in 62-amino acid peptides with 25-amino acid step size, resulting in 37-amino acid tiling, referred to as the Falciparome.

However, this whole-proteome approach also identified 952 proteins not identified in the above studies. Antigens identified in previous studies may have not been enriched here because of a known limitation of PhIP-seq â it detects predominantly linear epitopes, as opposed to conformational epitopes, which would account for loss of sensitivity with respect to particular proteins. In addition, prior studies were performed in different populations and may include false positives, for example by not using a large number of unexposed human samples to account for non-specific cross-reactivity. Furthermore, in vitro protein production for arrays may not guarantee full length, or correct folding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Expected and new relationships between age, exposure, and breadth of seroreactive regions captured at high resolution by Falciparome</title><p>Since our cohort was stratified by age and exposure, we next set out to investigate how the overall breadth of seroreactive regions varied with age and exposure. Breadth was evaluated in two ways â (i) the total number of seroreactive peptides per person (ii) the number of non-redundant seroreactive peptide groups in each person. The latter was calculated to minimize redundant counting of potential shared linear epitopes between seroreactive peptides due to the tiled nature of the library as well as common sequences across peptides (Materials and methods). Breadth increased with age in both settings, occurring more rapidly in the higher transmission setting such that children reached a similar breadth as adults by age 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>). As a result, children in the higher transmission setting had a significantly higher breadth than children in the moderate transmission setting. In contrast, adults in both settings had comparable breadth. Overall, these results are consistent with expected expansion of the repertoire of antibody targets with recurrent exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crompton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Helb et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Variant surface antigen (VSA) families are highly diverse, multi-member gene families in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> that are expressed on the surface of host erythrocytes and facilitate important functions of the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Niang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reeder and Brown, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xie et al., 2021</xref>). Expression of these genes is typically limited to one or few members of each family per parasite, presumably to evade the host immune system. Multiple variants from three VSA families were represented in the library - PfEMP1s (431 members from seven strains), RIFINs (157 3D7+118 IT), and STEVORs (32 3D7+32 IT variants), and the breadth of seroreactive variants was investigated across age and exposure based on the number of variant proteins in each family to which the VSA seroreactive peptides belonged in each person (Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2âfigure supplement 6</xref>). In the moderate transmission setting, adults had a significantly higher breadth of PfEMP1 variants recognized than children (fold increase in median breadth in adults over 4â6 and 7â11 year-old children: 1.69; KS-test p-value &lt;0.05), suggesting an age and/or cumulative exposure-dependent increase in PfEMP1 breadth in this setting, as previously observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cham et al., 2009</xref>. We note that the majority of seroreactivity in the moderate setting was present in the conserved ATS domain of PfEMP1, as opposed to the variable domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2âfigure supplement 6</xref>). Because sequences of variable domains may differ between the PhIPseq library and the parasites to which cohort members have been exposed, this may result in reduced sensitivity for these domains. On the other hand, both children and adults in this setting poorly recognized RIFINs and STEVORs.</p><p>In contrast, in the high transmission setting, children had a significantly higher breadth of variants recognized than adults for all three VSAs. Children of 2â6 years had the broadest responses to RIFINs (including in the variable V2 region) and STEVORS (fold increase in median breadth in 2- to 6-year-old children over adults for RIFINs: 17; KS-test p-value &lt;0.05, for STEVORs: 21; KS-test p-value &lt;0.05) and children of 4â11 years to PfEMP1s (including in the variable DBL domains; fold increase in median breadth in 4- to 11-year-old children over adults for PfEMP1: 2.13; KS-test p-value &lt;0.05), suggesting a decline in responses to variants as children develop into adults in this setting. This is consistent with observations from a previous study investigating antibody responses to PfEMP1 DBLÎ± domains in Papua New Guinea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barry et al., 2011</xref>). The loss of VSA breadth in adults in the high transmission setting could be due to various reasons, including a decline in antibody levels to VSA variants due to reduced antigenic exposure, as adults have a lower parasitic load than children in this setting, or a shift in the focus of the immune response to less variable targets.

This enables a comparison of repeat elements among seroreactive and non-seroreactive peptides within each protein sequence.</p><p>To accomplish this, a k-mer approach was used to characterize repeat elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, Methods). Briefly, the frequency of all biochemically similar k-mers of sizes 6-9aa (approximately the size of a linear B-cell epitope) was calculated for each protein. Then, each peptide in the protein was assigned a repeat index based on the maximum intra-protein frequency of any repeat element it encompassed. To minimize redundant representation, multiple peptides from a given protein deriving their repeat indices from the same repeat element were collapsed such that a repeat element was represented only once for each protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). In this manner, the set of all 5171 non-VSA seroreactive-peptides was collapsed based on their repeat elements to a set of 3091 non-redundant seroreactive peptides. The non-seroreactive peptides within each seroreactive protein were also collapsed similarly.</p><p>Overall, seroreactive peptides yielded significantly higher repeat indices than non-seroreactive peptides from seroreactive proteins, and this trend was more pronounced as a function of seropositivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).

These results suggest that seroreactive peptides are dominated by repeat elements and those with higher seropositivity also have progressively higher repeat indices. Examination of individual proteins, including well characterized repeat-containing antigens such as FIRA, LSA1, LSA3, MESA, and GLURP, illustrate the relationship between seropositivity and repeat index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). This relationship was consistently observed, regardless of kmer size from 6 to 9aa, and was insensitive to the level of degeneracy or biochemical similarity used for determining repeat matches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Each repeat-containing seroreactive peptide was defined by the 7-mer (repeat element) that was used to calculate its repeat index as described above. To avoid redundant counting, all repeat-containing peptides from a given protein defined by the same repeat element were collapsed and counted only once. Similar to non-repeat peptides, breadth of these peptides was higher in adults than children, reaching a similar level in both exposure settings (percent increase in median breadth in adults over 4- to 6-year-old children: moderate setting â 193%; high setting â 56%). In contrast to non-repeat peptides however, there was an exposure dependence in the responses to repeat-containing peptides with age, such that children living in the high versus moderate exposure setting had twice the breadth of repeat-containing peptides, reaching the same level in adulthood in both settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). These results were consistently observed with different thresholds for categorizing repeat-containing peptides (repeat index â¥ 4 or 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Investigation of individual repeat elements recapitulated this trend and showed higher seropositivity in the high exposure setting compared to moderate exposure in children, but not adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). There were a small number of notable exceptions, including repeat elements from PHISTc (PF3D7_0801000), LSA3 (PF3D7_0220000), and FIRA (PF3D7_0501400), none of which showed a transmission setting-dependent response in children (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p><p>Samples from the two exposure settings differed not just by exposure, but also with respect to time since most recent infection, reflecting the differing epidemiology of infection in these settings. In the moderate exposure setting, the median number of days since last infection was 100, whereas over 65% of the samples from the high exposure setting were taken during periods of active infection. The difference in seroreactivity to repeat-containing peptides observed here between the settings could therefore emerge from two related mechanisms. In the first, the difference could be driven by a requirement for a minimum level of cumulative exposure to the target repeats to generate a robust response. In the second, the antibody response to repeats may be inherently less durable, leading to rapid waning in the absence of frequent exposure. Each of these two possibilities were investigated below.</p><p>First, to determine the effect of exposure while controlling for infection status, children (ages 2â11 years) were combined to afford sufficient statistical power and were classified as actively infected or 60â120 days from infection (those infected 1â59 days prior were excluded from this analysis to look at a time point well past infection). For repeat containing peptides, breadth was significantly increased in the high exposure setting relative to moderate exposure, regardless of infection status at the time of sampling. This difference was not observed for non-repeat containing peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). These data suggest a dependency on cumulative exposure for the observed differential antibody responses in children to repeat-containing peptides relative to non-repeat peptides.</p><p>Next, durability of responses was investigated by characterizing differences in breadth with, time since last infection, in each exposure setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4</xref>). For repeat containing peptides, a significant decrease in breadth was evident between the most recent infections (0â30 days) and the longest (240â360 days) in the moderate exposure setting, while the difference in the high exposure setting between 0â30 days and 60â120 days was not significant; notably everyone in this setting was infected within the prior 120 days. No significant difference was evident for non-repeat peptides in either setting. Together, these results are consistent with the notion that the antibody response to repeat containing peptides are short lived relative to non-repeat peptides. Overall, the above data show that antibody responses to repeat-containing peptides may be less efficiently acquired and/or maintained in children than non-repeat peptides, but plateau at the same level of prevalence in adulthood.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Extensive sharing of motifs observed between seroreactive proteins, particularly the PfEMP1 family</title><p>While repeat elements within individual proteins were explored in the previous section, similar or identical motifs may also be shared among different proteins. If these motifs are a part of an epitope, then antibodies and BCR specific to a motif can potentially cross-react with the motif variants in different proteins, depending on accessibility and other factors. Identifying such shared motifs serves as the first step in exploring potential cross-reactivity between individual seroreactive proteins, and to identify them, a systematic investigation was performed.</p><p>First, enriched kmers (6â9 amino acids) were identified by collecting those present in a significantly (FDR-adjusted p-value &lt;0.001) higher number of seroreactive peptides (9927) than a random sampling (1000 iterations) of 9927 peptides from the whole library. From this collection, enriched kmers that were shared by different seroreactive proteins were identified as âinter-protein motifsâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Using a kmer size of 7, and allowing for up to two biochemically conservative substitutions, a total of 911 significantly enriched inter-protein motifs were identified, representing 509 seroreactive proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Limiting the selection of inter-protein motifs to only the most significantly enriched motif per seroreactive peptide (the motif with the lowest p-value among all motifs in each peptide) yielded 417 significant inter-protein motifs, from a similar number of proteins (507). As expected, increasing the kmer size, or further constraining the number of allowed substitutions resulted in fewer identified motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). For the subsequent analysis, we show results with a kmer size of 7, which is in the range of average length of a linear B-cell epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buus et al., 2012</xref>). As expected, previously described cross-reactive epitopes between antigens were well represented, such as the glutamate-rich motifs in Pf11-1 and Ag332 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mattei et al., 1989</xref>), among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).

The design provides for localization of seroreactive sequences to the region of overlap when considering adjacent fragments. For all except the first and last two peptides in each protein (85% of peptides in the library), the seroreactive region can theoretically be narrowed down to a 12-13aa segment within the peptide. Given that B cell linear epitopes are typically 5â12 amino acids in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buus et al., 2012</xref>), the 12-13aa mapping provides a near-epitope resolution.</p><p>To test the notion that the inter-protein motifs within each peptide are actually the elements associated with the observed seroreactivity, we leveraged the tiled peptide library design by comparing inter-protein motif carrying peptides with overlapping and adjacent peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2b</xref>). The maximum seropositivity among peptides containing an inter-protein motif was on average 54-fold higher than the maximum seropositivity among overlapping peptides not containing the motif (using a pseudo-seropositivity of 0.1% for peptides with 0% seropositivity to facilitate fold change calculation), suggesting a strong association between seroreactivity and the inter-protein motif itself, not just the whole peptide within which it resides (comparison of median seropositivity yielded a similar result). Furthermore, a similar result was observed when the same analysis was done with all the significantly enriched kmers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2c</xref>).</p><p>Then, to evaluate potential cross-reactivity, we measured the co-occurrence of reactivity to peptides containing inter-protein motifs from different proteins within the same individual. A cumulative profile was then created from the aggregation of the results across all individuals in the study, and then compared to a background distribution drawn by random sampling of peptides without inter-protein motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>). We observed that shared seroreactivity of inter-protein motifs within individuals was significantly higher than in the randomly drawn peptides lacking these motifs (KS test p-value &lt;0.01). Overall, these data suggest a possibility for cross-reactivity to these motifs within individuals. However, it is important to note that these data were derived from complex polyclonal responses in each person, and do not represent direct evaluation of the cross-reactivity of single antibodies.</p><p>On average, each inter-protein motif was shared by 3 seroreactive proteins (median = 2). Among the 509 seroreactive proteins, each of them shared inter-protein motifs with six other proteins on average (median = 3), (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Visualized as a network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), the PfEMP1 family of proteins formed a central hub to which a large number of other seroreactive proteins were connected. The PfEMP1 family of proteins possessed at least 90 shared inter-protein motifs, and this family shared those motifs with the greatest number of other seroreactive proteins (57) compared to all other proteins in this analysis. Approximately five times as many proteins shared connections with PfEMP1 than would be expected by chance (PfEMP1 shared motifs with 12â16 other proteins using a set of 9927 peptides consisting of PfEMP1 seroreactive peptides + random non-PfEMP1 peptides). Seroreactive proteins sharing motifs with PfEMP1 included many of the proteins with the highest measured seropositivity, such as RIFINs, SURFINs, FIRA, and PHISTc. This extent of sharing was driven, in part, by the number of PfEMP1 sequences included in the analysis. This was apparent when the same analysis performed with a reduced diversity of PfEMP1 sequences in the seroreactive peptide set (using PfEMP1 peptides from only PF3D7 and PFIT genomes instead of 7 genomes) resulted in PfEMP1 sharing motifs with 32 seroreactive proteins instead of 57. This suggests that the extent of sharing for PfEMP1 observed in this study may only be a small fraction of that occurring in the extensive natural diversity of PfEMP1 variants in circulating parasites.</p><p>Outside the main network driven by PfEMP1, 495 seroreactive proteins were also found to be highly connected to each other through motif sharing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6âfigure supplement 5a</xref>). A large proportion of proteins with high seropositivity were connected (80% and 58% of proteins with &gt;30% and 10â30% seropositivity, respectively). This included proteins like GARP, LSA3, Pf332, Pf11-1, and MESA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6âfigure supplement 5b</xref>). As observed for the full set of inter protein motifs, motifs shared by the subset of proteins with &gt;30% seropositivity also consisted predominantly of charged glutamate, lysine, asparagine, and aspartate residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6âfigure supplement 5b</xref>). Since the analysis used here to identify inter-protein motifs allowed only up to two conservative substitutions in 7-mer motifs, the similarity of motifs in the network in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6âfigure supplement 5b</xref> suggests that with a less stringent threshold of identifying motifs, these proteins would be even more highly connected. Moreover, 80% of proteins in this network had reported expression in the asexual blood stage of the lifecycle of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (PlasmoDB), suggesting temporally concordant presence of proteins sharing motifs within their seroreactive regions.</p><p>These results indicate that the interprotein motifs are strongly associated with seroreactivity and are extensively shared across seroreactive proteins, including among regions highly targeted by the antibodies. Furthermore, PfEMP1 shares motifs with the greatest number of other seroreactive proteins, partly driven by the sequence diversity of PfEMP1 variants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using a customized programmable phage display (PhIP-seq) library, we have evaluated the proteome-wide antigenic landscape of the malaria parasite <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, using the sera of 198 individuals living in two distinct malaria endemic areas. This approach readily identified previously known antigens, including proteins that are targets of protective antibodies, as well as novel antigens. In our study, we characterized features of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> antigens that could potentially contribute to the inefficient acquisition and maintenance of immunity to malaria. Repeat elements were found to be commonly targeted by antibodies, and had patterns of seropositivity that were less durable and more dependent on exposure than non-repeat peptides. Furthermore, extensive sharing of motifs associated with seroreactivity was observed among hundreds of parasite proteins, indicating potential for extensive cross-reactivity among antigens in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. These data suggest that repeat elementsâ a common feature of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteome, and shared motifs between antigenic proteins could have important roles in shaping the nature and development of the immune response to malaria.</p><p>To map the antigenic landscape, PhIP-seq for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> offers several attractive advantages. The library described here contains &gt;99.5% of the proteome, including variants for several antigenic families, surpassing the coverage of other existing proteome-wide tools for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camponovo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morita et al., 2017</xref>), while simultaneously providing high-resolution characterization of antigens (up to 12â13 aa regions within peptides). Unlike peptide arrays, the platform converts a proteomic assay into a genomic assay, leveraging the massive scale and low-cost nature of next-generation short-read sequencing. The result is a cost-effective and scalable system, allowing for the processing of hundreds of samples in parallel. Finally, an important aspect of all phage display systems is the ability to sequentially enrich, release phage, and repeat, thus greatly amplifying the signal to noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">OâDonovan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith and Petrenko, 1997</xref>). Only one published study to date evaluates responses to more than a quarter of the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camponovo et al., 2020</xref>), inherently limiting the scope of potential targets interrogated. Twenty-eight percent of the hits described in this study of individuals living in Tanzania and exposed to various doses of PfSpz vaccine overlapped with the hit proteins described in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camponovo et al., 2020</xref>). The limited overlap may be due to multiple factors, including differences in the characteristics of individuals sampled, the use of vaccine, and determination of seropositivity based on technical as opposed to biological controls (sera from unexposed individuals).</p><p>The near-epitope resolution provided by this platform allowed a systematic investigation of targets of antibodies. Targets with high seropositivity were observed to be significantly enriched for repeat elements. In some previous reports, the elevated antigenic potential of repeat elements has been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2017</xref>); however, the proteome-wide approach described here demonstrates that a large collection of proteins containing these elements are highly immunogenic. The high immunogenicity of repeat sequences observed here may be the result of competitive advantages that B cell clones could encounter when binding to higher valency epitopes, as opposed to single copy epitopes. Evidence from experimental inoculations of antigens with differing repeat numbers support this notion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kato et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, tandem repeat regions are predicted to be intrinsically disordered, which in turn have favorable predictions as linear B cell epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guy et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, this high immunogenicity can potentially restrict responses to other epitopes within the antigen, as has been reported for responses to protective non-repeat epitopes in the circumsporozoite protein (CSP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chatterjee et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>A key finding of this study is the difference in seroreactivity to repeat-containing peptides in children vs. other peptides, with the breadth of seroreactivity to repeat-containing peptides increasing more quickly with age in the high versus moderate exposure setting and decreasing with increase in time since infection. These results suggest that antibody responses to repeats are more likely to be exposure-dependent and/or short-lived in children than responses to non-repeats. There were a few exceptions, including repeats from FIRA, PHISTc, and LSA3, that did not show an exposure-setting dependent difference in seropositivity, suggesting that factors beyond the repeated nature of the epitope influence the nature of the response. Regardless, the predominance of repeat containing peptides in antibody targets, along with the remarkable abundance of these peptides in the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteome, suggests a possible strategy evolved by the parasite for the purpose of diverting the humoral response towards short-lived or exposure-dependent responses.</p><p>The hypothesis of less durable antibody responses to repeat antigens in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> can be reconciled with a model in which repeating epitopes favor extrafollicular B cell responses, which are typically short-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cockburn and Seder, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schofield, 1991</xref>). This is based on the potential of repeat epitopes in an antigen to interact with multiple BCRs on naive B-cells, thereby conferring high binding strength and sufficient activation to direct these cells into an early extrafollicular response and production of short-lived plasmablasts. Several studies provide support to this model, where strong binding of BCR to the antigen, including through increased valency, increases the production of plasmablasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">OâConnor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ochiai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwickert et al., 2011</xref>). This could also happen via a T-cell-independent response, as has been reported for some repeat antigenic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schofield, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schofield and Uadia, 1990</xref>). On the other hand, the effect on germinal centers (GC), which result in long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) and isotype-switched memory cells, is unclear. While some studies have reported no change or a decrease in the formation of GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">OâConnor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ochiai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paus et al., 2006</xref>) with increased strength of interaction between antigen and B-cells, some have reported an increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwickert et al., 2011</xref>), although it is unclear whether the latter were productive GCs. More insights come from a few studies that measured the outcome of GCs following increased strength of BCR-antigen interaction and these have reported a decrease in LLPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fink et al., 2007</xref>) and IgG-switched memory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pape et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>). If repeat antigens in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> follow this pattern, an expected outcome would be defective formation of LLPCs and memory B cells.</p><p>Another major finding of this study is the extensive presence of inter-protein motifs among seroreactive proteins. Since a strong association with seroreactivity was observed for these motifs and there was evidence of shared reactivity among peptides containing the motif from different proteins, they may potentially represent cross-reactive epitopes. Definitive confirmation of cross-reactivity could be demonstrated with targeted studies using monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, whether these inter-protein motifs are cross-reactive in vivo is unclear and may depend on expression timing and accessibility to the immune system, among other factors.</p><p>Analogously, seroreactive repeat elements with non-identical repeating units could represent cross-reactive epitopes within proteins. Extensive presence of potential cross-reactive epitopes in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> antigens may play an important role in influencing the quality of the immune response to malaria. While it could be advantageous for the host if multiple parasite proteins could be targeted by antibodies through cross-reactivity, simultaneous presence of cross-reactive epitopes could alternatively frustrate the affinity maturation process due to conflicting selection forces, as was observed for variant HIV antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Further, recurrent exposure may be necessary for the generation of strong cross-binding antibodies to cross-reactive epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murugan et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the extensive presence of cross-reactive epitopes, both within and between antigenic proteins in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, could represent an evolutionary strategy aimed at limiting high-affinity antibodies in favor of lower affinity, cross reactive antibodies. In essence, the large number of shared seroreactive sequences in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> may represent a complex immune counter measure, resulting in inefficient immunity acquisition which requires extensive exposure. The atlas of seroreactive repeat elements and inter-protein motifs from this study will be useful for future investigations in understanding their impact on the quality of immune response to malaria.</p><p>The PfEMP1 family shared inter-protein motifs with the greatest number of other antigens in this study. This was driven in part by the wide diversity of PfEMP1 variants, indicating that as one becomes naturally exposed to different PfEMP1 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cham et al., 2009</xref>), there may be an increase in not only the sequence diversity, but the number of cross-reactive epitopes that the immune system encounters. Possessing cross-reactive epitopes with other antigens could result in binding of pre-existing antibodies to the new variants, which could be disadvantageous to the host if binding strength is weak. Further, cross-reactivity may inhibit generation of antibodies specific to the new variant due to original antigenic sin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vatti et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the mechanism of evolving PfEMP1 variants within a network of shared sequences with other antigens could be another strategy evolved by the parasite for immune evasion. On the other hand, binding of new variants to pre-existing antibodies may be advantageous to the host if those antibodies are effective against the new variants.</p><p>While phage display of small peptides yields high-resolution discrimination of linear epitopes, this approach may not capture antibodies binding to conformational epitopes. Therefore, such epitopes are likely to be missed by this assay, although polyclonal responses are frequently a mixture of linear, partially linear, and conformational epitopes. Reassuringly, we observed a large-scale enrichment of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> peptide sequences in exposed individuals when compared with control sera from the US. This suggests that the humoral immune system of exposed individuals acquires an extensive and diverse set of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> targets, including thousands of linear sequences. The bias towards linear epitopes may have increased the relative detectability of repeat regions by this assay since they often form intrinsically disordered regions. However, that would not account for the observed differences between exposure settings for children and adults. Furthermore, antibodies that depend on epitopes with disulfide linkages and post-translational modifications for binding would likely not be enriched using phage-presented peptides. Another limitation of our study is that the PhIP-seq technique does not inherently provide quantitative measures of antibody affinity or titer, as many factors influence the actual number of reads recovered after immunoprecipitation, such as starting copy number in the library and non-specific interactions with beads. Instead, our analysis relies on per peptide relative (ratiometric) enrichments, using non-malaria control (n=86) sera as the basis for comparison, which also serves to remove non-specific enrichments. We imposed a stringent filter to minimize false positives by requiring that each seroreactive peptide be enriched in at least five Ugandan samples over control sera. While this excluded possible seroreactive peptides unique to a single sample, the resulting sequences that passed were those that exhibited a minimum level of sharing among multiple individuals, thereby enriching for those seroreactive peptides that represent common serological responses to malaria.</p><p>Findings from this study could have important implications on malaria vaccine design. Results from our study suggest that that in natural infections in children, repeat regions in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> could lead to an exposure-dependent and/or short-lived antibody response to a higher degree than for non-repeat regions. While we recognize that vaccine induced immunity is distinct from naturally acquired immunity, this potential limitation should be considered when evaluating repeat-containing antigens as vaccine targets. Further, given that highly immunogenic regions in natural immunity to malaria are predominantly repeats and there is widespread presence of potential cross-reactive epitopes across many proteins, whole-parasite vaccines may also be susceptible to similar limitations. If the findings from this study translate to vaccine-induce immune responses, non-repetitive, unique antigenic regions may be more effective targets.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BLT5403</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Novagen/EMD Millipore, T7 Select Kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 70550â3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (T7 Bacteriophage)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">T7 vector arms, Packaging extract</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Novagen/EMD Millipore, T7 Select Kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 70550â3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (T7 Bacteriophage library)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Falciparome</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Made in this study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See Materials and Methods</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (Humans)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ugandan cohort plasma</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kamya et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rek et al., 2016</xref>;

The final set of peptides was tabulated to generate counts for each peptide in each individual sample. Samples with less than 250,000 aligned reads were dropped from further analysis and any resulting samples with only one technical replicate were also dropped (2 of the 200 Ugandan samples were dropped). To keep the analysis restricted to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> peptides and limit the influence from non-<italic>P. falciparum</italic> peptides, reads mapping to all vaccine, viral and experimental control peptides were excluded from analysis. The remaining peptide counts were normalized for read depth and multiplied by 500,000, resulting in reads/500,000 total reads (RP5K) for each peptide. The null distribution for each peptide was modeled using read counts from a set of 86 plasma from the US (New York Blood Center) using a normal distribution, with the assumption that most of these individuals were likely unexposed to malaria. To avoid inflation by division, if the standard deviation of read counts of any peptide in the US samples was &lt;1, then that was set as 1. Z-score enrichments ((x-mean US)/std. dev US) were then calculated for each peptide in each sample using the US distribution and Z-score â¥ 3 in both technical replicates (or more than 75% of the replicates if there were more than two technical replicates) of a sample was used to identify enriched peptides within a given sample. To call malaria-specific peptide enrichments (âseroreactive peptidesâ), enrichment was required in a minimum of five Ugandan samples. Seropositivity for a peptide was calculated by the percent of Ugandan samples enriching for that peptide. Seropositivity for a protein was calculated by the percent of Ugandan samples enriching for any peptide within that protein.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Calculation of breadth of non-redundant peptide groups per person</title><p>Seroreactive peptides in each person were collapsed based on shared sequences (7-mer identical motifs) using the network approach described in AVARDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Monaco et al., 2021</xref>) to get a conservative estimate of the number of non-redundant peptide groups in each person.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Calculation of VSA breadth per person</title><p>VSA breadth was calculated as the number of variant proteins in each VSA family that were seroreactive in a given person and was calculated as follows. Since all these families possess conserved as well as variable regions, during library design, peptides across conserved regions from many variants that share identical sequences were filtered out to avoid redundant representation and only one representative peptide was retained in the final Falciparome library. Therefore, to accurately calculate the number of VSA proteins recognized in a person, all seroreactive VSA peptides were mapped back to the sequences from the full collection of VSA protein sequences to identify all the variant proteins each seroreactive peptide sequence mapped to. This information was then used to get the number of variant proteins reactive to a personâs plasma. Domain classification for PfEMP1s was done using the VarDom server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rask et al., 2010</xref>).

Cumulative frequency of repeats in a protein was then determined by adding the repeat counts of all reported repeats in the protein. To compare to the non-seroreactive set, the same number of proteins as the seroreactive protein set was randomly sampled from the total non-seroreactive protein set 1000 times and the distribution of cumulative frequencies between the seroreactive and non-seroreactive sets were compared using a 2-sample KS-test in each iteration.</p><p><italic>Repeat index calculation</italic> <bold>-</bold> To systematically compare the distribution of repeats between seroreactive and non-seroreactive peptides within seroreactive proteins, the following approach was adopted. Firstly, for each protein, repeats and their frequency within that protein was calculated using a k-mer approach. K-mers were fixed length sequences (6/7/8/9-aa) with any number of conservative substitutions (AG, DE, RHK, ST, NQ, LVI, YFW) and did not include polymeric stretches of single amino acids from N/Q/D/E/R/H/K. For each protein sequence, all possible kmers in the protein and their frequency (number of non-overlapping occurrences) in the protein (intra-protein repeat frequency) was calculated. Then for each peptide in the protein, all k-mers in the peptide sequence were taken and the k-mer with the highest intra-protein repeat frequency was identified. This frequency was assigned as the repeat index for the peptide. Once all peptides across all seroreactive proteins were assigned a repeat index, they were subsequently classified according to seropositivity. In each seropositivity group, since peptides from the same protein could have the same highest intra-protein repeat k-mer, to avoid redundancy of representation, peptides sharing the same highest k-mer were collapsed and counted only once. For the non-seroreactive peptide set, random sampling of peptides from all non-seroreactive peptides was performed (1000 iterations). The 2-sample KS test was then used to compare distributions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Inter-protein motif analysis</title><p>First, all motifs with wildcards (any amino acid allowed at that position) or conservative substitutions (AG, DE, RHK, ST, NQ, LVI, YFW), shared by at least two seroreactive peptides were identified using the SLiMFinder program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edwards et al., 2007</xref>), a part of the SLiMSuite package. The following parameters were used for running the program with the seroreactive peptide sequences as input: teiresias = T efilter = F blastf = F masking = F ftmask = F imask = F compmask = F metmask = F slimlen = 7 absmin = 2 absminamb = 2 slimchance = F maxwild = 1 maxseq = 10,000 walltime = 240 minocc = 0.0002 ambocc = 0.0003 wildvar = False equiv = &lt;txt file that lists the allowed conservative substitutions - AG, DE, RHK, ST, NQ, LVI, YFW&gt;.</p><p>Following this, a custom script was used to parse motifs with desired length and degeneracy threshold and identify those enriched over background. First, motifs of length K with at least N fixed positions and allowed number of conservative substitutions and wildcards were filtered depending on the degeneracy thresholds used. Motifs with homopolymeric stretches of KKKKK/ NNNNN/ EEEEE were not considered as this is a common feature in the proteome of plasmodium. Then, for each motif, the number of seroreactive peptides possessing that motif was determined (frequency in the seroreactive set). Next, enrichment in the seroreactive set over background was estimated with the following approach. Random sampling was performed on the whole library to get the same number of random peptides as seroreactive peptides (n=9927) and the occurrence frequency of each motif was calculated in the random set each time. This was bootstrapped 1000 times and this represented the background frequency of the motifs in 1000 iterations. A p-value for enrichment in the seroreactive set was then calculated using a Poisson model for the background frequency distribution. Significantly enriched ones were then identified following multiple hypothesis correction (FDR of 0.1%). This set of motifs represented the final collection of significantly enriched motifs. From this set, those that were shared by at least two seroreactive proteins were identified as inter-protein motifs. Network visualizations were performed with Cytoscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>). For the analysis on PfEMP1 with random set of peptides, all PfEMP1 peptides from the seroreactive set (n=3001) were combined with random peptides (n=6926) to a total of 9927 peptides. This was treated as the âseroreactiveâ set and a similar analysis was performed to identify significantly enriched motifs in this set.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data and sample metadata associated with this study can be accessed in the Dryad repository with the doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7272/Q69S1P9G">10.7272/Q69S1P9G</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://datadryad.org/stash/share/YuYmQNKNvrWmoMX8n99wle_2bFyrtweAGclxYPHkPjY">https://datadryad.org/stash/share/YuYmQNKNvrWmoMX8n99wle_2bFyrtweAGclxYPHkPjY</ext-link>).</p><p>The code generated for the study is on GitHub and can be accessed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/madhura-raghavan/phage-malaria-uganda200.git">https://github.com/madhura-raghavan/phage-malaria-uganda200.git</ext-link>, (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:b5eb627d24bae8bb5a30f89157db391dd95c080c;origin=https://github.com/madhura-raghavan/phage-malaria-uganda200;visit=swh:1:snp:905b76d7f2c528466e2faac9643cc288ab30115e;anchor=swh:1:rev:b49a3ec15d86048dd570b340487cee139fbeb445">swh:1:rev:b49a3ec15d86048dd570b340487cee139fbeb445</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raghavan, 2023</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Paid scientific advisor for Allen &amp; Co.

One presumes so but this can be assessed with available data.</p><p>Lines 396-479 â an extended passage is dedicated to the analysis of interprotein motifs, and their association with seroreactive proteins. The authors should analyze whether seroreactivities to different peptides containing the same/similar interprotein motif correlate or not within individuals. This would test the authors' hypothesis on L 399 &quot;If these motifs are a part of an epitope, then antibodies and B-cell receptors (BCR) specific to a motif can potentially cross-react with the motif variants in different proteins&quot;.</p><p>L 608: &quot;Another limitation of our study is that it did not provide quantitative measures of absolute antibody reactivity to individual peptides per person.&quot; This is a bit confusing, since Figure 2 âfigure supplement 2 shows that &quot;Technical replicates are well correlated&quot; for seroreactivity to individual peptides, indicating the assay is quantitative (but perhaps not for &quot;antibody reactivity&quot;, although that is the underlying selective force?). In any case, it should be possible to compare RP5K between peptides that share the same interprotein motif, assuming that these motifs represent important B cell epitopes as the authors hypothesize.</p><p>Effects of concurrent parasitemia on antibody:</p><p>Line 61: &quot;PfEMP1 shared motifs with the greatest number of other antigens&quot;. This echoes prior studies showing short-term responses against different (heterologous) PfEMP1 variants during/after infection, which is an important potential confounder in the analyses presented here. The authors should address/analyze this issue of concurrent malaria infection effects more thoroughly, otherwise, any comparison between the two cohorts is hard to interpret.</p><p>Line 174 â please clarify if there was a rationale for the different characteristics of the sample sets between the two sites â &quot;the majority of Tororo samples were positive for infection&quot;, while those in Kanungu were &quot;100 days after their last infection&quot;. This will bias any comparisons between the two cohorts. For example, Helb et al. previously observed, with sera from these same study sites, that &quot;Pf-Specific Antibody Profiles Showed Decreased Responses with Increased Days Since Infection.&quot;</p><p>Line 254 â &quot;children in the higher transmission setting had a significantly higher breadth than children in the moderate transmission setting.&quot; Here and elsewhere in the Results, the analyses could be confounded by concurrent parasitemia during sampling (which is more common in the high transmission cohort), since acute parasitemia has acute effects on antibody profiles including cross-reactive antibodies (for example, see https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15175751/). The authors should compare individuals with patent parasitemia (by microscopy), subpatent parasitemia (by PCR), and without parasitemia at the time of sample collection, to understand these potential confounding effects.</p><p>L 532-536: &quot;The difference in seroreactivity to repeat-containing peptides observed here between the [high versus moderate transmission] settings could therefore emerge from two related mechanisms. In the first, the difference could be driven by a requirement for a minimum level of cumulative exposure to the target repeats to generate a robust response. In the second, the antibody response to repeats may be inherently less durable, leading to rapid waning in the absence of frequent exposure.&quot; Please test the possibility that these differences among children are simply related to concurrent parasitemia at the time of sample collection.</p><p>Platform limitations:</p><p>Line 228 â &quot;none of the proteins expressed in the mosquito oocyst stage were identified as seroreactive&quot; Kindly clarify this statement, since for example CSP is expressed during the oocyst stage.</p><p>Line 239 â &quot;a known limitation of PhIP-seq â it detects predominantly linear epitopes&quot;. The passage including this statement may leave readers with the impression that the previous protein array studies cited here (which appear to have all used the same in vitro protein translation system) were generated using properly folded proteins with conformationally correct epitopes. However, this may be unlikely given the difficulty to express properly folded malaria antigens. Many of the antigens targeted by protective immunity are highly folded proteins and functional antibodies against these antigens are frequently conformation-dependent. As such, one might expect the PhIP-seq platform (and the other protein array platforms they cite) to perform poorly at studying such antibodies. The authors should clarify these issues a bit more as context for readers. The limitation of this PhIP approach may be indicated by &quot;Figure 2 âfigure supplement 7 Breadth of seroreactivity in the variable regions of RIFIN and PfEMP1&quot; which shows modest reactivity of adult sera to peptides of PfEMP1, whereas prior studies have established that adult sera in Africa cross-react to many/all blood-stage parasite surface variants circulating in a community (eg, see Figure 1 in https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10882604/ ), presumably reflecting seroreactivity to the immunodominant PfEMP1 proteins.</p><p>Line 267 â &quot;In the moderate transmission setting, adults had a significantly higher breadth of PfEMP1 variants recognized than children, suggesting an age and/or cumulative exposure dependent increase in PfEMP1 breadth in this setting, as previously observed in (Cham et al., 2009).&quot; Please provide numbers and results of statistical analysis to substantiate this statement. This difference looking at the figure is not striking-it appears reasonably clear for CIDR a/b/g, but less so for DBL domains.</p><p>Line 274: &quot;a decline in responses to variants as children develop into adults in this [high transmission] setting. This is consistent with observations from a previous study investigating antibody responses to PfEMP1 DBLa domains in Papua New Guinea (Barry et al., 2011)&quot;. While the results are consistent, it's worth noting that Barry used an array of in vitro translated proteins that may not be properly folded-this was never tested in Barry's study and hence would have similar limitations to the study here that uses only linear epitopes.</p><p>Figure 1: please state in the figure the total number of falciparum proteins and corresponding peptides in the library-the number 8980 stated here includes &gt;1400 non-malaria proteins (and these were apparently excluded from analysis-line 725).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, this paper was excellent. The writing was careful, and the experiment is exciting.</p><p>&quot;Slow development of immunity&quot; is a motivation described in the introduction for investigating repeat-containing elements. I would recommend adding some nuance to this description of natural immunity to avoid confusion for some readers. Immunity to severe disease in children (and in pregnancy) is acquired quite rapidly after only one or two infections. This is relevant here because it may differentiate the immunity to the types of antigens focused on in this paper from variant antigens and genes with completely different, but discrete numbers, of alleles-e.g., MSP1, EBA175, etc.</p><p>A potential major confounder in the interpretation of results indicating responses to repeat elements that are shared amongst multiple proteins is that the assay wouldn't differentiate antibodies derived from one or many of these loci. The conclusions about the importance of inter-protein repeats on immunity are based on the assumption that any signal in these regions is based on antibodies derived from those proteins, rather than Ab's to one region causing the immunoprecipitation of the others. This seems especially relevant where seroreactivity is discussed. Is it possible to look at regions adjacent to the inter-protein repeats to discern this? I understand this was done when investigating seroreactivity within proteins, but this would be to confirm signals from different proteins. If it's just that I'm missing something obvious, some discussion clarifying why this isn't a confounder would be a good addition.</p><p>I thought the focus on repeat regions was important and wonderful to see, but some comparison to polymorphic loci feels like a lost opportunity to add significant value. It would be particularly interesting to know if an immunity to repeats was anticorrelated within individuals to other loci, and how this compares across transmission intensity. For example, does high repeat-element seroreactivity stymie development of antibodies to invasion receptors?</p><p>Another potential confounder would be if the parasites in one of your cohorts was more similar to 3D7/IT than the other. This might be assessed with a PCA plot of SNPs from your NGS reads, or perhaps with MalariaGen or PlasmoDB tools comparing different locations in Uganda.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Lines 218-220: &quot;The 9,927 seroreactive peptides identified by the pipeline were derived from 1,648 parasite proteins and antigenic variants, many of which showed broad seroreactivity across pediatric and adult Ugandan samples&quot;</p><p>The 9,927 seroreactive peptides were identified from 238,068 total peptides corresponding to 4.2% of the peptides. Similarly, 1,648 seroreactive proteins were identified from 8,980 total proteins corresponding to 18.4% of the proteins. Taken together, the seropositivity in this study was lower than the previous studies using protein array and Î± screen. Please discuss why this difference has happened.</p><p>The reader of this paper will be interested in the seropositivity ranking among the top 100 proteins (not only the list of Top protein names; Supplementary table 2). Please provide the ranking of the seropositive proteins and add a discussion about the selected proteins.</p><p>As I listed in the public review 1), the phage display system is the ability to sequentially enrich and amplify the signal to noise. Although more rounds of IP definitely increase the S/N, an increased number of rounds of IP will have disadvantages such as biased results. Please add a description of why the authors defined the methods to round 2 of IP, not 1 or 3 or more.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81401.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please conduct analyses of the data stratified by BS/PCR status.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion.

We find significantly more sharing of seroreactivity to peptides with inter-protein motifs compared to peptides without inter-protein motifs, supporting the notion of cross-reactivity. Despite this association, we believe it prudent to be conservative about the conclusions, since the response of every individual is complex and polyclonal. Thus, we maintain our position that the data suggests wide-spread cross reactivity, but does not prove it. We have emphasized this point in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 396-479 â an extended passage is dedicated to the analysis of interprotein motifs, and their association with seroreactive proteins. The authors should analyze whether seroreactivities to different peptides containing the same/similar interprotein motif correlate or not within individuals. This would test the authors' hypothesis on L 399 &quot;If these motifs are a part of an epitope, then antibodies and B-cell receptors (BCR) specific to a motif can potentially cross-react with the motif variants in different proteins&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have included a new analysis to address this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L 608: &quot;Another limitation of our study is that it did not provide quantitative measures of absolute antibody reactivity to individual peptides per person.&quot; This is a bit confusing, since Figure 2 âfigure supplement 2 shows that &quot;Technical replicates are well correlated&quot; for seroreactivity to individual peptides, indicating the assay is quantitative (but perhaps not for &quot;antibody reactivity&quot;, although that is the underlying selective force?). In any case, it should be possible to compare RP5K between peptides that share the same interprotein motif, assuming that these motifs represent important B cell epitopes as the authors hypothesize.</p></disp-quote><p>While PhIPseq technical replicates are highly correlated, the assay is not considered quantitative in terms of titer or antibody affinity. As discussed in previous papers using PhIPseq ((Vazquez et al. 2020; Yuan et al. 2018), the actual number of reads recovered from an IP may vary due to many factors. This includes the starting copy number of phage targets in the library, position of the epitope in the peptide, non-specific interactions with the magnetic beads, and so on. In this work, and previous papers, the fold enrichment (by RPK) of any given peptide species is evaluated relative to the same library applied to control samples (non-malaria exposed plasma in this case), allowing a semi-quantitative, relative assessment of seroreactivity. An important aspect of this work is our inclusion of a large number (n=86) of (non-malaria) US controls, which forms the basis for measuring the relative enrichment in the Ugandan cohort. We have added a clarification in the limitations section of the discussion to hopefully avoid confusion (Lines 677-681).</p><p>As noted above, we have also included the requested analysis of per individual interprotein motif comparisons for cross-reactivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Effects of concurrent parasitemia on antibody:</p><p>Line 61: &quot;PfEMP1 shared motifs with the greatest number of other antigens&quot;. This echoes prior studies showing short-term responses against different (heterologous) PfEMP1 variants during/after infection, which is an important potential confounder in the analyses presented here. The authors should address/analyze this issue of concurrent malaria infection effects more thoroughly, otherwise, any comparison between the two cohorts is hard to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The analysis on inter-protein motifs was processed using the entire set of 9927 seroreactive peptides, regardless of cohort, to obtain a landscape of potential cross-reactive sequences. Note that the quoted statement refers to a comparison of responses to PfEMP1 to those of other, non-PfEMP1 proteins, mitigating the potential effect of broad responses to heterologous PfEMP1 variants. Therefore, the result on motif sharing with PfEMP1 only suggests that with the widely diverse PfEMP1 variants, there is a potential for cross-reactivity with different non-PfEMP1 antigens depending on the variant expressed within an individual. We claim only that the potential for cross reactivity exists, by sequence similarity alone, among the seroreactive peptide sequences. We have made the limitations of this claim clear in the discussion (Line 632-635).</p><p>We have however tested the important confounder of concurrent malaria with respect to breadth of reactivity to repeats as suggested by the reviewer, as described in the public review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 174 â please clarify if there was a rationale for the different characteristics of the sample sets between the two sites â &quot;the majority of Tororo samples were positive for infection&quot;, while those in Kanungu were &quot;100 days after their last infection&quot;.

The authors should compare individuals with patent parasitemia (by microscopy), subpatent parasitemia (by PCR), and without parasitemia at the time of sample collection, to understand these potential confounding effects.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer and described in public review, we have added new analyses with respect to current and recent parasitemia.

In the second, the antibody response to repeats may be inherently less durable, leading to rapid waning in the absence of frequent exposure.&quot; Please test the possibility that these differences among children are simply related to concurrent parasitemia at the time of sample collection.</p></disp-quote><p>This is included in our new analyses, as described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Platform limitations:</p><p>Line 228 â &quot;none of the proteins expressed in the mosquito oocyst stage were identified as seroreactive&quot; Kindly clarify this statement, since for example CSP is expressed during the oocyst stage.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct. Our original analysis was based on mass spectrometry data deposited in PlasmoDB until 2019, and using a spectral count &gt;= 2 for calling expression, CSP was not called as expressed in the oocyst stage. Since then, newer datasets have been deposited and we have re-analyzed using all the currently available datasets, and we reduced the threshold to spectral count &gt;= 1 to improve sensitivity, at the potential cost of specificity. Using this revised analysis, we now observe some oocyst sporozoite proteins (including CSP) identified in the seroreactive set. Notably though, the number of oocyst-only proteins is small, consistent with less representation of mosquito stage-specific proteins in the seroreactive set. We have updated the manuscript accordingly (lines 231-233 and Figure 2c).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 239 â &quot;a known limitation of PhIP-seq â it detects predominantly linear epitopes&quot;. The passage including this statement may leave readers with the impression that the previous protein array studies cited here (which appear to have all used the same in vitro protein translation system) were generated using properly folded proteins with conformationally correct epitopes. However, this may be unlikely given the difficulty to express properly folded malaria antigens. Many of the antigens targeted by protective immunity are highly folded proteins and functional antibodies against these antigens are frequently conformation-dependent. As such, one might expect the PhIP-seq platform (and the other protein array platforms they cite) to perform poorly at studying such antibodies. The authors should clarify these issues a bit more as context for readers. The limitation of this PhIP approach may be indicated by &quot;Figure 2 âfigure supplement 7 Breadth of seroreactivity in the variable regions of RIFIN and PfEMP1&quot; which shows modest reactivity of adult sera to peptides of PfEMP1, whereas prior studies have established that adult sera in Africa cross-react to many/all blood-stage parasite surface variants circulating in a community (eg, see Figure 1 in https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10882604/ ), presumably reflecting seroreactivity to the immunodominant PfEMP1 proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and thank the reviewer for pointing out this important point that the previous protein array studies may suffer from similar limitations of PhIP-seq in not displaying the conformations properly, especially for malaria proteins. We have modified the text to convey this point (lines 247).</p><p>With regards to PfEMP1, we acknowledge that our findings could just indicate a decrease in breadth of variant PfEMP1 recognition through linear epitopes in adults, and perhaps there is an increase in breadth of recognition through conformational epitopes that cannot be captured in our assay. This point has been added in lines 293-295.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 267 â &quot;In the moderate transmission setting, adults had a significantly higher breadth of PfEMP1 variants recognized than children, suggesting an age and/or cumulative exposure dependent increase in PfEMP1 breadth in this setting, as previously observed in (Cham et al., 2009).&quot; Please provide numbers and results of statistical analysis to substantiate this statement. This difference looking at the figure is not striking-it appears reasonably clear for CIDR a/b/g, but less so for DBL domains.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included this analysis in the Results section as suggested by the reviewer (lines 273-274) and we added additional detail to Figure 2, Supplement 6, including the ATS domain. In the moderate setting, the median number of PfEMP1 recognized in adults was 44, whereas the median in children was 26. For the moderate setting, the majority of seroreactivity was localized to the ATS domain, which is unsurprising, since this domain is conserved. The variable domains are inherently unlikely to be perfectly reflected between the PhIPseq library and the actual domains present in parasites from this cohort, which may result in less overall sensitivity in this assay. The text has been amended to clarify this point (lines 276-279).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 274: &quot;a decline in responses to variants as children develop into adults in this [high transmission] setting. This is consistent with observations from a previous study investigating antibody responses to PfEMP1 DBLa domains in Papua New Guinea (Barry et al., 2011)&quot;. While the results are consistent, it's worth noting that Barry used an array of in vitro translated proteins that may not be properly folded-this was never tested in Barry's study and hence would have similar limitations to the study here that uses only linear epitopes.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, as noted above, we have pointed out this limitation in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1: please state in the figure the total number of falciparum proteins and corresponding peptides in the library-the number 8980 stated here includes &gt;1400 non-malaria proteins (and these were apparently excluded from analysis-line 725).</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed Figure 1 now to represent the total number of malaria proteins and peptides instead of overall total and added this to the text (lines 189-190).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, this paper was excellent.

I would recommend adding some nuance to this description of natural immunity to avoid confusion for some readers. Immunity to severe disease in children (and in pregnancy) is acquired quite rapidly after only one or two infections. This is relevant here because it may differentiate the immunity to the types of antigens focused on in this paper from variant antigens and genes with completely different, but discrete numbers, of alleles-e.g., MSP1, EBA175, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We have added a modification to the Introduction, as suggested by the reviewer (lines 101-102).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A potential major confounder in the interpretation of results indicating responses to repeat elements that are shared amongst multiple proteins is that the assay wouldn't differentiate antibodies derived from one or many of these loci. The conclusions about the importance of inter-protein repeats on immunity are based on the assumption that any signal in these regions is based on antibodies derived from those proteins, rather than Ab's to one region causing the immunoprecipitation of the others. This seems especially relevant where seroreactivity is discussed. Is it possible to look at regions adjacent to the inter-protein repeats to discern this? I understand this was done when investigating seroreactivity within proteins, but this would be to confirm signals from different proteins. If it's just that I'm missing something obvious, some discussion clarifying why this isn't a confounder would be a good addition.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, thank you. There are two points here. First, we did indeed examine the regions immediately adjacent to the inter-protein repeat motifs, which is possible since our library consists of overlapping peptides, giving us an effective resolution of 12-13 amino acids (Figure 6, Supplement 2). Here, we observed that seroreactivity is indeed localized to the part of the peptide with the interprotein motif, as opposed to other parts of the peptide. Second, we have added a new analysis of cross-reactivity between shared interprotein motifs within each individual (see Lines 495-503, and response to Reviewers #1 and #2). There are limitations to this analysis, which we have made clear in the manuscript as well (Lines 632-635).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I thought the focus on repeat regions was important and wonderful to see, but some comparison to polymorphic loci feels like a lost opportunity to add significant value. It would be particularly interesting to know if an immunity to repeats was anticorrelated within individuals to other loci, and how this compares across transmission intensity. For example, does high repeat-element seroreactivity stymie development of antibodies to invasion receptors?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question, although difficult to directly address with this dataset. The question is whether repeats stymie or interfere with the development of immune responses to particular classes of proteins (like invasion proteins). As a whole, we observe more seroreactivity to both repeats and non-repeats together as a function of exposure and age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). That said, individuals vary widely with respect to seropositivity to specific repeats and non-repeats, and therefore it would require a much larger dataset to establish co-occurrence, or interference, since no two individuals are alike. This is graphically depicted in Figure 2, Supplement 2 (top panel). The Ugandan samples are clearly more correlated than the US samples, due to malaria exposure, but high correlation values between individuals are lacking. Furthermore, interference may be relieved in the form of antibody feedback â for instance, it has been shown that feedback from antibodies to the immunodominant repeat epitopes in CSP can lead to diversification of responses to subdominant epitopes in a vaccine setting (Mcnamara et al. 2020). A correlation analysis using this dataset is unlikely to capture these nuances.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81401-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>However, within proteins, it is clear that the linear peptide regions that are immuno-dominant are the repeats themselves (Figure 3, and also Figure 4), which is consistent with the notion that repeats prevent or shield against the development of seroreactivity to the non-repeat portions of the same protein. This effect has been posited in ((Schofield 1991)) and elsewhere. As weâve pointed out, one limitation on this conclusion is that PhIPseq detects largely non-conformational epitopes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another potential confounder would be if the parasites in one of your cohorts was more similar to 3D7/IT than the other.
