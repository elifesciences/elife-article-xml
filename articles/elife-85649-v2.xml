However, the genetic factors underlying this human disease remain largely unknown. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is an intricate surveillance mechanism that ensures accurate segregation of chromosomes throughout cell cycles. Once the kinetochores of chromosomes are correctly attached to bipolar spindles and the SAC is satisfied, the MAD2L1BP, best known as p31<sup>comet</sup>, binds mitosis arrest deficient 2 (MAD2) and recruits the AAA+-ATPase TRIP13 to disassemble the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), leading to the cell-cycle progression. In this study, by whole-exome sequencing (WES), we identified homozygous and compound heterozygous <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> variants in three families with female patients diagnosed with primary infertility owing to oocyte metaphase I (MI) arrest. Functional studies revealed that the protein variants resulting from the C-terminal truncation of MAD2L1BP lost their binding ability to MAD2. cRNA microinjection of full-length or truncated <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> uncovered their discordant roles in driving the extrusion of polar body 1 (PB1) in mouse oocytes. Furthermore, the patient’s oocytes carrying the mutated <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> resumed polar body extrusion (PBE) when rescued by microinjection of full-length <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> cRNAs. Together, our studies identified and characterized novel biallelic variants in <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> responsible for human oocyte maturation arrest at MI, and thus prompted new therapeutic avenues for curing female primary infertility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MAD2L1BP</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>oocyte maturation

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infertility is increasingly becoming a global health issue that affects 10% to 15% (e.g., approximately 186 million) of couples at reproductive age around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Inhorn and Patrizio, 2015</xref>). Currently, many couples benefit from assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs), such as <italic>in vitro fertilization</italic> (IVF) or <italic>intracytoplasmic sperm injection</italic> (ICSI), to have their own babies. However, among the patients seeking ART treatment in the clinic, some of the females suffer from recurrent failure even through repeated IVF/ICSI attempts. These female patients with primary infertility were most often attributed to functional deficiency in the oocytes, such as oocyte maturation arrest, premature oocyte death, fertilization failure, or preimplantation embryonic arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sang et al., 2021</xref>). Oocyte maturation is referred to as meiotic resumption of oocytes from the germinal vesicle (GV) to the metaphase II (MII) stage in vivo or in vitro, whereby the oocytes acquire the developmental competence. In the clinic, oocyte maturation arrest is characterized by the frequent occurrence of oocytes mostly or entirely arrested at the GV or metaphase I (MI) stage, representing a rare but highly challenging disease for treatment through traditional ART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mehlmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mrazek and Fulka, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beall et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the male germline, female germ cells initiate meiosis very early during embryonic development once primordial germ cells transit and colonize the genital ridge in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hilscher et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McLaren, 2003</xref>). Nonetheless, following the synapsis and recombination between homologous chromosomes, meiotic progression ceases in the embryonic gonad, and the oocytes remain arrested at the diplotene stage in meiotic prophase I during postnatal oocyte growth in growing follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McLaren, 2003</xref>). After birth, a limited number of primordial follicles are activated and recruited from the primordial follicle pool to develop sequentially into primary follicles, secondary follicles, and antral follicles. This process is concurrent with the oocyte cytoplasmic and meiotic maturation process whereby the oocytes continuously grow with increased size and acquire the ability to resume meiotic division upon luteinizing hormone surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mehlmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2004</xref>). The fully grown oocyte is morphologically characterized by the appearance of GV, representative of the oocyte nucleus with a bulgy nucleolus that can be readily identified under phase-contrast microscopy. Morphologically, meiotic resumption is characterized by chromatin condensation and the dissolution of nuclear membranes, termed ‘GV breakdown’ (GVBD). This is followed by the cell-cycle progression to MI and subsequent extrusion of the first polar body (PB1), culminating in MII arrest, which is ready for fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mihajlović and FitzHarris, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adhikari and Liu, 2014</xref>). This prolonged meiotic prophase I arrest at diplotene stage in conjunction with the discontinuous, hormone-triggered progression to MII stage in oocytes is highly genetically regulated and spatiotemporally coordinated. In agreement with this conclusion, numerous genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) have uncovered the genetic factors that are required to drive accurate and timely meiotic progression. For instance, genetic ablation of <italic>Marf1</italic>, <italic>Cdc25b,</italic> or <italic>Pde3a</italic> led to GV arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Su et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lincoln et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Masciarelli et al., 2004</xref>), while deletion of <italic>Ccnb3</italic>, <italic>Cks2</italic>, or <italic>Mlh1</italic> caused MI arrest in mouse oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karasu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Spruck et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Woods et al., 1999</xref>). Occasionally, genetic abrogation can cause a mixed phenotype. For example, mouse oocytes deficient in <italic>Mlh3</italic> arrested at both the MI and MII stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lipkin et al., 2002</xref>), whereas <italic>Ubb</italic>-null oocytes ceased at both the GV and MI stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ryu et al., 2008</xref>). Although these mouse genetic models provide insightful mechanisms underlying oocyte meiosis, the causative deleterious variants responsible for oocyte maturation arrest resulting in human infertility remain scarce. Until recently, only a limited number of protein-coding variants have been discovered to account for human oocyte maturation arrest, including <italic>TUBB8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2016</xref>) (MIM: 616768), <italic>PATL2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maddirevula et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2018</xref>) (MIM:614661), and <italic>TRIP13</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) (MIM: 604507). However, mutations in these genes can only account for a very small proportion (&lt;30%) of patients with this syndrome, and the deleterious causative variants in most cases remain largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maddirevula et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christou-Kent et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, there is an urgent need to screen the causal factors among the female patients suffering from recurrent reproductive failure for better genetic diagnosis and treatment in the future.</p><p>MAD2(MAD2L1) is a key component of mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). MAD2L1-binding protein (MAD2L1BP) (MIM: 618136), also called p31<sup>comet</sup>, mimicking the structure of mitosis arrest deficient 2 (MAD2), physically interacts with MAD2 through a conformation-specific binding and it functions as an adapter between MAD2 and TRIP13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alfieri et al., 2018</xref>). In mitosis, timely disassembly of the MCC and hence the silencing of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) rely on the joint action of both p31<sup>comet</sup> and TRIP13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alfieri et al., 2018</xref>). Whole-body p31<sup>comet</sup> knockout mice die soon after birth and have reduced hepatic glycogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2016</xref>). In rice, P31<sup>comet</sup> plays an important role in meiosis. The P31<sup>comet</sup> mutant rice was normal in vegetative growth but showed complete sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ji et al., 2016</xref>). However, whether the p31<sup>comet</sup> protein plays any role in meiosis in mammals remains unknown. In this study, we identified homozygous and compound heterozygous <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> variants in three families with female patients diagnosed with primary infertility owing to oocyte MI arrest. Our findings suggest that biallelic <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> variants contribute to oocyte MI arrest in women with primary infertility, and p31<sup>comet</sup> is required for human oocyte maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of biallelic variants in <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> underlying human oocyte maturation arrest at the MI stage</title><p>A cohort of 50 female patients with primary infertility displaying the oocyte maturation arrest at the MI stage was recruited from the Reproductive Center of the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC (University of Science and Technology of China) and the Reproductive Hospital at Shandong University between July 2014 and October 2021.

The oocytes and blood samples were donated by individuals who had provided the written, informed consent paperwork.

Her younger brother (F1: II-2), 22 years of age, carried the same homozygous mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Further Sanger sequencing after PCR amplification confirmed that their consanguineous parents were both heterozygous for this mutation. The second patient was diagnosed with primary infertility with no history of consanguinity. She had gone through one cycle of IVF, and all nine collected oocytes were arrested at MI (F2: II-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). A heterozygous frameshift mutation c.518delT [p.F173Sfs4*] in <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> was uncovered by WES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>,<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), which was inherited from her mother. Subsequent Sanger sequencing of ~200 bp intron-flanking sequences of <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> validated a heterozygous intronic variant c.21–94G&gt;A in the patient (F2: II-1), which was transmitted from her father (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). In the third family, the female patient had a total of five superovulated oocytes all arrested at MI after two unsuccessful cycles of IVF. WES and subsequent PCR sequencing revealed a homozygous mutation c.541C&gt;T [p.R181*] in <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This mutation was inherited from her parents respectively and likely resulted in the production of a much shorter C-terminally truncated MAD2L1BP protein compared with p.R285* variant from the first patient (F1: II-1).</p><p>The nonsense variants p.R285* and p.R181* occurred at low allele frequencies (3/248598 and 2/250850, respectively) in the gnomAD browser, and the frameshift mutation p.F173Sfs4* was not found in the database (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). However, the intronic variant c.21-94G&gt;A (rs142226267) had an allele frequency of 111/31250 and homozygote frequency of 2/31250 in the gnomAD browser, which was initially filtered out through the WES analysis pipeline but subsequently reconsidered for further evaluation of its pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). The nonsense variants p.R285* and p.R181* and the frameshift mutation p.F173Sfs4* gave rise to a premature termination codon (PTC) in the resultant <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> mRNA. For the intronic variant c.21-94G&gt;A, it was predicted to be a cryptic splicing acceptor site of exon 2 by NNsplice and ASSP, presumably leading to aberrant splicing of Exon 2 with additional intronic sequences resulting in a PTC introduction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>C-terminal truncation of MAD2L1BP abolished its interaction with MAD2, a key kinetochore protein</title><p>MAD2L1BP is a relatively small-sized protein consisting of only 306 amino acids, which are highly evolutionarily conserved across metazoan species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, there is a shorter isoform that differs exclusively at the N-terminus compared to the longer isoform in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). By analyzing the published RNA-seq databases, we found that <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> mRNAs are highly abundant in both human and mouse oocytes, especially those at advanced stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicative of an important role of MAD2L1BP in oocyte meiotic maturation in mammals. To determine whether those variants impact <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> mRNA expression, we next designed quantitative PCR (qPCR) primers against <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> mRNAs. We discovered that p.R285* mutation did not affect the expression levels of <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> mRNAs in the first patient (F1: II-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), thus possibly producing a truncated MAD2L1BP protein loss of C-terminal 22 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the second patient carrying the compound heterozygous variants, the p.F173Sfs4* mutation would elicit frameshift reading causing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or generate a much shorter C-terminally truncated MAD2L1BP protein. To investigate whether the c.21-94G&gt;A (rs142226267) variant affects splicing of <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> mRNA, we initially tried the cDNA amplification using total RNA extracted from the patient’s peripheral blood sample. However, we failed to amplify the predicted bands after several rounds of attempts by optimization of the primer designs and PCR conditions, presumably owing to the extremely low abundance of aberrant <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> mRNA in the blood (<italic>data not shown</italic>). Therefore, we next conducted an in vitro splicing assay by synthesizing a plasmid that comprised the Exon 1, Exon 2, and Exon 3 as well as the flanking intronic sequences in the <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> gene. Not surprisingly, the aberrant splicing around Exon 2 was repeatedly observed by sequencing the transcribed spliced mRNA product after transfection into 293T cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In support of this finding, the qPCR assay validated that the <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> mRNA levels were significantly reduced in the blood from the second patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We were unable to quantitatively measure the effect of p.R181* mutation on <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> mRNA expression in the third patient owing to the unavailability of blood samples. However, the p.R181* mutation would only be possible to generate a much shorter MAD2L1BP protein than p.R285* variant in the first patient (F1: II-1), leading to a complete loss of 126 amino acids at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Adverse impacts of <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> variants on mRNA expression and protein function.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays comparing the mRNA expression levels of <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> in peripheral blood samples from Family 1 and Family 2 as indicated.

MAD2L1BP has been shown to act as an adaptor that tightly binds MAD2 and recruits TRIP13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alfieri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brulotte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ma and Poon, 2016</xref>). At the protein level, MAD2L1BP harbors highly conserved central ‘α-helix’- and flanked ‘β-sheet’-organized domains, which structurally mimick MAD2 and physically interact with each other in vivo at the MAD2 dimerization interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2F</xref>).

MAD2 is a core member of the MCC, which is timely assembled and disassembled through the conformational transition of ‘O-MAD2’ to ‘C-MAD2’ via a ‘MAD2 template’ model throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Antoni et al., 2005</xref>). The disassembly of the MCC machinery is predominantly achieved through MAD2L1BP, which acts as an adaptor that binds MAD2 and recruits ATPase TRIP13 to the MCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alfieri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ma and Poon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Compelling studies have shown that MAD2 overexpression or deficient TRIP13 rendered oocyte meiotic arrest in both mice and humans, suggesting an indispensable role of MAD2-MAD2L1BP-TRIP13 signaling in driving meiotic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wassmann et al., 2003</xref>). We therefore subsequently carried out co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays using Myc-tagged MAD2 plasmid, and Flag-tagged wild-type (WT) and p.R285* mutated MAD2L1BP constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D</xref>). Not surprisingly, while the Flag-tagged WT MAD2L1BP could strongly pull down the full-length MAD2 as judged by Co-IP, the loss of 22 aa in MAD2L1BP at the C-terminus completely abolished its binding to MAD2, suggesting an essential function of the C-terminal 22 aa in stabilizing the binding of MAD2L1BP to MAD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In support of this finding, the resolved crystal structure of MAD2L1BP (PDB: 2QYF) showed that its C-terminal 22 residues fold into the β9 and β10 strands, which are in charge of the physical interaction between MAD2L1BP and MAD2 like a seatbelt essential for the conformational stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2F</xref>).

A quantitative comparison from the time-lapse imaging experiments revealed that microinjection of the WT <italic>Mad2l1bp</italic> cRNAs accelerated the polar body extrusion (PBE) by ~3 hr as compared with those in the control groups (non-injected or GFP cRNA group), although the resultant percentages of oocytes with PBE were comparable among WT <italic>Mad2l1bp</italic> and control groups (~80%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>).

To this end, we carried out an optimized single-cell SMART-seq2 in duplicates using two frozen MI oocytes from healthy female donors and two remaining frozen MI oocytes from the first patient (F1: II-1).

Genetic mouse models have shown that Mad2 is the core player of SAC signaling – inactivation of Mad2 caused the accelerated mitotic exit whereas overexpression of Mad2 induced precocious activation of SAC in somatic cells and meiotic MI arrest in oocytes, suggesting MAD2 is functional and required for normal oocyte meiotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wassmann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Niault et al., 2007</xref>). Once the kinetochore-spindle attachment is satisfactorily achieved, the inhibitory signaling from the SAC must be timely quenched to allow anaphase progression. This is primarily achieved through MAD2 recognition by MAD2L1BP, which further recruits AAA+ATPase, TRIP13, that binds and subsequently dissembles the MCC in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alfieri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brulotte et al., 2017</xref>). Conversely, deficient SAC disassembly, for example, <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> mutations in this study, disrupts the MAD2•MAD2L1BP(p31<sup>comet</sup>)•TRIP13 axis, leading to sustained SAC activation and consequently the oocyte maturation arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lower panel).</p><p>Intriguingly, recent studies have identified pathogenic biallelic variants in <italic>TRIP13</italic> causing female primary infertility owing to the oocyte maturation arrest predominantly at MI stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, a spectrum of deleterious variants in <italic>CDC20</italic>, the core component of MCC, have also been discovered, that account for human oocyte meiotic arrest and early embryonic failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report that identified and characterized causative <italic>loss-of-function</italic> variants in <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> underlying human oocyte maturation arrest. Consistent with the abnormalities in <italic>MAD2L1BP-</italic>null oocyte meiotic division, <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> KO cells exhibited mitotic delay and lagging chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ma and Poon, 2016</xref>), but some of them managed to reinitiate cell cycle, which is distinct from the complete arrest in the mutant oocytes. Notably, the younger brother of the female patient from Family 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) was also infertile. The significantly declined number and the aberrant morphology of the sperm retrieved appear to implicate that there might be a meiotic disruption in this male patient. Unfortunately, after multiple attempts, we were not able to obtain a testicular biopsy for further pathological analysis. Hence, further exploration of the roles of MAD2L1BP variants in the male meiosis would be an interesting direction in the future.</p><p>Moreover, in order to recapitulate the deleterious effect of the human <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> variants in mice, we have attempted to generate the knock-in (KI) mouse model that mimic the equivalent human mutations. However, <italic>Mad2l1bp-</italic>deficient mice died perinatally owing to the neonatal hypoglycemia resulting from the liver glycogen shortage, rendering us fail to get the homozygous KI offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, with a small-scale cohort of genetic screening in 50 oocyte MI-arrested patients, our study adds novel pathogenic variants of <italic>MAD2L1BP</italic> to the genetic mutational spectrum underlying human oocyte maturation arrest, and likely provides novel diagnostic and therapeutic avenues for primary female infertility in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DH5α competent <italic>E. coli</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat # 18265017</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293T cells</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat # CRL-3216;<break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Medium: DMEM+10% FBS</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pcDNA3.1-human MAD2L1BP isoform1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pcDNA3.1-hMAD2L1BP iso1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Synthesized from Genewiz.

The concentration of all injected RNAs was adjusted to 1200 ng/μl. After injection, oocytes were washed and cultured in M16 medium at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Chromosome spreading and immunofluorescence</title><p>ZP-free oocytes were fixed in a solution containing 1% paraformaldehyde, 0.15% Triton X-100, and 3 mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich) on glass slides for 30 min. After fixation, slides were air-dried. To perform immunofluorescence analysis of dispersed chromosomes, slides were blocked with 1% BSA and then incubated for 1 hr with primary antibodies. After rinsing three times, slides were incubated with secondary antibodies for 45 min, followed by DAPI staining. Slides were then mounted and examined with a Leica THUNDER Imager Live Cell with a K5 camera driven by the Leica Application Suite Software. Image processing was performed by ImageJ software. See antibodies information in Key resources table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Single-cell SMART-seq2 for RNA-seq library preparation</title><p>The single-oocyte SMART-seq2 protocol was based on the well-established SMART-seq2 protocol with in-house optimized modifications as indicated below. In brief, MI oocytes retrieved from healthy control or the first patient (F1: II-1) were washed at least five times in 1×PBS, and directly lysed in Lysis Buffer MasterMix (0.3% Triton X-100, 40 U/µl RNase inhibitor, 2.5 µM oligodT30VN, and 2.5 µM dNTP mix). The oocyte lysis mixture was allowed to undergo at least one freeze-thaw cycle at –80°C to facilitate complete cytosolic lysis. The first strand cDNA synthesis was performed at 50°C for 60 min, followed by 16 cycles of PCR preamplification to achieve the full-length cDNA products through ISPCR primer-mediated semi-suppressive PCR. Fifty ng of size-selected full-length cDNAs was used for Tn5-guided library preparation using Hieff NGS Fast Tagment DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (Yeasen, 12207ES24). Final dual-barcoded libraries were achieved through PCR amplification for nine cycles with both index i5 and i7 primers prior to pooled library sequencing on the NovaSeq 6000 platform with PE150 mode (Novagene).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>RNA-seq data analysis</title><p>The sequencing raw reads were processed to remove adaptor contaminants and low-quality bases. The clean reads were aligned to the human genome (hg38) using STAR, and uniquely mapped reads were counted with RSEM by default parameters. We quantified gene expression levels with transcripts per million (TPM). For each sample, the expressed transcripts were defined with cutoff: TPM ≥1. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were assessed with the DESeq2 package with a cutoff: padj &lt;0.05 and fold change (FC) ≥2. GO enrichment was performed using DAVID. Statistical analyses were performed using R software. The RNA-seq data in this work have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE232488.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Minigene assay</title><p>Minigene analysis was performed in 293T cells. Amplicons spanning exons 1–3 along with ~200 bp of the flanking intronic sequences were PCR-amplified using the genomic DNA from the normal control and were inserted into the pcDNA vector. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to introduce the mutation c.21-94G&gt;A. The minigene constructs (c.21-94G&gt;A or WT) were transfected into cultured 293T cells using PEI reagent (Polyscience). Cells were harvested 48 hr after transfection and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol following the manufacturer’s protocol. RT-PCR was performed using the indicated primers to amplify the target region (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref> for primers sequences).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Molecular modeling and evolutionary conservation analysis</title><p>MAD2L1BP mutations were mapped using PyMOL software according to the crystal structure of the Mad2/p31(comet)/Mad2-binding peptide ternary complex (PDB ID: 2QYF).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hongtao Yu (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 3D, injection of the Mad2l1bp mutant cRNA into mouse oocytes delayed polar body extrusion as compared to the un-injected control. This suggested that the Mad2l1bp mutant had a dominant-negative function. On the other hand, this mutant is unlikely to be folded and should not be able to interact with any of its known binding partners. This putative dominant-negative effect is hard to explain. The authors should inject an unrelated cRNA (e.g. GFP) into these oocytes and use those as the negative control. It is possible that the injection process per se perturbed the meiotic progression of these oocytes.</p><p>2) For the experiments in mouse oocytes, the authors should test mechanistically whether the checkpoint is turned off, for example, they could examine the localization of one of the checkpoint proteins by immunofluorescence.</p><p>3) As pointed out by reviewers #1 and #2, the references are often not correct and some important work in this area is not cited. Please ensure that all the relevant literature is cited in all of the appropriate places.</p><p>4) The authors should discuss the male phenotype more comprehensively.</p><p>5) Given the small sample size, the authors should make conclusions cautiously and ensure that statements take this caveat into account, particularly for the rescue experiments in human.</p><p>6) Although not essential, the addition of mechanistic work on the other two patient mutations in their mouse oocyte system would greatly strengthen the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study may be submitted to a more specialized journal. Rescue experiments of human oocytes need to be repeated, to reproduce the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I find this is an important translational study that adds to the growing body of literature that genetic mutations impact oocyte quality and fertility. However, to fully support your claims that the SAC is not being satisfied in patients who have a mutation in this gene, additional SAC assays in mouse oocytes should be performed to demonstrate this. I point you to papers by authors from Wassmann, FitzHarris, and Schindler labs for examples.</p><p>You also identified 3 variants, but only explore one. Is it possible that the other variants have different impacts on oocytes? This seems like a simple point to explore in your mouse oocyte system and would have an important clinical impact if therapeutic treatment would be different depending on the degree of truncation in the protein.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I only have one major point that needs to be addressed prior to publication. In Figure 3D, injection of the Mad2l1bp mutant cRNA into mouse oocytes delayed polar body extrusion as compared to the uninjected control.

We have referred to the methods as you mentioned published from Wassmann, FitzHarris, and Schindler labs, and conducted the microinjection and immunofluorescence staining using one of the spindle assembly checkpoint components – Bub3. In support of our previous findings, we observed consistent activation of SAC machinery all through in vitro <italic>maturation</italic> upon the <italic>Mut Mad2l1bp</italic> cRNA injection, which indicates the intact SAC signaling. Consequently, these oocytes failed to undergo complete meiotic division I and possess bivalent chromosomes even after release for 16 hr. By contrast, the majority of oocytes with WT <italic>Mad2l1bp</italic> cRNA injection successfully undergo meiosis I and achieved typical univalent chromosomes with low levels of Bub3 staining (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This additional SAC assay unambiguously confirms our previous results.</p><p>The following papers published from Wassmann, FitzHarris, and Schindler labs were also cited:</p><p>1.

We have identified <italic>MAD2L1BP variants</italic> from three patients<italic>,</italic> including two homozygous variants (p.R285* and p.R181*) and biallelic <italic>MAD2L1BP variants</italic> p.F173Sfs4*/ c.21-94G&gt;A (Figure 1 and Sup Figure 1). Among these variants, only p.R285* is able to produce the longest truncated MAD2L1BP protein (with only loss of 22 residues) (Sup Figure 1). Since we have validated and confirmed that loss of 22 amino acids clearly abolished its interaction of MAD2L1BP (p.R285*) with the kinetochore protein MAD2 (Figure 2), there is no chance to establish the interaction between other much shorter MAD2L1BP variants (p.R181*, p.F173Sfs4*/ c.21-94G&gt;A) and MAD2 protein. Therefore, the primary defect responsible for the patients’ infertility must be ascribed to the malfunction of MAD2L1BP-MAD2 interaction. For clarity, we have rephrased the texts in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I only have one major point that needs to be addressed prior to publication. In Figure 3D, injection of the Mad2l1bp mutant cRNA into mouse oocytes delayed polar body extrusion as compared to the uninjected control. This suggested that the Mad2l1bp mutant had a dominant-negative function. On the other hand, this mutant is unlikely to be folded and should not be able to interact with any of its known binding partners. This putative dominant-negative effect is hard to explain. The authors should inject an unrelated cRNA (e.g. GFP) into these oocytes and use those as the negative control. It is possible that the injection process per se perturbed the meiotic progression of these oocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your good suggestion. Following your advice, we have injected the GFP cRNA as a mock control in both new Figure 3C and 3D (serving as a negative control). Consistently, we show GFP mock injection behaves phenotypically similar to non-injected group, suggesting that GFP injection per se has no adverse effect on normal meiotic progression, and somehow implicates a dominant-negative effect for Mad2l1bp Mut as compared with Mad2l1bp WT. Given that the cellular milieu of meiotic oocytes reported (less stringency of SAC machinery, large cytoplasmic volume) is in sharp distinct from that in somatic cells, we reasoned that there likely exists unknown partners in oocyte context, but not in soma, that could be affected by Mad2l1bp Mut. This disparity was indeed observed for kinetochore proteins (e.g., BubR1) between meiosis in oocytes and mitosis in soma (Refs: Homer, H., Gui, L. &amp; Carroll, J. A spindle assembly checkpoint protein functions in prophase I arrest and prometaphase progression. Science. Touati, S. A. et al. Mouse oocytes depend on BubR1 for proper chromosome segregation but not prophase I arrest. Nat. Commun.). For clarity, we have rephrased the texts in the MS. This would be an interesting direction to explore the SAC responsive partners, e.g., through very sensitive mass-spectrometry-based proteomic approach, in varied cellular contexts in the future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
