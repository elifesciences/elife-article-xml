This process markedly stimulates cell migration and is constitutively activated in more than 60% of breast carcinomas. How this activation is achieved remains unclear. Here, we screened 948 signalling genes using RNAi and imaging. We identified 12 negative regulators of O-glycosylation that all control GalNAc-T sub-cellular localisation. ERK8, an atypical MAPK with high basal kinase activity, is a strong hit and is partially localised at the Golgi. Its inhibition induces the relocation of GalNAc-Ts, but not of KDEL receptors, revealing the existence of two separate COPI-dependent pathways. ERK8 down-regulation, in turn, activates cell motility. In human breast and lung carcinomas, ERK8 expression is reduced while ER O-glycosylation initiation is hyperactivated. In sum, ERK8 appears as a constitutive brake on GalNAc-T relocalisation, and the loss of its expression could drive cancer aggressivity through increased cell motility.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01828.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01828.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01828.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The likelihood of an individual being able to recover from cancer depends on: where the cancer is within the body, how quickly the disease is detected and how quickly treatment is started. Cancers that have spread from their original location to another part of the body are particular challenging to treat, and cause the vast majority of cancer deaths every year.</p><p>Treatments that can recognize and eradicate cancer cells, while leaving nearby healthy cells untouched, are still needed—and so there has been a lot of research into identifying the key differences between healthy cells and cancer cells. For several decades, researchers have been aware that cancer cells have more proteins coated with modified sugars on their cell surfaces than healthy cells. This is caused by the enzymes that add these sugars to the proteins relocating from one location within the cell, the Golgi apparatus, to another, called the endoplasmic reticulum. These specific ‘sugar-coated’ proteins are known to encourage cancer cells to migrate and invade new tissues, but the mechanisms that regulate the addition of these sugar molecules to proteins remains poorly understood.</p><p>Now Chia et al. have discovered 12 molecules that regulate this process, including an enzyme called ERK8 that is found at the Golgi apparatus. ERK8 is shown to prevent the relocation of the sugar-adding enzymes from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby restricting the production of sugar-coated proteins that help the cancer cells to spread within the body. By identifying 12 potential targets for new therapeutics aimed at preventing the spread of cancer, the work of Chia et al. could ultimately help to improve the chances of patients recovering from certain cancers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01828.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01828.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>golgi</kwd><kwd>glycosylation</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>COP-I</kwd><kwd>retrograde traffic</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>A*STAR</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chia</surname><given-names>Joanne</given-names></name><name><surname>Tham</surname><given-names>Keit Min</given-names></name><name><surname>Gill</surname><given-names>David James</given-names></name><name><surname>Bard</surname><given-names>Frederic A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ERK8 kinase blocks the export of glycosyl-tranferases from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum, and thus subsequent O-glycosylation of proteins that otherwise enhance cell motility and tissue invasion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>GalNAc-type O-linked glycans are polysaccharides present on secreted and membrane-inserted proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tran and Ten Hagen, 2013</xref>). Traditionally associated with mucin-like proteins, recent advances in mass spectrometric analysis have revealed O-glycosylation on hundreds of different proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Steentoft et al., 2013</xref>). Recent results have also highlighted specific functional roles for O-glycans; for instance, in regulating the secretion of the phosphatemia regulator FGF23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kato et al., 2006</xref>) and in processing of the angiopoietin-like factor ANGPTL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schjoldager et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>O-glycans are synthesised through the step-wise action of various glycosylation enzymes, starting with the UDP-N-Acetyl-Alpha-D-Galactosamine:Polypeptide N-Acetyl-galactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-Ts), a large family of 20 different isoforms that catalyses the addition of N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) onto serine or threonine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 2012</xref>). The addition of GalNAc on proteins generates the Tn antigen, with antigenicity being lost upon the addition of other sugar residues. Earlier work demonstrated that carcinomas stain prominently with antibodies and lectins such as the <italic>Helix Pomatia</italic> Lectin (HPL), which binds to Tn antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Springer, 1983</xref>). The high prevalence and specificity of this cancer glycophenotype is remarkable, with matching normal tissues and benign tumours expressing much lower levels.</p><p>This increase in Tn levels is proposed to stem from a block or reduction in the activity of the main O-GalNAc-modifying enzyme, the Core 1 Galactosyl-Transferase (C1GALT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ju et al., 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stanley, 2011</xref>); indeed, the loss of C1GALT in the high Tn-expressing T cell leukaemia Jurkat cell line has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ju et al., 2008a</xref>). In breast carcinoma, however, high Tn levels seem to be caused by a different mechanism: GalNAc-Ts are massively relocated from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with Tn staining largely located in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gill et al., 2013</xref>). Further, in some cancer cells, O-glycosylation initiation in the ER has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egea et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>Trafficking of GalNAc-Ts to the ER can be stimulated by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), with GalNAc-Ts active in the ER and GalNAc incorporation in proteins increasing after relocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill et al., 2010</xref>). It is surmised that glycosylation of ER-resident proteins likely explains this observed increase in Tn staining, as several of these proteins bear O-GalNAc in mass spectrometric analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Steentoft et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although it is unclear which specific proteins are modified, O-glycosylation in the ER results in a marked stimulatory effect on cell adhesion and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gill et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that ER O-glycosylation promotes the invasive and metastatic potential of malignant tumour cells. Tn levels are consistently higher in higher grade, more aggressive breast tumours. Conversely, ER-specific inhibition of O-glycosylation reduced drastically lung metastasis in a mice model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gill et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>GalNAc-Ts transport is stimulated by activated SRC tyrosine kinases and requires the COPI coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill et al., 2010</xref>). COPI is a multimeric protein complex required for the formation of transport carriers and functions in the retrograde traffic between the Golgi and the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Szul and Sztul, 2011</xref>). COPI coat assembly is regulated by small GTPases of the Arf family and their regulator, the GTP exchange factor, GBF1; however, the regulation of COPI-coated carrier formation in response to extracellular signals is poorly understood.</p><p>To better understand the mechanisms regulating Tn expression in cancer, we performed an RNAi screen targeting 948 genes presumed to be involved in signal transduction. We identified and validated 12 regulators, with a particular focus on the MAP kinase ERK8 (alias <italic>MAPK15</italic>), the most recently identified member of the MAPK family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2002</xref>). Unlike classical MAP kinases, ERK8 possesses an atypically long C-terminal domain and appears to constitutively auto-phosphorylate its Thr-X-Tyr motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klevernic et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we find that a fraction of the ERK8 protein is localised at the Golgi where it specifically inhibits COPI vesicle formation and the export of GalNAc-Ts. The loss of ERK8 activity results in increased O-glycosylation and increased cell motility. We find that ERK8 expression is also frequently downregulated in lung carcinomas, which may partly explain the high Tn phenotype and invasiveness of these tumours.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNAi screening identifies 12 signalling genes that negatively regulate Tn levels</title><p>We recently reported the results from a screen for regulators of Golgi morphology and organisation using various markers including fluorescently labelled HPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chia et al., 2012</xref>). In the analysis presented in this study, we quantified Tn levels using HPL fluorescence intensity per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In a pilot screen using HeLa cells, which targeted 63 known players of membrane traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chia et al., 2012</xref>), we identified that knockdown of the SNARE gene Syntaxin 5 (<italic>STX5</italic>) reproducibly induced a 6–7-fold increase in Tn levels relative to a non-targeting (NT) control (GFP siRNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This effect was presumably due to a defect in the balance in anterograde vs retrograde ER-to-Golgi traffic of GalNAc-Ts. Using <italic>STX5</italic> and GFP siRNA as positive and negative controls, we then screened 948 signalling genes in search for regulators of O-glycosylation. We discarded the results for 134 siRNA pools that reduced the cell number to less than 20% of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Of the remaining siRNA pools, we identified numerous gene knockdowns that increased HPL levels significantly more than <italic>STX5</italic> depletion.

Depletion of one of these negative regulators—the Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase 8 (ERK8)—induced a particularly marked increase in Tn, ranging from 4–25-fold depending on the experimental design and RNAi reagent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). It should be noted that knock-down was not optimised for the other 18 genes and thus Tn levels may reflect partly the extent of target depletion.</p><p>To exclude the possibility of off-target effects in the 19 hits, we repeated the screen using the individual siRNAs that were used in each siRNA pool in the primary screen. For ERK8, we observed that three out of the four single siRNAs significantly increased Tn levels above the NT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Using a threshold of 4.5-fold increase for at least two independent siRNAs, 12 genes were considered validated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To verify that the effects observed were not specific to the detection method used, knockdown cells were also stained with a different lectin, <italic>Vicia Villosa</italic> Lectin (VVL), which revealed a highly consistent pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>To validate that these genes indeed led to the up-regulation in GalNAc protein O-glycosylation, we sought to downregulate the responsible enzymes. Although GalNAc-Ts represent a large family, the T1 and T2 isoforms are by far the most prevalent and represent most of GalNAc-T activity in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 2012</xref>). This is apparent in the almost complete loss of Tn levels when GalNAc-T1 and -T2 were depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Co-depletion of the two enzymes also reduced significantly the Tn increase from the knockdown of ERK8 as well as that from other Tn regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This effect was not caused by inefficient ERK8 knockdown, as other co-knockdown experiments did not have such an effect. In addition, ERK8 levels were still significantly reduced in the triple knockdown configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our screen revealed several negative regulators of the O-GalNAc glycosylation process, which thus appears to be tightly controlled by signalling mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Tn negative regulators are not required for O-glycan extension</title><p>Two mechanisms are known to increase Tn levels: inhibition of O-GalNAc extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ju et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2008b</xref>) or relocation of GalNAc-Ts from the Golgi apparatus to the ER. The loss of expression of C1GALT or its molecular chaperone, COSMC, results in a failure to generate the subsequent Core 1 glycan structure (the TF antigen) and thus inhibits O-GalNAc extension, which is detectable as a loss in Peanut Agglutinin (PNA) lectin positive staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Swamy et al., 1991</xref>). Relocation of GalNAc-Ts from the Golgi apparatus to the ER, on the other hand, induces a modest but measurable increase in PNA staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To distinguish between the two possibilities, PNA staining was quantified upon depletion of each of the 12 Tn regulators. HeLa cells with a stable COSMC knockout which prohibits C1GALT activity, was used as a positive control and, as expected, completely abolished PNA staining. Comparatively, there was either no significant decrease or some increase in PNA staining following depletion of each of the Tn regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), with the most significant increase in PNA staining observed after ERK8 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, none of the Tn-regulating genes we identified appears to be required for core 1-forming activity and thus do not regulate Tn levels by inhibiting O-GalNAc extension.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01828.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Tn regulators control Tn expression through GalNAc-T subcellular localisation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Peanut Agglutinin (PNA) lectin staining in ERK8-depleted HeLa cells.

As ERK8 was previously found to be highly expressed in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2002</xref>), we set out to explore the link between ERK8 and Tn levels in lung cancer with 23 lung biopsies containing 2 normal lung tissues, 14 squamous cell carcinomas, 6 adenocarcinomas and 1 small cell carcinoma. We found that ERK8 was clearly detectable in normal tissues but that the levels appeared markedly lower in all lung carcinomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H</xref>), with an average 80% loss of expression, and a range of 40–90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). No specific trend in regard to the cancer type was noticed. Next, we quantified Tn levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and found a significantly higher expression of Tn in a majority of the samples, with a more than fourfold average higher expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1I</xref>) and a range of 2–10-fold; 18 cores (86%) displayed higher than normal levels of Tn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>We next explored if high Tn levels were linked to ER O-glycosylation, as in the case of breast carcinomas and indeed found that Tn staining co-localised extensively with the ER marker calnexin in the carcinoma samples. By contrast, Tn staining in the normal lung tissue was clearly more punctuate and reminiscent of a Golgi localisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>Thus, in most lung carcinoma tumours, ERK8 expression is lower while Tn levels are higher as compared with normal lung tissue. Furthermore, in samples with heterogeneous staining for Tn, we observed a reverse correlation between ERK8 and Tn staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,G</xref>). However, at the whole core level, the staining intensities of the two levels were not inversely correlated from sample to sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1J</xref>).</p><p>The lack of a direct correlation indicates that, in human lung and breast tumours, ERK8 levels do not strictly control the levels of Tn. Given the number of regulators that have been already identified in this and previous studies, this is not surprising. Notwithstanding, our analysis indicates that ERK8 is frequently downregulated in lung and breast carcinomas, which probably facilitates the relocation of GalNac-Ts to the ER when other biochemical or genetic perturbations, such as SRC activation, are engaged.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cellular levels of the Tn antigen vary dramatically in cancer cells, suggesting that O-glycosylation initiation and/or elongation is highly regulated. Indeed, our screen results reveal that several signalling molecules exert significant control over O-glycosylation initiation. In recent years, we have reported that this initiation step can be regulated through trafficking of the GalNAc-Ts between the ER and the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill et al., 2010</xref>) and that marked ER localisation explains the high Tn phenotype in at least 60% of human breast tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gill et al., 2013</xref>). High Tn levels can also arise from a loss or inhibition of the elongation of the O-GalNAc, a mechanism that has also been proposed to underlie the cancer phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ju et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In secondary screens, it appeared that most, if not all, signalling proteins affecting Tn levels regulate the subcellular localisation of GalNAc-Ts and not the elongation process. This obviously does not preclude the main elongation enzyme, C1GALT or its specific chaperone, COSMC (alias <italic>C1GALT1C1</italic>) from being regulated in some conditions, but a significant inhibition of the activity of these proteins was not observed in our screen conditions. In contrast, the subcellular localisation of GalNAc-Ts appears to be a nodal point of control in a complex signalling network. Indeed, at least 12 independent negative regulators were identified and at least as many positive regulators, including the SRC family tyrosine kinases, are likely to be involved. This regulatory complexity suggests that perhaps signals of different origins are being integrated at the level of GalNAc-Ts traffic.</p><p>ERK8 is one of the most potent regulators we identified. Multiple pieces of evidence indicate that it acts at the level of the Golgi by inhibiting the formation of GalNAc-T-containing COPI vesicles. Based on their genetic interaction profile, the other negative regulators appear to act at the same level as ERK8. Consistently, two of these proteins, PKMYT1 and MAP4K2, are also reported to localize at the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ren et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 1997</xref>), and several other regulators interact with Golgi-localised proteins. Together, this suggest that the incorporation of GalNAc-Ts in COPI vesicles is the key point of regulation of this potential regulatory network.</p><p>This regulation point also reveals the existence of at least two different types of COPI-dependent Golgi-to-ER retrograde traffic carriers: one type of transport, GalNAc-Ts, is activated by growth factor stimulation and cancerous transformation and is repressed by ERK8; the other, KDEL-R, is activated by cargo protein traffic and is independent of ERK8. However, both routes appear to be under the control of the SRC kinase family. A key step in understanding these differences will be to identify the relevant phosphorylation substrates for both SRC and ERK8.</p><p>The trafficking of GalNAc-Ts to the ER results in the glycosylation of multiple different substrates, as indicated by the metabolic labelling results. The precise identity of these substrates, as well as the functional effects of their glycosylation, remains to be established. Notwithstanding, the outcome of the relocation at the cellular level is clearly a significant stimulator of cell migration. Indeed, the stimulatory effect of ERK8 depletion is dependent on ER-localised O-glycosylation. These results are also consistent with our previous data based on the expression of an exogenous, ER-targeted form of GalNAc-T2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gill et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, an interesting hypothesis is that the intensity of packaging of GalNAc-Ts into Golgi-derived COPI-coated vesicles could be a signalling integration point that sets the ‘motility potential’ of cells.</p><p>In breast and lung cancer cells, this set-point appears constitutively high, as the relocation of GalNAc-Ts is extensive and frequent. The promotion of cell motility associated with ER-localised O-glycosylation appeared to favour the formation of lung metastases in a tail-vein injection-based assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gill et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, how GalNAc-T relocation is stimulated in cancer cells has probably important medical implications. Our analyses suggest that multiple mechanisms are possible, including a decrease in ERK8 protein levels. However, the actual level of decrease required to stimulate relocation is not known and is anyway probably dependent on other cellular parameters. Additionally, Tn levels are not likely to depend only on the intracellular distribution of GalNAc-Ts. For instance, normal tissues with high levels of mucin expression, such as stomach, colon or kidney, tend to have higher endogenous Tn levels without clear evidence for relocation. This complexity probably contributes to the lack of direct correlation between ERK8 and Tn levels.</p><p>In addition to promoting O-glycosylation, ERK8 depletion could also have other beneficial advantages for cancer cells. Indeed, ERK8 has been implicated in multiple, apparently unrelated, molecular processes, such as maintenance of genomic integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Groehler and Lannigan, 2010</xref>), regulation of telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cerone et al., 2011</xref>), autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colecchia et al., 2012</xref>) and inhibition of nuclear receptor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henrich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saelzler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rossi et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog Erk7 and human ERK8 were also shown to participate in the regulation of protein secretion during starvation through disassembly of ER exit sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zacharogianni et al., 2011</xref>). Whether these different processes are somewhat linked through ERK8 or whether ERK8 is simply moonlighting in different, independent functions constitutes an interesting challenge for the future.</p><p>In sum, our results suggest that initiation of O-glycosylation in the ER is under an elaborate regulatory control system of which ERK8 is a key player.

The catalytically inactive ERK8 mutant construct was generated by introducing T175A and Y177F mutations using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The entry vectors were subsequently cloned into pcDNA6.2-Nmcherry-DEST, a gateway compatible destination vector constructed by the replacement of the GFP tag with mCherry on pcDNA6.2-NGFP-DEST (Invitrogen). Human ARF1 (NM-001024228)-GFP expression clones were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill et al., 2010</xref>). miR-ERK8 and miR-GFP vector were generated from BLOCK- iT Pol II miR RNAi expression vector kits from Invitrogen.

Image analysis was performed using MetaXpress software (version 3.1.0.89). For each well, total HPL staining intensity and nuclei number was quantified using Transfluor HT application module in the software. Briefly, masking for both Cy5 (HPL) and DAPI (Nuclei) channels was generated by setting the mask dimensions and cut-off intensity above the background for each of the two channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and intensities were quantified in the area covered by the masking. Hundreds of cells were quantified and the averages per well were calculated. To compare HPL intensities between wells, HPL intensity per cell of each well was obtained by normalising the total HPL intensity (‘Integrated Granule Intensity’ of Cy5 channel) with nuclei number of the well. The same procedures were performed for the quantification of PNA and GalNAc-T1 staining in the secondary screens. Statistical significance was measured using a paired t test assuming a two-tailed Gaussian distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Drug treatments</title><p>For ERK8 inhibitor Ro-31-8220 treatment, HeLa MannII-GFP cells were seeded into imaging plates overnight, treated with 5 µM Ro-31-8220 in DMEM with 10% FBS for various durations and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde-4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by subsequent staining.

The slides were then washed three times with TBST and blocked with 10% goat serum-PBS for 30 min. Subsequent staining with ERK8 antibody (0.9 µg/ml), VVL-biotin (4 μg/ml) and Hoescht (1:10,000) was performed overnight before staining with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000) and Streptavidin-Alexa 594 (1:400) secondary antibodies for 30 min. Slides were counterstained with DAPI and then mounted (Vectashield). The arrays were first automatically imaged (using constant acquisition parameters) using a 10 ×objective (LD Plan-NEOFLUAR; 10 ×; N.A. 0.4) on a motorised stage coupled to a Zeiss inverted confocal microscope equipped with a CCD camera (AxioCam HRc). Images of the cores were exported from Zeiss Zen2011 software to enable quantification of ERK8 and VVL staining in tumour cores. To quantify the levels of ERK8 or Tn (VVL) expression in a tissue core, the images were first converted to 8-bit images using ImageJ. The area above the threshold was set for background staining (Threshold for ERK8 and VVL was 30 and DAPI was 40) and then quantified. The area of ERK8 and VVL was normalised to the total area of the core represented by nuclei (DAPI) staining. The values of each core were then normalised to the average area of the normal tissue cores.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is Suzanne Pfeffer, a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This lab has previously reported the interesting finding that several growth factors and some cancers induce the relocalization of GalNAc-transferases from the Golgi to the ER where they function to enhance GalNAc 0-glycosylation. This process leads to stimulation of cell adhesion and migration. The current study extends this work by using a RNAi screen of 948 genes involved in signal transduction to identify 12 genes that serve as negative regulators of this process, with ERK8 being the most potent and the focus of the rest of the paper. Data are presented that ERK8 is partially localized to the Golgi and must be catalytically active to retain the GalNAcTs in the Golgi. Some data are presented that ERK8 expression is downregulated in breast and lung cancers, which are associated with increased 0-GalNAc formation in the ER. Additionally it is shown that ERK8 regulated retrograde traffic of GalNAcTs is dependent on COPI.</p><p>These findings significantly extend the previous reports by identifying ERK8 as a major regulator of this process. The work has been well executed and the data are convincing that ERK8 is a regulator of GalNAcT localization.</p><p>An unexpected finding is that Erk8 depletion drives GalNAc T1 to the ER but apparently not KDELR, which is also is transported in a COP-I dependent pathway, and activated for recycling via Src family kinase activity and secretory traffic. The work would be of much greater impact if the authors could use any other molecular distinction to show that GalNAc T1 and KDEL-R really do use different activation pathways for activated retrograde transport. For example, do methods reported by Luini to enhance KDEL-R retrograde transport also activate GalNAcT1 trafficking? Are the two routes similar in sensitivity to specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors? Can they monitor the actual rate of KDEL receptor recycling rather than steady state localization or overexpress a KDEL substrate to alter the KDELR trafficking and verify that it is insensitive or less sensitive to Erk8 depletion. If they can provide any additional detail to clarify this difference, the work would represent a major finding and be precisely the kind of story we seek for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Regardless of the weaknesses, the identification of ERK8 as a major regulator of GalNAcT localization is a significant advance that will open up new lines of investigation and merits publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01828.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>An unexpected finding is that Erk8 depletion drives GalNAc T1 to the ER but apparently not KDELR, which is also is transported in a COP-I dependent pathway and activated for recycling via Src family kinase activity and secretory traffic.

In this new version, we report experiments where either an active form of Src is expressed or ERK8 is depleted and both GalNac-Ts and KDEL-R are monitored simultaneously (new panels; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). Although the extent of GalNac-Ts dislocation from the Golgi is comparable in both conditions, we find that active Src expression induces a marked dispersion of KDEL-R whereas ERK8 depletion does not.</p><p>In a separate experiment, we induced a wave of cargo at the Golgi using the temperature-sensitive form of VSVG. As previously reported by Alberto Luini’s group, we observed a significant relocation of the KDEL-R, whereas, in contrast, we found that GalNac-Ts were not detectably affected (new panel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Together with our previous quantification, these data indicate that whereas Src controls trafficking of both KDEL-R and GalNac-Ts, ERK8 only controls GalNac-Ts traffic. Both the receptor for KDEL and the enzymes use the COPI coat machinery but their traffic is activated through different pathways: rate of secretion for KDEL-R; growth factors and events involved in cancerous transformation for GalNac-Ts.</p></body></sub-article></article>
