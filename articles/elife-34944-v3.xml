This technique has been exploited to track either ion flow arising from channel opening or the synchronized movement of charged residues and/or ions within the membrane electric field. Here, we describe a novel type of current by using the serotonin transporter (SERT) as a model. We examined transient currents elicited on rapid application of specific SERT inhibitors. Our analysis shows that these currents originate from ligand binding and not from a long-range conformational change. The Gouy-Chapman model predicts that adsorption of charged ligands to surface proteins must produce displacement currents and related apparent changes in membrane capacitance.

Yet signals from outside of the cell can still influence how that cell behaves. One way this can happen is via small molecules called ligands binding to proteins embedded in the membrane and triggering a cascade of reactions inside the cell. Studying this kind of protein-ligand interaction is important for many aspects of biology. However, such studies typically require that the ligand be first labeled in some way, which is time-consuming, costly and may alter how the ligand behaves. As such, there is a need for alternative ways to measure ligands binding to proteins in membranes.</p><p>The fact that the two sides of a membrane are insulated from each other means that they can store electrical charges. The ability to store charges is called capacitance. Theory predicts that it should be possible to detect a change in capacitance when a ligand binds to a membrane protein. Yet, though the theoretical basis of this hypothesis has been widely accepted, it had not been tested experimentally until now.</p><p>Burtscher et al. chose to focus on a membrane protein called the serotonin transporter because a large number of its ligands had already been characterized. Experiments with human cells that expressed this transporter confirmed that the binding of a ligand was indeed detectable as a change in membrane capacitance. Burtscher et al. also detected a brief electrical current across the membrane that is predicted to occur when the capacitance changes.</p><p>Ligand binding studies are especially important in therapeutics, as many drugs rely on blocking specific signaling pathways in diseased cells. As these capacitance recordings show precise real-time measurements, they could be used for drug screening in the future, all without the need to label the ligands.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human Serotonin transporter</kwd><kwd>surface charge</kwd><kwd>membrane capacitance</kwd><kwd>HEK293 cells</kwd><kwd>cocaine</kwd><kwd>serotonin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P28090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sandtner</surname><given-names>Walter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F3510</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freissmuth</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Binding of a charged small molecule to a membrane protein changes the amplitude of the apparent membrane capacitance by changing the charge density at the surfaces of the membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Voltage-clamp recordings have been used for the past 70 years to assess currents through membranes, which are either resistive (i.e. ion flux through ion channels, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>) or which arise from synchronized movement of charged residues or ions within the membrane electric field (i.e. gating currents, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armstrong and Bezanilla, 1973</xref>). The two hallmarks of electrophysiological recordings are high sensitivity and high temporal resolution: it is technically feasible to monitor currents through single molecules and to resolve conformational transitions, which occur on the microsecond scale. In addition, voltage-clamp recordings also allow for determining the cell membrane capacitance (C<sub>M</sub>). Using this approach, it has been possible to detect changes in membrane area that result from the fusion of a single vesicle with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neher and Marty, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernandez et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">von Gersdorff and Matthews, 1994</xref>). However, a change in membrane area is not the only factor that can affect capacitance. Several studies – most of them conducted in cells that overexpressed a membrane protein – demonstrated the contribution of the same to the C<sub>M</sub>: the effect can be accounted for by mobile charges within the protein. These add to the total charge required to recharge the membrane upon prior voltage change. Voltage-gated channels were the first membrane proteins on which capacitance measurements were conducted: the total C<sub>M</sub> of a cell expressing these proteins was shown to comprise a voltage-independent component, which was ascribed to the membrane, and a voltage-dependent component, which was attributed to mobile charges within the voltage sensors of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bean and Rios, 1989</xref>). However, capacitance measurements also allow for extracting information on the conformational switch associated with binding of ions and/or substrate to transporters: it has, for instance, been possible to infer the conformational transition associated with phosphorylation of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump from the recorded change in capacitance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 1995</xref>). Similarly, binding of the co-substrate Cl<sup>-</sup> to the inward-facing conformation of the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter-1 (GAT1/SLC6A1) caused a very rapid reduction in the recorded capacitance, which was proposed to reflect the suppression of a charge moving reaction induced by binding of Na<sup>+</sup> to the outward -facing conformation of GAT1.</p><p>In the present study, we conducted current and capacitance measurements in HEK293 cells expressing human SERT. Like GAT1, SERT is a member of the solute carrier 6 (SCL6) family. The transport cycle of SERT is understood in considerable detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schicker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sandtner et al., 2014</xref>), in particular the nature of substrate-induced currents, electrogenic steps associated with binding and release of co-substrate ions and decision points in the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hasenhuetl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kern et al., 2017</xref>). In addition SERT, in contrast to GAT1, has a very rich pharmacology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sitte and Freissmuth, 2015</xref>), which allows for probing the actions of inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hasenhuetl et al., 2015</xref>), atypical inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sandtner et al., 2016</xref>), substrates and releasers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sandtner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kern et al., 2017</xref>), and atypical substrates/partial releasers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhat et al., 2017</xref>) by electrophysiological recordings. Here we explored changes in apparent C<sub>M</sub> resulting from ligand binding to SERT. A reduction in C<sub>M</sub> was seen regardless of whether the ligand was the cognate substrate or an inhibitor of SERT, e.g. cocaine. The Gouy-Chapman model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gouy, 1909</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chapman, 1913</xref>) predicts that charged ligand adsorption to membrane proteins must result in an apparent change of the C<sub>M</sub> and in ligand-induced displacement currents. We verified these predictions, by analysing both the ligand-induced currents and the related changes in C<sub>M</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Application of cocaine to HEK293 cells stably expressing SERT induces an inwardly directed peak current</title><p>When measured in the whole cell configuration, rapid application of 5-HT to SERT gives rise to an initial peak current, which is followed by a steady-state current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schicker et al., 2012</xref>).

Under our recording conditions, both compounds give rise to a transient current, which may arise by two alternative mechanisms: it is conceivable that binding of cocaine or of 5-HT to SERT occurs via an induced fit, that is local rearrangements are required within the vicinity of the binding pocket to accommodate the compound. These rearrangements can be expected to force charged residues of SERT to change their position within the membrane electric field. However, it is difficult to reconcile this with the negative slope in the current-voltage relation of both the cocaine- and the 5-HT-induced peak current in the absence of Cl<sup>-</sup>. The negative slope in the current-voltage relation was inconsistent with the conjecture that the cocaine-induced peak current originated from charges moving in the membrane electric field. The rules of electrostatics dictate that inwardly directed currents must increase at negative voltages, if they are carried by charges moving in response to a conformational change. This is also evident from the current-voltage relation for the 5-HT-induced peak current in the presence of chloride (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). This current reflects the conformational rearrangement that carries substrate and co-substrates through the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hasenhuetl et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, the corresponding current-voltage relation had a positive slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Alternative scenarios, which produce a negative slope, include a voltage-dependent gating step or a blockage of transport at negative potentials.

These potentials depend on the voltage difference between the intra- and extracellular bulk solution, the ionic composition of these solutions and the number of charges at the inner and outer membrane surfaces. In biological membranes, the charges at the surfaces comprise the phospholipid head groups and the solvent-accessible acidic or basic residues of membrane proteins.

For the simulation we assumed the presence of 150 mM of a monovalent cation and 150 mM of a monovalent anion in the bulk solutions on both sites of the membrane. The charge densities at the inner and outer membrane surface were set to the values measured by Zhang and co-workers (2001) (−0.018 C/m<sup>2</sup> and −0.005 C/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively). The cell membrane capacitance is composed of a voltage-independent component that reflects the lipid bilayer and a voltage-dependent component that originates primarily from voltage-dependent proteins in the plasma membrane (e.g. voltage-gated ion channels). The latter varies with the level of expression and the valence of the involved mobile charges. In excitable cells (e.g. cardiac myocytes) the voltage-dependent component accounts up to 10% of the total membrane capacitance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Novák and Zahradník, 2006</xref>).

Our data are in agreement with this report. According to Farrell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farrell et al., 2006</xref>), the voltage-dependent component in HEK293 cells originates from electromechanical coupling (i.e. electrostriction). Their analysis revealed a quadratic component (attributed to electrostriction) and a linear component, which was found to be the dominant component in 60% of the measured cells in the voltage range from −0.09 to +0.1 V. The Gouy-Chapman model predicts the linear voltage-dependence in this voltage range. Hence, we surmise that the Gouy-Chapman model explains the linear component observed by Farrell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farrell et al., 2006</xref>): the observed linear capacitance change with voltage is an apparent change, which arises because of the dependence of Ф<sub>t</sub> (=voltage difference between the inner and outer membrane surface) on V<sub>M</sub> (voltage difference between inner and outer bulk solution).

The increase in capacitance, which was seen at desipramine concentrations ≥ 30 µM in both SERT-expressing and untransfected HEK293 cells, can be rationalized by assuming that desipramine permeated the cell membrane and adsorbed to the inner surface. We carried out a simulation based on this conjecture, which recapitulated the capacitance recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Thus, the rise in capacitance was the expected consequence of desipramine adsorption to the inner surface of the membrane. We verified this conclusion by lowering the pH in the bath solution to 5.5. This manipulation increases the fraction of protonated species of desipramine at the expense of the diffusible uncharged species (pKa = 10.2). Lowering the pH is therefore predicted to diminish the SERT-independent increase in C<sub>M</sub>, if this action is contingent on the presence of intracellular desipramine. This was the case: at pH 5.5, 30 µM desipramine caused a decrease in apparent C<sub>M</sub> (left panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). In contrast, at pH 7.4, 30 µM desipramine elicited an increase in capacitance (right panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). It is also evident from this representative trace (right panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) that the increase at pH 7.4 was preceded by an initial decrease. This can be explained as follows: the initial decrease is the consequence of desipramine binding to SERT; the subsequent increase results from accumulation of intracellular desipramine. When assessed in paired recordings at pH 7.4 and pH 5.5, 30 µM desipramine consistently produced a drop in capacitance at pH 5.5 but not at pH 7.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). We also repeated these experiments in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). As expected, desipramine increased the capacitance at pH 7.4 (∆C<sub>M</sub> ~300 fC) but was ineffective at pH 5.5.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Ibogaine binds to an extracellular site on SERT</title><p>Most inhibitors of SERT bind to the outward-facing conformation. However, ibogaine is one notable exception. Ibogaine stabilizes the inward-facing conformation of SERT and inhibits substrate uptake in a non-competitive fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacobs et al., 2007</xref>). Ibogaine was therefore assumed to act on SERT by binding to a site in the inner vestibule. This implies that ibogaine gains access to the inner vestibule through the cytosol. We examined this hypothesis by measuring the effect of ibogaine on C<sub>M</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>): application of 10 µM ibogaine resulted in a reduction of the C<sub>M</sub> (upper panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). This effect was absent in control cells (lower panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Hence, these observations unequivocally refute the idea that ibogaine binds to a cytosolic site on SERT. Instead, our data suggest that the ibogaine binding site is directly accessible from the extracellular face of the transporter. We also evaluated the ibogaine-induced change in C<sub>M</sub> in paired recordings at pH 5.5 and 7.4, which did not affect the response to ibogaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), although the difference in pH is expected to substantially decrease the fraction of non-protonated, membrane permeable ibogaine (pKa = 8.05).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34944.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Ibogaine binds to an extracellular site of SERT.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative capacitance change induced by 10 µM ibogaine in a SERT-expressing cell (upper panel) and a recording in a control cell (lower panel).

While originally developed for a description of the interaction between dissolved ions and a metal electrode, this model also provides a conceptual framework to approach the electrical properties of a lipid bilayer. Fixed charges arise primarily from the net negative charge of phospholipid head groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McLaughlin et al., 1971</xref>). In addition, proteins which reside in or at the plasma membrane, also contribute to the surface charges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Green and Andersen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Madeja, 2000</xref>). In cells, these surface charges are asymmetrically distributed with the inner membrane leaflet carrying a higher negative surface charge density. The electrostatic forces between the dissolved ions and the fixed surface charges of the membrane drive the formation of a Gouy-Chapman diffusive layer. Thus, the underlying theory predicts, under voltage-clamp conditions, any binding reaction which results in adsorption of a charged ligand to the surface of the cell membrane must evoke a displacement current and an apparent change in capacitance. In spite of the veneration of the Gouy-Chapman model, the current experiments are – to the best of our knowledge - the first to demonstrate that binding reactions to surface proteins can be directly monitored by recording the predicted currents and the apparent changes of the membrane capacitance.</p><p>In the present study, we exploited the rich pharmacology of SERT to test the predictions of the Gouy-Chapman model: (i) Inhibitors such as cocaine and desipramine produced a displacement current and the related change in apparent C<sub>M</sub>. Their binding per se did not result in movement of mobile charges within the membrane electric field and was fully accounted for by the change in outer surface charge density caused by ligand adsorption. This conclusion is supported by the negative slope of the current-voltage relation. In addition, the change in C<sub>M</sub> is consistent with the average density of SERT in the cell line employed: adsorption of one charged ligand/molecule gives rise to a change in C<sub>M</sub> of about 500 fF. (ii) Displacement currents were also seen with the substrate serotonin provided that chloride was omitted to eliminate the conformational change associated with substrate translocation. (iii) Finally, we used ibogaine to interrogate the Gouy-Chapman model; binding of ibogaine also produced a drop in apparent C<sub>M</sub>. While inhibitors bind to the outward-facing conformation, ibogaine traps SERT in the inward-facing conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacobs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bulling et al., 2012</xref>). The precise binding site of ibogaine is unknown, but our capacitance recordings unequivocally refute the original hypothesis that ibogaine gains access to the inner vestibule. Our findings are also consistent with earlier observations, which showed that ibogaine was ineffective when administered to SERT via the patch electrode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bulling et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>SERT ligands are protonated amines, which form an ion pair with D98 in the orthosteric S1 binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coleman et al., 2016</xref>). Because of the large number of transporters expressed on the surface of our HEK293 cell line, adsorption of one ligand per transporter suffices to account for our experimental findings, both qualitatively and quantitatively. However, it is plausible that the binding of an uncharged ligand can also be detected by a capacitance change provided that ligand binding results in conformational rearrangements, which alter the solvent accessible surface of the protein. We note that on average the changes in apparent capacitance were somewhat larger with cocaine (495 fF, n = 29) than with ibogaine (283 fF, n = 7; p=0.0007, Mann-Whitney U-test). This difference presumably reflects the difference in accessible surface charges in the cocaine- and the ibogaine-bound states. Finally, it is worth pointing out that capacitance measurements are more specific for monitoring binding events than the recording of the displacement current. The displacement currents evoked by cocaine, desipramine and 5-HT (in the absence of Cl<sup>-</sup>) validate the predictions of the Gouy-Chapman model. However, the small size and transient occurrence of these currents limit their applicability for the assessment of ligand/protein interactions. Measurement of the apparent change in C<sub>M</sub> is a better technique to investigate ligand binding because of the sustained amplitude change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). An additional advantage of this readout is that measurements of C<sub>M</sub> are less susceptible to the masking effects of electrogenic transitions associated with conformational change. This was also seen in our recordings: the 5-HT-induced peak current was approximately three to four times larger than the cocaine peak, because most of the current elicited by 5-HT was produced by charges moving in response to conformational change, despite the small associated valence (0.15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hasenhuetl et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the extent by which the capacitance was reduced was similar for cocaine and 5-HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This can be explained as follows: the small valence associated with the mobile charge in SERT means that only a small fraction of this charge can be moved by the 80 mV voltage step used in our protocol to measure membrane capacitance. In fact, the simulation summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> documents that the current is too small to affect the analysis, which allows for extraction of total capacitance and changes therein. We stress that measurements of capacitance rather than of ligand-induced transient currents allow for obtaining the true binding affinity. In this context, we also want to note that we estimated the minimal expression density of the target membrane protein required for detection of the ligand-induced change in apparent C<sub>M</sub> to be 20,000 units/pF (see Materials and methods).</p><p>We stress that adsorption of a ligand to a surface protein does not evoke an actual change in C<sub>M</sub>. Accordingly, we refer to the recorded alterations as apparent changes in capacitance. The point is illustrated by the equivalent circuit of a cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>): the schematic representation depicts a battery (Vϕ), which is connected in series with a capacitor (C<sub>M</sub>) representing the cell membrane. This battery was included to account for the voltage drop caused by the asymmetry of the surface charge densities at the outer and inner membrane leaflets. Importantly, this battery is the element in the circuit, which is affected by charged ligand adsorption. The physiological relevance of this battery in a living organism is readily appreciated: it is, for instance, known that the voltage for half-maximal activation (V<sub>0.5</sub>) of voltage-gated ion channels can be shifted by the presence of divalent ions in the extracellular fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin, 1957</xref>). This is the reason why hypocalcemia causes seizures. The shift in V<sub>0.5</sub> is accounted for by the screening of surface charges by dissolved ions, which - similar to charged ligand adsorption - impinges on the highlighted battery. However, while surface charge screening is a long-range effect of ions that keep their hydration shell, ligand adsorption reflects a more specific interaction: it relies on tight binding of a ligand, which requires partial shedding of its water shell. We stress that in the case of surface charge screening no reference is made to the concept of binding affinities, which - in contrast - is implicit to charged ligand-adsorption to surface proteins.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34944.018</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Equivalent circuit of the cell.</title><p>The battery denoted V<sub>M</sub> accounts for the difference in potential between the intra- and extracellular bulk solutions.

In fact, any reaction which alters the surface charge in the membrane can be detected by recording the apparent change in capacitance. This conclusion is also supported by our observations that desipramine increased the apparent C<sub>M</sub> at concentrations exceeding 10 µM. Three lines of evidence indicate that this was a non-specific action: (i) the increase in capacitance was seen regardless of whether cells expressed SERT or not; (ii) it was not saturable and (iii) it was not mimicked by the other SERT ligands (cocaine, serotonin and ibogaine). The most plausible explanation is to assume enrichment of desipramine at the inner leaflet of the membrane. The polar surface area is a good predictor of membrane permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palm et al., 1998</xref>). The polar surface areas for desipramine, cocaine and 5-HT are 15 Å<sup>2</sup>, 56 Å<sup>2</sup> and 62 Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively (values taken from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pccompound">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pccompound</ext-link>). Thus, the low polar surface area of desipramine is consistent with its rapid permeation and the resulting change in capacitance. This is further supported by the findings of another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sheetz and Singer, 1974</xref>), which showed that amphiphilic cations, such as desipramine, accumulate at the inner membrane surface given that the surface charge density of the plasma membrane is more negative in the internal leaflet.</p><p>Incidentally, these observations highlight applications of possible C<sub>M</sub> recordings, which go beyond measuring ligand binding in real time: there are many biological processes known to alter the amount and the distribution of solvent accessible charge in the membrane. This (non-exhaustive) list includes: (i) reactions which are orchestrated by flippases and floppases and maintain the vital asymmetry between inner and outer surface-charge densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zachowski et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Groen et al., 2011</xref>); (ii) dissipation of an existing charge-asymmetry by scramblases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zachowski, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>); (iii) alteration of the charge density at the inner surface by enzymes, e.g. phospholipase C via cleavage of PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mauco et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rittenhouse-Simmons, 1979</xref>), lipid kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pike and Arndt, 1988</xref>) and phosphatases (i.e. P<sub>ten</sub>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maehama and Dixon, 1998</xref>). These activities ought to be amenable to recordings of the membrane capacitance given that they result in a sufficiently large change in surface charge density. Thus, capacitance measurements may be useful to extract kinetic information on these key biological reactions in real time and by a label-free approach.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings</title><p>Recordings of tetracycline-inducible HEK293 cells stably expressing a GFP-tagged human serotonin transporter (hSERT) were performed.

For the measurement we used a train of square wave voltage pulses with an amplitude ±40 mV and a frequency of 200 Hz. Bipolar square waves were used for measuring capacitance, because they are less sensitive to changes in series resistance (R<sub>S</sub>) and membrane resistance (R<sub>M</sub>) when compared with other methods for high-resolution membrane capacitance recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lindau and Neher, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thompson et al., 2001</xref>). In the protocol the holding potential was set to 0 mV if not stated otherwise. Exponential current responses were low pass filtered by a 10 kHz Bessel filter and sampled at 100 kHz rate. The cross talk between R<sub>S</sub> and C<sub>M</sub> was further suppressed as follows: the acquired current traces were first deconvoluted with the transfer function of the recording apparatus and the passive membrane parameters of a cell were calculated from the theoretical function as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoťka and Zahradník, 2017</xref>). This method provides reliable C<sub>M</sub> estimates even in conditions where large changes in R<sub>S</sub> occur (1 MΩ change in R<sub>S</sub> produces a C<sub>M</sub> change smaller than 1 fF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoťka and Zahradník, 2017</xref>). The pipette capacitance was recorded in the cell-attached mode first and subtracted from the currents recorded in the whole-cell configuration prior to further analysis. The patch pipettes used had a resistance of 2–4 MΩ. To stabilize the level of stray capacitance, the pipettes were coated with hydrophobic resin Sylgard184 (Dow Corning, USA).

Each trace analyzed had a time length of 5 s (sampling rate = 50 Hz). The average SD calculated was 4.84 ± 1.16 fF. We assumed a detectable change in capacitance amplitude if this exceeded two SDs. We used this value to estimate the minimal expression density of the target membrane protein required for detection of ligand-induced change in apparent membrane capacitance. The calculated density amounted to approximately 20,000 units/pF. However, this value applies only if the ligand neutralizes one surface charge on the protein. Accordingly, the lowest expression density required to detect change in apparent capacitance is decreased if a charged ligand adsorbs to more surface charges on the target protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Modeled and corrected apparent association rates</title><p>The apparent association rate (k<sub>app</sub>) of cocaine to SERT was calculated based on the previously estimated association and dissociation rate constants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hasenhuetl et al., 2015</xref>) and was plotted as a function of the cocaine concentration (dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The rates were modeled as: k<sub>app</sub> = k<sub>on</sub>*[Cocaine] +k<sub>off</sub>. We attribute the discrepancy between the theoretical and the measured rates to the finite solution exchange rate of our application device (~20 s<sup>−1</sup>). To model the corrected rate, we used a two-state model and simulated pseudo-first order binding assuming an exponential rise in cocaine concentration with the rate of solution exchange.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Shreyas Bhat, Klaus Schicker, and Peter S Hasenhuetl for discussions and comments on the data. This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund/FWF Project P28090 (to W S), Project Program Grant SFB35 (F3510 to M F).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A label-free approach to detect ligand binding to cell surface proteins in real time&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Baron Chanda (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew J R Plested (Reviewer #2); Leon D. Islas (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that describes a new method to probe direct binding of ligands to cell surface proteins. In many cases, ligands or modulators of protein function are charged molecules which when they bind will change the surface charge density either by neutralizing existing charges or by adding more charge to the membrane. This will be manifested as a change in membrane capacitance which typically has not been directly observed largely due to the fact that the membrane proteins are not expressed at sufficient levels. In this study, Burtscher et al. show that the binding of cocaine and other molecules to serotonin (5-HT) transporter SERT result in a capacitive current which is not due to displacement of charges but rather due to modification of surface charges. While the reviewers agree that the properties of the inward currents recorded here are entirely consistent with the predictions of the simple Guy-Chapman model of the double layer, they have raised few concerns which will have to be addressed in the revised version.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The negative slope of the current-voltage curve is intriguing and is the critical piece of evidence to support the claim that the increased capacitance is due to modification of surface potential. The increases are small but more importantly, without showing complete traces, it is not possible to determine where the baseline is. For instance, it is not clear whether the linear component of membrane capacitance was properly compensated or is some of it an artifact of compensation.</p><p>2) Related to the above point – the authors measure cell capacitance by estimating the charging of the membrane RC circuit due to square voltage pulses. This method has to rely on a good estimate of the leak current and is very sensitive to series resistance (R<sub>s</sub>) compensation. The authors should demonstrate that R<sub>s</sub> is not drifting during the recordings. Also, measuring capacitance in this fashion is affected greatly by even subtle changes in the level of the solution, which is a problem in experiments that use perfusion of solutions. This problem is present even when using Sylgard-coated pipettes. Please make a better presentation and discussion of the problems of estimating capacitance as done in these experiments.</p><p>3) Although the concentration of 5-HT and cocaine used are small, given the large expression level attained, it is important to estimate what fraction of the transient inward currents are caused by actual transport of these substrates. Is it possible that some fraction of the charge is actual current carried by 5-HT and cocaine, which should be positively charged?</p><p>4) In the data of Figure 7, the capacitance is different at 0, 50 or -50 mV, even in untransfected cells, please explain the possible origin of this.</p><p>5) The modeling and theoretical treatment is a major plus – although it's not well enough explained in my view. For example, &quot;this idea was incorporated into the model&quot; – how? There is no explanation how the simulations were done, that I found. Also, in the subsection “The voltage dependence of the cocaine-induced capacitance change is predicted by the Gouy-Chapman model” – It would be good to have some quantification of how the model performs. What are the parameters?</p><p>6) The first four figures are rather simple and might be condensed into two – in order to get faster to the real meat of the argument. It should be emphasized that capacitance measurement is more robust than current measurement and it is possible to obtain the true binding affinity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34944.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The negative slope of the current-voltage curve is intriguing and is the critical piece of evidence to support the claim that the increased capacitance is due to modification of surface potential.

It is only necessary to subtract (compensate for) “passive” displacement currents in the latter case. Additionally and in response to the reviewer's criticism, we show larger segments of the original traces to clearly visualize the baseline in the new Figure 3C and 3E (original Figure 4C and 4E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the above point – the authors measure cell capacitance by estimating the charging of the membrane RC circuit due to square voltage pulses. This method has to rely on a good estimate of the leak current and is very sensitive to series resistance (R<sub>s</sub>) compensation. The authors should demonstrate that R<sub>s</sub> is not drifting during the recordings. Also, measuring capacitance in this fashion is affected greatly by even subtle changes in the level of the solution, which is a problem in experiments that use perfusion of solutions. This problem is present even when using Sylgard-coated pipettes. Please make a better presentation and discussion of the problems of estimating capacitance as done in these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We show the time dependent evolution of C<sub>M</sub>, R<sub>M</sub> and R<sub>S</sub> in a representative recording (see Figure 5B); the traces allow the reader to appreciate how the circuit parameters in our measurements change over time. It is evident that there is no cross talk between these parameters.</p><p>We explicitly stated this as follows:</p><p>“Figure 5B shows a representative recording of the membrane capacitance (C<sub>M</sub>) with the two other circuit parameters R<sub>M</sub> and R<sub>S</sub> upon application and subsequent removal of 100 µM cocaine to HEK293 cells expressing SERT. It is evident from this recording that there was no cross talk between circuit parameters.”</p><p>In addition, we justify the choice of the bipolar square-wave method for measuring capacitance by a more detailed description; the pertinent text now reads:</p><p>&quot;Bipolar square waves were used for measuring capacitance, because they are less sensitive to changes in R<sub>S</sub> and R<sub>M</sub> when compared to other methods for high-resolution membrane capacitance recording (Lindau and Neher, 1988, Thompson et al., 2001). […] This method provides reliable C<sub>M</sub> estimates even in conditions where large changes in R<sub>S</sub> occur (1MΩ change in R<sub>S</sub> produces a C<sub>M</sub> change smaller than 1 fF; see Hotka and Zahradník, 2017).&quot;</p><p>In addition, we also explicitly address the concern of stray capacitance by the following explanation:</p><p>&quot;The method of bipolar square-wave stimulation can be rendered largely insensitive to changes in stray capacitance (C<sub>S</sub>) by ignoring the current during the time when the stray capacitor charges (Lindau and Neher, 1988). […] By removing the first six data points it is therefore possible to provide estimates of C<sub>M</sub>, which are insensitive to changes in C<sub>S</sub> (Thompson et al., 2001, Novak and Zahradnik, 2006, Hotka and Zahradnik 2017).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Although the concentration of 5-HT and cocaine used are small, given the large expression level attained, it is important to estimate what fraction of the transient inward currents are caused by actual transport of these substrates. Is it possible that some fraction of the charge is actual current carried by 5-HT and cocaine, which should be positively charged?</p></disp-quote><p>We stress that only 5-HT is a substrate of SERT. In contrast, cocaine is an inhibitor, which is not transported. We explicitly state this:</p><p>&quot;In contrast to 5-HT, which is the cognate substrate of SERT, cocaine is not translocated. Under our recording conditions, both compounds give rise to a transient current, which may arise by two alternative mechanisms …&quot;</p><p>We hope that this addresses the question of the reviewer in an adequate manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the data of Figure 7, the capacitance is different at 0, 50 or -50 mV, even in untransfected cells, please explain the possible origin of this.</p></disp-quote><p>In the main manuscript, we explicitly alert the reader to the voltage-dependent change in capacitance by stating:</p><p>&quot;It is important to note that the Gouy-Chapman model also predicted voltage-dependent change in capacitance observed in control cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).&quot;</p><p>We added a figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) showing the dependence of the membrane capacitance on V<sub>M</sub> as predicted by the Gouy-Chapman model (Materials and methods).</p><p>In the legend of Figure 6—figure supplement 1, we address the reviewer’s question as follows:</p><p>&quot;The cell membrane capacitance is composed of a voltage-independent component that reflects the lipid bilayer and a voltage-dependent component that originates primarily from voltage-dependent proteins in the plasma membrane (e.g. voltage-gated ion channels).
