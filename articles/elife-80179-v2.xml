sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The gut lining is undergoing constant damage caused by environmental aggressors (pesticides, drugs, viruses, bacteria and toxins) ingested along with food. The gut quickly responds to these aggressions by accelerating its epithelium renewal to replace damaged cells. Over the past decade, studies in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> have contributed substantially to the understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and regeneration. These mechanisms have proven to be highly conserved in the animal kingdom. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, resident intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are the guarantors of this cell renewal process. Under normal conditions, asymmetric division of an ISC gives rise to a new ISC (to maintain the pool of ISC) and to a daughter progenitor cell that can commit to two different paths of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">de Navascués et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goulas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">O’Brien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Perdigoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tian and Jiang, 2014</xref>). The enteroblasts (EBs) and enteroendocrine precursors (EEPs) are the precursors of enterocytes (ECs) and enteroendocrine cells (EEs), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Joly and Rousset, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pasco et al., 2015</xref>). ECs are the main intestinal epithelial bricks constituting an efficient barrier against aggressors and are therefore their first victims. The damaged or dying ECs emit cytokines, which stimulate the proliferation of ISCs to augment the pool of EBs that will differentiate into ECs to replace the damaged ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonfini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Osman et al., 2012</xref>). Two mechanisms underlying intestinal regeneration have been described. The first one is the ‘cell renewal’ model, which occurs under weak aggression conditions that does not induce EC apoptosis. In this case, ISC proliferation is low and the neo-EBs differentiate into ECs. However, this provokes a transient excess of ECs due to the absence of prior EC death. The gut cell homeostasis is subsequently reestablished by the removal of old ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loudhaief et al., 2017</xref>). The second mechanism, called ‘cell replenishment’ or ‘regenerative cell death’, occurs after a strong aggression that induces massive EC apoptosis. In this case, a rapid ISC proliferation is followed by the differentiation of EBs into ECs to replace the dying ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loudhaief et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vriz et al., 2014</xref>) without producing supernumerary ECs.</p><p><italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (<italic>Bt</italic>) bacteria are largely used as microbial insecticides to fight crop pests. <italic>Bt</italic> is a Gram-positive sporulating bacterium belonging to the <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (<italic>Bc</italic>) group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ehling-Schulz et al., 2019</xref>). It was first identified and characterized for its specific entomopathogenic properties due to the presence of a crystal containing specific Cry protoxins, which are produced during the bacteria sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rabinovitch et al., 2017</xref>). Among all the subspecies of <italic>Bt</italic> inventoried (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bgsc.org/">http://www.bgsc.org/</ext-link>), spores of <italic>Bt</italic> subsp. <italic>Kurstaki</italic> (<italic>Btk</italic>) are used to specifically kill lepidopteran larvae that threaten crops, through a cocktail of Cry toxins made of Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry2Aa and Cry2Ab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Caballero et al., 2020</xref>). Cry toxins sequentially bind to different receptors present in the midgut to exert their cytotoxicity. Among those receptors, the ones named Bt-R that belong to the Cadherin transmembrane cell adhesion molecules are primordial for the Cry1A holotype of toxins, allowing them to bind to enterocyte brush borders. The other receptors—such as Alkaline phosphatases, Aminopeptidases N, and ABC transporters—appear to account for the cytotoxicity that Cry exert toward susceptible organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2018b</xref>). In susceptible insects, upon ingestion of spores and crystals, the basic midgut pH dissolves the crystals, releasing the Cry protoxins. Then, digestive enzymes cleave Cry protoxins (130kD and 72kD for proCry1A and proCry2A, respectively) into activated Cry toxins (around 67kD) allowing them to bind their midgut receptors. Thereby, Cry toxins form pores in the plasma membrane of ECs, ultimately leading to their death. An alternative mode of action of Cry toxins suggested that Cry binding to Cadherin induces an intracellular flux of Mg<sup>2+</sup> resulting in EC apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Castella et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mendoza-Almanza et al., 2020</xref>). In both models, toxin-induced breaches within the gut lining allow bacteria (spores and vegetative cells) to reach the internal body cavity, generating a septicemia and subsequent death of the lepidopteran larvae within 2 or 3 days after ingestion of <italic>Btk</italic> spores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mendoza-Almanza et al., 2020</xref>). It is assumed that <italic>Btk</italic> do not harm the intestine of non-susceptible organisms because, first, the intestinal pH is not suitable for the solubilization of the crystal of protoxins and, second, the Cry toxin receptors are absent from their gut epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rubio-Infante and Moreno-Fierros, 2016</xref>).</p><p>However, recent studies provide evidence that <italic>Btk</italic> also exhibits some adverse effects on non-susceptible organisms including humans. Indeed, <italic>Bt</italic> belongs to the <italic>B. cereus</italic> group to which some strains are well-known worldwide food-poisoning pathogens causing diarrheal-type illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jovanovic et al., 2021</xref>). Recently, <italic>Bt</italic> has also been implicated in foodborne outbreak events and the strains identified were indistinguishable from the commercial ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biggel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bonis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johler et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, we have shown that <italic>Btk</italic> spores and toxins at concentrations close to those recovered on vegetables after spraying induce growth defects and developmental delay in <italic>Drosophila larvae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nawrot-Esposito et al., 2020</xref>). Increasing spore and toxin doses ultimately lead to larval lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Babin et al., 2020</xref>). Cry toxins produced by <italic>Btk</italic> are also used in genetically modified crops (GMCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">ISAAA, 2017</xref>), and it has been reported that GMC-produced Cry1Ab toxin is found in agricultural water stream networks at abnormally high doses that may affect the survival rate of non-susceptible insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rosi-Marshall et al., 2007</xref>). In a similar vein, laboratory studies have demonstrated genotoxic activity of Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, and Cry2A in zebrafish rearing water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grisolia et al., 2009</xref>). Based on all these data, our aim in this study was to decipher the interaction of <italic>Btk</italic> and its toxins with the intestinal epithelium using <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, an organism non-susceptible to <italic>Btk</italic> Cry toxin and a well-established model for studying host-pathogen interaction mechanisms.</p><p>Using environmental doses of spores and crystals of protoxins recovered on vegetables after treatment, we first showed that crystals of <italic>Btk</italic> Cry protoxins induced moderate enterocyte death that triggers a quick cell replenishment. We then demonstrated that the crystals diverted a higher number of progenitor cells from their initial EC fate toward an EE fate, generating an excess of EEs. Importantly, this effect was due to a weakened cell-cell interaction between ISC mother cells and progenitor daughter cells. We were able to rescue the crystal-dependent excess of EEs by specifically overexpressing the DE-Cadherin in ISC and progenitor daughters, reinforcing the strength of the adherens junction between these cells. Moreover, we found that among the five <italic>Btk</italic> Cry toxins, only the Cry1A holotype was able to induce this EE excess. Unexpectedly, we observed that <italic>Btk</italic> crystals are processed in the midgut of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> as they are in that of susceptible-organisms, releasing activated Cry1A toxins. Hence, since our data demonstrate that Cry1A toxins disrupt conserved cellular processes, many non-susceptible organisms may exhibit an excess of EEs and consequently a disruption of their enteroendocrine functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crystals of <italic>Btk</italic> Cry protoxins induce EC death and stimulate proliferation of intestinal stem cells</title><p>During sporulation<italic>, Btk</italic> produces a crystal of protoxins that is lethal to lepidopteran larvae once ingested by the insect. To study the <italic>Btk</italic> effects on the non-susceptible organism <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, we orally infected flies with the SA11 <italic>Btk</italic> strain (hereafter named <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic>), which is widely utilized in commercial microbial insecticides. A suspension of spores/crystals in water was deposited on the fly medium corresponding to 10<sup>6</sup> CFU (Colony Forming Unit) of spores per female for 4 cm². The impact on the gut of the spores alone, or the toxins alone, was also monitored using a <italic>Btk</italic> strain devoid of protoxin crystals (<italic>Btk<sup>ΔCry</sup></italic>) or purified crystals, respectively (see Materials and methods).</p><p>The <italic>Gal4/UAS</italic> binary expression control system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>) allowed us to monitor first the effect of the spores/crystals on EC apoptosis by expressing the Caspase 3 sensor Casp::GFP; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schott et al., 2017</xref>) under the control of the <italic>myo1A-Gal4</italic> EC driver (<italic>myo1A&gt;Casp::GFP</italic>). With this transgenic combination, the GFP is detectable only when the Caspase 3 is activated in ECs. As a negative control, we fed flies with water alone. In all our experiments, we focused our observations on the posterior midgut (R4 region, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://flygut.epfl.ch/overview">https://flygut.epfl.ch/overview</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buchon et al., 2013</xref>) because this region is known to show a high stem cell renewal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marianes and Spradling, 2013</xref>) and exhibits the strongest phenotypes (see below).

This prompted us to assess the number of ISC mitoses in the different conditions, using an Anti-phospho-Histone H3 antibody marking mitotic cells. As expected, ISC mitotic indexes were stronger upon oral infection with <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores or purified crystals than in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In <italic>Btk<sup>ΔCry</sup></italic> spore infection, mitotic figures were only moderately increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This is consistent with previous observations showing that a low dose (10<sup>6</sup> CFU per <italic>Drosophila</italic>) of <italic>Btk</italic> vegetative cells (that do not produce and contain crystals of Cry protoxins) only moderately activates ISC proliferation without inducing EC apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loudhaief et al., 2017</xref>). We confirmed this increase in ISC proliferation by analyzing ISC density and proportion in the posterior midgut (R4 region). To specifically mark ISCs, we expressed the GFP under the control of the <italic>Dl-Gal4</italic> driver that is expressed in ISCs and EEPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Joly and Rousset, 2020</xref>), and we co-stained with an anti-Prospero (Pros), an EEP and EE marker (ISCs were therefore GFP+, Pros-). While we observed an increase in ISC number with <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores or purified crystals (both density and ratio increased), <italic>Btk<sup>ΔCry</sup></italic> spores did not induce any increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). This could be explained by the fact that the moderate stimulation of ISC proliferation by <italic>Btk<sup>ΔCry</sup></italic> spores was not sufficient to promote a detectable increase in global ISC number. Nonetheless, to verify that ISC daughter cells committed to a process of differentiation upon <italic>Btk<sup>ΔCry</sup></italic> or <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spore ingestion, we used the ReDDM <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetic tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antonello et al., 2015</xref>) under the control of the <italic>Dl-Gal4</italic> driver (<italic>Dl</italic>-ReDDM). This tool allows us to follow the progeny of the ISCs because they express a stable RFP (H2B::RFP) while the mother cells (the ISCs) express a labile GFP. After shifting the flies to 29 °C to activate the <italic>Dl</italic>-ReDDM tool, the GFP was only expressed in Dl + cells (i.e. the ISCs and EEPs) while the H2B::RFP was expressed in Dl + cells but also stably transmitted to the progeny. We also used an anti-Pros to label EEPs and EEs. Consequently, ISCs were recognized by their expression of both GFP and RFP; EEPs expressed GFP, RFP and Pros, EEs expressed only Pros, EBs and ECs expressed only the RFP. As expected, both <italic>Btk<sup>ΔCry</sup></italic> or <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spore ingestion promoted ISC daughter cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) but surprisingly we observed an abnormal elevated number of EEP doublets upon ingestion of <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spore (see below).</p><p>We next monitored the density and ratio of ECs using the fly strain <italic>myo1A&gt;GFP</italic> allowing the expression of GFP in all ECs. <italic>Btk<sup>ΔCry</sup></italic> spores induced an increase of EC density at days 1 and 3 post-ingestion though their ratio was not altered; the right density of ECs was recovered 5 days after ingestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2A, C</xref>). Along with the low number of dying EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and the moderate induction of ISC proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), our data strongly suggest that <italic>Btk<sup>ΔCry</sup></italic> spores weakly damage the intestinal epithelium, reminiscent of the ‘cell renewal’ process previously described after infection with poorly virulent bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loudhaief et al., 2017</xref>). On the contrary, ingestion of the <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores or purified crystals provoked a decrease in total EC number 3 days post-ingestion (both density and ratio dropped down) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2A, C</xref>) that we attributed to EC apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loudhaief et al., 2017</xref>). A normal number of ECs was restored 5 days post-ingestion for <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores and to a lesser extent for purified crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2A, C</xref>). Hence, <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores or purified crystals launch a process of regenerative cell death, inducing a strong proliferation of ISCs to quickly replenish the gut lining as previously described for strong pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vriz et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, the ingestion of purified crystals containing the <italic>Btk</italic> Cry-protoxins recapitulates the midgut phenotypes caused by the ingestion of <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores.</p><sec id="s2-1-1"><title><italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores induced an increase in EB, EEP and EE numbers</title><p>During the course of our experiments we observed that many more EEs were apparently present in the flies that had ingested <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores compared with the control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). As ECs derive from EBs and EEs from EEPs, we assessed the amount and the identity of the precursors in the different conditions of infection (H<sub>2</sub>O; <italic>Btk<sup>ΔCry</sup></italic> spores, <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores and purified crystals). To count the EBs, we used a <italic>Gal4</italic> strain of <italic>Drosophila</italic> driving GFP expression specifically in EBs (<italic>Su(H)&gt;CD8::GFP</italic>). As expected, a significant increase in the number of EBs was observed between the first and the fifth day after ingestion of <italic>Btk<sup>ΔCry</sup></italic>, <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> or purified crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, D</xref>). The EEP density was assessed using two markers: the GFP expressed in ISCs and progenitors (EBs and EEPs) using the <italic>esg-Gal4</italic> driver (<italic>esg &gt;GFP</italic>) and a Pros staining which labels EEPs and EEs. Cells expressing both GFP and Pros corresponded to EEPs. While <italic>Btk<sup>ΔCry</sup></italic> spores did not modify the density of EEPs, ingestion of either <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores or purified crystals resulted in an increase in EEPs from day one onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). Since EEPs must differentiate into EEs, we then counted the differentiated EEs that were GFP-/Pros+. No difference in EE density was obtained with <italic>Btk<sup>ΔCry</sup></italic> spores compared to the control, whereas there was a net increase with the <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores and with the purified crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> and E, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).

Noticeably, we never observed such an increase in EEPs and EEs in the anterior part of the midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–I</xref>).

We chose to analyze the progeny at day 3 post-ingestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), when the increase in EEs reached its peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). According to the expression of specific cell markers and nucleus size, we could identify different cell types either that existed before the ingestion or that appeared after the ingestion of <italic>Btk<sup>ΔCry</sup></italic> spores, <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores or purified crystals. Identities of the different cell types were defined as follows: ISCs and EBs were GFP+/RFP+/DAPI +with small nuclei (although EBs were bigger cell than ISCs); EEPs were GFP+/RFP+/Pros+/DAPI+; new EEs were RFP+/Pros+/DAPI+; old EEs were Pros+/DAPI+, new ECs were RFP+/DAPI + with big polyploid nuclei and old ECs were DAPI + with very big nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref>&quot;). In the control experiments, a few newborn ECs (red arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and B'</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) and rare newborn EEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) appeared 3 days post-ingestion, reflecting the relative steady state of the cellular homeostasis.

A shorter and/or weaker interaction between the ISC and its progenitor weakly induces the N pathway, pushing the progenitor towards the EE fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guisoni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sallé et al., 2017</xref>). The adherens junctions between ISCs and progenitors formed by E-Cadherins and Connectins intervene to prolong the contact between Dl and N, favoring the EB/EC fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Falo-Sanjuan and Bray, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maeda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhai et al., 2017</xref>). As the consensus receptors for Cry1A toxins in target organisms are members of the Cadherin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adang et al., 2014</xref>), we wondered whether the <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> could interfere with the function of the adherens junctions. We hypothesized that ISC-progenitor interaction could be reduced via interference of Cry toxins with Cadherins, modifying the progenitor cell fate and thus explaining the excess in EE number seen after ingestion of <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores or purified crystals. To test this hypothesis, we labelled the intestines of <italic>esg &gt;GFP Drosophila</italic> fed with <italic>Btk<sup>ΔCry</sup></italic> spores, <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores or purified crystals with the anti-Armadillo (Arm)/β-catenin antibody that strongly marks the adherens junctions. We observed an intense labeling at the level of the junctions between pairs of GFP + cells in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–A’’, E</xref>) or following intoxication by <italic>Btk<sup>ΔCry</sup></italic> spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–B, E</xref>). Strikingly, this labeling became less intense following ingestion of <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores or purified crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>), and correlated with an increase in EEPs number. To verify that weakening of cell junctions corresponded to cell shift towards an EEP fate, we used a <italic>Drosophila</italic> line expressing the endogenous DE-Cadherin (DE-Cad) fused to a Tomato tag in which progenitor cells (ISCs, EBs and EEPs) were labelled with GFP, while EEPs and EEs were marked with Pros (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Using this genetic background, we first confirmed the decrease in the proportion of cells showing strong junctions between pairs of GFP + cells upon feeding with <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores or purified crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Second, as expected, we observed that the weak Tomato::DE-Cad labelling between a GFP + cell (an ISC or an EB) and its neighboring cells was correlated with the expression of the EEP marker Pros (blue stars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D'</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Together, our results suggested that crystals of Cry protoxins produced by <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> are responsible for the increase in the number of EEPs/EEs, this effect being associated with a decrease in intercellular adhesion between ISCs and progenitors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Btk crystals decrease ISC-Progenitor cell-cell adhesion.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) <italic>esg &gt;UAS GFP, Tomato::shg Drosophila</italic> midgut R4 region 24 hr PI of water (A-A” Ctrl), <italic>Btk<sup>∆Cry</sup></italic> spores (<bold>B-B”</bold>), <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores (<bold>C-C”</bold>) or crystals (<bold>D-D”</bold>).

junction strength rescues crystal-dependent cell fate diversion</title><p>To confirm that the crystals of <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> interfered with progenitor fate by disturbing adherens junctions, we wondered whether increasing the strength of cell adhesion between ISCs and progenitors could rescue the right number of EEPs/EEs. Thus, we overexpressed the DE-Cad in these cells using the <italic>esg-ReDDM</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). We analyzed the identity of newborn cells 3 days after ingestion of water (control), <italic>Btk<sup>ΔCry</sup></italic> or <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores, or purified crystals. First of all, we verified that DE-Cad overexpression in ISCs and progenitor cells (<italic>esg +</italic> cells) did not blocked ISC proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Interestingly, in flies overexpressing the DE-Cad fed with <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores or purified crystals, we observed a rescue in the number of EEs (blue arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D'</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In agreement, the number of ISC-progenitor pairs with a strong interaction was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Furthermore, as expected, more newborn ECs appeared (red arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D'</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), strongly suggesting that increasing the cell adhesion between ISCs and progenitors rescued the progenitor fate disturbance generated by the <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> crystals. Surprisingly, overexpressing the Connectin, another cell adhesion molecule, which mediates hemophilic cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhai et al., 2017</xref>), in both ISCs and progenitors did not rescue the number of EEs following feeding with <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores or purified crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The emergence of new Pros + cells were still considerable upon ingestion of <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> or crystals at the expense of new ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2I</xref> and J). Of note, the overexpression of the Connectin in <italic>esg+</italic> cells did not impact ISC proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2K</xref>). To confirm the disturbance of DE-Cad-dependent cell adhesion by purified crystals, we carried out an aggregation assay in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell culture. Indeed, S2 cells do not endogenously express the DE-Cad and display only a weak cell-cell adhesion phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Toret et al., 2014</xref>). Transfection of S2 cells with a plasmid encoding a DE-Cad::GFP fusion resulted in large aggregate formation as early as 1 hr post-agitation (Ctrl in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Adding purified crystals to the cell culture medium strongly reduced the size of aggregates. Interestingly, purified Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac protoxins have the same effect although Cry1Ab needed a longer time to reduce the size of S2 cell aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–H</xref>&quot; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Interestingly, the magnitude of EEP/EE excess was similar using either Cry1Ac crystals or purified activated Cry1Ac toxin (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>), suggesting that Cry1Ac protoxins contained in the crystals were activated in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine. However, the admitted model proposes that protoxins can be activated in vivo only in the intestine of the susceptible lepidopteran owing to the presence of appropriate digestive proteases specifically functioning at the basic pH and reducing conditions encountered in the larval midgut of lepidopteran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pardo-López et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Soberón et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vachon et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore wondered whether the effects we observed in vivo were due to the crystal on its own (i.e. protoxins) or to the activated Cry toxins after processing in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut. We first monitored by western Blot the processing of the Cry1A toxin family in the fly midgut fed with <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores. We used an anti-Cry1A antibody raised against the activated form of the toxin, which therefore recognizes both forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Babin et al., 2020</xref>). As a control, we incubated <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spores in vitro in water, at 25 °C for 4 hr, 1 days, 3 days and 6 days. Under these conditions, the protoxin form of Cry1A at 130kD was predominant and stable for at least 3 days before fading (control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, right part of the blot). This observation is in agreement with the fact that the half-life of Cry1A crystals has been estimated at about 1 week in soil or under laboratory conditions at 25 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hung et al., 2016</xref>). We used the same initial <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> spore preparation (0 hr) to feed the flies. We further dissected intestines and extracted total proteins at different times post-feeding. Interestingly, as early as 4 hr, we observed the 67kD activated form of the Cry1A toxins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> left part). Noteworthy, the 130kD protoxin forms were still present, as the flies kept ingesting spores and crystals throughout the experiments. Six days after ingestion, almost no more protoxins or toxins were detectable due to the instability of the crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, our data show that the crystals can be processed in the midgut of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> to give rise to active forms of the Cry1A toxins.</p><p>As mentioned previously, the increase in EEPs/EEs number was prominent in the posterior midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, it has been previously observed that posterior midgut is more prone to ISC proliferation and EE differentiation or tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beebe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marianes and Spradling, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tamamouna et al., 2020</xref>). Nonetheless, a differential processing of Cry1A protoxins along the midgut could also participate to this difference. Thereby, we fed flies with purified <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> crystals and 24 hr later, we dissected and crushed the intestines by separating the anterior midgut from the posterior part. Furthermore, we performed subcellular fractioning by separating the soluble fraction (considered as the cytosol-enriched fraction) and the insoluble fraction containing membranes. As expected, actin is mainly found in insoluble fraction (lysis buffer detergent-free) and was consequently used as house-keeping protein for this cellular compartment. Interestingly, we observed that protoxins were already activated in the anterior part of the midgut (the 67kD form) but were only found in insoluble fraction, containing membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In the posterior midgut, we detected a stronger quantity of the 67kD-activated form both in the soluble and insoluble fraction, suggesting an internalization by epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In this part of the midgut, smaller forms appeared mainly associated with the membrane, probably resulting from degradation processes. Notably, we did not detect the 130kD protoxins in the cytoplasmic fraction of both anterior and posterior midguts, suggesting that the protoxins remained associated with membranes. Moreover, total processing was never achieved since some protoxins still remained detectable. Altogether, our data show that crystals containing Cry1A protoxins are processed all along the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut to generate activated Cry1A toxins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Cry1A toxins cross the intestinal barrier independently of cell adhesion strength and cell death</title><p>DE-Cad/adherens junctions are located basally in the posterior <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chen and St Johnston, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loudhaief et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">St Johnston and Ahringer, 2010</xref>) and are therefore protected from direct contact with the luminal content (<italic>i.e</italic>. from the Cry1A toxins ingested along with the food) by the septate junctions (i.e. the tight junctions) located apically. To reach the ISC-progenitor pairs that are also located basally within the intestinal epithelium, Cry1A toxins can follow different routes. Indeed, toxins could weaken the septate junctions, penetrating the intercellular space to directly interact with DE-Cadherins. An alternative might be that Cry-induced cell death would cause a leaky midgut favoring the toxin passage. To address this question, we first overexpressed either DE-Cad or Connectin in ECs using <italic>myo1A<sup>ts</sup>-Gal4 UAS-GFP</italic> driver. We assumed that increasing the amount of cell-cell adhesion molecules would strengthen the sealing of the intestinal epithelium, thereby limiting intercellular passage of Cry toxins. As expected, DE-Cad overexpression in ECs partially rescued the increased number of EEs due to <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> or crystal ingestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–G and N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>) while, surprisingly, Connectin overexpression did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H–J and N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). These data suggest that strengthening EC-EC interaction on its own is not sufficient to prevent Cry toxins to reach basal ISC-progenitor cell junctions. However, the partial rescue obtained with the DE-Cad overexpression suggest that DE-Cad in ECs could trap Cry1A toxins away from the ISC-progenitor cell junctions, limiting the amount of toxins able to interfere. We then blocked EC death by overexpressing the anti-apoptotic factor p35 in ECs, but we did not rescue EE increase induced by <italic>Btk<sup>SA11</sup></italic> or crystal ingestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K–N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1J–L</xref>). Together our data suggest that Cry1A toxins can reach the basally located ISC through routes that do not depend on cell adhesion strength or cell death.

Previous studies showed that Cry1A and Cry2A bind to different receptors in the intestinal epithelium of susceptible lepidopteran larvae, and proteins of the Cadherin family appear essential for Cry1A, but not Cry2A, binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hernández-Rodríguez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2018a</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> possesses 17 genes encoding for members of the Cadherin superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hill et al., 2001</xref>). Cad88C is the most similar to Bt-R Cadherin of susceptible Lepidoptera, but shares only 17% of identity, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stevens et al., 2017</xref>) and is poorly expressed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flygutseq.buchonlab.com/">http://flygutseq.buchonlab.com/</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://flygut.epfl.ch/">https://flygut.epfl.ch/</ext-link>). However, Cry1A effects on <italic>Drosophila</italic> progenitor cell fate appear to depend specifically on the DE-Cadherin present in the adherens junctions, since overexpression of DE-Cadherin in progenitor cells (ISCs, EBs and EEPs) can overcome Cry1A-induced impacts while another component of the adherens junctions (Connectin) cannot. Interestingly, the percentage of identity between the Cry1A binding regions (CBRs) shared by the orthologs of Cadherin-type receptors in different susceptible lepidopteran species ranges from 21% to 66% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shao et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, the presence of a well-conserved primary consensus sequence within the CBRs cannot explain the specificity of binding. In agreement, it has been recently shown in susceptible Lepidoptera that only two dipeptides within the CBRs are essential for high-affinity binding of Cry1A to its Cadherin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2018a</xref>). These two dipeptides are not conserved in the CBRs of the Bt-R orthologs in different lepidopteran species targeted by Cry1A toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2021</xref>). These data suggest that binding of Cry1A to the receptor relies more on a conserved conformation of the CBRs than on a conserved primary sequence. In addition, alignment of the <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> (a Cry1A susceptible lepidopteran) CBR sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gao et al., 2019</xref>) and the DE-Cadherin sequence between amino acids 164 and 298 shows 24% identity and 47% similarity (using BlastP, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>). Altogether, these results support a possible binding of Cry1A toxins to <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestinal DE-cadherins, although this could occur with a low affinity.</p><p>Susceptibility of lepidopteran larvae to CryA1 toxins relies on the presence of a secondary receptor such as Alkaline phosphatases, Aminopeptidases N, or ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2018b</xref>). None of the orthologs of these receptors has been shown to be strongly expressed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stevens et al., 2017</xref>), which could explain why binding of Cry1A to DE-cadherins does not lead to the death of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Interestingly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, heterologous expression of ABCC2 from <italic>Bombix mori</italic> or <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic>, or Aminopeptidases N from <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> was sufficient to induce Cry1A-dependent death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gill and Ellar, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Obata et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, heterologous expression of the <italic>Bombix mori</italic> Cadherin Bt-R receptor in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is not sufficient to induce death upon exposure to Cry1A but strongly enhances death when co-expressed with BmABCC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Obata et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these data suggest that, in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> in the absence of a Cadherin receptor displaying a high affinity to Cry1A toxin, endogenous Cadherins with reduced affinity toward Cry1A could step in to enhance the death potential of Cry1A toxins in the context of heterologous expression of a secondary receptor from susceptible Lepidoptera. In agreement, it has been previously demonstrated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae that increasing the dose of ingested <italic>Btk</italic> spores and crystals could ultimately lead to death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Babin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cossentine et al., 2016</xref>), arguing that the receptors (i.e. the Cadherins and the secondary receptors) present in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut have lower affinities for Cry1A toxins.</p><p>Cry toxin activities in susceptible organisms rely not only on the presence of specific host receptors in the midgut, but also on the extreme midgut pH and reducing environment allowing crystal solubilization, as well as the enzymatic capacity of digestive proteins, both of which are involved in the conversion of protoxins into active toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fiuza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mendoza-Almanza et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pardo-López et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shao et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, our data along with another recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stevens et al., 2017</xref>) suggest that crystals can be solubilized and then protoxins activated in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut. Therefore, more investigations will be necessary to understand how crystals are processed and protoxins activated in the intestine of non-susceptible organisms. What makes the difference between Cry-susceptible and non-susceptible organisms is likely the affinity of Cry toxins for midgut host receptors. The higher the affinity of the toxins, the greater the cellular damage/death and the greater the risk of death. In addition, the capacity of regeneration of the midgut epithelium also plays an important role to overcome <italic>Bt</italic> pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Castagnola and Jurat-Fuentes, 2016</xref>). If the regeneration of the intestinal epithelium is more efficient than the destructive capacity of Cry toxins, the host will survive. However, whatever the host is (susceptible or non-susceptible), <italic>Bt</italic> uses a three-pronged strategy to improve its degree of virulence. First, it tries to disrupt the epithelial barrier function by damaging or killing ECs. Second, it diverts the behavior of the progenitor cells toward the wrong fate, thus limiting the amount of ECs produced that are necessary to replace the damaged ones and to maintain the midgut integrity. Third, killing ECs also reduces the capacity of these cells to produce reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides known to be involved in antimicrobial defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allaire et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Capo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim and Lee, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Bt</italic> subspecies <italic>kurstaki</italic> and <italic>aizawai</italic> are widely used as microbial pesticide to fight lepidopteran pests worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Casida and Bryant, 2017</xref>), both subspecies partially producing the same Cry1A toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Caballero et al., 2020</xref>). Likewise, 180 millions of hectares of genetically modified crops express Cry1A toxins. Consequently, Cry1A toxins are present in the food, the feed and in the environment, implying that many organisms might be affected. As the mechanisms of intestinal progenitor fate choice are conserved in the animal kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Joly and Rousset, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zwick et al., 2019</xref>), it would be interesting to investigate whether Cry1A toxins can also promote an increased number of EEs in other organisms (vertebrates and invertebrates). EEs, through the production of neuropeptides and hormones, are involved in the regulation of many physiological functions such as feeding behavior, metabolism and immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nässel and Zandawala, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Watnick and Jugder, 2019</xref>). Consequences of this increase in EE number could be, for example, metabolic dysfunctions or inflammatory pathologies. More studies are needed to understand the physiological impacts of this change in intestinal cellular composition on organismal health.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains</title><p><italic>Btk<sup>∆Cry</sup></italic> (identified under the code 4D22, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">González et al., 1982</xref>), <italic>Btk<sup>Cry1Ac</sup></italic> (identified under the code 4D4), and the <italic>E. coli</italic> strains producing Cry1Ac (identified under the code ECE53), Cry1Ab (identified under the code ECE54) and Cry2Aa (identified under the code ECE126) were obtained from the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bgsc.org/">https://bgsc.org/</ext-link>).

We tested this cell line for contamination of mycoplasma (MycoFluor Mycoplasma Detection Kit, Invitrogen). We have not tested cell line identity because (1) S2 is the only cell line used in our lab and in a dedicated culture cell room, (2) this is the only <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell line present at the institute, (3) all experiments were conducted using the same batch of initial frozen ampoule received from the DGRC, and (4) transfection results were compared with control data experiment conducted in the same culture passage at the same time. S2 cells were cultured in Schneider’s medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 25 °C in a non-humidified ambient air-regulated incubator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gallet et al., 2006</xref>). For S2 aggregation assay, 2.2 10<sup>6</sup> cells were plated in 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flask for each condition. After 6 hr, transient transfection was performed by mixing transfection reagent (TransIT–2020; Mirus Bio) with a reagent-to-DNA ratio of 3:1. A total of 3 µg plasmid DNA per T25 was used, corresponding to a 5:1 mixture of pUAST-DEFL and pWA-GAL4. Approximately 46 hr after transfection, the cells were collected into 15 mL tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 400 g. The pellet was resuspended in 2 mL of fresh medium supplemented in CaCl<sub>2</sub> to obtain a final concentration of 7.4 mM and separated into single cells by repeated pipetting. Of this cell suspension, 500 µL were added to a well of a 24-well microplate. To allow cell-cell adhesion (aggregation), the microplate was placed under constant agitation on a rotary platform at 150 rpm at 25 °C for the indicated time (1 hr, 2 hr, and 3 h) with or without protoxins (at a final concentration 35 µg/mL). Cell aggregates formed in the wells were observed using an inverted Fluorescent microscope (Nikon, Eclipse TE2000-U). Images for the florescence of GFP was acquired using a CCD camera (ORCA ER, Hamamatsu Photonics). The same parameter settings were used to acquire images (objectives, gain, exposure time …). The area of fluorescent aggregates and individual cells were measured using Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). The average area of a S2 cell in our condition is about 15.5 µm<sup>2</sup>. Hence, quantification of the aggregates area was performed excluding all objects smaller than 15 µm<sup>2</sup>. The mean area of aggregates were calculated after background subtraction. Three independent experiments were performed for each condition. Values in µm<sup>2</sup> were represented in GraphPad Prism 7 software as scatter-plot view. Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism 7 software. The significance of the difference between CTR and exposed conditions was assessed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc tests.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis toxins divert progenitor cells toward enteroendocrine fate by decreasing cell adhesion with intestinal stem cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Arturo Casadevall as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Karen Bellec (Reviewer #1); Young Kwon (Reviewer #2); Yiorgos Apidianakis (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. In several instances (e.g. Figure 1D, Figure 2 C and D), conclusions about changes in numbers of cells are based upon plots that count number of cells per unit area. However, cell number per unit area is a measure of cell density, not overall cell number. Please either provide total cell counts for a defined midgut region (e.g. R4), or else modify these conclusions. Alternatively, the ratio of particular cell types to total cells could be helpful as a measure of the relative abundance of different cell populations. In addition, could images that illustrate overall organ morphology be included? Such information would provide a sense of the relative sizes of the organs.</p><p>2. Please provide evidence to support the use of the Δ-ReDDM system as a readout of symmetric versus asymmetric fate outcomes. (a) Does degradation of the ReDDM GFP signal occur in the same time frame as activation of the enteroblast-specific SuH marker? (For instance, is ReDDM GFP signal absent from SuH-lacZ cells in both control and experimental conditions?) (b) Cell contact was used to classify two progenitor cells as siblings from the same mother stem cell division. Please either justify this claim or else revise the interpretation of these data. (c) Can you respond to Reviewer 3's question about co-expression of two GFP transgenes in the Δ-ReDDM genotypes?</p><p>3. Please address the Reviewers' requests for improved data presentation. (individual values in graphs, scale bars in images, loading controls for Westerns, etc). In addition, please quantify the correlation between Tomato::DE-Cad and EEP markers (described in lines 283-284).</p><p>4. The Reviewers raised questions about visibility and interpretation of the Arm, E-cad, and caspase signals in multiple figure panels. In cases where improved visibility would be helpful, please present split channel images. In cases where alternative interpretations are raised (e.g., could Arm levels be affected by proliferation rate?), please evaluate these alternatives either through new data or textual discussion.</p><p>5. Please clarify the methodological details requested by the Reviewers. (a) Better descriptions are needed of how quantitative analyses were performed. (b) In some cases, the criteria used to identify particular cell types or populations were ambiguous (e.g. new cells versus old cells, sibling cells versus neighbor cells, diploid enteroblasts identified via nuclear size), (c) To avert reader confusion, might you consider referring to enteroendocrine cells by the standard abbreviation EE, rather than EEC?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Data representation</p><p>Different figures should be modified to improve the representation of the data all along the manuscript:</p><p>– Authors should plot individual values in the graphs shown all along the manuscript instead of using histograms.</p><p>– Scale bars should be included both in the pictures and in the legends.</p><p>– Figure 5G-G': errors bars should put in another color. The scale of the graph could be changes to have a better overview of the distribution of the different points.</p><p>For each figure, the signification of the error bars (sd or sem, etc..) should be included in the legends and/or in the Material and Methods.</p><p>2) Experiments</p><p>– Loading controls of the Western blots are missing: authors should provide a control to indicate that the same amount of sample has been loaded in each condition by staining another protein. This is particularly true for the Western blots shown in Figure 6D and Figure 6E</p><p>– Figure S1A-S1B: How were the authors able to confirm that two cells came from the same mother cell? This question is particularly true for BtkSA11 where there is a lot of neighboring labelled cells. Details about the way to quantify should be added in the Material and Methods (quantification in a small area only? n=number of divisions analyzed?)</p><p>Same figure: The picture of Btk∆Cry seems to show lot of symmetric cell divisions giving rise to cells that are GFP+RFP+Pros- (=ISCs) but surprisingly, the Figure 1C does not show this increase.</p><p>– L181: Authors conclude: &quot;Therefore, consistent with previous studies, the mode of ISC division appeared to reflect the degree of intestinal damage, the symmetric mode being preferentiality adopted when the damage was greater (i.e., when cell death occurred).&quot; This mode of division seems to be also preferentially adopted when there is intestinal damage but no cell death, as in the case of Btk∆Cry.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, the manuscript is in a good shape.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The described work is about assessing <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut histopathology upon consumption of an entomopathogenic strain of B. thuringiensis and its Cry1A toxins, which are lethal to lepidoptera, but non-lethal to <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Thus, <italic>Drosophila</italic> is characterized a non-susceptible organism. The authors tested if this &quot;non-susceptible host&quot; is nevertheless histopathologically susceptible. They convincingly show that it is, because the mechanism of action of the Cry1A toxins on progenitor cell E-Cadherin is functionally (but not biochemically) revealed in flies and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells.</p><p>To improve the manuscript, I suggest the following:</p><p>1. Add &quot;<italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut&quot; in the title, because generalizations need to be omitted.</p><p>2. Lines 89-92: reference to B. cereus should not add to the proof about Btk. So need to phrase this accordingly. Different species and different strains have different effects.</p><p>3. Figure 1A: how do Caspase 3 sensor and Caspase 3 antibody compare? While both are of a value, the authors measure the first, but show the latter. Why?</p><p>4. Dl-ReDDM experiments: The M and Ms read &quot;w; tub-GAL80ts; Dl-GAL4 UAS-GFP/TM6b females were crossed to w; UAS-GFP::CD8; UAS-H2B::RFP/TM6 males&quot;. This means that the progeny express two different UAS-GFP transgenes, right? This issue applies also to ReDDM experiments with the other GAL4 lines. What is the perdurance of UAS-GFP in each case and in combination with UAS-GFP::CD8?</p><p>5. Line 224: Why the authors chose esg-ReDDM flies instead of Dl-ReDDM? The latter makes clear what ISC is, while esg based ReDDM confuses the distinction between ISC and EB.</p><p>6. Line 229: &quot;EBs were GFP+ RFP+ DAPI+ with bigger nuclei&quot;. Why bigger? EBs are presumably diploid.</p><p>7. Figure S3: The terms &quot;old cells&quot; and &quot;new cells&quot; seems misleading, because by &quot;old cells&quot; the authors mean EEs of Su(H)-independent origin and by &quot;new cells&quot; EEs of Su(H)-dependent origin.</p><p>8. Lines 293-4: &quot;the decrease in Tomato::DE-Cad 283 labelling between an ISC and its progenitor was correlated with the expression of EEP markers&quot;. The authors should measure the extend of this correlation. Also, neighboring esg+ cells do not equal &quot;ISC and its progenitor&quot;.</p><p>9. The following statement is imprecise &quot;we no longer observed an increase in the number of EECs (blue arrows in Figure 5A-D, and Figure 5E)&quot;. Comparing Figure 3F and Figure 5E, there is an increase in EEs in both cases, but the increase is more prominent in 3F.</p><p>10. I suggest replacing the term EEC(s) with EE(s) to abide to previous nomenclature and make it easier to distinguish from the term EEP(s).</p><p>11. Figure panels 5G and S5I are missing from the PDF available for this review.</p><p>12. Figure S2I (&quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; pros+ cells are plotted together) refers to the anterior midgut only and to see what is going on in the posterior is unclear (information is not plotted). One needs to extrapolate maybe by comparing with Figure 3F (&quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; pros+ cells are plotted separately).</p><p>13. Lines 363-4. To explain the discrepancy between the anterior and the posterior midgut in terms of EEs and their progenitors, the authors should resort to Tamamouna et al. 2020 (PMID: 32513656) and Marianes and Spradling 2013 (PMID: 23991285), where such gut compartmentalization and anterior vs. posterior mitosis and propensity for EE and ISC accumulation has been thoroughly discussed.</p><p>14. Line 492. What does &quot;fortuitously mean? How was the selection process arranged? Was there a random mutagenesis involved?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;<italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> toxins divert progenitor cells toward enteroendocrine fate by decreasing cell adhesion with intestinal stem cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Arturo Casadevall (Senior Editor) and by Lucy O'Brien (Reviewing Editor), in consultation with the three original reviewers.</p><p>We all agreed that the revised manuscript addresses many, but not all, of the Essential Revision Items raised in the first round of review. In particular, concerns about cell density (Essential Revision Item #1) have been addressed, and the manuscript is much improved in terms of the data presentation and methodological detail (Essential Revision Items #3-5).</p><p>However, the overall consensus was that fundamental concerns still remain about the classification of division fate outcomes in the manuscript (Essential Revision Item #2). The authors were requested to perform two important controls to justify their classification: (1) examine whether degradation of the Δ-driven ReDDM GFP signal occurs in the same time frame as activation of an enteroblast-specific SuH marker, such as Su(H)-lacZ, and (2) justify their claim that progenitor cells that are in contact are sibling cells. As we explain in detail below (&quot;Essential Revision Item #2 – Rationale&quot;), the Response does not adequately address either of these points. Hence, we are not able to recommend the publication of the manuscript in its current form.</p><p>In light of the fact that fate outcomes are only one aspect of the study's overall conclusions, and that experiments to demonstrate division fate outcomes would represent substantial additional effort, we may consider publication if the authors were willing to revise their manuscript so as to refrain from drawing conclusions regarding symmetric and asymmetric fates. (It would be acceptable to include a speculative statement about fate outcomes, clearly indicated as such.) Without textual revisions that address these issues, or without new, direct evidence as originally requested, we are sorry that we are unable to move forward with this manuscript.</p><p>In addition, a few other items arose during the consultation; these can all be addressed by textual revision:</p><p>– Findings from prior studies described in lines 167-171 are described inaccurately (see explanation below), and two papers that contradict the authors' assertion were not cited.</p><p>– Other portions of the manuscript, such as the Figure 7 results, draw conclusions that are not supported by data. Careful revision of the study's results to avoid over-interpretation and to make clear distinctions between data-based conclusions and interesting, but speculative, remarks will also be necessary for a revised manuscript to be considered further.</p><p>– The title appears to be missing a &quot;the&quot;. Two grammatically correct alternatives would be:</p><p>&quot;Bacillus thuringiensis toxins divert progenitor cells toward enteroendocrine fate by decreasing cell adhesion with intestinal stem cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut&quot; or &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis toxins divert progenitor cells toward enteroendocrine fate by decreasing cell adhesion with intestinal stem cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot;</p><p>Essential Revision Item #2 – Rationale</p><p>(1) In terms of Point (1) above, the authors did not perform the requested experiment to examine whether degradation of the Δ-driven ReDDM GFP signal occurs in the same timeframe as activation of an enteroblast-specific SuH marker. Instead, they offer two alternative justifications for the validity of their current approach. However, as detailed below, neither of these justifications is valid.</p><p>The first justification the authors give for drawing conclusions about cell identity from ReDDM hinges on the half-life of GFP in the ReDDM system being less than 24 hours. The authors cite Antonello 2015 as evidence for the &lt; 24-hour half-life, but a quantitative measurement of GFP half-life in the Antonello study could not be identified in either the main figures or the supplemental figures. (If this is mistaken, please point out where these data are found in the paper.) In addition, the authors also claim that since they examined tissues two days after ReDDM induction, the GFP transmitted to most daughter cells has begun to be degraded. This statement appears to assume that all cell divisions happened at the time that ReDDM was induced. However, this assumption is erroneous. Stem cells continue to cycle throughout the two-day post-induction period, and with fixed tissues, it cannot be ascertained when during the two-day period a division actually occurred. It is likely that some stem cell divisions occurred a short time prior to fixation.</p><p>The second justification that the authors provide is two images of DeltaGAL4-driven ReDDM showing that, following feeding with the Btk mutant, there is an increased number of GFP-/RFP+ cells compared to control guts. In both images, the authors designate the GFP-/RFP+ cells as enteroblasts and the GFP+/RFP+ cells as stem cells, and they conclude there are more enteroblasts following Btk treatment because there are more red cells. Without a positive marker of enteroblast fate, however, the authors' reasoning is neither scientifically nor logically valid. Crucially, enteroblasts are not defined by the absence of Δ (for instance, loss of Δ does not result in loss of stem cells, but rather results in excess stem cells and enteroendocrine cells -- Ohlstein 2007 Science). Instead, enteroblasts are defined by the activation of Notch targets such as the Su(H)GBE Notch reporter. Hence Notch activation and Δ downregulation are not necessarily synchronous. Rather, Δ downregulation may lag behind Notch activation, such that new enteroblasts transiently exist in a Δ-positive, Notch-activated state. Indeed, Zhai 2017 PLoS Geneticsand Tian 2022 EMBO J have found that under injury conditions there is a marked increase in Su(H)+ enteroblasts that are also Δ+.</p><p>(2) In terms of Point (2) above, the authors do not present data to support the claim that a GFP-/RFP+ cell adjacent to a GFP+/RFP+ cell is the division progeny of the GFP+/RFP+ cell, and they state that two days after induction is too short a time frame for enteroblasts to come into contact with a stem cell that is not its mother stem cell. By contrast, Martin 2018 (<italic>eLife</italic>), which analyzed stem cell divisions in live movies, found that approximately one-third of sibling cells separate from each other after birth. The duration of these movies was ~16 hours, which is much shorter than the 2-day period the authors used. In addition, Martin et al. observed that some of these sibling cells subsequently associated with other progenitor cells. These findings undermine the authors' assertion and underscore the importance of performing lineage tracing to deduce lineage relationships. While we appreciate that some other journals have previously published midgut studies that assume progenitor cell pairs are siblings, our view is that publication in <italic>eLife</italic> requires more rigorous evidence such as lineage tracing or direct monitoring of live divisions.</p><p>Finally, the statement that &quot;upon environmental challenges, ISCs divide symmetrically&quot; (Author's response and manuscript lines 167-171) is not supported by the literature. The deNavascues 2012, Goulas 2012, Perdigoto 2011, and Tian 2014 studies examine homeostasis only; hence, these results do not speak to what happens when there are environmental challenges. In addition, Goulas and Perdigoto do not explicitly examine asymmetric versus symmetric division fate outcomes. O'Brien 2011 examined feeding-induced growth, which is not an environmental challenge but rather a normal physiological mechanism; hence, these results also do not speak to what happens upon environmental challenges. Although Zhai 2017 speculates on symmetric fate outcomes in the discussion, no conclusions are drawn about the fate outcomes of cell pairs in the data presented in the Results section.</p><p>By contrast, there are two studies that did examine division fate outcomes in injured guts, and that were not cited in either the Response or the manuscript: Jin 2017 (Stem Cell Reports) and Tian 2017 (PNAS). Both studies used Twin-spot MARCM – the gold standard for symmetric/asymmetric division fate outcomes – and found that the majority of divisions still exhibit asymmetric fate outcomes following injury. Their injury conditions of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infection and bleomycin ingestion are arguably in a similar realm to the current study's Btk treatment. Their results contradict the authors' assertion that stem cells divide symmetrically following environmental challenges and raise the possibility the authors' method is inaccurate.</p><p>Additional remarks from individual reviewers follow below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Thanks to the authors for addressing the questions raised in the previous reviews and for their detailed answers.</p><p>In the previous reviews, we highlighted the lack of some quantifications; controls, and information about the methods of analysis for some key experiments (Arm staining; rescue experiments..). The authors addressed all the questions when experimentally possible and modified the text accordingly. They also modified the graphs as suggested. Altogether, these modifications greatly improved the manuscript and reinforced the conclusions proposed by the authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have appropriately addressed most of the comments. However, I have a concern regarding the results presented in Figure 7. The results raise interesting ideas about how toxins might reach ISCs. The presented experiments do not directly test the ideas. Therefore, the conclusions are not appropriately supported. I suggest the authors revise the text to clearly separate the conclusions drawn from the experimental data and their speculations. Alternatively, the whole data can be removed as those are not essential for the story.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Taking the authors' words (in their response to reviewers): &quot;ISCs mostly divide asymmetrically while upon environmental challenges ISCs divide symmetrically (de Navascues et al., 2012; Goulas et al., 2012; O'Brien et al., 2011; Perdigoto et al., 2011; Tian and Jiang, 2014; Zhai et al., 2017)&quot;. Thus, being responsive to Bacillus thuringiensis infection and its Cry1A toxins does not equal B. thuringiensis being a hazard to <italic>Drosophila</italic> or other flies. Such treatments merely elicit a defense response against damaging agents, which are mild enough for flies to cope with (survive). I suggest the authors refrain from conclusions (should there be any) about B. thuringiensis being very hazardous to flies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80179.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

So even if GFP expressed in ISCs might be transmitted to EB daughter cells, the GFP intensity in EBs would be very week due to the short half-life of GFP. Since we took pictures 2 days after ReDDM induction (see Figure 1 —figure supplement 1D), we assume that the GFP transmitted to most of EB daughter cells has begun to fade. Indeed, increasing the intensity using Zeiss or Photoshop software allows to distinguish a weak GFP staining in the putative EBs. However, we consider this faint staining as background.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows a Dl-ReDMM midgut fed with water (Control), 2 days after temperature shift at 29°C (i.e. the induction of GFP and RFP).

Therefore, an EEP GFP+/RFP+/Pros+ in direct contact with an ISC GFP+/RFP+ has most likely inherited the GFP from this neighboring ISC. A GFP-/RFP+ cell with a small nucleus (an EB) contacting a GFP+/RFP+ ISC is likely to be its daughter cell. Although we can imagine that a GFP-/RFP+ EB contacting an GFP+/RFP+ ISC could arise from a distant GFP+/RFP+ ISC, we took images 2 days after induction of the ReDDM system limiting the time frame allowing a distant EB to come in close contact to an ISC which is not its mother cells. This is explained in the text lines 172-187.</p><p>Moreover using these criteria, we found ratio of symmetric/asymmetric divisions close to what it has been previously described: ISCs mostly divide asymmetrically while upon environmental challenges ISC divide symmetrically (de Navascues et al., 2012; Goulas et al., 2012; O'Brien et al., 2011; Perdigoto et al., 2011) (Tian and Jiang, 2014; Zhai et al., 2017).

When Dl-Gal4 drives the expression of one GFP allele, the GFP is weakly expressed (see the expression of the CD8::GFP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>, red labelling is Prospero). Therefore, this led us to use two GFP copies in order to label most mother cells in the Dl-ReDDM experiments. In addition, if the GFP was weakly detectable while the RFP was strongly expressed, these cells would have been considered as progenies and not as mother cells. Of note, we also combined the membrane tethered (GFP::CD8) and a nuclear GFP to increase the probability to detect the cells.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80179-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Similarly, we expressed two copies of the GFP in the Su(H)-ReDDM experiments to track most EBs (mother cells).

Instead, they offer two alternative justifications for the validity of their current approach. However, as detailed below, neither of these justifications is valid.</p><p>The first justification the authors give for drawing conclusions about cell identity from ReDDM hinges on the half-life of GFP in the ReDDM system being less than 24 hours. The authors cite Antonello 2015 as evidence for the &lt; 24-hour half-life, but a quantitative measurement of GFP half-life in the Antonello study could not be identified in either the main figures or the supplemental figures. (If this is mistaken, please point out where these data are found in the paper.) In addition, the authors also claim that since they examined tissues two days after ReDDM induction, the GFP transmitted to most daughter cells has begun to be degraded. This statement appears to assume that all cell divisions happened at the time that ReDDM was induced. However, this assumption is erroneous. Stem cells continue to cycle throughout the two-day post-induction period, and with fixed tissues, it cannot be ascertained when during the two-day period a division actually occurred. It is likely that some stem cell divisions occurred a short time prior to fixation.</p><p>The second justification that the authors provide is two images of DeltaGAL4-driven ReDDM showing that, following feeding with the Btk mutant, there is an increased number of GFP-/RFP+ cells compared to control guts. In both images, the authors designate the GFP-/RFP+ cells as enteroblasts and the GFP+/RFP+ cells as stem cells, and they conclude there are more enteroblasts following Btk treatment because there are more red cells. Without a positive marker of enteroblast fate, however, the authors' reasoning is neither scientifically nor logically valid. Crucially, enteroblasts are not defined by the absence of Δ (for instance, loss of Δ does not result in loss of stem cells, but rather results in excess stem cells and enteroendocrine cells -- Ohlstein 2007 Science). Instead, enteroblasts are defined by the activation of Notch targets such as the Su(H)GBE Notch reporter. Hence Notch activation and Δ downregulation are not necessarily synchronous. Rather, Δ downregulation may lag behind Notch activation, such that new enteroblasts transiently exist in a Δ-positive, Notch-activated state. Indeed, Zhai 2017 PLoS Geneticsand Tian 2022 EMBO J have found that under injury conditions there is a marked increase in Su(H)+ enteroblasts that are also Δ+.</p><p>(2) In terms of Point (2) above, the authors do not present data to support the claim that a GFP-/RFP+ cell adjacent to a GFP+/RFP+ cell is the division progeny of the GFP+/RFP+ cell, and they state that two days after induction is too short a time frame for enteroblasts to come into contact with a stem cell that is not its mother stem cell. By contrast, Martin 2018 (eLife), which analyzed stem cell divisions in live movies, found that approximately one-third of sibling cells separate from each other after birth. The duration of these movies was ~16 hours, which is much shorter than the 2-day period the authors used. In addition, Martin et al. observed that some of these sibling cells subsequently associated with other progenitor cells. These findings undermine the authors' assertion and underscore the importance of performing lineage tracing to deduce lineage relationships. While we appreciate that some other journals have previously published midgut studies that assume progenitor cell pairs are siblings, our view is that publication in eLife requires more rigorous evidence such as lineage tracing or direct monitoring of live divisions.</p><p>Finally, the statement that &quot;upon environmental challenges, ISCs divide symmetrically&quot; (Author's response and manuscript lines 167-171) is not supported by the literature. The deNavascues 2012, Goulas 2012, Perdigoto 2011, and Tian 2014 studies examine homeostasis only; hence, these results do not speak to what happens when there are environmental challenges. In addition, Goulas and Perdigoto do not explicitly examine asymmetric versus symmetric division fate outcomes. O'Brien 2011 examined feeding-induced growth, which is not an environmental challenge but rather a normal physiological mechanism; hence, these results also do not speak to what happens upon environmental challenges. Although Zhai 2017 speculates on symmetric fate outcomes in the discussion, no conclusions are drawn about the fate outcomes of cell pairs in the data presented in the Results section.</p><p>By contrast, there are two studies that did examine division fate outcomes in injured guts, and that were not cited in either the Response or the manuscript: Jin 2017 (Stem Cell Reports) and Tian 2017 (PNAS). Both studies used Twin-spot MARCM – the gold standard for symmetric/asymmetric division fate outcomes – and found that the majority of divisions still exhibit asymmetric fate outcomes following injury. Their injury conditions of Pseudomonas infection and bleomycin ingestion are arguably in a similar realm to the current study's Btk treatment. Their results contradict the authors' assertion that stem cells divide symmetrically following environmental challenges and raise the possibility the authors' method is inaccurate.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the editors for the exhaustive bibliographic analysis they provided. We are agreeing that the methods we used cannot provide solid conclusions on the mode of ISC division upon Bt/toxin ingestion and more experiments are required. Since the mode of ISC division is not the focus of our work and is not linked to the main message of our publication, we followed the editor’ suggestion and therefore modified the text by removing all the sentences referring to the mode of ISC division. We hope the changes we have made are satisfactory now and have taken into consideration all the points raised by the reviewers and editors regarding the division fate outcomes upon Bt/toxin ingestion.</p><p>We have modified the text lines 48-49, 110, 161-174, 242 and 610.
