extracellular domain at 1.35Å. We combined these data with known bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channel structural insights and novel functional studies to determine the interactions of specific residues in β2 with Na<sub>v</sub>1.2. We identified a flexible loop formed by <sup>72</sup>Cys and <sup>75</sup>Cys, a unique feature among the four β-subunit isoforms. Moreover, we found that <sup>55</sup>Cys helps to determine the influence of β2 on Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 toxin susceptibility. Further mutagenesis combined with the use of spider toxins reveals that <sup>55</sup>Cys forms a disulfide bond with <sup>910</sup>Cys in the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 domain II pore loop, thereby suggesting a 1:1 stoichiometry. Our results also provide clues as to which disulfide bonds are formed between adjacent Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 <sup>912/918</sup>Cys residues. The concepts emerging from this work will help to form a model reflecting the β-subunit location in a Na<sub>v</sub> channel complex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10960.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10960.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10960.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our bodies run on electricity. The brain, heart and some other organs depend on small electrical signals that are generated by ions moving through specialized protein complexes that sit in the membrane surrounding a cell. One of these channels is a ‘sodium channel’, through which positively charged sodium ions move. Tiny changes in the structure of the sodium channel can cause severe conditions such as epilepsy and heart arrhythmias, so it is crucial that we know how it works</p><p>Sodium channels consist of different protein building blocks (called α and β) and it was not known exactly how these come together to form the full channel complex. However, previous studies hinted at which parts of the β building block make contact with the α protein.</p><p>Now, Das, Gilchrist et al. have been able to visualize the three-dimensional structure of the β building block of the sodium channel in extremely high detail by using a technique called X-ray crystallography. The level of detail in the structure also allowed the amino acids that make up the β building block to be identified.</p><p>Das, Gilchrist et al. then altered some of the amino acids in the sodium channel, and treated frog cells containing the mutant channel with a spider toxin that binds between the α and β building blocks. This revealed the location and identity of the exact contact points between the proteins. In the future, a full three-dimensional structure showing the α and β subunits bound together would yield invaluable information on how they cooperate to form the sodium channel complex and give insights into mutations that cause cardiac arrhythmias and epilepsy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10960.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10960.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>voltage-gated sodium channel</kwd><kwd>beta2 subunit</kwd><kwd>scn2b</kwd><kwd>spider toxin</kwd><kwd>X-ray structure</kwd><kwd>disulfide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01NS091352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bosmans</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-119404</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van Petegem</surname><given-names>Filip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGY0064/2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bosmans</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name><name><surname>Van Petegem</surname><given-names>Filip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004411</institution-id><institution>Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>Samir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31NS084646</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilchrist</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>X-ray crystallography reveals new conceptual insights into the location of the β2-subunit in the Na<sub>v</sub> channel signaling complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>v</sub>) channels are part of membrane-embedded signaling complexes that initiate the rising phase of action potentials, a crucial event in generating and propagating electrical signals throughout the human body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hille, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Catterall, 2012</xref>). As key components of these protein assemblies, β-subunits (1) modify Na<sub>v</sub> channel-gating properties; (2) regulate channel trafficking and localization to distinct surface compartments; and (3) influence channel oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calhoun and Isom, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Namadurai et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, β-subunits can alter the toxin pharmacology of Na<sub>v</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilchrist et al., 2014</xref>), a concept that has been exploited to detect their presence in heterologous expression systems or native tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilchrist et al., 2013</xref>). Structurally, β-subunits are single-transmembrane segment glycoproteins with a short cytoplasmic C-terminal tail and a large V-type immunoglobulin (Ig) extracellular domain that may participate in homophilic and heterophilic interactions, cell adhesion, and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calhoun and Isom, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Namadurai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brackenbury et al., 2008</xref>). Although all β-subunits belong to the Ig family, recent atomic resolution information for the β3 and β4 extracellular domain revealed substantial differences in their 3D structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilchrist et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Namadurai et al., 2014</xref>). Given their distinct features and functional roles, it has now become clear that each β-subunit structure should be obtained and assessed separately. Of the four known β-subunits and their splice variants (β1–4; gene names <italic>Scn1b</italic>-<italic>Scn4b</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Isom et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Isom et al., 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morgan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patino, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yu, 2003</xref>), β2 and β4 form a disulfide bond with an unidentified Cys within particular Na<sub>v</sub> channel isoforms. In contrast, non-covalent interactions underlie β1 and β3 association with Na<sub>v</sub> channels as well as other members of the voltage-gated ion channel family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calhoun and Isom, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Namadurai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marionneau, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nguyen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deschenes et al., 2008</xref>). Aberrant behavior of the ubiquitously expressed β2 and β4 subunits has been linked to disorders such as long-QT syndrome, atrial fibrillation, sudden infant death syndrome, and epilepsy, possibly through dysregulation of the Na<sub>v</sub> channel signaling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Medeiros-Domingo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Watanabe et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, β2 has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders and neuropathic pain and is therefore of potential interest for developing novel therapeutic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O'Malley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lopez-Santiago, 2006</xref>). Finally, β2 is targeted by secretase enzymes, an observation that suggests a potential contribution to Alzheimer's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gersbacher et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Despite accruing evidence supporting their clinical relevance, fundamental questions on the causal relationship between β2 mutations and disorders remain unanswered. In contrast, auxiliary proteins are the topic of herculean research efforts in other fields where their role as vital contributors to cellular function or in forming drug receptor sites is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Copits and Swanson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gee et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milstein and Nicoll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dolphin, 2012</xref>). To begin to appreciate β2 function and lay the foundations for constructing an interacting model with Na<sub>v</sub> channels, we first need to define the mechanism by which β2 regulates Na<sub>v</sub> channel function. In particular, knowledge of the relative orientation of both partners will help to assess whether a mutation modifies channel function or influences complex assembly. To this end, we solved the crystal structure of the extracellular β2 domain at 1.35Å and found a <sup>55</sup>Cys-containing binding region that modulates Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 toxin susceptibility by β2. Next, we exploited a combination of Na<sub>v</sub> channel mutagenesis, biochemistry, and β2-induced alterations in spider toxin pharmacology to uncover a disulfide bond between <sup>55</sup>Cys and a partnering Cys located in the domain II S5-S6 pore loop of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2. Remarkably, Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 and close relatives Na<sub>v</sub>1.8/Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 do not possess a corresponding Cys, which may explain a lack of β2 effect on Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 toxin pharmacology. In concert with the available structural information on bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Payandeh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shaya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), our results provide conceptual insights into the location of the β2-subunit in the Na<sub>v</sub> channel-signaling complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crystal structure of the human β2 extracellular region</title><p>To begin to understand the functional relationship between human (h)β2 and hNa<sub>v</sub> channels at an atomic level, we solved the crystal structure of the extracellular hβ2 domain at a resolution of 1.35Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The construct encompasses residues 30–153 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and contains a single Cys mutation (C55A) to facilitate crystallization [The C55A mutation is located on the protein surface and therefore unlikely to affect the overall structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,d</xref>).]. The hβ2 configuration displays an Ig-like fold, consisting of eleven β-strands and three 3<sub>10</sub> helices. Other than the mutated Cys (C55A), this domain contains four additional cysteines that are arranged in two bonds. The first, intra-subunit bond, is strictly conserved among all four β-subunit isoforms and is mediated by <sup>50</sup>Cys and <sup>127</sup>Cys buried within the core where it links two opposing faces of the protein. The second intra-subunit bond is located within a loop that spans residues 70–77 and connects strand β<sub>5</sub> to β<sub>6</sub> via <sup>72</sup>Cys - <sup>75</sup>Cys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>). This loop constitutes a unique feature of hβ2 since corresponding cysteines are absent in β1, β3, and β4. Remarkably, this region displays a dual conformation in the crystal structure which indicates a high degree of flexibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10960.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of hβ2.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cartoon representation of the hβ2 (C55A) extracellular domain crystal structure, showing β strands in gold and 3<sub>10</sub> helices in red.

Aside from the distinct <sup>72</sup>Cys - <sup>75</sup>Cys disulfide bond, there are extensive variances in loop lengths and β strands, indicating that hβ2 and hβ4 have diverged substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,c</xref>). Yet, at a protein sequence level, hβ2 is most closely related to hβ4 (26% identical; 48% conserved) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,e</xref>). Of note is that the N-terminal region of hβ2 is structured rather than disordered in hβ4, adding an additional short β strand (β<sub>1</sub>) which interacts with the novel β<sub>4</sub> strand. The strand following the unique disulfide bond is shortened in hβ2 and two additional 3<sub>10</sub> helices can be seen, whereas one that is present in hβ4, no longer exists in hβ2. A comparison with the hβ3 structure also shows substantial divergence in loop lengths at particular locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>). The hβ3 extracellular domain misses the additional N-terminal β-strand; instead, its N-terminus is anchored via a disulfide bridge between <sup>26</sup>Cys and <sup>48</sup>Cys, resulting in positional shifts in excess of 15Å.</p><p>We previously found that <sup>58</sup>Cys on the surface of β4 is crucial in modulating Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 susceptibility to toxins from spider and scorpion venom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilchrist et al., 2013</xref>). The hβ2 subunit possesses a corresponding Cys at position 55 that is located in a longer loop which may result in an altered spatial position of this residue when compared to hβ4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>). In addition, the residues immediately N-terminal to <sup>55</sup>Cys are stabilized through a β-strand interaction between strands β<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>4</sub>, both of which are absent in hβ4. Taken together, these observations suggest that the environment of this key Cys may differ in both isoforms. To further examine the coupling of hβ2 to hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2, we next determined the functional role of <sup>55</sup>Cys as well as that of <sup>72</sup>Cys and <sup>75</sup>Cys.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mutating <sup>55</sup>Cys in hβ2 restores hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 toxin susceptibility</title><p>Previously, we and others discovered that β-subunits can manipulate the pharmacological sensitivities of Na<sub>v</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilchrist et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doeser et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, β4 is capable of dramatically altering animal toxin binding to rat (r)Na<sub>v</sub>1.2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilchrist et al., 2013</xref>). For example, the spider toxin ProTx-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Middleton et al., 2002</xref>) binds to voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) I, II, and IV in rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosmans et al., 2008</xref>), and is ∼five-fold less potent when β4 is present. [An intriguing concept is that ProTx-II may also bind directly to β4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gee et al., 1996</xref>); however, our isothermal calorimetry experiments do not support this notion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).] To examine whether this protective ability extends to hβ2, we expressed hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and measured ProTx-II susceptibility without or in the presence of the β-subunit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similar to β4, we observe that the hβ2 subunit expresses abundantly and traffics to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) where it is able to reduce the degree of hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 current inhibition by ProTx-II. Specifically, 100 nM ProTx-II reduces hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 conductance to ∼17% of peak whereas the current remaining in the presence of hβ2 is typically more than ∼64% of peak conductance, thereby demonstrating a protective effect. Other gating parameters such as conductance-voltage (G–V) and channel availability relationships are unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Next, we sought to determine if <sup>55</sup>Cys in hβ2 is involved in reducing hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 susceptibility to ProTx-II by mutating this residue to an Ala. Indeed, the C55A mutant traffics to the membrane and causes ProTx-II inhibition of hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 to resemble that of the wild-type (WT) channel without hβ2 present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although Ala wields a small side chain and is often employed in mutagenesis studies, we also replaced <sup>55</sup>Cys with a Ser, as it most closely resembles Cys in terms of size and electric properties. Similar to WT hβ2 and C55A, the C55S mutation impaired neither channel expression nor surface trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, the extent of ProTx-II-induced hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 inhibition in the presence of C55S is indistinguishable from that of the channel alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Altogether, these results support the notion that hβ2 conveys ProTx-II protection to hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 via <sup>55</sup>Cys and may relate to previous work in which the loss of the covalent link between rβ2 and hNa<sub>v</sub>1.1 disrupts the targeting of rβ2 to nodes of Ranvier and to the axon initial segment in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10960.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Effect of hβ2 on hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 toxin pharmacology.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Co-expression of hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 with hβ2 decreases the degree of inhibition by 100 nM ProTx-II.

Remarkably, this additional loop is highly conserved in almost all species that express β2, suggesting an evolutionary conserved contribution to function (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine if this loop regulates the gating or pharmacological influence of hβ2 on hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2, we mutated <sup>72</sup>Cys and <sup>75</sup>Cys to Ala (C72A C75A) but found that it is functionally indistinguishable from WT hβ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The C72A C75A mutant localizes to the oocyte membrane surface without or with hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 co-expression. Moreover, typical gating parameters and hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 inhibition by 100 nM ProTx-II in the presence of C72A C75A is similar to that observed for the channel when co-expressed with WT hβ2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). The lack of effect of the C72A C75A mutant on hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 function suggests that this disulfide bond is not essential for folding, and that its disruption may not significantly affect the position or environment of <sup>55</sup>Cys. To verify this hypothesis, we produced recombinant hβ2 extracellular domain containing three Cys mutations: C55A, C72A, and C75A. Size exclusion chromatography demonstrates that the mutant produces monomeric protein, indicating that the bond between <sup>72</sup>Cys and <sup>75</sup>Cys is unessential for folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Furthermore, we obtained a crystal structure of the triple mutant at 1.85Å which overlays well onto the C55A structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The only significant difference is situated in the loop containing both cysteines, which now displays a single conformation. Although the spatial organization of this loop does not seem to impact the ability of hβ2 to modulate hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 gating or sensitivity to ProTx-II, this region may yet play a functional role in modulating other Na<sub>v</sub> channel isoforms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The S5-S6 loop in domain II of hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 contains an anchoring point for hβ2</title><p>Although previous work has postulated the involvement of the domain II (DII) S5-S6 pore loop as the region responsible for forming an inter-subunit disulfide bond between particular Na<sub>v</sub> channel isoforms and β2 or β4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gajewiak et al., 2014</xref>), the precise residue has remained elusive. To explore the possibility of an hβ2 anchoring point in this region, we individually replaced each of the three cysteines found here (<sup>910</sup>Cys, <sup>912</sup>Cys, and <sup>918</sup>Cys) with Ser. When expressed without or with WT hβ2, the C910S mutant exhibits the same degree of inhibition by 100 nM ProTx-II, indicating that the protective effect of hβ2 is lost and that <sup>910</sup>Cys is a critical residue for hβ2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To evaluate this hypothesis, we constructed a set of double Cys to Ser mutations (C910S C912S, C910S C918S, and C912S C918S) and examined the effects on ProTx-II susceptibility without and in the presence of hβ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). According to previous work with rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a, mutating <sup>912</sup>Cys or <sup>918</sup>Cys results in a bridge between <sup>910</sup>Cys and the remaining intact cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). These experiments were carried out without a β2 subunit and with GVIIJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gajewiak et al., 2014</xref>), a unique μO§-conotoxin that directly competes for binding to <sup>910</sup>Cys; however, the rest of its binding site remains unexplored. In our hands, high concentrations of GVIIJ are needed to achieve an effect, and efficacy towards hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 is augmented in case of the C910S mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), two complicating factors that made us revert to ProTx-II which is more potent and has clearly delineated binding sites within Na<sub>v</sub>1.2. Our experiments on these double mutants show a much clearer picture wherein hβ2 only protects against ProTx-II when <sup>910</sup>Cys is intact: the C912S C918S mutant still has lowered toxin susceptibility whereas C910S C912S and C910S C918S are completely inhibited by 100 nM ProTx-II, suggesting that these mutants no longer bind hβ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that <sup>910</sup>Cys is the disulfide bond partner of <sup>55</sup>Cys in hβ2, while <sup>912</sup>Cys and <sup>918</sup>Cys could form an intra-subunit bridge. At first sight, the C912S data which show the split population appear in conflict with this interpretation. However, it is conceivable that losing the <sup>912</sup>Cys- <sup>918</sup>Cys bond results in the formation of a non-native bond between <sup>910</sup>Cys and <sup>918</sup>Cys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Indeed, when <sup>918</sup>Cys is mutated in addition to <sup>912</sup>Cys, <sup>918</sup>Cys again allows toxin protection by hβ2 similar to WT, suggesting it has become available again. The data also indicate that a non-native disulfide bond between <sup>910</sup>Cys and <sup>912</sup>Cys may not occur in the C918S mutant, likely because such a Cys-Val-Cys disulfide bond could be too constrained. Importantly, hβ2 cannot protect the C910S C918S or the C910S C912S mutants from 100 nM ProTx-II, indicating that neither <sup>912</sup>Cys nor <sup>918</sup>Cys can compensate for the loss of <sup>910</sup>Cys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).<sup>918</sup></p><p>To biochemically verify that Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 and β2 are covalently bound, we expressed the closely related and well-expressing rat variants (∼99% sequence identity) in oocytes and immunoprecipitated the rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a/rβ2 complex. It is worth noting that WT myc-tagged rβ2 can form higher-order oligomers under non-reducing conditions, which may complicate the interpretation of immunoblots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, these oligomers disappear upon removal of <sup>55</sup>Cys, further highlighting the reactivity of this residue. Notwithstanding this phenomenon, probing crude cell lysate uncovers a clear co-migration of myc-tagged rβ2 with rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a under non-reducing conditions, since co-expression yields a distinct myc-stained band above the highest rβ2 oligomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Substitution of either <sup>55</sup>Cys in rβ2 or <sup>910</sup>Cys in rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a with Ser results in the loss of this covalent complex. Furthermore, the presence of DTT completely abolishes the rβ2-rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a complex as well as the rβ2 oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Thus, these results confirm our toxin experiments and suggest the formation of a disulfide bond between <sup>910</sup>Cys in the DII S5-S6 linker of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 and <sup>55</sup>Cys in β2. In addition to investigating the interaction of rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a and rβ2 in crude lysate from injected oocytes, we also pulled down rβ2 with an antibody directed against the C-terminal myc-tag and treated with DTT before loading onto a tris-acetate gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). In this experiment, we observe that WT rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a is present only when co-expressed with WT rβ2. Moreover, both <sup>910</sup>Cys within the channel and <sup>55</sup>Cys in rβ2 are required for co-immunoprecipitation, thereby pointing to their role in forming a disulfide bond between both subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10960.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Biochemical verification of the β2 and β4 disulfide bond with <sup>910</sup>Cys in Na<sub>v</sub>1.2.</title><p>Top rows indicate particular Na<sub>v</sub> channel and β-subunit constructs with which oocytes were injected.

Labels on left column indicate which antibody was used to immunoblot the associated slice. (<bold>a</bold>) Western blot run under non-reducing conditions reveals a fraction of rβ2 migrating with WT rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a but not after selective cysteine substitution. Crude lysate from injected oocytes was run on a protein gel and probed for both the channel and the myc-tag of the β-subunit. The top PanNav slice and bottom myc slice show the expression of the respective proteins in lysates from oocytes injected with the indicated constructs. Even though equal quantities of protein was loaded in each lane (10 μg), the C910S channel mutant expresses less bountifully than the WT channel and as a result shows a weaker signal. The WT β-subunit can form redox-sensitive multimers that migrate at an apparent mass similar to that of the Na<sub>v</sub> channel. Mutation of <sup>55</sup>Cys prevents multimer formation and disappearance of the high molecular weight band. Open arrows identify bands representing Na<sub>v</sub> channel-bound β-subunit and aid in distinguishing them from the multimeric β-subunit. Substituting <sup>910</sup>Cys within rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a with Ser causes a loss of the channel-bound β-subunit band. rβ4 also binds to WT rNav1.2a, as evidenced by a second band, and no longer interacts with the C910S mutant. (<bold>b</bold>) Addition of DTT prevents both binding of rβ2 to the channel and formation of β-subunit multimers. The absence of myc signal at the same apparent weight as rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a indicates that binding to the channel is sensitive to reduction. In all cases, α-tubulin was used as a loading control. (<bold>c</bold>) WT rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a co-immunoprecipitates with rβ2 and rβ4. The β-subunit was pulled down with an antibody directed against a C-terminal myc-tag and treated with DTT before loading onto the gel.

To examine this notion, we measured ProTx-II susceptibility of rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a and its C910S mutant expressed in oocytes without or with the rβ4-subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Analogous to hβ2, we observe rβ4 protein production in oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>) where it is able to influence the degree of rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a current inhibition by ProTx-II. In particular, 100 nM ProTx-II reduces rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a conductance to ∼22% of peak whereas the current remaining in the presence of rβ4 is ∼55% of peak conductance. Other gating parameters such as G–V and channel availability relationships are unaffected. In case of the C910S mutant, the presence of rβ4 no longer decreases ProTx-II efficacy (from ∼22% current inhibition to ∼17%, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>), thus illustrating the likely role of rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a <sup>910</sup>Cys in forming a disulfide bond with rβ4 <sup>58</sup>Cys. In concert, (co-)immunoprecipitation experiments with rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a and rβ4 expressed in oocytes indicate that both partners are covalently bound and that mutating <sup>910</sup>Cys in the channel indeed disrupts the disulfide bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10960.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Mutation of <sup>910</sup>Cys in rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a disrupts rβ4 influence on ProTx-II effect.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Replacement of <sup>910</sup>Cys with Ser in rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a impairs the ability of rβ4 to protect against 100 nM ProTx-II inhibition in a manner similar to that of hβ2.

Although hβ2 seems to be anchored to the DII pore forming region, ProTx-II was previously shown to target VSDs I, II, and IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosmans et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that the protective effect of hβ2 is through occlusion of the ProTx-II binding site in one or more of these regions. In order to determine which one, we assembled a set of animal toxins that, together, interact with VSDI, II, and IV in Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosmans et al., 2008</xref>), and tested whether or not their function is influenced by hβ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). A previous study in which rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a S3b-S4 paddle loops from each domain (I-IV) were transplanted into a homotetrameric K<sub>v</sub> channel to identify the VSDs with which toxins interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosmans et al., 2008</xref>), found that the tarantula toxin PaurTx3 and scorpion toxin AahII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martin et al., 1987</xref>) exclusively target VSDII and VSDIV, respectively. In addition, the tarantula toxins ProTx-I and ProTx-II both interact with the voltage sensor in DII and DIV, whereas ProTx-II also binds to DI with high affinity. Here, we tested these four toxins on hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 without and with hβ2 to determine if the presence of the subunit impacts toxin function. Aside from ProTx-II, we observe no significant difference in PaurTx3, AahII, or ProTx-I effect which suggests that hβ2 does not impede binding of these toxins to VSDII and VSDIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 8—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that hβ2 primarily influences VSDI and as such, is located near this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>). Since μO§-conotoxin GVIIJ function is also influenced by hβ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gajewiak et al., 2014</xref>), it will be interesting to investigate a possible VSDI binding site for this toxin. While our data are limited by the absence of VSDI- and VSDIII-specific toxins and do not exclude the possibility of non-overlapping binding sites for a particular toxin and hβ2 on the same VSD, or of direct competition for binding to the DII S5-S6 loop, they may yet prove valuable as insights into hβ2 function accrue.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10960.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>hβ2 influences hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 VSDI toxin pharmacology.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cartoon illustrating the binding site of AaHII, PaurTx3, ProTx-I, and ProTx-II within the VSDs of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2.

Although we obtained the first crystal structure of the hβ4 extracellular region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilchrist et al., 2013</xref>), the second reported structure of the corresponding hβ3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Namadurai et al., 2014</xref>) highlights the unique character of each β-subunit isoform. Since the ability to compare the distinct organizational features of β-subunits will provide valuable information as to their difference in action, we now obtained detailed structural information for the extracellular domain of hβ2 at a resolution of 1.35Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We identified a flexible loop formed by <sup>72</sup>Cys and <sup>75</sup>Cys that is a unique feature among β-subunits but with a function that has yet to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, hβ2 contains a Cys at position 55 that, when mutated, disrupts the influence of hβ2 on hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 toxin pharmacology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–d</xref>). Next, we combined mutagenesis and biochemical studies with spider and scorpion toxins that target specific VSDs within Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilchrist et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosmans et al., 2008</xref>) to probe the interaction with hβ2. As a result, we found that <sup>55</sup>Cys forms a distinct disulfide bond with <sup>910</sup>Cys located in the domain II S5-S6 loop of hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2, thereby revealing a 1:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also exploited this toxin-reporter approach to investigate the possibility of intra-subunit disulfide bond formations between <sup>910</sup>Cys, <sup>912</sup>Cys, and <sup>918</sup>Cys in hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2, three reactive residues that are in close vicinity to each other. The outcome of these experiments indicates that <sup>912</sup>Cys and <sup>918</sup>Cys form an intra-subunit bridge in WT hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). When mutating <sup>918</sup>Cys, hβ2 still interacts with <sup>910</sup>Cys whereas substituting <sup>912</sup>Cys suggests the possibility for bond formation between <sup>910</sup>Cys and <sup>918</sup>Cys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, hNa<sub>v</sub>1.5 lacks these three cysteines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>) and as a result, ProTx-II is equipotent without or in the presence of hβ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b–e</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>) This outcome provides evidence that this particular β-subunit may not modulate hNa<sub>v</sub>1.5 in heterologous systems or that binding occurs through a different mechanism in native tissues. In concert, immunocytochemical studies in the heart and electrophysiological measurements in mammalian cell lines or oocytes disagree on whether hβ2 can modulate hNa<sub>v</sub>1.5 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson and Bennett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zimmer and Benndorf, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dhar Malhotra et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maier et al., 2004</xref>). As opposed to native cardiomyocytes, hNa<sub>v</sub>1.5 may not associate with hβ2 upon heterologous expression, a hypothesis that is supported by co-localization experiments in HEK293 cells where hNa<sub>v</sub>1.5 and hβ2 were mainly found in the endoplasmatic reticulum or plasma membrane, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zimmer et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>So far, none of the hβ2 mutations implicated in disorders have been found close to <sup>55</sup>Cys, as they are located either in the signal peptide or near the transmembrane region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Medeiros-Domingo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Watanabe et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, amino acid substitutions in the DII S5-S6 pore loop of particular Na<sub>v</sub> channel variants are linked to diseases. For example, more than 30 mutations have been identified within this region in hNa<sub>v</sub>1.1, several of which relate to Dravet syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Claes et al., 2009</xref>). This includes C927F (corresponding to <sup>918</sup>Cys in hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2), and other variants which introduce an additional Cys that may interfere with local disulfide bond pattern formation. Therefore, it is conceivable that DII S5-S6 linker mutations may affect channel interactions with hβ2 or hβ4.</p><p>Collectively, our results uncover the disulfide link between hβ2 and hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 which opens up the possibility to assign a potential orientation of this subunit in relation to the channel and provide an experimental basis for future docking efforts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>). hβ2 may position itself in the gaps between VSDs where it can interact with a voltage sensor as well as anchor to a pore-forming region. One important observation from bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channel crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Payandeh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Payandeh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shaya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) is the domain-swapped architecture of the channel in which the S1-S4 VSD within one subunit is located adjacent to the S5-S6 segments of the next subunit. Such a structural clockwise arrangement has also been consistently observed in prokaryotic and mammalian K<sub>v</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Long et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>). Since hNa<sub>v</sub> channels may be organized in a similar fashion, the determinants of hβ2-subunit sensitivity can be located in multiple Na<sub>v</sub> channel domains. For example, we found that hβ2 binds to <sup>910</sup>Cys in the S5-S6 loop of DII and influences ProTx-II interaction with VSDI. Although it is challenging to pinpoint its precise location, our data suggest that hβ2 is positioned in the cleft between VSDIV and VSDI or VSDI and VSDII where it is presented with an opportunity to interact with both determinants to influence ProTx-II action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>). In contrast, the consistent picture emerging from the literature is that Na<sub>v</sub> channel fast inactivation and voltage-dependence of activation changes substantially when co-expressed with the β1-subunit in heterologous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Cannon, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCormick et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isom et al., 1995b</xref>). Given the pivotal role of VSDIV in channel fast inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosmans et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chanda and Bezanilla, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sheets et al., 1999</xref>), β1 may be positioned close to VSDIV where it can also interact with the extracellular S5-S6 pore-loop within DI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>), a presumed interacting region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Makita et al., 1996</xref>). Altogether, this model suggests that particular Na<sub>v</sub> channel isoforms can interact simultaneously with a β1- and β2-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calhoun and Isom, 2014</xref>). Future experiments will further investigate the possible locations of β3 and β4 in this model as well as allow the incorporation of mutational effects which is essential to uncover the contribution of β-subunit mutations to human disorders or contribute to small molecule screening efforts geared towards disrupting or facilitating subunit interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Production of the hβ2 extracellular domain</title><p>Human β2 (residues 30–153) was cloned into a modified pET28 vector (pET28HMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Van Petegem et al., 2004</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Binary architecture of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2-β2 signaling complex&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Das et al., present a structure of a truncated hβ2 subunit structure at ~1.4A and provide functional evidence that the β2 subunit is covalently attached to the α subunit. The structure is of residues 30-153, with a Cys mutation (C55A) to facilitate crystallization. hβ2 has an Ig-like fold, consisting of eleven β-strands and three 310 helices. This domain contains four additional cysteines that are arranged in two bonds, the first intra-subunit bond is conserved among all four β-subunit isoforms and is mediated by <sup>50</sup>Cys and <sup>127</sup>Cys buried where it links two opposing faces of the protein. The second intrasubunit bond is in a loop that spans residues 70-77 and connects strand β5 to β6 via <sup>72</sup>Cys <sup>75</sup>Cys. This loop is a unique feature of hβ2 since corresponding cysteines are absent in β1, β3, and β4.</p><p>In functional studies in which the hβ2 subunit is expressed in oocytes, the authors argue that the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 alpha subunit is bound by a disulfide link between C55 of the β2 subunit and C910 of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 alpha subunit.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were generally positive about publication, but have two major points to address before resubmission. Specifically:</p><p>1) In order to show crosslinking convincingly the authors need to show biochemically that the α and β subunits are covalently bound (by an immunoblot running at the combined weight of the proteins for example), and that this is reducible by DTT and interrupted selectively by mutation of the cysteines in question. The function alone only shows that both Cys are involved in the toxin effect, it is plausible that they both interact individually with the toxin and not each other.</p><p>2) All the immunoblots shown need to show loading controls. Quantification of the membrane fraction would substantially strengthen the argument.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10960.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions: The reviewers were generally positive about publication, but have two major points to address before resubmission.

When we started these experiments however, it quickly became clear that obtaining biochemical evidence of a Nav channel:β-subunit complex is far from trivial. We experimented with a range of conditions (published by others and non-published) but were unable to generate satisfying data within the two-month revision period. Nonetheless, we persisted in our efforts and in the two months thereafter, we managed to clearly show that rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a and rβ2 form a covalent bond that can be disrupted by mutating <sub>910</sub>Cys and <sub>55</sub>Cys, respectively (an extensive description of the methods has been added to the manuscript). Moreover, we extended these experiments to include rβ4 and found that this subunit can also form a disulfide bond with <sup><sub>910</sub></sup>Cys in rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a. Finally, we noticed that β2 can form multimers that disappear under reducing conditions or after mutating the reactive <sup><sub>55</sub></sup>Cys to Ser. To our knowledge, this potentially complicating factor in interpreting immunoblots has not yet been reported. As such, the manuscript has been substantially revised to include these data:</p><p><italic>“</italic>To biochemically verify that Nav1.2 and β2 are covalently bound, we expressed the closely related and well-expressing rat variants (~99% sequence identity) in oocytes and immunoprecipitated the rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a/rβ2 complex. […] In this experiment, we observe that WT rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a is present only when co-expressed with WT rβ2. Moreover, both <sup><sub>910</sub></sup>Cys within the channel and <sup><sub>55</sub></sup>Cys in rβ2 are required for co-immunoprecipitation, thereby pointing to their role in forming a disulfide bond between both subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).”</p><p>“(Co-)immunoprecipitation experiments with rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a and rβ4 expressed in oocytes reveal that both partners are covalently bound and that mutating <sup><sub>910</sub></sup>Cys in the channel or <sup><sub>58</sub></sup>Cys in the β-subunit indeed disrupt the disulfide bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).”</p><p><italic>2) All the immunoblots shown need to show loading controls. Quantification of the membrane fraction would substantially strengthen the argument.</italic></p><p>We certainly agree with the reviewers that immunoblots should show loading controls and have therefore added an α-tubulin control to the newly added experiments described above (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As far as the other immunoblots in the manuscript are concerned, adding a loading control to those experiments would require doing every experiment again, including the electrophysiological tests to which the blots relate. Since these blots 1) clearly show a qualitative presence of β-subunits in the membrane (which goes beyond most of the reports found in the literature); and 2) result from an equal amount of protein loaded onto the gel each time (10μg), we feel that these immunoblots present an added value in their current form.</p></body></sub-article></article>
