through effector domains. Effector domain/histone interactions have been broadly studied, but largely using peptide fragments of histone tails. Here, we extend these studies into the nucleosome context and find that the conformation adopted by the histone H3 tails is inhibitory to BPTF PHD finger binding. Using NMR spectroscopy and MD simulations, we show that the H3 tails interact robustly but dynamically with nucleosomal DNA, substantially reducing PHD finger association. Altering the electrostatics of the H3 tail via modification or mutation increases accessibility to the PHD finger, indicating that PTM crosstalk can regulate effector domain binding by altering nucleosome conformation. Together, our results demonstrate that the nucleosome context has a dramatic impact on signaling events at the histone tails, and highlights the importance of studying histone binding in the context of the nucleosome.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31481.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human genome contains all the instructions needed to build the human body. However, each human cell does not read all of these instructions, which come in the form of genes encoded in the DNA. Instead, different subsets of genes are switched on in each type of cell, while the rest of the genes are switched off.</p><p>DNA within human cells is wrapped around proteins called histones, to form hundreds of thousands of structures called nucleosomes. If the DNA that encodes a gene contains a lot of nucleosomes, the DNA is not very accessible and the gene will generally be off; removing the histones or rearranging the nucleosomes can turn the gene on.</p><p>Each histone contains a region called a tail – because it protrudes like the tail of a cat – that can be chemically modified in dozens of different ways. Particular combinations of histone modifications are thought to signal how the nucleosomes should be arranged so that each gene is properly regulated. However, it is unclear how these combinations of modifications actually work because, historically, it has been difficult to study tails in the context of a nucleosome. Instead most studies had looked at tails that had been removed from the nucleosome.</p><p>Now, Morrison et al. set out to investigate how one protein, called BPTF, recognizes a specific chemical modification on the tail of a histone, referred to as H3K4me3, in the context of a human nucleosome. Unexpectedly, the experiments showed that the histone-binding domain of BPTF, which binds to H3K4me3, was impeded when the tail was attached to the nucleosome but not when it was removed from the nucleosome. Morrison et al. went on to show that this was because the histone tail is tucked onto the rest of the nucleosome and not easily accessible. Further experiments revealed that additional chemical modifications made the tail more accessible, making it easier for the histone-binding domain to bind.</p><p>Together these findings show that a combination of histone modifications acts to positively regulate the binding of a regulatory protein to H3K4me3 in the context of the nucleosome by actually regulating the nucleosome itself. The disruption of the histone signals is known to lead to a number of diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disease, and neurological disorders, and these findings could guide further research that may lead to new treatments. Yet first, much more work is needed to investigate how other histone modifications are recognized in the context of the nucleosome, and how the large number of possible combinations of histone signals affects this process.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nucleosome</kwd><kwd>histone tail</kwd><kwd>PHD Finger</kwd><kwd>methylation</kwd><kwd>NMR Spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>MD Simulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1452411</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Musselman</surname><given-names>Catherine A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1552743</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowerman</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name><name><surname>Wereszczynski</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000997</institution-id><institution>Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>Emma A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM119647</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wereszczynski</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The BPTF PHD finger is inhibited from binding the methylated H3 tails in the context of the nucleosome due to their robust interaction with the nucleosomal DNA, which can be modulated by additional histone PTMs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic DNA is packaged into the cell nucleus in the form of chromatin. This DNA/histone complex contributes to DNA compaction and restricts its accessibility, also providing a mechanism for regulating the genome. Dynamic modulation of chromatin structure is vital in all DNA-templated processes. The basic subunit of chromatin is the nucleosome, comprised of an octamer containing two copies each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, around which ~ 147 bp of DNA is wrapped. The N-termini of all four histones, as well as the C-terminus of H2A, protrude to the exterior of the nucleosome core and are commonly referred to as histone tails. These tails can be extensively post-translationally modified, which is thought to be critical in regulation of chromatin structure. Genome-wide studies have revealed that particular post-translational modifications (PTMs) are correlated with specific genomic states and/or elements, and notably, strong correlations have led to the suggestion that it is patterns of PTMs that are functionally important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zentner and Henikoff, 2013</xref>). Though some histone tail PTMs have been found to directly affect chromatin array compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang and Hayes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mishra et al., 2016</xref>), most are thought to act through indirect mechanisms, by recruiting regulatory complexes to modified nucleosomes or modulating their activity once there. Modified histone tails are recognized by effector domains, often referred to as histone readers. A large number of families of histone effector domains have been identified over the past two decades including bromodomains, chromodomains, and PHD fingers, and these often exist in multiples within chromatin regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Musselman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2016</xref>). A wealth of studies have examined the structural determinants of effector domain specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Musselman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2016</xref>). However, due to difficulties in crystalizing these domains in complex with modified nucleosomes, the mechanism of histone binding has largely been studied with peptides corresponding to segments of the histone tails.</p><p>Biochemical studies suggest that the histone tails are highly solvent accessible, and the large majority of crystal structures of the nucleosome do not resolve the tails, suggesting a high degree of conformational heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Böhm and Crane-Robinson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rosenberg et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). This is further supported by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies, in which the histone tails are found to have a high degree of conformational flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2013</xref>). Together, this has led to a model of the nucleosome where the tails are extended into solution and fully accessible. If correct, this would suggest that effector domain binding to a nucleosome versus a histone tail peptide should be largely similar. However, there is also ample evidence that the histone tails stabilize nucleosome structure and alter DNA binding. In particular, histone tails have been shown to alter transcription factor accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Polach et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2005</xref>), thermal stability of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ausio et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iwasaki et al., 2013</xref>), and DNA wrapping/unwrapping rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andresen et al., 2013</xref>). There has also long been evidence that the tails can interact with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cutter and Hayes, 2015</xref>) (in some studies quite robustly), including a recent study in which it was found that the tails transiently interact with linker DNA, inhibiting the activity of histone modifying enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stützer et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, in the one crystal structure of the nucleosome where the tails are resolved, several of them are associated with the DNA of crystallographic symmetry mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davey et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, in silico all-atom studies of the nucleosome have repeatedly suggested that the histone tails collapse onto core DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biswas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li and Kono, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shaytan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ikebe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chakraborty and Loverde, 2017</xref>), and tail dynamics have been correlated with the DNA unwinding process through free energy calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kenzaki and Takada, 2015</xref>). Thus, our current understanding of the histone tail conformation within the nucleosome is incomplete, and we know very little about how effector domains recognize histone tails in the context of the nucleosome.</p><p>Here, we utilize NMR spectroscopy to investigate the interaction of a PHD finger with the nucleosome, specifically, the BPTF (bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor) PHD finger. The BPTF PHD finger is a well-characterized histone effector domain that recognizes the first 6 residues of the histone H3 tail, with specificity for tri-methylated lysine 4 (H3K4me3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2006</xref>). We find that in the context of the nucleosome, the PHD finger association with the methylated H3 tail is inhibited. Using NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we demonstrate that this inhibition is due to the conformation of the H3 tail within the nucleosome. Our data support a model where the H3 tails are collapsed onto the nucleosome core through robust interaction with DNA. However, they adopt an ensemble of heterogeneous DNA-bound conformations that are in fast exchange between one another, reconciling that they can be both DNA bound and have a high level of conformational flexibility. Furthermore, we find that modification or mutation of H3 tail residues outside the PHD finger binding region weakens tail association with DNA and increases accessibility to the PHD finger. This suggests that PTM cross-talk may be mediated by histone tail conformation within the nucleosome. Altogether, our data reveal a far more complex interface for effector domain binding as compared to histone peptides, and demonstrates that it is critical to characterize these associations in the proper context.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The nucleosome inhibits association of the BPTF PHD finger with the H3 tail</title><p>In order to determine how the context of the nucleosome may affect the association of PHD fingers with the histone H3 tail, we utilized NMR spectroscopy to compare binding of the BPTF PHD finger to histone tail peptide and the nucleosome core particle (NCP). Specifically, we collected sequential <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (<sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC) spectra on <sup>15</sup>N-PHD upon titration of increasing concentrations of a methylated histone tail peptide or a methylated nucleosome.</p><p>Addition of a peptide corresponding to H3 residues 1–10 methylated at lysine 4 (H3(1–10)K4me3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2C</xref>) to <sup>15</sup>N-PHD resulted in extensive chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) in resonances for residues in the binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) as previously determined by NMR and crystallographic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2006</xref>). The pattern of CSPs observed as a function of peptide concentration denotes low μM affinity and is consistent with previously reported affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2006</xref>). The methylated nucleosome was generated using a methyl lysine analogue (MLA) at histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-NCP) using human histones and the 147 base pair (bp) Widom 601 DNA sequence. Importantly, mass spec analysis of the H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3 protein demonstrated that alkylation at position four was complete, with no evidence of over-alkylation, or carbamylation due to refolding in urea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Addition of H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-NCP to <sup>15</sup>N-PHD led to CSPs indicating binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, center). Compared to the peptide, the same set of resonances is perturbed, and the majority of resonances track along the same trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). This demonstrates that the mode of interaction between the PHD finger and H3 tail in the context of the NCP is the same as observed for free histone tail peptide and that the PHD finger does not make any significant contacts with other histone tails or the NCP core. The latter is further confirmed by demonstration that binding is dependent on methylation, as seen by titration of unmodified NCP into <sup>15</sup>N-PHD, which does not result in any significant CSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31481.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Binding of the BPTF PHD finger to H3K4me3 is inhibited in the context of the nucleosome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overlay of a region of the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC (or TROSY-HSQC) spectra of 50 μM <sup>15</sup>N-BPTF PHD upon titration of H3(1–10)K4me3 (left), H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-NCP (center), or H3(1–44)K<sub>C</sub>4me3 (right).

The NCP solution causes a change in response signal when sensors loaded with either avitag-PHD or buffer-only are dipped into the NCP sample wells, which becomes very large with the 230 μM NCP. This was interpreted as a change in the optical properties of the solution, which was likely caused by the viscosity of NCP samples.

At the same ‘analyte’ concentration, H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-NCP (which should result in a significantly larger BLI response signal upon binding due to the significantly larger size) elicits minimal response. At 10-fold higher concentration of H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-NCP, there is still minimal response signal.

If the mode of interaction between the PHD finger and NCP is identical to the PHD-H3(1–10)K4me3 complex, as is suggested by the equivalent CSP trajectories, then the chemical shift values of the fully bound state should be identical. Under this assumption, the small shift towards the bound state seen for the NCP indicates that binding in the context of the NCP is dramatically weaker.</p><p>In general, the MLAs are robust mimetics of methylated lysines, but in some cases, they bind substantially weaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seeliger et al., 2012</xref>). A recent study extensively compared the interaction of the BPTF PHD finger with a histone peptide containing a true methylated lysine versus one containing the MLA. Though a crystal structure revealed the mechanism of association is largely the same, the authors reported a loss in binding affinity of about an order of magnitude for the MLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we first sought to ensure that the weaker binding observed for the H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-NCP was not simply due to the analogue itself. To do this, we produced an MLA version of the histone tail alone, H3(1–44)K<sub>C</sub>4me3 (which we will refer to as H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-Tail). Titration of the analogue-containing H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-Tail into <sup>15</sup>N-PHD resulted in large CSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right), immediately suggesting that the analogue is not the sole cause of the minor CSPs observed for H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-NCP. Consistent with Chen et al., binding to the MLA-containing peptide was moderately weaker as denoted by the pattern of CSPs for a subset of residues changing from intermediate (seen with the true methylated lysine) to fast exchange on the NMR time-scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Importantly, the residues perturbed are identical between the two peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), though comparison of spectra of the PHD finger saturated with either H3(1–10)K4me3 or H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-Tail reveals that the bound states are not quite identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Though for the majority of residues the resonances progress along the same trajectory from apo to bound, the difference in chemical shift (Δδ) between the free and fully bound states of the PHD is generally greater for H3(1–10)K4me3 as compared to H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-Tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Fitting CSPs as a function of ligand concentration indicates that the PHD finger binds H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-Tail with a low micromolar K<sub>d</sub> of 12 ± 1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>, center). As saturation is not reached during the NMR titration with the H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-NCP, a robust binding affinity cannot be determined. However, the CSPs as a function of H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3 mark suggest a dissociation constant in the low millimolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>, right). Thus, the NMR data indicate that binding to the NCP is substantially weaker than binding to the free histone tail peptide. To confirm this, we utilized biolayer interferometry (BLI). A biotin-PHD construct was immobilized on streptavidin-coated sensors, and experiments were carried out with H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-Tail or H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-NCP under similar solution conditions as the NMR experiments. Clear association and dissociation curves were observed for binding to the H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-Tail with strong response signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Fitting the equilibrium response at the end of the association phase, the binding affinity was determined to be 7.0 ± 0.1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>). This is slightly higher affinity than that determined via NMR, likely due to the fact that the PHD finger is immobilized for BLI. In contrast, no association was detected with the H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-NCP at the highest concentrations used for the H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-Tail, even though it is expected to elicit a larger BLI response signal due to its significantly larger size. Even at a ten-fold higher concentration, H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-NCP produces minimal response signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>).</p><p>Together, these data demonstrate that the BPTF PHD finger adopts the same bound state with the H3 tail in the context of the nucleosome as with the free histone tail peptide, making no direct interaction with the nucleosome core. However, association is substantially inhibited in the context of the nucleosome. Though moderate effects are seen from the use of the MLA versus true methylated lysine, these do not account for the dramatically weaker association observed for the NCP. Thus, it is possible that the conformation of the nucleosome itself is causing a reduction in the observed binding affinity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The H3 tail experiences distinct conformations in isolation or in the native context of the NCP</title><p>To further investigate the conformation of the H3 tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and its potential effect on PHD finger binding, <sup>15</sup>N-H3-NCPs were prepared by refolding octamer with <sup>15</sup>N-labeled H3, and unlabeled H2A, H2B, and H4, and reconstituting this with the 147 bp 601 Widom DNA.

The single set of peaks observed implies that the two H3 tails within the NCP are identical. Due to the large size (~200 kDa) and resultant slow tumbling of the NCP, it is expected that the residues in the core would not be observable using this isotope labeling scheme. Thus, the observation of the H3 tail suggests that this region experiences greater intrinsic conformational dynamics than do the residues in the core.

Plotting the intensity of H3 tail bound-state resonances as a function of NCP/tlNCP concentration shows greater intensity in binding to tlNCP than to NCP throughout the titration. In addition, peak intensities plateau (indicating saturation) with tlNCP but not NCP over the concentration range tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Together, this indicates that the H3-Tail binds tlNCP tighter than NCP. This is consistent with a mechanism in which free H3 tail peptide must compete with tethered tails to associate with the core, providing additional evidence that nucleosomal H3 tails are associating with the NCP core. Plotting the CSPs as a function of residue for association with the NCP/tlNCP reveals that residues along the entire H3 tail are affected by binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>The structure of the isolated H3 tail peptide, the H3 tail peptide bound to the NCP <italic>in-trans</italic>, and the native H3 tail in the context of the NCP can be compared through overlay of the corresponding <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC/HMQC spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). As noted previously, there are large differences in the spectra of H3-Tail and H3-NCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, compare black vs. gold). In contrast, the spectra for H3-Tail bound <italic>in-trans</italic> to the NCP or tlNCP much more closely resembles H3-NCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). In fact, the majority of resonances for H3-Tail bound <italic>in-trans</italic> to the NCP/tlNCP lie along a linear or nearly linear trajectory between the corresponding resonances for apo H3-Tail and H3-NCP. This suggests that the <italic>in-trans</italic> NCP-bound state of the H3 tail peptide closely reproduces the environment of the native H3 tail, consistent with the native tail associating with the NCP core. Differences between the <italic>in-trans</italic> bound and native histone tails likely arise because the H3 tail is uniquely tethered to the NCP in the native state, and when binding <italic>in-trans</italic>, the tail is likely to associate with regions inaccessible to the restricted tail binding <italic>in-cis</italic>. Indeed, when comparing the chemical shift of the H3 tail peptide bound to the NCP <italic>in-trans</italic> and the native H3 tail, the greatest differences are in the C-terminal half of the H3 tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). One of the largest differences is seen for lysine 36, which is immediately adjacent to where the H3 tail connects to the core histone fold and protrudes from between the DNA gyres. Additionally, there are significant differences observed for residues 24–28 and Thr32.</p><p>Notably, these data indicate that the interaction between the tails and core is quite robust, yet the fact that the resonances are detectable indicates that the tails are also conformationally dynamic. To investigate this further, MD simulations of the complete NCP were carried out. Simulations were conducted on NCPs containing unmodified H3 tails (un-NCP). Each NCP was initiated from three different H3 tail conformations: one based on the 1KX5 crystal structure (the only crystal structure that resolves all H3 histone tail residues), another in which the H3 tails were extended linearly from residues 1 to 40, and a third based on <italic>de novo</italic> modeling of the tails. Consistent with the robust interaction between the H3 tail and the NCP core seen by NMR, simulations show that the H3 tail consistently collapses onto the NCP regardless of the initial conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This is measured quantitatively through calculation of the radius of gyration (R<sub>g</sub>) of the full histone H3 protein, which reduced from a maximum of 45 Å to ~26 Å upon tail collapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Notably, the average root mean square deviation (RMSD) of H3 tail conformations calculated between the final frames of all simulations, after aligning NCP core conformations, is 50.0 Å, suggesting that there exists a wide range of potential conformations available to the H3 tail. If only simulations of the same initial tail conformation are considered, then this value is reduced by varying degrees to values between 30.0 Å and 41.2 Å. This reduction of 10–20 Å suggests that the final conformation of the H3 tail is influenced somewhat by the choice of initial tail structure, but that the ensemble of final states is still extensive for a single initial conformation. In addition, since the tail compacts onto the outer surface of the NCP core, a significant amount of surface area of the tails is still exposed to solvent (&gt;2600 Å<sup>2</sup>), which is in agreement with data suggesting high solvent-accessibility.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31481.015</object-id><label>Table

To test if the interaction observed here between the H3 tail and the nucleosome core is driven by DNA, we compared spectra of the H3 tail bound to a 21 bp double-stranded DNA fragment to those of the H3 tail bound to the nucleosome <italic>in-trans</italic> and also in its native state within the nucleosome. Comparison of the corresponding <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HMQC/HSQC spectra for the DNA-bound H3-Tail with the H3-NCP reveals marked similarities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). As was seen for NCP/tlNCP-bound H3-Tail, the majority of resonances for the DNA-bound H3-Tail lie along a linear or near-linear trajectory between the chemical shift values for the apo H3-Tail and the H3-NCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This strongly suggests that the interaction of the H3 tail with the nucleosome core is driven through contacts with DNA. This is very similar to previous observations for the <italic>X. laevis</italic> 187bp-nucleosome containing linker DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stützer et al., 2016</xref>) and reveals that, even in the absence of accessible linker DNA, the native histone H3 tails are DNA bound. Notably, the chemical shift values for the tlNCP-bound state are more similar to the native H3 tail than those for the 21bp-DNA-bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This is most notable for arginine residues and, to a lesser extent, their neighboring residues (see residues 5–9, 17–18, and 24–27), which still deviate considerably in chemical shift between the DNA-bound and native H3 tails whereas binding to tlNCP much better reproduces the native NCP chemical shift. It is possible that the arginines, which fit into the minor groove of DNA, are more sensitive to DNA shape (linear vs. bent).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31481.017</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The NCP- and DNA-bound states of the H3 tail peptide mirror the H3 tail conformation in the context of the nucleosome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overlay of <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC or SOFAST HMQC spectra of <sup>15</sup>N-H3(1–44) (black), <sup>15</sup>N-H3(1–44) bound to DNA (blue) or tlNCP (green), and <sup>15</sup>N-H3-NCP (gold).

Fitting the CSPs as a function of peptide concentration yields an apparent K<sub>d</sub> of 180 ± 30 μM for H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-Tail, which is 15-fold weaker than peptide alone (12 ± 1 μM), revealing that the interaction between the H3 tail and PHD is decreased due to competitive binding of the H3 tail to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Peak broadening suggests the possibility of a ternary complex, where the PHD finger and DNA could be simultaneously binding to different regions of H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-Tail, but this would require further investigation to confirm.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31481.023</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>H3 tail-DNA interactions inhibit PHD finger binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overlay of a region of the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra of 50 μM <sup>15</sup>N-BPTF PHD upon titration of H3(1–10)K4me3 (left, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), or H3(1–10)K4me3 pre-bound to DNA at a ratio of 1:2 (right).

Although the effect is not as strong as that observed for the H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-NCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, center), it is expected that in the context of the nucleosome, where the tail is tethered close to the DNA, the greatly increased effective local concentration would increase the apparent affinity between the histone tail and DNA and thus its competition for PHD finger binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Modification or mutation of the H3 tail weakens binding to DNA</title><p>Our results show that the H3 tail is stabilized on the nucleosomal DNA through multiple contacts along the entire length of the tail. Given this, it is possible that a variety of PTMs may alter this interaction and thus the H3 tail conformation and accessibility. Notably, our results reveal that H3K4me3 does not significantly alter the H3 tail-DNA interactions (discussed above, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which is likely due to the fact that methylation of lysine does not alter the side-chain charge. However, there are a number of PTMs, such as lysine acetylation and other acylations, arginine citrullination, and serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphorylation, that alter the side-chain charge of histone residues and thus might perturb the electrostatic interaction between the histone tails and nucleosomal DNA.</p><p>Acetylation neutralizes the positive charge on the lysine side-chain. To investigate how acetylation along the H3 tail alters the tail-DNA interaction we conducted MD simulations of NCPs containing acetylation on lysines 14, 18, 23, and 27 along the H3 tail (quadAc-NCP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the H3 tails in the quadAc-NCP compact to a similar extent as in the un-NCP and H3K4me3-NCP, with an R<sub>g</sub> of 26.5 ± 0.4 Å for H3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Also, similar to the un-NCP and H3K4me3-NCP the quadAc-H3 tails compact primarily onto the nucleosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). The quadAc-H3 tail shows no change in secondary structure, with an average helicity of 5.9% and an average β-strand content of 3.3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). However, the interaction energies between the DNA and H3 tail are significantly weakened (ΔG = −52.1 + /- 2.7 kcal/mol, p-value of 0.0003) in the quadAc-NCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This is in-line with previous studies using UV-induced laser-crosslinking, in which it was proposed that the histone tail-DNA interaction persists even upon acetylation, but is weakened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mutskov et al., 1998</xref>). We note that the acetylated lysines only account for 33% of the total change in free energy (6.2 kcal/mol of the total 18.9 kcal/mol disfavorable shift), while the immediate neighbors of the acetylated lysines combine to contribute an additional 37% of the difference (6.9 kcal/mol). Other residues that experience significant drops in binding strength include A1 (ΔΔG = 1.7 kcal/mol, 9% of total), K4 (ΔΔG = 1.8 kcal/mol, 9% of total), and S10 (ΔΔG = 0.9 kcal/mol, 5% of total). Additionally, the average amount of solvent-exposed surface area of the H3 tails is increased in the quadAc-NCP to 2928 ± 42 Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), in part due to the increased size of the acetylated side chains. This increase in solvent-accessibility may provide a larger site for interaction with binding partners. Together, these results show that acetylation of lysines 14, 18, 23, and 27 reduce the strength of H3 tail interactions with DNA by removing not only direct interactions formed by these residues, but also by consequentially weakening the interactions of neighboring cationic and polar residues with the DNA.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31481.024</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Modification and mutation of the H3 tails leads to a partial release from nucleosomal DNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three-dimensional probability distribution of the locations of heavy atoms within H3 N-terminal tails for the quadAc-NCP (left) and H3K4me3/3xR-A-NCP (right) simulations, superimposed upon the crystal structure (PDBID 1KX5).

To probe the effects of arginine neutralization, we conducted simulations of modified NCPs where the arginine residues that are not implicated in PHD binding (R8, R17, and R26) were mutated to alanine in the presence of K4me3 (H3K4me3/3xR-A-NCP). As was seen with acetylation of lysine, the H3 tails in these simulations compacted to a similar extent as was seen for the unmodified NCP (H3 R<sub>g</sub> = 25.4 + /- 0.3 Å), though notably, they collapsed at a slower rate than the other NCPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). The H3K4me3/3xR-A tails occupy a similar volume of the DNA surface as compared to K4me3 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, right vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>).

In comparison to the unmodified NCP, the mutated tails have a decreased level of solvent exposed surface area (2534 ± 39 Å<sup>2</sup>), largely due to the decreased size of the alanine side-chain. Most notably, however, is that the strength of DNA binding by the mutated tail is the lowest of all NCPs tested (ΔG = −45.1 + /- 2.7 kcal/mol), and this decrease in interaction strength can be almost entirely attributed directly to the alanine mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), with contributions from neighboring lysines only modestly affected by the mutations. This is in stark contrast to the quadAc-NCP, which displayed a correlation between PTMs at lysine sites and a reduced interaction strength of neighboring residues with the nucleosomal DNA.</p><media id="video4" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-31481-video4.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31481.033</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>End states of the histone H3 tails from the H3K4me3/3xR-A-NCP simulations.</title><p>Protein arrangement is shown in dark blue, while sidechains are represented as orange sticks.

Note that glutamine is a commonly used acetyl-lysine mimetic because the polar side chain of glutamine mimics that of the neutralized lysine. To confirm the validity of this mimic, we compared the simulations of NCPs containing acetylated lysine with those containing glutamine at the same positions (with and without K4me3) and found that they were in good agreement with one another for the R<sub>g</sub> value for H3, secondary structure, and interaction energy with DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>).

Compared to titration of H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-NCP containing no additional modifications, the same set of residues is perturbed, and the resonances track along the same trajectories. However, at equivalent concentrations of NCP, PHD finger resonances have progressed farther towards the H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-Tail-bound state in binding to H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3/4xK-Q-, H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3/3xR-A-, and H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3/phos-NCP as compared to binding to H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-NCP. This indicates that the PHD finger is binding the H3 tail with the same molecular mechanism between all NCP samples, but that when additional tail residues are modified or mutated, the observed binding affinity is higher. Failure to reach saturation precludes the ability to determine exact K<sub>d</sub> values; however, plotting the CSPs as a function of concentration of the H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3 mark indicates that the binding trends in the order of the weakest to tightest binding to H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-NCP, followed by H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3/4xK-Q- and H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3/phos-NCP, with the tightest binding to H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3/3xR-A-NCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, neutralizing the charge of basic residues or introducing negative charges results in an increase in accessibility to PHD finger binding. This is consistent with the smaller computed binding energy observed between the H3 tail and nucleosomal DNA in the MD simulations of H3K4me3/quadAc-, H3K4me3/4xK-Q- and H3K4me3/3xR-A-NCP (see above), and the computed binding energies trend in the same order as the experimental data (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The Phos-tag gel appears to smear and accentuate the high molecular contaminants (*), which might also be due to the 601 DNA present in the sample and running at a similar position as the contaminants.

This adds to a growing body of evidence that the nucleosome context can have a significant effect on chromatin signaling events, including histone tail binding and modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stützer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang and Hayes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Munari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gatchalian et al., 2017</xref>). We show that inhibition of PHD finger binding is due to the conformation of the tail in the context of the nucleosome core particle. Our data indicate a robust, but conformationally heterogeneous interaction of the H3 tail with the nucleosome core, driven by contacts with DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). The interaction with DNA is competitive with respect to PHD finger binding. As this collapsed conformation is favored under physiological conditions, this inhibits association of the PHD finger with the H3 tail in the context of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31481.041</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of the H3 tail conformational ensemble and effect on PHD finger binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Conglomeration of histone tail conformations (gold) from all simulations of the unmodified NCP compacted upon the core DNA surface (blue).

Note that each histone tail is likely in equilibrium between collapsed, partially extended, and extended conformations. We do not intend to indicate cooperativity between the equilibria of individual tails as this is unknown; distinct ensembles are depicted only for simplicity. We expect that the energetics of these ensembles may be perturbed by a number of nuclear factors, including histone PTMs. (<bold>C</bold>) The data provided predicts that higher order PTM crosstalk, or the modification of residues remote from the region directly recognized by the histone effector domain, can perturb the energetics of the system, thereby shifting the conformational pre-equilibrium and altering the observed binding affinity.

Indeed, the tails are highly susceptible to protease degradation and generally not resolved in crystal structures, and NMR data indicates substantial conformational dynamics within the tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Böhm and Crane-Robinson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rosenberg et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2013</xref>). However, many biochemical and biophysical studies have also suggested that the histone tails interact with DNA and have an effect on nucleosome stability. Molecular dynamics studies also widely show that the histone tails collapse onto DNA during the course of a simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li and Kono, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shaytan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ikebe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bowerman and Wereszczynski, 2016</xref>). Moreover, a CHIP-exo study suggests that the H3 tails associate with linker DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rhee et al., 2014</xref>). Here we develop a model that is consistent with both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). We find that the H3 tails associate robustly with DNA in the context of the nucleosome, but with substantial conformational flexibility. Notably, DNA binding is independent of the presence of available linker DNA, as we find here that it also robustly associates with the core DNA. Our simulations reveal that there exists a plethora of energetically similar but structurally heterogeneous DNA-bound states of the H3 tail. Though simulations show that these binding modes remain highly stable up to the 100ns timescale, the fact that there is only a single peak observed for each residue by NMR suggests that movement between these collapsed conformations is fast on the NMR timescale. Fast exchange on the NMR timescale indicates dynamic transitions on the order of sub-microseconds. Movement between collapsed conformations could involve partially or fully released/extended conformations as intermediates or could take the form of a ‘tethered diffusion’ of the H3 tail along the surface of the core DNA.</p><p>Given current computing power, it is highly unlikely that individual MD simulations can rigorously sample a representative region of the H3 tail ensemble when bound to the NCP. These findings support previous studies, which showed that multiple trajectories must be collected and/or enhanced sampling approaches implemented in order to robustly simulate the bound state of the H3 tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li and Kono, 2016</xref>), and that caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions regarding the role of the tails in NCP stability and dynamics. The equilibrium of states is likely determined by a balance of the extended and collapsed modes, the former of which is driven by conformational entropy and the latter of which is driven by the enthalpy of tail-DNA interactions. At first glance, it may seem that the extended state should dominate due to its high flexibility and inherently large entropy. However, our results suggest that the collapsed tail state is actually more favorable. Specifically, our MM-GBSA calculations indicate that there is a significant enthalpic advantage to compacted configurations due to strong Coulomb interactions that overwhelm the loss of configurational entropy upon tail collapse. Furthermore, the large variability in compacted tail configurations observed in our simulation trajectories suggests that the collapsed state likely has a significant configurational entropy of its own, which may also alleviate some of the entropic cost of compaction.</p><p>Our results align with a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stützer et al., 2016</xref>. on the <italic>X. laevis</italic> 187bp-nucleosome. Similar to what we show here with inhibition of PHD finger binding, they found that acetylation and methylation of the H3 tail by a subset of histone acetyltransferases (Gcn5, p300, CBP) and methyltransferases (G9a, PRC2, PRMT5, Set7/9), respectively, is inhibited by the nucleosome. Using NMR, they determined this to be due to a transient interaction of the tail with linker DNA. We suggest a robust yet dynamic interaction not only with linker DNA but also with DNA in the nucleosome core. It is likely that all histone tails are associated in some manner with nucleosomal DNA. An NMR analysis of the histone H4 tail found that the small basic patch within the tail (residues 16–20) is associated with the nucleosome core, as evidenced by the complete lack of signal in an <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). The contrast to observable signals for H3 could represent either a different exchange regime between states or even a single stable state for the H4 tail, as suggested by a recent computational study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erler et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, a number of biochemical studies have shown through chemical reactivity and cross-linking that the N- and C-terminal tails are associated with the nucleosome core (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pepenella et al., 2014</xref>]). This collapsed conformation presents a much more complex binding interface to histone effector domains than would an extended tail, and many effectors will likely be inhibited as seen here with the BPTF PHD finger. In fact, studies of fluorescein 5-maleimide reactivity towards single cysteine mutants of the H2B tail in the context of the nucleosome suggest that effector domain binding should be 10- to 50-fold weaker than binding to an H2B tail peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang and Hayes, 2007</xref>). A modest decrease in binding to the H3K9me3-NCP as compared to peptide was also observed for the chromodomain containing HP1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Munari et al., 2012</xref>). This nucleosomal inhibition is less than that observed here for the BPTF PHD finger, but regions flanking the chromodomain are thought to interact with DNA, which could somewhat counter the inhibition. Another recent study reported on binding of the tandem CHD4 PHD fingers to the histone H3 tail unmodified at lysine 4<sup>43</sup>. Similar to our results, the individual CHD4 PHD fingers bound too weakly to the NCP to accurately measure binding affinity. Though the linked PHD fingers also bound more weakly to the nucleosome than to histone peptides, there was only a ~ 6 × difference in affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gatchalian et al., 2017</xref>). The increase in affinity for the dual domain as compared to the individual PHD fingers is purportedly due to the multivalent activity of the tandem PHD fingers as well as contributions to histone binding by the region linking the two PHD fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gatchalian et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>There are many mechanisms by which the inhibitory conformations of the histone tails could be regulated. We show here that neutralization of lysine or arginine along the H3 tail, as occurs with several types of lysine acylation and arginine citrullination, weakens the association with DNA and promotes PHD finger binding. We also observe an increase of binding upon phosphorylation of serine. This is in agreement with recent studies showing that acetylation or phosphorylation of H3 tails promotes subsequent additional modification of the H3 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stützer et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, there are many additional modifications including ADP-ribosylation and certain acylations that not only neutralize lysine, but add negative charge to the side-chain. In addition, modification by the small proteins ubiquitin and SUMO would likely lead to large steric hindrance. This suggests that cross-talk between histone PTMs is not only mediated through effector domains themselves (i.e. recognition of multiple PTMs by multiple domains, or antagonism between neighboring PTMs by direct inhibition of binding) but can also be mediated by the integrated effects of PTM recognition and nucleosome structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). It is also possible that DNA-binding domains could displace the histone tail and increase accessibility. There are now several examples of histone effector domains that also harbor DNA-binding ability and have been found to bind tighter to nucleosomes than to histone peptides alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eidahl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Musselman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Nuland et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Savitsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morrison et al., 2017</xref>).

The Q5 mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs) was used to introduce an AviTag and an additional linker (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHEGSGS). The AviTag-PHD construct was grown and purified as described above, with the exception that this version of the BPTF PHD finger was not codon optimized and expression was done out of Rosetta 2(DE3)pLysS competent cells (Novagen). The AviTag-PHD construct was biotinylated in vivo by endogenous BirA (and confirmed via western blot, data not shown). Cells were grown in LB media, and 100 μM biotin was added at induction. All of the experiments were performed using biotin-PHD from a single protein prep so the population of biotinylated protein was constant between experiments.</p><p>Experiments were run using an Octet RED96 Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) System (Pall ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA). All samples were prepared in 20 mM MOPS pH 7, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mg/mL BSA (RPI albumin, bovine fraction V, molecular biology grade). Dip and Read Steptavidin Biosensors (Pall ForteBio) were used for all experiments and were hydrated in buffer for at least 30 min preceding data collection. Experiments were performed at 37°C in black 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC), shaking at 1000 rpm. Data were collected at 10 Hz with a scheme of 10 min temperature pre-equilibration followed by 180 s buffer equilibration, 300 s biotin-PHD loading, 120 s buffer baseline, 300 s analyte association, and 300 s analyte dissociation steps. Two data sets were collected with H3(1–44)K<sub>C</sub>4me3 as analyte. For one of the data sets, double referencing was performed. This consisted of the standard single reference sensor that was loaded with biotin-PHD with the association phase performed using buffer alone and additionally a second set of sensors, not loaded with biotin-PHD, that were run through the same protocol for all analyte concentrations to test for optical property changes and non-specific binding. As no difference was observed between either referencing, the second data set was obtained with only the single reference of biotin-PHD against buffer. H3(1–44)K<sub>C</sub>4me3 analyte concentrations used were 20, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.3, and 0.6 μM, and the double referenced experiment additionally used 0.3 μM. Separate peptide dilutions were prepared for each experiment. Two data sets were also collected with H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-NCP as analyte. Note that double referencing was needed for the NCP as a large offset in response signal was seen independent of the PHD finger, likely due to changes in the optical properties of the solution. H3K<sub>C</sub>4me3-NCP analyte concentrations used were 183, 21, and 10 μM for one experiment and 230, 23, and 11 μM for the other experiment.</p><p>Data were analyzed using the Octet Analysis software. Data were processed by subtracting the single or double reference data, aligning to the last 5–10 s of the baseline, and applying a Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter.

For each simulation, energy minimization was performed for 5000 steps with solute heavy atoms restrained by a 10 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup> harmonic potential, followed by 5000 steps with no restraints. Then, each simulation was heated from 10 K to 300 K over 50 ps in the NVT ensemble with the restraints reinstated.

Reported energies are the average of all results from each single simulation of a set (i.e., tail chemistry or initial tail conformation). Each tail within a simulation is considered a separate observation of the H3 tail ensemble, thereby producing two samples per simulation. Errors in the calculations are presented as the standard error of the mean from the simulation set, which corresponds to the standard deviations within the 10 samples of each initial tail conformation for a particular tail chemistry (a cumulative of 30 samples per tail chemistry).</p><p>Residue secondary structures were calculated using the DSSP algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kabsch and Sander, 1983</xref>), as implemented in cpptraj (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roe and Cheatham, 2013</xref>). For simplicity, secondary structures are reported as one of four categories: helix (DSSP types ‘G’, ‘H’, and ‘I’), sheet (‘E’, ‘B’), turn (‘T’), or unstructured coil (none of the above). Total tail helicity or sheet values are reported as the average over all tail residues of each residue’s percentage of frames in the respective structure. The global H3 tail structure was monitored through the radius of gyration (R<sub>g</sub>) of the whole H3 histone such that reduced values in R<sub>g</sub> can be directly interpreted as tail compaction upon the core. Furthermore, the 3-D coordinates of heavy atoms in the tails are visualized as average occupancy within a grid of 1.0 Å<sup>3</sup> voxels, in a method similar to the counter-ion condensation observations made by Materese et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Materese et al., 2009</xref>). Solvent exposure was calculated using the LPCO method, as implemented in cpptraj (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weiser et al., 1999</xref>). Lastly, a comparative analysis of the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of tail residues in the final frame of each simulation was conducted. In this analysis, translations and rotations were removed by least squares fitting the backbone of H3 core residues, and the subsequent RMSD values consider only the H3 tail residue backbone atoms.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Work in the Musselman group is funded by an NSF CAREER Award (1452411).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Geeta J Narlikar is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will see from the reviews appended below, the reviewers thought that the work has the potential to be impactful because quantifying the magnitude of any inhibitory effect of the nucleosome on reader binding will uncover the dynamic range of tail accessibility that can be tuned by other nucleosome modifiers. However, there were concerns that the work as such did not go sufficiently beyond the published work by Stutzer et al., 2016. Stutzer et al., have previously shown large inhibitory effects in the context of nucleosomes with linker DNA. The reviewers recognize that your work differs in that it assesses effects with core nucleosomes. The reviewers also agree that the data suggest that direct interactions between the H3 tails and core nucleosomal DNA restrict tail accessibility for reader domain binding. While this result is interesting, where the study has the potential for larger impact is from a direct comparison of the Kd of the PHD reader protein on nucleosomes vs. tail peptides. Here, the lack of saturation observed in the context of a nucleosome raised concerns about obtaining a reliable Kd. It is possible that alternative methods such as ITC could be used to compare the Kd on a nucleosome vs. peptides or higher concentrations of the PHD finger could be used in the NMR assay to achieve saturation.</p><p>In the context of tail acetylation, the hypothesis that acetylation affects tail accessibility has been tested previously by Stutzer et al., study, where they show that one tail mark can promote general accessibility for depositing other tail marks by specific enzymes. For the work in this study to go beyond the published work would require directly assessing the effect of nucleosomal tail acetylation (or other modifications) on BPTF binding either by NMR or other methods.</p><p>In addition, a more explicit comparison of the results from this study with the results from Stutzer et al., is needed throughout the text to provide the appropriate context for identifying and appreciating the new findings made in this study.</p><p>As it is unclear how long it would take to acquire the necessary data for increasing the impact of the work, the reviewers concluded that the current manuscript should be rejected, rather than be caught in what might be a considerable delay.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The identification of new post-translational modifications (PTMS) on histone tails and reader domains that specifically recognize these modifications continues to grow at a rapid pace. To date most of the quantitative characterization of readers with histone PTMs has been carried out in the context of tail peptides. However, it is also known that in the context of a nucleosome the histone tails interact with nucleosomal DNA. Thus, understanding the structural and energetic consequences of these two competing interactions is essential to understand the full regulatory potential if histone tail modfications. Here the authors use NMR approaches to quantify the energetic effects of nucleosome context on the ability of a key histone reader, the BPTF PHD finger to bind the H3-K4me3 mark. They present data to suggest that binding of the BPTF PHD finger is reduced by ~ 100fold in the context of the nucleosome and that this inhibition can be explained by competition with DNA binding. Through the use of NMR, they further relate the quantitative effects to H3 tail dynamics and suggest that the nucleosomal H3 tail is in fast exchange between a nucleosomal DNA bound state and a free state. They also present molecular dynamics data to support the NMR results. Based on these experiments the authors propose a model in which interactions with the nucleosomal DNA reduce the accessibility of the nucleosomal H3 tail by ~100-fold compared to a free H3 tail peptide and that other PTMs such as acetylation, which would reduce DNA interactions, can increase H3 tail accessibility for binding by reader domains.</p><p>Overall the experiments are rigorously carried out with the key controls, including important controls for the effects of the MLA, and the conclusions are well supported. From the perspective of impact, this appears to be the first quantification of the effect that nucleosomal context has on the intrinsic out vs. in equilibrium of the H3 tail, and the magnitude the effect implies a large regulatory dynamic range that can be tuned by other PTMS as well proteins that bind nucleosomal DNA. The types of models opened up by such considerations are more sophisticated than current simple models of combinatorial PTM recognition. Therefore, this work is likely to substantially enrich discussion in the field about the mechanisms by which histone modifications regulate genome accessibility.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript is a composite of replication of prior work by others and conceptually interesting, imperfectly executed (or insufficiently detailed in supporting information) so that strong new conclusions cannot be drawn. I wanted to like this paper, however I have serious reservations about many of the experiments that represent interesting departures from that which has already been done. Were many of these experiments cleaned up, this manuscript could represent a conceptually important advance in the understanding of how the restricted H3 tail dynamics that occur as a consequence, interactions with nucleosomal DNA can impact binding partners that engage tail-embedded marks. However, the existing data falls short of conclusively demonstrating that the effects observed are due to previously noted H3 tail-DNA interactions, rather than MLA differences coupled with a titration that gets nowhere near saturation so that quantification of affinity is not appropriate.</p><p>A clear comparison point for this work is the elegant study that also used NMR of labeled H3 to demonstrate the more limited dynamics in the H3 tail (Stutzer et al., 2016). Confirmation is an important function of science, but this seems too high profile a journal for this to be the basis of publication. The present manuscript confirms previously published work's conclusion that the H3 tail is adopts a heterogenous ensemble of conformations that are in close contact with DNA, and these columbic interactions between basic residues and DNA can be weakened by tail PTMs that neutralize or impart negative charge. The prior work also did a very similar H3 tail titration against DNA, and found much the same thing, although adding H3K4me3 and PHD finger is a new twist. In revision, the authors should emphasize new experiments rather than ones that are essentially repeating prior work-these latter experiments, though nice are more germane to supplementary display. The tail-less experiment with H3 peptide titration is an exciting and new experiment, and the MD simulations add a modicum of additional insight. Although the calculations of free energy seem a bit too far out.</p><p>My biggest concern is that the NMR titrations that do not saturate, or any quantitative affinity measurement that does not saturate cannot be used to compute accurate Kd values-one can only say that the binding is weaker, but not that it is &quot;[…]nearly two orders of magnitude weaker than that measured for the MLA-peptide.&quot; Secondarily, I am not sure how the staging of NMR titrations in stoichiometric binding regime (well above computed Kd for peptides) can be used to compute accurate Kd-saturation or near saturation is reached when the peptide becomes equimolar with protein. My sense is that most NMR titrations provide values that are very different (orders of magnitude in some cases) than those measured by other quantitative equilibrium methods: FP, ITC, SPR, MST, etc. So, validation of the peptide and MLA affinities by an orthogonal more accurate means would greatly strengthen the conclusions, and would be great at the nucleosome level, although very challenging. Furthermore, as no characterization of the MLA histone is presented so the lower affinity could be due in the part or whole to incomplete or excessive alkylation. I also worry that peptide quantification by mass is not sufficiently accurate. These points are critical to the interpretation of weaker binding as a consequence tail engagement with DNA.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The revised manuscript from Morrison and colleagues describes a series of NMR and MD simulation studies that indicate that interactions between the N-terminal tail of histone H3 and nucleosomal DNA are a critical factor in regulating the binding of PhD finger domain protein to H3 K4 trimethylation. This manuscript significantly adds to a recently emerging awareness that the N-terminal tails of the histones do not function independently as was assumed by the traditional models showing the tails extending out form the surface of a nucleosome. Rather, this manuscript (and a few others) shows that the N-terminal tails are dynamically associated with the core of the nucleosome and with the nucleosomal and linker DNA. The data in the manuscript is convincing and the conclusions drawn are reasonable and will be impactful. However, there are two issues with the manuscript. First, the data used to examine the effect of the MLA on binding of BPTF relative to trimethyllysine. The authors conclude that the MLA has a negative effect of BPTF binding. However, this seems to be based on an apples to oranges comparison. The binding of a peptide containing residues 1 to 10 of the H3 tail with K4 trimethylated is compared to binding a peptide containing H3 tail residues 1 to 44 with the MLA. While the peptide with the MLA shows lower affinity, it is possible that the change in affinity is due to potential structural changes in the peptide that exist in the 1 to 44 peptide but not the 1 to 10 peptide. The authors should compare peptides with the different modifications that have the same length. The second issue regards the final set of experiments examining the effect of acetylation on the interaction of the H3 tail with nucleosomal DNA. It would increase the relevance of these experiments if the simulations were tested by comparisons of binding BPTF to NCPs with H3 K4 trimethylation plus and minus acetylation. This may be a difficult experiment fot set up but without this direct test, the section of acetylation does not significantly add to the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The conformation of the histone H3 tail inhibits association of the BPTF PHD finger with the nucleosome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Mark Parthun (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As with the first submission the reviewers think that quantifying the magnitude of inhibitory effects of the nucleosome on reader binding is of biological significance as it uncovers the dynamic range of tail accessibility that can be tuned by other nucleosome modifiers. In response to the first submission the reviewers had asked for two major additions: (i) Bona-fide nucleosome Kd values and (ii) the effects of PTMs on reader binding in the context of nucleosomes. The reviewers appreciate that your resubmission now has data on the effects of PTMs and think this new data adds to the significance of the work. However, the lack of saturation in the context of Kd values for nucleosomes, is still somewhat of a concern as is the emphasis on experiments that largely confirm previous findings by Stutzer et al., 2016. Below we outline how these, and related concerns could be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Given that saturation is not achieved it is essential that the Kd values be reported as limits and not as estimates based on assumptions about the ppm changes at saturation. This is because it is possible that the maximal ppm changes in the context of a nucleosome may differ from those in the context of a free peptide. In the revised manuscript, while the initial Results text is suitably softened in this context, in the section describing H3 tail charge mutant nucleosome NMR measurements (subsection “Modification and mutation of the H3 tail increase accessibility to the PHD finger”) approximate Kd values are reported. Further, in Figure 9, Kds are reported with a &quot;=&quot; rather than a &quot;~&quot;, as well as associated uncertainty (which also cannot be accurately computed), and in Table 1. The Kd values should instead be reported as &gt; the highest concentration of nucleosomes used. Given such a measure, from the data in Figure 9 it is still possible to say that the nucleosome inhibits reader accessibility to tail residues by &gt; 20-fold.</p><p>2) Given that saturation is not achieved, one concern is whether the reader is still binding specifically to the H3Kc4me3 or whether it is binding the nucleosome non-specifically at multiple other locations. In this context, a control to show that binding to unmethylated nucleosomes does not give the same chemical shifts is needed.</p><p>3) The overall paper still has many measurements with H3 tails and DNA that are quite similar to the prior Stutzer paper that came up in the first round of review, and the reviewers acknowledge that the authors now more effectively highlight the prior work as useful points of comparison. However, the portion of the manuscript that is dedicated to confirming previous work should be further de-emphasized in the text and main figures, so that the data that is original-how these nucleosomal H3 tail properties impact binding by the BPTF PHD finger-stands out more readily. The reviewers feel there is limited value in presenting identical or substantially similar data for example, subsecgtion “The nucleosome inhibits association of the BPTF PHD finger with the H3 tail” and subsection “The H3 tail experiences distinct conformations in isolation or in the native context of the NCP”.</p><p>4) A recent publication (Gatchalian et al., https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ucsf.idm.oclc.org/pubmed/29138400) describes a similar phenomenon in the context of paired PHD finger readers. Here they are able to measure Kds for nucleosomal H3 tails using fluorescence polarization (Figure 1F of this paper) and find a ~ 6-fold weaker affinity on the nucleosome vs. free peptide. This presents an interesting and likely informative contrast to the work under review. The authors should therefore compare the effects in their study with those of Gatchalian et al., and discuss models for why the magnitude of the effects may be different given that the reader domains in both cases bind a similar region of H3.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31481.045</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript is a composite of replication of prior work by others and conceptually interesting, imperfectly executed (or insufficiently detailed in supporting information) so that strong new conclusions cannot be drawn.

However, we appreciate that we are nearing stoichiometric conditions for the peptides. We have remeasured the Kd for the H3KC4me3(1-44) histone peptide by biolayer interfermoetery (BLI). Notably, the binding to the H3KC4me3-NCP was not detectable by BLI, confirming the NMR results that binding to the nucleosome is substantially weaker. For the short peptide, we removed the computed NMR Kd, and did not pursue quantitative analysis by BLI, as a very nice report published during revision of this work thoroughly investigates the difference between true methyl-lysine and the MLA specifically for the BPTF PHD finger.

Specifically, we have tested the interaction of the PHD finger with a nucleosome containing four lysine-to-glutamine mutations in the H3 tail, which mimics acetylated lysine. As predicted, these led to a moderate increase in the ability of the PHD finger to bind. We also tested binding to a nucleosome containing three arginine-to-alanine mutations along the H3 tail, and one containing two phosphorylated serines. Similar to the glutamine construct, these led to a moderate increase in accessibility to PHD finger binding. Together this supports the model generated and the concept that it mediates cross-talk between residues along the H3 tail. This new data is summarized in Figure 9.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Given that saturation is not achieved it is essential that the Kd values be reported as limits and not as estimates based on assumptions about the ppm changes at saturation.

As we are using a quadratic instead of a simple hyperbola to fit the data we are not comfortable reporting the lower limit in this manner, so we instead have removed all Kd approximations for the nucleosomes and simply state that the CSPs are consistent with low millimolar affinity for the H3KC4me3-NCP, and discuss trends in the CSPs for each of the additionally modified nucleosomes without any mention of Kd.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given that saturation is not achieved, one concern is whether the reader is still binding specifically to the H3Kc4me3 or whether it is binding the nucleosome non-specifically at multiple other locations.

We note that as the data shown here is the first NMR data on human histones with only 147bp of DNA, it is important to emphasize what about these spectra are the same as seen for previous constructs.
