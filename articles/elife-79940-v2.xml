from a wide range of drugs. Thus, understanding the unique molecular changes elicited by the marrow is of critical importance toward improving therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we demonstrate that aberrant activation of oxidative phosphorylation serves to induce therapeutic resistance in FLT3 mutant human AML cells challenged with FLT3 inhibitor drugs. Importantly, our findings show that AML cells are protected from apoptosis following FLT3 inhibition due to marrow-mediated activation of ATM, which in turn upregulates oxidative phosphorylation via mTOR signaling. mTOR is required for the bone marrow stroma-dependent maintenance of protein translation, with selective polysome enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation transcripts, despite FLT3 inhibition. To investigate the therapeutic significance of this finding, we tested the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in combination with the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib in primary human AML xenograft models. While marrow resident AML cells were highly resistant to quizartinib alone, the addition of everolimus induced profound reduction in tumor burden and prevented relapse. Taken together, these data provide a novel mechanistic understanding of marrow-based therapeutic resistance and a promising strategy for improved treatment of FLT3 mutant AML patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>AML</kwd><kwd>drug resistance</kwd><kwd>bone marrow</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship NRSA F30CA23197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Hae J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM118070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kieft</surname><given-names>Jeffrey S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001368</institution-id><institution>V Foundation for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T2016-012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeGregori</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006058</institution-id><institution>St. Baldrick's Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AWD-430131</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeGregori</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005189</institution-id><institution>Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>7020-19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jordan</surname><given-names>Craig T</given-names></name><name><surname>DeGregori</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA046934</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeGregori</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cellular and molecular analyses of human AML cells reveal a novel pathway activated by the bone marrow microenvironment that confers resistance to FLT3 inhibition and can be exploited to improve the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitor therapy for AML.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive blood cancer with a high relapse rate and resistance to cytotoxic therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brumatti et al., 2017</xref>). Internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) are among the most prevalent mutations in AML and are particularly associated with a poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burnett et al., 2011</xref>). FLT3-ITD leads to constitutive activation of FLT3, a receptor tyrosine kinase, which induces activation of multiple effector molecules involved in survival, proliferation, and cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fathi and Chen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gilliland and Griffin, 2002</xref>). Clear scientific and clinical evidence that supports the significance of activated FLT3 in leukemogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2012</xref>) has led to the development of several FLT3-targeted inhibitors.</p><p>Several clinical trials with two highly potent and selective second-generation FLT3 inhibitors, quizartinib and gilteritinib, have demonstrated their effectiveness in refractory AML patients with activating FLT3 mutations, showing significantly higher overall survival and rate of remissions compared to salvage chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cortes et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cortes et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cortes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perl et al., 2019</xref>). However, those remissions were short-lived. Furthermore, both FLT3 inhibitors showed noticeably delayed responses in the bone marrow (BM) (over weeks to a few months) compared to the peripheral blood (a few days), often showing persistence of the FLT3-ITD mutation in recovering marrow cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levis and Perl, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, it has long been appreciated that multiple components of the BM microenvironment promote leukemogenesis, drug resistance, and relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shafat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tabe and Konopleva, 2015</xref>). An extensive number of studies have shown that bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) provide protection to leukemia cells from chemotherapies either through direct cell-to-cell contact or secretion of soluble factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakker et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, several recent studies have attempted to unravel the key human BMSC-activated signaling pathways in FLT3-ITD AML cells that lead to resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. In these studies, reactivation of STAT5 signaling and/or the MAPK/ERK pathway by human BMSCs was found to mediate the resistance to FLT3 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Patel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Traer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sung et al., 2019</xref>), yet conflicting data between each study indicates that the drug resistance mechanism is complex and likely to be cell-type-dependent. Thus, further studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanism of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors.</p><p>In this study, we uncover a novel pathway mediated by ATM and mTOR whereby BMSCs protect FLT3-ITD AML cells from apoptosis following FLT3 inhibition. We demonstrate that this ATM/mTOR pathway plays an essential role in the maintenance of protein translation and oxidative phosphorylation, which is critical for cell survival. Our data show that targeting these key mediators in collaboration with FLT3 inhibitor effectively overcomes BMSC-mediated protection and enhances elimination of AML cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conditioned media of human bone marrow stromal cells prevents apoptosis in FLT3-ITD AML cells upon FLT3 inhibition</title><p>To study the paracrine effects mediated by BMSC, we utilized conditioned media from HS-5 human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC-CM). The HS-5 cell line has been shown to be a reliable model to reproduce the biological properties mediated by BM mesenchymal stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamo et al., 2020</xref>). Human AML cells either cultured with conditioned media from HS-5 or co-cultured with HS-5 exhibit enhanced resistance to multiple therapies, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garrido et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Edwards et al., 2019</xref>). To further examine the role of hBMSC-CM on FLT3-ITD AML cells following FLT3 inhibition, we used MOLM-13 and MV4-11 cell lines. A significantly lower percentage of apoptotic cells were observed in both cell lines post-treatment with quizartinib in the presence of hBMSC-CM compared to regular RPMI media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The protective effect of hBMSC-CM was also evident in the greater maintenance of viable cells observed after drug removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, the degree of hBMSC-CM-mediated protection from apoptosis upon FLT3 inhibition was greater in MOLM-13 cells compared to MV4-11 cells. In addition, we observed similar protection by hBMSC-CM for AML cells treated with gilteritinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), another highly selective and potent FLT3 inhibitor.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conditioned media of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) prevents apoptosis in FLT3-ITD acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells upon FLT3 inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>), FLT3-ITD AML cell lines, MOLM-13 and MV4-11, were treated with either DMSO (veh) or quizartinib with indicated doses for 48 hr in regular media (RPMI) or 50% conditioned media of human BM stromal cells in RPMI (hBMSC-CM).

Quizartinib completely inhibited the activity of FLT3 even in the presence of hBMSC-CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that the drug resistance mediated by hBMSC-CM is not due to increased drug efflux or other mechanism preventing FLT3 inhibition. To examine whether hBMSC-CM induces differential regulation of cell cycle upon FLT3 inhibition, we next measured cell cycle profiles in FLT3-ITD AML cells upon FLT3 inhibition in either RPMI or hBMSC-CM. Our cell cycle analysis demonstrated that cells surviving FLT3 inhibition show a similar G1 phase arrest, regardless of hBMSC-CM exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Given that hBMSC-CM could contain different levels of metabolites and nutrients compared to regular RPMI media, we further tested whether FLT3-ITD AML cells respond differently to quizartinib in regular RPMI supplemented with fractionated hBMSC-CM. RPMI supplemented with the heavy fraction of hBMSC-CM that contains molecules larger than 30 kDa phenocopied the protective effect of hBMSC-CM, while the light fraction of hBMSC-CM containing molecules smaller than 30 kDa demonstrated complete loss of protection from apoptosis upon FLT3 inhibition, suggesting that the protective effects of hBMSC-CM are due to larger molecules and cannot be explained by altered levels of smaller metabolites and nutrients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, conditioned media from HS-27A, another human BM stromal cell line, did not provide protection from apoptosis upon FLT3 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Together with the previous finding that only HS-5 cells recapitulated the general expression pattern of primary BM mesenchymal stromal cells while HS-27A cells displayed a distinctive gene expression profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamo et al., 2020</xref>), our data indicate that protection may require specific soluble factor(s). To understand the key soluble factors responsible for hBMSC-CM-mediated protection, we examined whether cytokines highly expressed by BMSCs such as GM-CSF, IL-3, and FGF-2 that have been shown to protect FLT3-ITD AML cells from cell killing by FLT3 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Traer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sung et al., 2019</xref>) show similar effects to hBMSC-CM. While GM-CSF or/and IL-3 induced modest and partial protection from apoptosis upon FLT3 inhibition, FGF-2 did not result in significant protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>), indicating that hBMSC-CM-mediated survival of FLT3-ITD AML cells from FLT3 inhibition likely involves multiple factors.</p><p>Our results above indicate that the protective effect of hBMSC-CM is not due to the prevention of FLT3 inhibition or alteration of cell cycle profiles. Hence, we further focused on hBMSC-CM-induced potential intrinsic changes that may promote cell survival following FLT3 inhibition. To explore alterations in protein expression and activation in FLT3-ITD AML cells caused by both FLT3 inhibition and hBMSC-CM exposure, we pursued a nonbiased approach using reverse-phase protein array (RPPA). We observed three major patterns of change: (1) downregulation upon FLT3 inhibition in both regular RPMI and hBMSC-CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left panel), (2) upregulation with FLT3 inhibition in RPMI but not in hBMSC-CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, middle panel), or (3) downregulation in RPMI but not in hBMSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right panel). We found that the major components of the first pattern largely consist of cell cycle regulatory proteins (AURORA kinases, CDC6, CDK, CHK1, Cyclin B1, PLK1, and WEE1), consistent with our cell cycle analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Regarding the second pattern of change (upregulation by FLT3 inhibition in RPMI but not in hBMSC-CM), proteins involved with the DNA damage response (p-H2AX, ubiquitinated histone H2b, p-CHK1, CDC25C, and UVRAG) or apoptosis (cleaved caspases 3, 7, and 8) were found to be in this category, consistent with our observations of differential induction of apoptosis. Finally, proteins involved in a wide range of biological functions were found to show a pattern of downregulation with FLT3 inhibition in RPMI but significantly less downregulation or nearly complete maintenance in hBMSC-CM. This group included the oncogenic transcription factor c-MYC, antiapoptotic protein MCL-1, and MAPK/ERK signaling proteins (DUSP6 and p-MAPK/ERK). Among these, MAPK/ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2014</xref>) and MCL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oâ Reilly et al., 2018</xref>) are consistent with findings from other studies. Notably, multiple proteins involved in the mTOR signaling pathway (p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-S6, p-4E-BP1, eIF4G, and MNK1) demonstrated this consistent pattern. Together, the above data suggest that hBMSC-CM dramatically alters expression and activation of multiple pathways, and these changes may contribute to the survival of FLT3-ITD AML cells following FLT3 inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Bone marrow microenvironment substantially limits downregulation of mTOR and MYC pathway in FLT3-ITD AML cells upon FLT3 inhibition in vitro and in vivo</title><p>To characterize the influence of the hBMSC-CM on gene expression in FLT3-ITD AML cells upon FLT3 inhibition, we compared the transcriptomes of MOLM-13 cells treated with either vehicle or quizartinib in RPMI or hBMSC-CM by performing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).

Specifically, a majority of mTOR complex1 (mTORC1) signaling genes and MYC target genes demonstrated significant suppression post-FLT3 inhibition in RPMI, while such downregulation was at least partially reversed in the presence of hBMSC-CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), further supporting our findings from the RPPA data.

To investigate the effect of the BM microenvironment on gene expression profiles of human AML cells, we compared transcriptomes of AML cells isolated from the spleen and the BM of mice treated with vehicle or quizartinib for 16 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Cells isolated from the spleen showed a distinct gene expression signature compared to those from the BM, and treatment with quizartinib resulted in significant alterations of transcriptome profiles both in the spleen and the BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Our GSEA data showed multiple pathways with a similar gene expression pattern between AML cells from the spleen of quizartinib-treated mice and AML cells treated with quizartinib in RPMI, indicating similar effects of quizartinib on gene expression in both our in vitro and in vivo models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

We first determined whether pharmacological inhibition of mTOR signaling reverses hBMSC-CM-mediated protection from apoptosis following FLT3 inhibition. Our data revealed that while the mTOR inhibitor everolimus alone did not significantly promote apoptosis, combinatorial treatment with everolimus and quizartinib significantly reversed hBMSC-CM-mediated protection from apoptosis mediated by quizartinib alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, AML cells treated with quizartinib/everolimus in hBMSC-CM failed to recover after removal of drugs, in contrast to cells treated with quizartinib alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similar results were observed in FLT3-ITD MV4-11 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

A separate cohort of mice were treated with the same drug regimen for 84 days to examine the long-term effects of the therapies. After 5 days of treatment, quizartinib alone substantially reduced AML cells in the spleen, but only modestly reduced AML burden in the BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). On the other hand, the addition of everolimus to quizartinib (âcomboâ therapy) resulted in effective elimination of leukemia burden in the BM, recapitulating our in vitro data with hBMSC-CM. Complete blood counts revealed that mice treated with everolimus alone or in combination with quizartinib showed a modest level of thrombocytopenia and leukopenia without affecting neutrophils or hematocrit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), consistent with patient data that everolimus has been reported to induce hematological changes that are tolerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015a</xref>).

Throughout the duration of long-term treatment, vehicle-treated mice had a median survival of 27 days and all had succumbed by 84 days.

Elimination of the leukemia in the spleen by the combination therapy was further confirmed by the absence of splenomegaly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Furthermore, in an independent experiment with a second primary FLT3-ITD+ AML sample from a patient who developed relapse after chemotherapy, we observed potent elimination of leukemic burden in all compartments with the combination therapy. While monotherapy with quizartinib was effective in peripheral tissues (spleen and blood), effective elimination of leukemia cells in the BM was only achieved with the combinatorial treatment of quizartinib with everolimus. Notably, everolimus alone demonstrated similar effectiveness as quizartinib monotherapy in eliminating leukemia cells only in the blood without showing significant effect in the spleen or BM, suggesting that mTOR inhibition alone results in different cell-killing effects depending upon tissue microenvironment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>).

Strikingly, FLT3 inhibition alone was sufficient to dramatically reduce translation activity in FLT3-ITD AML cells over the course of treatment, comparable to the effect of translation inhibition by cycloheximide, but the reduction was significantly limited by hBMSC-CM. Moreover, combined inhibition of mTOR and FLT3 reversed the partial restoration of translation activity in hBMSC-CM, indicating that the effect of hBMSC-CM on translation activity is dependent on restored mTOR activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The number of viable cells was maintained in every treatment condition through this time course, indicating that the significant reduction in translation activity was not due to concurrent cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, MV4-11 cells also showed mTOR-dependent partial restoration of translation activity in hBMSC-CM. The degree of restoration was less than what we observed from MOLM-13 cells, consistent with the lesser extent of hBMSC-CM-mediated protection from apoptosis following FLT3 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Following FLT3 inhibition, a substantial population of AML cells showed a very low level of OPP labeling (OPP<sup>low</sup>) in RPMI, indicating severe suppression of translation, while hBMSC-CM significantly reduced the proportion of OPP<sup>low</sup> cells and the OPP<sup>high</sup> cells showed a noticeable leftward peak shift compared to vehicle-treated cells (consistent with a partial inhibition of translation on a per-cell basis). Furthermore, dual inhibition of mTOR and FLT3 by combination treatment resulted in a dramatic increase of OPP<sup>low</sup> cells even in the presence of hBMSC-CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Our data from earlier time points suggest that leftward peak shift in OPP<sup>high</sup> cells and accumulation of OPP<sup>low</sup> cells occur over the course of drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Notably, mTOR inhibition alone showed a leftward shift in OPP<sup>high</sup> cells without noticeable detection of OPP<sup>low</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>), consistent with a partial reduction in overall translation (that apparently is well-tolerated by cells).</p><p>To determine how hBMSC-CM affects translation of specific mRNAs in FLT3-ITD AML cells following inhibition of FLT3 and/or mTOR signaling, we performed polysome fractionization using ultracentrifugation through sucrose density gradients followed by analysis of mRNA distribution profiles. As expected, cells treated with quizartinib in RPMI showed a much higher proportion of transcripts bound to the 80S monosome and substantially reduced polysome-associated transcripts, consistent with impaired translation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, FLT3 inhibition in hBMSC-CM showed partial restoration of polysome content, especially heavy polysomes that consist of five or more ribosomes, with a concomitant decrease in the 80S monosome peak. Moreover, addition of everolimus to quizartinib treatment reversed the partial restoration of heavy polysomes in hBMSC-CM. Findings from our polysome profiling are consistent with what we observed from OPP assays, further validating the role of restored mTOR signaling by hBMSC-CM in regulation of protein translation. Finally, we tested whether pharmacological inhibition of translation recapitulates the effect of mTOR inhibition in reversing hBMSC-CM-mediated protection from apoptosis following FLT3 inhibition. Indeed, combinatorial treatment of quizartinib with the translation inhibitor homoharringtonine (HHT) showed a significantly higher number of apoptotic cells compared to cells treated with quizartinib alone, even in the presence of hBMSC-CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), phenocopying the effect of everolimus. These results further support previously reported synergistic elimination of FLT3-ITD AML cells following treatment with FLT3 inhibitors in combination with HHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lam et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that mTOR-dependent partial restoration of translation activity is a key survival mechanism of FLT3-ITD AML cells in hBMSC-CM following FLT3 inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Examination of polysome enrichment of transcripts reveals a critical role for oxidative phosphorylation in hBMSC-CM-mediated protection from FLT3 inhibition</title><p>Our OPP assays and polysome profiling data indicate that hBMSC-CM induces partial restoration of translation activity and polysome-associated transcripts following FLT3 inhibition, respectively. Yet, the mechanism for how cells survive despite incomplete restoration of translation remains unknown. To investigate this, we further analyzed mRNAs enriched in heavy polysomes to examine whether specific subsets of mRNAs were selectively translated. First, we measured levels of RNAs isolated from the whole lysates (input) and heavy polysome fractions. As expected, cells treated with quizartinib alone or quizartinib and everolimus in combination demonstrated a significant reduction of RNA levels that was substantially more extensive in polysomes than inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), consistent with the suppressive effects of FLT3 inhibition on polysome engagement of transcripts. mRNAs isolated from input and heavy polysomes were subjected to RNA-seq. Notably, GSEA applied on RNA-seq data from input (unfractionated) samples indicated that the addition of everolimus to quizartinib in hBMSC-CM significantly suppressed a majority of the pathways that were shown to be restored by hBMSC-CM following treatment of quizartinib alone, including genes for mTORC1 signaling, MYC targets, oxidative phosphorylation, and translation regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>; compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and G</xref>). Thus, mTOR signaling is essential for the ability of hBMSC-CM to maintain the expression of these key pathways in FLT3-inhibited cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Polysome enrichment of transcripts by human bone marrow stromal cell (hBMSC-CM) following FLT3 inhibition is highly selective for oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs and is mTOR-dependent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RNA yields from whole-cell lysates (input) and heavy polysome fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) were measured and normalized to vehicle-treated group in RPMI for each biological replicate.

Remarkably, only one Hallmark pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, exhibited significant enrichment in heavy polysomes isolated from cells treated with quizartinib in hBMSC-CM compared to those in RPMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, combinatorial treatment of quizartinib with everolimus significantly reduced polysome enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs, even in the presence of hBMSC-CM, compared to quizartinib alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In fact, oxidative phosphorylation was the only Hallmark gene set with significant (by p-adj) alteration with the combination treatment. Interestingly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, oxidative phosphorylation was also the most enriched pathway identified in primary AML cells in the BM relative to the spleen in mice treated with quizartinib. Our GSEA of Hallmark gene sets demonstrates that other pathways with statistical significance showed opposite enrichment patterns, suggesting polysome enrichment of transcripts by hBMSC-CM following FLT3 inhibition is highly selective to oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs and is mTOR-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). In accordance with this, GSEA of Gene Ontology gene sets demonstrated similar polysome enrichment patterns for transcripts that are involved with mitochondria integrity and biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Given that mTOR has been shown to control transcription of mitochondrial genes through a complex involving transcription factors such as PGC1-Î± and YY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cunningham et al., 2007</xref>), we further compared levels of transcripts in input samples of multiple mitochondrial genes and transcription factors that regulate the expression of mitochondrial genes. Interestingly, PGC1-Î± and the mitochondrial enzyme IDH3A demonstrated mTOR-dependent restoration by hBMSC-CM following FLT3 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). PGC1-Î± is a transcriptional coactivator, and thus its mTOR-dependent restoration by hBMSC-CM could contribute to the partial restoration of OXPHOS, a possibility that would require further investigation. Notably, other mitochondrial transcriptional regulators and mitochondrial genes examined did not show such patterns.</p><p>To examine whether altered expression and polysome enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs translates into corresponding changes in mitochondrial respiration, we measured the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of MOLM-13 cells following inhibition of FLT3 and/or mTOR in either RPMI or hBMSC-CM. In agreement with our findings from GSEA, we found a dramatic decrease in OCR in cells following FLT3 inhibition, while the OCR reduction was partially restored in the presence of hBMSC-CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Furthermore, the dual inhibition of FLT3 and mTOR reversed this partial restoration of OCR. Of note, the degree of restoration was greater for maximal respiration than basal respiration, as represented by reserve respiratory capacity that reflects the difference between maximal and basal respiratory rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The observed changes in OCR coincide with similar alterations in ATP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that restoration of OCR is able to rescue ATP, which may be key for cell survival. Similarly, we observed hBMSC-CM-mediated partial restoration of OCR following FLT3 inhibition in MV4-11 cells. While the degree of restoration is less than what we observed in MOLM-13 cells, the dual inhibition of FLT3 and mTOR reversed this restoration of OCR. Moreover, alterations in OCR translate into corresponding changes in ATP levels in MV4-11 cells as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Additionally, accumulating evidence indicates that ATM drives the BM-mediated resistance to chemotherapy in other hematological malignancies, such as multiple myeloma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia via upregulation of cytokines such as IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tang et al., 2018</xref>) or CCL3, CCL4, and GDF15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). We found that blocking FLT3 inhibited ATM expression in RPMI, but that ATM expression was maintained in hBMSC-CM following FLT3 inhibition in FLT3-ITD AML cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). However, dual inhibition of mTOR and FLT3 did not reverse the effect of hBMSC-CM on ATM levels, suggesting that ATM acts upstream of mTOR. We observed that phosphorylated ATM (S1981) was predominantly detected at a smaller size (~250 kDa) than full-length ATM (350 kDa) following FLT3 inhibition in RPMI, while hBMSC-CM significantly restored full-length phosphorylated ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Moreover, dual inhibition of mTOR and FLT3 resulted in a higher ratio of small to full-length phospho-ATM. Treatment of cells with pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK resulted in the elimination of the small ATM isoform following FLT3 inhibition, suggesting that cleavage of full-length ATM was mediated by caspase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>), as previously reported from other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).

In the absence of BM stroma, FLT3-ITD AML cells undergo apoptosis upon FLT3 inhibition as a result of downregulation of ATM and mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity (left). In the presence of BM stroma, on the other hand, FLT3-ITD AML cells are protected from cell-killing effects by FLT3 inhibition (right). As indicated by orange arrows, the BM stroma-mediated protection is driven by ATM through regulation of mTOR protein levels, as well as mTORC1 activity via AKT, subsequently leading to partial restoration of translation. Restored mTORC1 activity selectively drives translation of oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs that promote cell survival even in the presence of FLT3 inhibition. The BM stroma-mediated protection against apoptosis upon FLT3 inhibition is reversed with combinatorial treatment with everolimus, which inhibits mTOR signaling and downstream processes including polysome enrichment and selective translation of oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs, and oxidative phosphorylation.

Compared to cells expressing nontargeting shRNA (shNT), cells with shRNA-mediated ATM knockdown (sh<italic>ATM</italic>) demonstrated reversal of protection against apoptosis upon FLT3 inhibition in hBMSC-CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), as well as impaired recovery of cell growth after removal of quizartinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We also observed reversal of hBMSC-CM-mediated protection with ATM knockdown in MV4-11 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Given that ATM has long been known to regulate cell cycle checkpoints, we asked whether knocking down ATM allowed cell cycle progression despite FLT3 inhibition via bypassing ATM-dependent checkpoint arrest. We found that sh<italic>ATM</italic> did not prevent the G1 arrest observed with quizartinib with or without hBMSC-CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7âfigure supplement 4</xref>), indicating that the mechanism of hBMSC-CM-mediated protection by ATM is not through activating cell cycle checkpoints.</p><p>Based on the importance of mTOR signaling in hBMSC-CM-mediated protection, we wanted to further investigate the potential association between ATM and mTOR signaling in FLT3-ITD AML cells. Strikingly, knockdown of ATM resulted in the complete absence of detectable mTOR protein expression (validated with two different antibodies as described in âMaterials and methodsâ), without significantly affecting the baseline phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Still, upon FLT3 inhibition, sh<italic>ATM</italic> prevented the restoration of p-4E-BP1 or p-S6 otherwise elicited by hBMSC-CM. Additionally, sh<italic>ATM</italic> not only resulted in a moderate reduction of AKT protein levels, but also impaired the hBMSC-CM-mediated restoration of phosphorylation of AKT following FLT3 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These results implicate ATM as a key regulator of mTORC1 signaling through regulation of the mTOR protein itself, as well as AKT that has been shown to regulate mTORC1 via phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). It is important to note that we observed the same results in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ATM knockout FLT3-ITD AML cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7âfigure supplement 5</xref>). The ATM knockout cells also showed greater sensitivity to FLT3 inhibition in RPMI and reversal of protection against apoptosis upon FLT3 inhibition in hBMSC-CM, compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7âfigure supplement 5</xref>), further validating our findings. In addition, we confirmed that in other AML cell lines MV4-11 (FLT3-ITD), THP-1 or OCI-AML3 (both FLT3 WT), the degree of ATM knockdown correlated with the extent of reductions in mTOR expression and with AKT phosphorylation in MV4-11 and THP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7âfigure supplement 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Furthermore, our analysis of data sets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) indicates that brain tissues from human ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients, who have mutated ATM, have significantly lower <italic>MTOR</italic> mRNA levels compared to control groups, coinciding with a reduction of gene expression associated with mTORC1 signaling and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways according to GSEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s7">Figure 7âfigure supplement 7</xref>). These data implicate that the role of ATM in controlling mTOR signaling extends to other cell types.</p><p>We next measured OCR in FLT3-ITD AML cells expressing shRNAs (shNT or sh<italic>ATM</italic>) following inhibition of FLT3 with or without hBMSC-CM. ATM knockdown resulted in a significant reduction of baseline OCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s8">Figure 7âfigure supplement 8</xref>). More importantly, ATM knockdown in combination with quizartinib prevented the partial restoration of OCR elicited by hBMSC-CM, consistent with our findings with dual inhibition of FLT3 and mTOR. Taken all together, our data indicate that ATM drives hBMSC-CM-mediated protection of AML cells from apoptosis following FLT3 inhibition through regulation of mTOR signaling and oxidative phosphorylation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Results presented here support a key role for a novel pathway mediated by ATM, mTOR, translational control, and oxidative phosphorylation, whereby BM stromal cells protect FLT3-ITD AML cells from therapeutic elimination following FLT3 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Multiple components of the hBMSC-CM-dependent pathway are essential for AML survival, as substantiated by the loss of protection when each mediator is targeted by pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockdown. Notably, this survival pathway can be effectively blocked at multiple points using FDA-approved drugs, including everolimus and HHT, which should facilitate the translation of these studies into clinical trials for FLT3-ITD AML. In all, these studies reveal the therapeutic potential of combining FLT3 inhibition with therapeutic targeting of mediators of this pathway to improve clinical outcomes for patients with FLT3-ITD AML.</p><p>Although numerous clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors both as monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutics for patients with FLT3-mutated AML, these trials have thus far not yielded prolonged remissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levis and Perl, 2020</xref>). This clinical challenge indicates that a better understanding of resistance mechanisms is necessary to identify additional targets for effective molecularly targeted AML therapy. The BM microenvironment has been shown to mediate resistance to FLT3 inhibitors via several mechanisms including (1) high levels of FLT3 ligand in the BM microenvironment that leads to persistent activation of FLT3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sato et al., 2011</xref>; (2) cytochrome p450 enzyme produced by BMSCs enhances metabolization of FLT3 inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; and (3) BMSCs-mediated activation of prosurvival pathways such as MAPK/ERK and/or STAT5 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Patel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Traer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sung et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, a recent study has shown that the BM microenvironment is responsible for early resistance of FLT3-ITD+ AML cells to FLT3 inhibition, followed by clonal expansion of pre-existing NRAS mutant subclones that drive relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joshi et al., 2021</xref>). Collectively, these studies suggest that BM-mediated resistance against FLT3-targeted therapy in FLT3-dependent AML cells is multifactorial and context-dependent.</p><p>In our present studies, we focused on intrinsic changes in AML cells upon FLT3 inhibition in the presence of BM microenvironmental factors by utilizing FLT3-ITD AML cell lines and xenograft mouse models utilizing primary FLT3-ITD+ AML cells. Both our in vitro and in vivo data consistently support the conclusion that persistent activation of mTOR signaling mediated by the BM microenvironment impedes cell death induced by FLT3 inhibition. Notably, activation of mTOR signaling has been previously shown in FLT3-WT AML cells co-cultured with mouse BM stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zeng et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting upregulation of the mTOR pathway in AML cells may not be limited to dependence on FLT3 or human BM stromal factors. Moreover, our therapeutic studies in mice demonstrated the limitation of FLT3-targeted monotherapy in eliminating leukemia from the BM compared to the periphery (spleen and blood), leading to relapse even with sustained treatment. Our results indicate that such relapse can be effectively prevented by combination therapy that targets FLT3 and mTOR signaling. Given that everolimus in combination with midostaurin (a multi-kinase inhibitor that targets FLT3) was well tolerated in patients with AML in a phase 1 clinical study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stone et al., 2012</xref>), our results suggest a promising treatment strategy for patients with FLT3-dependent AML.</p><p>Over the past two decades, many aspects of mTORâs role in controlling key cellular processes, including protein synthesis, have been extensively elucidated, and mechanistic details of mTOR-mediated pathways in different cellular and physiological contexts remain an area of active study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>). Whereas mTOR signaling has long been known to control global protein synthesis, studies have shown that it can also drive the selective translation of specific subsets of mRNAs. Selective translation by mTOR can be determined by the presence of 5â²terminal oligopyrimidine (5â²TOP) motifs within mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thoreen et al., 2012</xref>). Another study showed that mTOR-dependent selective translation of mRNAs that are important in cell proliferation, survival, and genomic reprogramming confers tamoxifen resistance and estrogen independence in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Geter et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the mechanism of mTOR-driven selective translation is complex and context-dependent, supporting the need for further investigation. Our data reveal a novel process through which mTOR-dependent translational control of transcripts involved in oxidative phosphorylation is a mechanism by which BMSCs mediate survival of FLT3-ITD AML cells following FLT3 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The mechanism we propose consolidates some of the major findings from studies that explore the role of mTOR signaling and oxidative phosphorylation in different physiological contexts: (1) enhanced mTORC1 signaling is required for translation of mitochondria-related mRNAs during erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2017</xref>); (2) mTORC1 controls mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis via regulation of 4E-BPs in human breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morita et al., 2013</xref>); and (3) upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation confers chemoresistance via inhibition of AMPK pathway and subsequent activation of mTORC1 signaling in FLT3-WT AML cells co-cultured with hBMSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">You et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have shown that drug-resistant AML cells and leukemia stem cells are highly dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for energy production, leading to clinical trials of several drugs that target mitochondrial metabolism, thus directly/indirectly inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Beauchamp et al., 2022</xref>). Compared to normal hematopoietic cells or solid tumors, AML cells have been shown to have low reserve respiratory capacity, rendering them highly sensitive to inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sriskanthadevan et al., 2015</xref>). Our data suggest that the significant restoration of maximal respiration rate and reserve respiratory capacity by hBMSC-CM may promote cell survival by preventing ATP depletion following FLT3 inhibition. While combination therapy effectively reversed the hBMSC-CM-mediated restoration of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP, mTOR inhibition alone did not significantly affect oxidative phosphorylation and ATP levels, suggesting that FLT3-ITD signaling may activate alternative pathway(s) to maintain mitochondrial bioenergetics. Given that low reserve respiratory capacity is a specific metabolic vulnerability of AML cells, we speculate that therapeutic targeting of the mTOR/translation/oxidative phosphorylation axis could block BM-mediated resistance to other AML therapies.</p><p>One of the novel aspects of our findings is the unconventional role of ATM in regulation of mTOR signaling and thus oxidative phosphorylation. While many regulators of the mTOR pathway have been identified in a wide range of cellular contexts, the control of the kinase activity of the two major mTOR complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, remains a primary focus to understand regulatory inputs of mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>). Yet, the regulation of mTOR protein levels is poorly understood. We discovered that ATM is required for the expression of the mTOR protein, independent of FLT3 activity or BM stromal effects. It is important to note that ATM-mediated regulation of mTOR protein levels does not appear to be unique to FLT3-dependent AMLs or leukemia in general, as implicated with our analyses of other cell types. Furthermore, our data suggest that ATM not only regulates mTOR protein levels, but also mediates the phosphorylation/activity of AKT. As ATM knockdown only reduced AKT activity in the context of FLT3 inhibition, ATM and FLT3 appear to redundantly regulate AKT activity. Given that AKT has been identified as a downstream effector of FLT3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fathi and Chen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gilliland and Griffin, 2002</xref>), BM stromal factors likely confer dependence of FLT3-ITD AML cells on ATM following FLT3 inhibition to maintain AKT activity, followed by subsequent activation of mTORC1. Similarly, our observation that S6 and 4E-BP1 were still phosphorylated under baseline condition even in the absence of mTOR in ATM deficient cells suggests that other determinants of S6 and 4E-BP1 activity beyond mTOR exist, perhaps involving other FLT3-dependent signaling molecules.</p><p>Based on these intriguing findings, it will be of interest to elucidate the mechanism of ATM-mediated regulation of mTOR signaling. Indeed, ATM has been shown to mediate numerous cellular homeostasis pathways, independent of its functions in response to DNA damage. ATM has been shown to be involved in insulin signaling by promoting protein translation by phosphorylating 4E-BP1 in HEK293 cells and adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang and Kastan, 2000</xref>), and by activating AKT via its kinase function to enhance glucose uptake in muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Halaby et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast to what we show here, ATM has been shown to <italic>inhibit</italic> mTOR signaling in response to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2010</xref>) or hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cam et al., 2010</xref>), implicating diverse and context-dependent functions of ATM.</p><p>In summary, our findings demonstrate that the BM microenvironment provides a unique survival pathway mediated by ATM, mTOR, and oxidative phosphorylation in FLT3-ITD AML cells following FLT3 inhibition. Therapeutic targeting of this pathway, such as by inhibition of mTOR, in combination with FLT3 inhibition could lead to more durable remissions for patients with FLT3-ITD+AML.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>All human AML cells, MOLM-13 (RRID<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_2119">:CVCL_2119</ext-link>), MV4-11 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0064">CVCL_0064</ext-link>), THP-1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0006">CVCL_0006</ext-link>), and OCI-AML3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_1844">CVCL_1844</ext-link>) were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibacterial antimycotic (anti-anti).

Leukemic burden was monitored by flow cytometry staining for human HLA-ABC-PE-Cy7 and CD45-FITC (eBioscience). Quizartinib was synthesized and prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez-Calderon et al., 2015</xref>), and was dissolved in 30% polyethylene glycol-400, 5% Tween 80 in ddH<sub>2</sub>O. 2.5 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg quizartinib was delivered once daily p.o. Everolimus was purchased from LC Laboratories and was dissolved in the same solvent as quizartinib. Then, 10 mg/kg everolimus was delivered once daily p.o. After treatments, mice were sacrificed, followed by collection of leukemia cells harvested from the blood, spleen, and BM. Leukemic burden was measured by counting percentages of HLA-ABC+/CD45+ via flow cytometry. For RNA-seq analysis, human leukemia cells were isolated using EasySep Mouse/Human Chimera Isolation Kit (#19849; Stemcell Technologies). All animal experiments were approved by and performed in accordance with guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Colorado (protocol no. 00170). Deidentified primary AML studies were obtained with donor consent from patients at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (COMIRB protocol #12-0173).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA)</title><p>MOLM-13 cells were treated with vehicle or 3 nM quizartinib in either RPMI or hBMSC-CM for 16 hr, followed by washing with PBS.

Poly-A-selected total RNA library construction was performed using Universal Plus mRNA-seq with NuQuant (#0520-A01; Tecan), and paired-end sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq6000 instrument (Illumina) in the Genomics Shared Resource (University of Colorado). Illumina adapters were trimmed and reads &lt;50 base pairs were removed with BBDuk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bushnell, 2019</xref>). Trimmed reads were aligned to the human Ensembl genome (hg38.p12, release 96) and gene counts were quantified using STAR v2.6.0a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). Ensembl IDs were mapped to gene names and counts of genes with multiple IDs were aggregated. Lowly expressed genes were defined as &lt;1 mean raw count or &lt;1 count per million across the dataset and were removed from the analysis. The limma R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>) was used to calculate differential expression between the indicated groups. An interaction model was used with the input fractions for the polysome comparisons. Pathway analysis was performed using fold-change and the fgsea R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sergushichev, 2016</xref>), and Hallmark or GO terms from the Molecular Signatures Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liberzon et al., 2011</xref>), which were downloaded using the msigdbr R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dolgalev, 2021</xref>). Heatmaps were generated using the complexheatmap R package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gu et al., 2016</xref> following counts per million normalization and z-score transformation.

Interestingly, PGC1-Î± and the mitochondrial enzyme IDH3A demonstrated mTOR-dependent restoration by hBMSC-CM following FLT3 inhibition (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1). PGC1-Î± is a transcriptional coactivator, and thus its mTOR dependent restoration by hBMSC-CM could contribute to the partial restoration of OXPHOS, a possibility that would require further investigation. Notably, other mitochondrial transcriptional regulators and mitochondrial genes examined did not show such patterns.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors used hBMSC conditioned medium to mimic the bone marrow environment and used normal RPMI media as a control, to investigate the effects of bone marrow-released stromal factors on the TLT3 inhibitor resistance of AML.

RPMI supplemented with the heavy fraction of hBMSC-CM that contains molecules larger than 30kDa phenocopied the protective effect of hBMSC-CM, while the light fraction of hBMSC-CM containing molecules smaller than 30kDa demonstrated complete loss of protection from apoptosis upon FLT3 inhibition, suggesting that the protective effects of hBMSC-CM are due to larger molecules and cannot be explained by altered levels of smaller metabolites and nutrients (Figure 1D). Moreover, conditioned media from HS-27A, another human BM stromal cell line, did not provide protection from apoptosis upon FLT3 inhibition (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3). Together with the previous finding that only HS-5 cells recapitulated the general expression pattern of primary BM mesenchymal stromal cells while HS-27A cells displayed a distinctive gene expression profile (19), our data indicate that protection may require specific soluble factor(s). To understand key soluble factors responsible for hBMSC-CM-mediated protection, we examined if cytokines enriched in BM microenvironment such as GM-CSF, IL-3 and FGF-2 that have been shown to protect FLT3-ITD AML cells from cell killing by FLT3 inhibitors (17, 18) show similar effects to hBMSC-CM. While GM-CSF or/and IL-3 induced modest and partial protection from apoptosis upon FLT3 inhibition, FGF-2 did not result in significant protection (Figure 1âfigure supplement 4), indicating that hBMSC-CM-mediated survival of FLT3-ITD AML cells from FLT3 inhibition likely involves multiple factors.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Explain why the treatment times of drugs changed from experiment to experiment. Is there any reason for this?</p></disp-quote><p>To determine the cell killing effects of drug treatments, we chose to measure apoptosis at 48 hours post drug treatment, a time point where cell death with the treatments is consistently evident. Following 48 hours of drug treatment, we measured cell viability at 5 days after reseeding cells from each condition to measure rebound growth, which reflects the ability of cells to recover and expand post drug treatments. For measurements of biochemical activities, such as RNA expression, protein levels, translation activity, and oxidative phosphorylation, we used shorter time points from 12-16 hours. Given that apoptosis begins about 20 hours post quizartinib, we chose these earlier timepoints to allow sufficient time for these parameters to change, but late enough to avoid the secondary effects of cell death activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Improve the Western blot quality throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated multiple Western blots, substantially improved the image quality of Figure 2D (particularly mTOR signaling western per reviewer 2âs concern #4), and improved image quality of other western blot figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Explain why In Figure 7C, knockdown of ATM completely eliminates mTOR but the translation indicators, p-4EBP1, and p-S6 are kept unchanged, indicating inhibition of mTOR in these cells has no effect on protein translation in general. This appears to contradict the data shown previously in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided an explanation for this result in the Discussion section (on page 15):</p><p>âour observation that S6 and 4E-BP1 were still phosphorylated under baseline condition even in the absence of mTOR in ATM deficient cells suggests that other determinants of S6 and 4EBP1 activity beyond mTOR exist, perhaps involving other FLT3-dependent signaling molecules.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) better place this work in the context of prior work. Prior papers report that the combination of FLT3 and mTOR inhibitors are synergistic, although they don't discuss stromal protection.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this concern on page 6 as follows:</p><p>âAs a downstream effector of activated FLT3 kinase, mTOR signaling has been implicated in the survival of FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> AML cells, and aberrant activation of the mTOR pathway has been reported in FLT3-ITD AML cell lines that developed intrinsic resistance to FLT3 inhibitors through long-term culture with FLT3 inhibitor, coinciding with enhanced sensitivity to the combination of FLT3 and mTOR inhibitors (26,27).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Address the issue of FLT3 inhibitor concentration. The experiments utilize a single concentration of FLT3 inhibitors. It would be helpful to understand the effects of a range of concentrations. Are the protective effects of stroma lost at higher concentrations? Do they see synergy without stroma at different concentrations?</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this concern on page 7 as follows:</p><p>âIn addition, combinatorial treatment of everolimus with a range of quizartinib concentrations demonstrated significantly greater elimination than quizartinib alone in both regular media RPMI and hBMSC-CM (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2), although the extent of this protection by hBMSC-CM was reduced at the highest dose of quizartinib, potentially due to off-target effects.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) It is interesting that polysome fractions show enrichment of oxphos transcripts, but gene expression pathways are not different. Can the authors speculate on how the polysome fractions of oxphos genes are increasing?</p></disp-quote><p>We elaborated on this result in the revised Discussion section (on page 14):</p><p>âOver the past two decades, many aspects of mTORâs role in controlling key cellular processes, including protein synthesis, have been extensively elucidated, and mechanistic details of mTOR-mediated pathways in different cellular and physiological contexts remain an area of active study (45). Whereas mTOR signaling has long been known to control global protein synthesis, studies have shown that it can also drive the selective translation of specific subsets of mRNAs. Selective translation by mTOR can be determined by the presence of 5â terminal oligopyrimidine (5âTOP) motifs within mRNAs (46). Another study showed that mTOR-dependent selective translation of mRNAs that are important in cell proliferation, survival, and genomic reprogramming confers tamoxifen resistance and estrogen independence in breast cancer cells (47). Thus, the mechanism of mTOR-driven selective translation is complex and context-dependent, supporting the need for further investigation. Our data reveal a novel process through which mTOR-dependent translational control of transcripts involved in oxidative phosphorylation is a mechanism by which BMSCs mediate survival of FLT3-ITD AML cells following FLT3 inhibition (Figure 7E). The mechanism we propose consolidates some of the major findings from studies that explore the role of mTOR signaling and oxidative phosphorylation in different physiological contexts: (1) Enhanced mTORC1 signaling is required for translation of mitochondria-related mRNAs during erythropoiesis (48); (2) mTORC1 controls mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis via regulation of 4E-BPs in human breast cancer cells (49); (3) Upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation confers chemoresistance via inhibition of AMPK pathway and subsequent activation of mTORC1 signaling in FLT3-WT AML cells co-cultured with hBMSC (50).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>3) An important area of novelty is that stroma maintains/increases mTOR signaling. However, more mechanistic studies would be needed to link the stroma to mTOR.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show that stromal factor(s) greater than 30KDa is essential for survival of AML cells following FLT3 inhibition. Still, we do not yet know what stromal factor(s) mediate the protection of AML cells from apoptosis through the ATM/mTOR/OXPHOS pathway. A new graduate student in the lab is working to identify the mechanistic details that link the BM stroma to ATM/mTOR/OXPHOS â we believe that these efforts will represent a multi-year project.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Are similar changes seen in AML patients treated with FLT3 inhibitors?</p></disp-quote><p>This is of great interest for us as it would be clinically relevant. We tried to obtain primary AML samples from patients treated with FLT3 inhibitors from our clinical collaborators, but we could not obtain sufficient numbers to allow this question to be addressed, given variability in treatments (e.g. often with standard chemotherapy) and variability of bone marrow sampling (often at points where leukemic burden was very low). We are in discussions with colleagues to translate our discoveries into a clinical trial combining FLT3 and mTOR inhibitors, and characterization of biochemical responses will be part of this trial.</p></body></sub-article></article>
