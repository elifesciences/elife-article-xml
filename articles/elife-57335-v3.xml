We measured BLA ACh signaling and activity of neurons expressing CaMKIIα (a marker for glutamatergic principal cells) in mice during cue-reward learning using a fluorescent ACh sensor and calcium indicators. We found that ACh levels and nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) cholinergic terminal activity in the BLA (NBM-BLA) increased sharply in response to reward-related events and shifted as mice learned the cue-reward contingency. BLA CaMKIIα neuron activity followed reward retrieval and moved to the reward-predictive cue after task acquisition. Optical stimulation of cholinergic NBM-BLA terminal fibers led to a quicker acquisition of the cue-reward contingency. These results indicate BLA ACh signaling carries important information about salient events in cue-reward learning and provides a framework for understanding how ACh signaling contributes to shaping BLA responses to emotional stimuli.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cholinergic</kwd><kwd>reward learning</kwd><kwd>fiber

availability of food and other natural rewards is critical for survival. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a brain area necessary for associating cues with both positive and negative valence outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baxter and Murray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">LeDoux et al., 1990</xref>). A recent study has shown that genetically distinct subsets of BLA principal neurons encode the appetitive and aversive value of stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2016b</xref>). This encoding involves the interplay between principal neurons, interneurons, and incoming terminal fibers, all of which need to be tightly regulated to function efficiently.</p><p>The neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh) is released throughout the brain and can control neuronal activity via a wide range of mechanisms. ACh signals through two families of receptors (nicotinic, nAChRs and muscarinic, mAChRs) that are differentially expressed on BLA neurons as well as their afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picciotto et al., 2012</xref>). ACh signals through these receptors to increase signal-to-noise ratios and modify synaptic transmission and plasticity in circuits involved in learning new contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picciotto et al., 2012</xref>), especially in areas that receive dense cholinergic input, like the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Woolf, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zaborszky et al., 2012</xref>). The effect of ACh signaling can differ depending on the receptor, as metabotropic mAChRs work on a slower timescale than the rapid, ionotropic nAChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu and Yakel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picciotto et al., 2012</xref>). The overall impact of ACh signaling on the BLA is likely quite heterogeneous as mAChRs are coupled to both inhibitory and excitatory signaling cascades and nAChRs are found on both glutamatergic and GABAergic BLA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picciotto et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The basal forebrain complex is a primary source of ACh input to the BLA. In particular, the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) sends dense cholinergic projections to the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Woolf, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zaborszky et al., 2012</xref>). Optical stimulation of BLA-projecting cholinergic terminal fibers (NBM-BLA) during fear conditioning is sufficient to strengthen fear memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>) and may support appetitive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitta-aho et al., 2018</xref>). Cholinergic NBM neurons increase their firing in response to both rewarding and aversive unconditioned stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>). Cholinergic signaling in the medial prefrontal cortex and visual cortex has been linked to cue detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parikh et al., 2007</xref>) and reward timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chubykin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), respectively. A recent study has also demonstrated that NBM cells fire in response to a conditioned stimulus during trace fear conditioning, indicating that ACh signaling may be involved in learning about cues that predict salient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that ACh signaling in the BLA is a critical neuromodulatory signal that responds to both unconditioned stimuli and cues that gain salience, thereby coordinating activity in circuits necessary for learning cue-reward contingencies. To test this hypothesis, we measured relative levels of BLA ACh (ACh signaling), cholinergic NBM-BLA terminal fiber activity (BLA ACh signal origin), and the activity of BLA principal neurons (BLA output) across all phases of learning in an appetitive operant learning task to evaluate how BLA output and ACh signaling are related to behavioral performance in this paradigm. We then optically stimulated cholinergic NBM fibers locally in the BLA, while mice learned to nose poke in response to an auditory cue to receive a food reward to determine if accelerating the increase in ACh signaling that occurs as mice learn the task would enhance performance. We also pharmacologically blocked different ACh receptors during the learning task to determine the subtypes involved, and varied the timing of optical stimulation of cholinergic NBM-BLA terminal fibers to determine whether ACh release time-locked with the reward-predictive cue is necessary for the improvement of the task performance. These studies provide a novel framework for understanding how NBM ACh signaling in the BLA is recruited during the perception of novel stimuli and how it contributes to linking previously neutral cues to predictions about future salient outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Acetylcholine release in the BLA occurs at salient points in the cue-reward learning task and shifts as mice learn the cue-reward contingency</title><p>The BLA is critical for learning that previously neutral cues can predict future punishments or rewards and for assigning valence to those cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baxter and Murray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>). The BLA receives dense cholinergic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Woolf, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zaborszky et al., 2012</xref>) and we speculated that, since ACh signaling is involved in both attention and several types of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picciotto et al., 2012</xref>), it could be essential for learning about cues that predict salient events, such as reward delivery. Based on data showing that ACh neurons fire in response to unexpected or salient events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>), we also hypothesized that ACh release might vary as mice learn a cue-reward contingency. Therefore, we designed a cue-reward learning task in which food-restricted mice were trained to perform a nose poke when signaled by a cue (tone) to receive a palatable reward (Ensure) on a 30 s variable intertrial interval (ITI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>).

Animals quickly learned to make a high number of responses over the course of each Pre-Training session. In this paradigm, mice obtained most available rewards by day 5 of Pre-Training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, blue shaded region). However, this phase of training did not promote learning of the cue-reward contingency, (i.e. that they should only nose poke during tone presentation) seen by the high number of incorrect nose pokes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, blue shaded region). Mice performed roughly eightfold more incorrect nose pokes than correct nose pokes, suggesting that mice were not attending to the task contingency. The Training phase of the task was identical to Pre-Training except incorrect nose pokes resulted in a 5 s timeout, during which the house light was illuminated, that concluded with a restarting of the ITI timer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, red active nose poke not coincident with tone). On day 1 of the Training phase, all animals earned fewer rewards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, pink shading) and, while still high, incorrect nose pokes dropped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, pink shading). Animals that did not meet acquisition criterion by day 9 (defined as consistently earning 20 or more rewards per session, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, white horizontal line) were moved to a 20 s variable ITI to promote responding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, pink shading day 10). Following the change in ITI, mice acquired the cue-reward behavior at different rates. After acquisition, animals were switched to Extinction training in which correct nose pokes did not result in reward delivery, and all mice decreased nose poke responding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> + <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, orange shading).</p><p>During Pre-Training, when there were high numbers of both correct and incorrect nose pokes, there was a large increase in ACh release following correct nose pokes, which were followed by reward delivery and receptacle light, but not incorrect nose pokes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> + <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). We used bootstrapped confidence intervals (bCIs) to determine when transients were statistically significant (bCI did not contain the null of 0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2020</xref>]). Correct, but not incorrect, nose poke trials consistently showed a sustained, significant increase in fluorescence close to the time of nose poke onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We also observed a significant decrease in fluorescence for most mice around 2–4 s after correct nose poke, which corresponds to the time of reward retrieval.</p><p>ACh release occurred in response to different events as mice learned the task (data for individual mice are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> + <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–G</xref> and averaged data across all mice at key time points in the task is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> + <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). During Pre-Training rewarded trials, the highest levels of ACh release occurred close to the time of correct nose pokes (NP), with a smaller peak at the time of reward retrieval (entry into the reward receptacle, Rec). As Training began, the ACh release during reward trials shifted dramatically toward the time of reward retrieval, likely because the animals were learning that many nose pokes did not result in reward delivery. Incorrect nose pokes that triggered a timeout were also followed by a modest but non-significant increase in BLA ACh levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–H</xref>). As mice began to learn the contingency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> + <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>, 10 rewards), the peak ACh release during rewarded trials shifted back to the time of the correct nose poke response. As animals approached the acquisition criterion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> + <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>, Acq.), ACh level significantly increased at the time of the tone, suggesting that as animals learned the cue-reward contingency, the tone became a more salient event. At this time point, there was still a peak at the time of reward, but its magnitude was diminished. After task acquisition, the increase in ACh following correct nose pokes remained but was diminished, and incorrect nose pokes did not elicit apparent ACh release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C–H</xref>, Acq.). During Extinction, ACh release to tone onset diminished. We replicated this experiment in an independent cohort of mice and found similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). Mice in this replicate cohort learned in a similar fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref> + 4A) but met the acquisition criteria faster than initial mice because aspects of the behavioral setup were optimized (3D printed wall extensions) to allow the imaging apparatus to be used inside sound attenuating chambers (see Materials and methods section). One difference observed in this group that learned the task more rapidly, was small magnitude, but significant, increases in BLA ACh release following tone onset late in Pre-Training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C–I</xref>). As behavioral performance during the Training phase increased, ACh release to tone onset became more pronounced, as in the initial cohort.</p><p>In order to determine the source of the ACh released in the BLA during cue-reward learning, we recorded calcium dynamics as a measure of cell activity of ChAT<sup>+</sup> NBM terminal fibers in the BLA (NBM-BLA), since the NBM is a major source of cholinergic input to the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Woolf, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zaborszky et al., 2012</xref>). We injected AAV carrying a Cre-recombinase-dependent, genetically-encoded calcium indicator (DIO-GCaMP7s) into the NBM of ChAT-IRES-Cre mice and implanted an optical fiber above the ipsilateral BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> + <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A–C</xref>). As with the ACh3.0 sensor, there was a significant increase in NBM-BLA cholinergic terminal activity following correct, but not incorrect, nose pokes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> + <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5D–E</xref>). NBM-BLA cholinergic terminal activity evolved across phases of the reward learning task as was seen for ACh levels in the BLA (data for each mouse shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> + <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5F–G</xref>, averaged across all mice at key time points in the task shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> + <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7G</xref>). Strikingly, NBM-BLA cholinergic terminal activity most closely followed correct nose pokes in Pre-Training and shifted primarily to tone onset as mice learned the contingency during Training. As in the replication cohort for the ACh sensor, small magnitude, but significant, increases in terminal activity were observed following tone onset late in Pre-Training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> + <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7G</xref>). Incorrect nose pokes that resulted in a timeout in Training sessions were followed by a modest increase in NBM-BLA cholinergic terminal activity before task acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6B–E</xref>). During Extinction, activity of NBM-BLA terminals following tone onset diminished. These findings were replicated in an independent cohort of mice, which we combined for across-mouse statistical analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplements 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">8</xref>).</p><p>In order to record NBM-BLA cholinergic terminal activity and BLA ACh levels simultaneously in the same mouse, we injected AAV carrying a construct for Cre-recombinase dependent red-shifted genetically-encoded calcium indicator (DIO-jRCaMP1b) into the NBM of ChAT-IRES-Cre mice, ACh3.0 sensor into the ipsilateral BLA, and implanted a fiber above the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9A–E</xref>, mouse 1). DIO-jRCaMP1b was also injected into the NBM of a wild-type littermate so Cre-mediated recombination would not occur to control for any crosstalk between the ACh3.0 and jRCaMP1b channels. While this was only a single animal and proof of principle for future studies, we found that NBM-BLA cholinergic terminal activity coincided with ACh levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9F–G</xref>). Importantly, this relationship between ACh release and NBM-BLA terminal fiber activity was not explained by signal crosstalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9H–I</xref>), further indicating that the BLA ACh measured comes at least in part from the NBM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>BLA principal neurons respond to reward availability and follows cue-reward learning</title><p>Glutamatergic principal cells are the primary output neurons of the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>), and their firing is modulated by NBM-BLA cholinergic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Unal et al., 2015</xref>).

Cholinergic cells in the basal forebrain complex fire in response to both positive and negative reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>). The results shown here indicate that ACh signaling in the BLA is intimately involved in cue-reward learning. Endogenous ACh is released in the BLA in response to salient events in the task, and ACh dynamics evolved as the subject formed associations between stimuli and reward. While the pattern of ACh signaling in the BLA may seem reminiscent of how dopamine neurons encode reward prediction errors as measured in other brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>), the current results suggest that ACh release in the BLA may instead be involved in signaling a combination of salience and novelty. ACh release and NBM-BLA activity increased following correct nose poke and, around the time that animals acquired the cue-reward task, following tone onset. However, earlier in Training, incorrect nose pokes that resulted in a timeout were also followed by ACh release, although this was smaller in magnitude. Further, stimulating NBM-BLA cholinergic terminals during learning enhanced behavioral performance, but was not intrinsically rewarding on its own and did not support responding for the tone alone. Although ACh was released in the BLA at discrete points during the task, the effects of heightened BLA ACh signaling were relatively long lasting, since it was not necessary for stimulation to be time-locked to cue presentation or reward retrieval to enhance behavioral performance. Thus, cholinergic inputs from the basal forebrain complex to the BLA are a key component of the circuitry that links salient events to previously neutral stimuli in the environment and uses those neutral cues to predict future rewarded outcomes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>BLA ACh signaling and CaMKIIα cell activity are related to cue-reward learning</title><p>We have shown that ACh release in the BLA is coincident with the stimulus that was most salient to the animal at each phase of the task. Use of the fluorescent ACh sensor was essential in determining these dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jing et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jing et al., 2019</xref>). Previous microdialysis studies have shown that ACh is released in response to positive, negative, or surprising stimuli, but this technique is limited by relatively long timescales (min) and cannot be used to determine when cholinergic transients align to given events in an appetitive learning task and how they evolve over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sarter and Lustig, 2020</xref>). In this cue-reward learning paradigm, when there was no consequence for incorrect nose-poking (Pre-Training phase), animals learned to perform a very high number of nose pokes and received a large number of rewards, and BLA ACh signaling peaked following correct nose pokes. Both the behavioral response (nose poking that was not contingent with the tone) and the ACh response (linked to the correct nose poke) suggest that the animals were not attending to the tone during most of the Pre-Training phase of the task, but rather were attending to the cues associated with reward delivery, such as the reward light or the sound of the pump that delivered the reward. Consistent with this possibility, in the next phase of the task when mice received a timeout for responding if the tone was not presented, performance of all groups dropped dramatically. Interestingly, in animals that had difficulty learning the cue-reward contingency, during early Training sessions ACh release shifted to reward retrieval, likely because this was the most salient aspect of the task when the majority of nose pokes performed did not result in reward. Finally, as mice acquired the contingency between tone and reward availability, the tone also began to elicit ACh release in the BLA, suggesting that mice learned that the tone is a salient event predicting reward availability. Since there are multiple sources of ACh input to the BLA, it was important to determine whether NBM cholinergic neurons were active during the periods when ACh levels were high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Woolf, 1991</xref>). Recordings from cholinergic NBM-BLA terminal fibers showed similar dynamics to ACh measurements, suggesting that the NBM is a primary source of ACh across the phases of cue-reward learning.</p><p>Perhaps the most well-known example of dynamic responding related to learning cue-reward contingencies and encoding of reward prediction errors is the firing of dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schultz, 1998</xref>). After sufficient pairings, dopaminergic neurons will fire in response to the cue that predicts the reward, and no longer to the rewarding outcome, which corresponds with behavioral changes that indicate an association has been formed between conditioned stimuli (CS) and unconditioned stimuli (US). It should be noted that dopamine signaling is not unique in this learning-related dynamic response profile. Serotonergic neuronal responses also evolve during reward learning in a manner distinct from dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhong et al., 2017</xref>). Plasticity related to learning has also been observed in cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain complex during aversive trace conditioning, such that after several training days, neuronal activity spans the delay between CS and US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, a recent study suggested that ACh may signal a valence-free reinforcement prediction error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sturgill et al., 2020</xref>). Future studies on the selective inputs to NBM to BLA cholinergic neurons would be of interest to identify the links between brain areas involved in prediction error coding.</p><p>We found that BLA CaMKIIα cells were most reliably activated following reward retrieval before contingency acquisition (both when they were receiving several rewards but no timeouts in Pre-Training and few rewards early in Training). Similar to the recording of ACh levels, after acquisition, the tone began to elicit an increase in BLA CaMKIIα cell population activity. However, activity of CaMKIIα neurons differed from ACh signaling in the BLA in important ways. ACh was released in response to the salient events in the task that were best able to predict reward delivery or availability. By contrast, the activity of BLA CaMKIIα neurons was not tightly time-locked to correct nose poking, and instead followed reward retrieval until acquisition, when activity increased in response to tone onset. The divergent dynamics of ACh release and CaMKIIα neuron activity underscores that ACh’s role in the BLA is to modulate, rather than drive, the activity of CaMKIIα neurons, and therefore may alter dynamics of the network through selective engagement of different populations of GABA interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Unal et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Increasing BLA acetylcholine levels enhances cue-reward learning</title><p>Neuronal activity and plasticity in the BLA is required for both acquisition of appetitive learning (conditioned reinforcement) and fear conditioning, however the inputs that increase activity in the structure during salient events likely come from many brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McKernan and Shinnick-Gallagher, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rogan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tye et al., 2008</xref>). In particular, dopaminergic inputs to the BLA are important for acquisition of conditioned reinforcement and for linking the rewarding properties of addictive drugs to cues that predict their availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cador et al., 1989</xref>). Our results indicate that ACh is a critical neuromodulator upstream of the BLA that is responsive to salient events, such as reward availability, motor actions that elicit reward, and cues that predict reward. We show here that increasing endogenous ACh signaling in the BLA caused mice to perform significantly better than controls in an appetitive cued-learning task. Heightened ACh release during learning of a cue-action-reward contingency led to fewer incorrect responses and increased acquisition rate in both female and male mice. The optical stimulation was triggered by correct nose poke, thus the cholinergic NBM-BLA terminal fiber stimulation overlapped with all three salient events: tone, nose poke, and reward retrieval, since the tone terminated 2 s after correct nose poke. We chose this stimulation pattern, as opposed to linking optical stimulation to tone onset, to ensure stimulation was dependent on behavioral responses. Therefore, stimulation did not precisely recapitulate the ACh release profile observed in mice that had already acquired the task (when ACh increases following tone onset). This suggests that behaviorally-contingent increases in BLA ACh are sufficient to enhance task acquisition (but see below). It is also possible that optogenetic-mediated ACh release may last longer than endogenous, tone-evoked release. A simultaneous stimulation and recording approach would be required to compare ACh release under both conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pisansky et al., 2019</xref>). It is important to note that basal forebrain neurons have been demonstrated to co-release ACh and GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saunders et al., 2015</xref>), and cholinergic basal forebrain neurons that project to the BLA have been shown to co-express a glutamate transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nickerson Poulin et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, it is possible that both fiber photometry and optogenetic results could be influenced, in part, by co-release of other neurotransmitters from ChAT-positive neurons. Future studies employing additional fluorescent neurotransmitter sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marvin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marvin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marvin et al., 2019</xref>) could help understand the interaction between the different signals employed by basal forebrain neurons.</p><p>It is possible that ACh improved learning by increasing the intensity of the reward, potentiating the learned association, improving discrimination, or a combination of these phenomena. However, increasing ACh release in the BLA was not inherently rewarding, because it did not support self-stimulation or real-time place preference. This is at odds with a recent study that found stimulation of NBM-BLA cholinergic terminals could induce a type of place-preference and modest self-stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitta-aho et al., 2018</xref>). Perhaps slight differences in targeting of ChR2 infusion or differences in the behavioral paradigm could be responsible for the lack of direct rewarding effects of optical ChAT terminal stimulation in the current study. Other recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>) has demonstrated that stimulating this NBM-BLA cholinergic pathway is sufficient to strengthen cued aversive memory, suggesting that the effect of ACh in the BLA may not be inherently rewarding or punishing but instead potentiates plasticity in the BLA, allowing learning of cue-outcome contingencies. Similarly, it is possible that ACh alters motor activity. However, there were no effects of optical stimulation on locomotion or responding in the inactive nose poke port. In addition, during the Pre-Training phase when there was no consequence for incorrect nose pokes, all groups earned the same number of rewards, regardless of optical stimulation or pharmacological blockade of ACh receptors, suggesting that ACh is not involved in the motor aspects of the task or the value of the reward. Indeed, differences emerged only during the Training phase, when attention to the tone was critical to earn rewards. Further, incorrect nose poking remained high for mice administered scopolamine. This suggests that scopolamine-treated animals were seeking the reward, as in the operant familiarization and Pre-Training phases of training, but were unable to learn that they should only nose poke in response to the tone.</p><p>Cell-type-specific expression of AChRs and activity-dependent effects place cholinergic signaling at a prime position to shape BLA activity during learning. For instance, late-firing interneurons in the BLA exhibit nAChR-dependent EPSP’s when no effect is seen on fast-spiking interneurons, while principal neurons can be either excited or inhibited through mAChRs, depending on activity level of the neuron at the time of cholinergic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Unal et al., 2015</xref>). BLA mAChRs can support persistent firing in principal neurons and can be important for the expression of conditioned place preference behavior, as well as trace fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baysinger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egorov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McIntyre et al., 1998</xref>). Similar to studies of trace fear conditioning, in which activity of the network over a delay period must be maintained, we found that metabotropic (mAChRs) but not ionotropic (nAChRs) ACh receptors were required for learning the contingency of this cue-reward task. The timing of cholinergic signaling can be a critical factor in the induction of synaptic plasticity in other brain regions, so we hypothesized that the enhancement of cue-reward learning observed might be dependent upon when NBM-BLA terminal fibers were stimulated with respect to tone presentation and/or behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu and Yakel, 2011</xref>). However, we found that heightened ACh signaling in the BLA improved behavioral performance even when stimulations were explicitly unpaired with the cue or correct nose poking. This suggests that the effect of increased cholinergic signaling in the BLA is long lasting, and that stimulation during a learning session is sufficient to potentiate synaptic events linking the cue to a salient outcome—even if CS and/or reward delivery are presented tens of seconds later. Given the findings from fiber photometry recordings, which showed endogenous ACh release was time-locked to salient stimuli during the task and evolved with learning, it is surprising that time-locking of exogenous ACh release was not necessary for enhancement of cue-reward learning. Coupled with pharmacological evidence demonstrating that muscarinic signaling is necessary for reward learning in this task, these results suggest the involvement of metabotropic signaling downstream of muscarinic receptors that outlasts the initial cholinergic stimulation.</p><p>To conclude, the abundant ACh input to the BLA results in ACh release in response to stimuli that predict reward in a learned cue-reward task. Increasing cholinergic signaling results in accelerated learning of the cue-reward contingency. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ACh is a neuromodulator that is released in response to salient stimuli and suggests that ACh signaling may enhance neuronal plasticity in the BLA network, leading to accelerated cue-reward learning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Mono fiber-optic cannulas (1.25 mm outer diameter zirconia ferrule; 5 mm long, 200 µm core diameter/245 µm outer diameter, 0.37 NA, polyimide buffer outer layer cannula; Doric Lenses) were inserted bilaterally above the basolateral amygdala (BLA, A/P; −1.22 mm, M/L ± 2.75 mm, D/V −4.25 mm). Mice were randomly assigned to EYFP or ChR2 groups, controlling for average group age.</p><p>For ex vivo local field potential electrophysiology experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), the NBM was injected with DIO-ChR2-EYFP as described above, except mice were 8 weeks of age (see Supplemental Methods for current clamp recording methods). The coronal brain slices containing the NBM were prepared after 2–4 weeks of expression. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 1× Fatal-Plus (Vortech Pharmaceuticals, Dearborn, MI) and were perfused through their circulatory systems to cool down the brain with an ice-cold (4°C) and oxygenated cutting solution containing (mM): sucrose 220, KCl 2.5, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.23, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 26, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 6 and glucose 10 (pH 7.3 with NaOH). Mice were then decapitated with a guillotine immediately; the brain was removed and immersed in the ice-cold (4°C) and oxygenated cutting solution to trim to a small tissue block containing the NBM. Coronal slices (300 μm thick) were prepared with a Leica vibratome (Leica Biosystems Inc, Buffalo Grove, IL) after the tissue block was glued on the vibratome stage with Loctite 404 instant adhesive (Henkel Adhesive Technologies, Düsseldorf, Germany). After preparation, slices were maintained at room temperature (23–25°C) in the storage chamber in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; bubbled with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>% and 95% O<sub>2</sub>) containing (in mM): NaCl 124, KCl 3, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.23, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 26, glucose 10 (pH 7.4 with NaOH) for recovery and storage. Slices were transferred to the recording chamber and constantly perfused with ACSF with a perfusion rate of 2 mL/min at a temperature of 33°C for electrophysiological experiments. Cell-attached extracellular recording of action potentials was performed by attaching a glass micropipette filled with ACSF on EYFP-expressing cholinergic neurons with an input resistance of 10–20 MΩ under current clamp. Blue light (488 nm) pulse (60 ms) was applied to the recorded cells through an Olympus BX51WI microscope (Olympus, Waltham, MA) under the control of the Sutter filter wheel shutter controller (Lambda 10–2, Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). All data were sampled at 3–10 kHz, filtered at 3 kHz and analyzed with an Apple Macintosh computer using Axograph X (AxoGraph). Events of field action potentials were detected and analyzed with an algorithm in Axograph X as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rao et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Behavioral testing</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Habituation</title><p>One week after surgery, mice were weighed daily and given sufficient food (2018S standard chow, Envigo, Madison, WI) to maintain 85% free-feeding body weight. All behavioral tests were performed during the light cycle. Mice were allowed to acclimate to the behavioral room for 30 min before testing and were returned to the animal colony after behavioral sessions ended.</p><p>Two weeks after surgery, mice were handled 3 min per day for 7 d in the behavioral room. Mice were given free access to the reward (EnsurePlus Vanilla Nutrition Shake solution mixed with equal parts water (Ensure); Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) in a 50 mL conical tube cap in their home cages on the last 3 d of handling to familiarize them to the novel solution. Mice were also habituated to patch cord attachment during the last 3 d of handling for optical stimulation and fiber photometry experiments. Immediately before training each day, a patch cord was connected to their optical fiber(s) via zirconia sleeve(s) (1.25 mm, Doric Lenses) before being placed in the behavioral chamber.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Operant training</title><p>All operant training was carried out using Med Associates modular test chambers and accessories (ENV-307A; Med Associates Inc, Georgia, VT). For optical stimulation experiments, test chambers were housed in sound attenuating chambers (ENV-022M). Two nose poke ports (ENV-313-M) were placed on the left wall of the chamber and the reward receptacle (ENV-303LPHD-RL3) was placed on the right wall. The receptacle cup spout was connected to a 5 mL syringe filled with Ensure loaded in a single speed syringe pump (PHM-100). Nose pokes and receptacle entries were detected by infrared beam breaks. The tone generator (ENV-230) and speaker (ENV-224BM) were placed outside the test chamber, but within the sound attenuating chamber, to the left. The house light (used for timeout, ENV-315M) was placed on top of the tone generator to avoid snagging patch cords. Each chamber had a fan (ENV-025F28) running throughout the session for ventilation and white noise. Behavior chambers were connected to a computer running MEDPC IV to collect event frequency and timestamps. For optical stimulation experiments, a hole drilled in the top of the sound attenuating chambers allowed the patch cord to pass through. Initial BLA ACh3.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E</xref>) and BLA CaMKIIα GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) fiber photometry recordings occurred in a darkened behavioral room outside of sound attenuating chambers due to steric constraints with rigid fiber photometry patch cords. Later behavioral chamber optimization (wall height was extended with 3D printed and laser cut acrylic panels to allow removing the test chamber lid while preventing escape) allowed all other fiber photometry cohorts to be tested inside sound attenuating chambers. For fiber photometry experiments, a custom receptacle was 3D printed that extended the cup beyond the chamber wall to allow mice to retrieve the reward with more rigid patch cords. Each mouse was pseudo-randomly assigned to behavioral chamber when multiple chambers were used, counterbalancing for groups across boxes.</p><p>Three weeks after surgery, initial operant familiarization consisted of one 35 min session of Free Reward to demonstrate the location of reward delivery; all other sessions were 30 min. During Free Reward, only the reward receptacle was accessible. After 5 min of habituation, Ensure (24 µL over 2 s) was delivered in the receptacle cup and a light was turned on above the receptacle. The receptacle light was turned off upon receptacle entry. The next phase of operant familiarization, mice learned to nose poke to receive reward on a fixed-ratio one (FR1) schedule of reinforcement. Mice in experiments involving manipulations (optical stimulation and antagonist studies) were pseudo-randomly assigned to left or right active (reinforced) nose poke port. Mice in fiber photometry experiments were all assigned to right active port to minimize potential across subject variability. The inactive (unreinforced) port served as a locomotor control. During FR1 operant familiarization, each nose poke response into the active port resulted in receptacle light and reward delivery. After the mice reached criterion on FR1 operant familiarization (group average of 30 rewards for 2 consecutive days, usually 4–5 d), mice were advanced to the Pre-Training phase. This phase incorporated an auditory tone (2.5–5 kHz, ~60 dB) that lasted for at most 10 s and signaled when active nose pokes would be rewarded. Only active nose pokes made during the 10 s auditory tone (correct nose pokes) resulted in reward and receptacle light delivery. The tone co-terminated with Ensure delivery. During Pre-Training, there was no consequence for improper nose pokes, neither in the active port outside the tone (incorrect nose pokes) nor in the inactive port (inactive nose pokes). The number of inactive nose pokes were typically very low after operant familiarization and were not included in analysis. After reward retrieval (receptacle entry following reward delivery) the receptacle light was turned off and the tone was presented again on a variable intertrial interval schedule with an average interval of 30 s (VI 30), ranging from 10 to 50 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambroggi et al., 2008</xref>). After 4–5 d of Pre-Training, mice progressed to the Training phase, which had the same contingency as Pre-Training except incorrect nose pokes resulted in a 5 s timeout signaled by house light illumination, followed by a restarting of the previous intertrial interval. Mice were considered to have acquired the task after earning 20 rewards during the Training phase of the task. In order to promote task acquisition, mice that were not increasing number of rewards earned reliably were moved to a VI 20 schedule after 9 d of VI 30 Training for BLA ACh3.0 or 6–7 d for BLA CaMKIIα cell mice. The VI 20 schedule was only needed for the two groups that were trained outside of the sound attenuating chambers. Mice progressed to Extinction after 12 d of Training or, in the case of fiber photometry cohorts, once all mice met the acquisition criteria. Extinction was identical to Training except no Ensure was delivered in response to correct nose pokes. The replicate cohorts of the BLA CaMKIIα GCaMP6s and NBM-BLA terminal fiber recording experiments were advanced to 1 d of Extinction after only 7 d of Training due to the COVID-19 shutdown.</p><p>Between mice, excrement was removed from the chambers with a paper towel. At the end of the day chambers were cleaned with Rescue Disinfectant (Virox Animal Health, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) and Ensure syringe lines were flushed with water then air. Mice were excluded from analyses if a behavioral chamber malfunctioned (e.g. syringe pump failed) or they received the improper compound. Fiber photometry mice were excluded from analyses if they did not meet the acquisition criterion by the last day of Training.

The laser was connected to a fiber optic rotary joint (Doric Lenses) via a mono fiber optic patch cord (200 µm core, 220 µm cladding, 0.53 NA, FC connectors; Doric Lenses). The rotary joint was suspended above the sound attenuating chamber with a connected branching fiber optic patch cord (200 µm core, 220 µm cladding, 0.53 NA, FC connector with metal ferrule; Doric Lenses) fed into the behavioral box. Laser power was adjusted to yield 10–12 mW of power at each fiber tip. The stimulation pattern was 25 ms pulses at 20 Hz for 2 s modified from parameters in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>. Jiang et al. used a 20 Hz pulse frequency, 5 ms pulses, and 10–12 mW power at the fiber tips. In this study, we used a 2 s stimulation duration because it matched the time of syringe pump activation for reward delivery and co-terminated with the pump and auditory tone. A 25 ms pulse width was used because our lasers were not able to generate sufficient power with 5 ms pulses. Optical stimulation was only delivered during the Pre-Training and Training phases of the operant task. Both control (EYFP) and experimental (ChR2) groups received identical light delivery, and stimulation was triggered by a correct nose poke and co-terminated with the auditory tone and Ensure delivery. For the non-contingent experiment, the number of light stimulations was yoked to the concurrently running ChR2 mouse. The timing of the non-contingent stimulation was explicitly unpaired with correct nose pokes or tones and was held in queue until the mouse had not made a response in the last 2 s, a tone was not going to be delivered within the next 2 s, or at least 5 s had passed since the mouse entered the receptacle after earning reward.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fiber photometry</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Acquisition</title><p>Fluorescent measurements of ACh and calcium levels were recorded using two Doric Lenses 1-site Fiber Photometry Systems: a standard 405/465 nm system and a 405/470/560 nm system. The standard 405/465 system was configured as follows: the fiber photometry console controlled the two connectorized LEDs (CLEDs, 405 nm modulated at 208.616 Hz and 465 nm modulated at 572.205 Hz) through the LED module driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cassidy et al., 2019</xref>). Each CLED was connected via attenuating patch cord to the five-port Fluorescence MiniCube (FMC5_AE(405)_AF(420-450)_E1(460–490)_F1(500–550)_S). A pigtailed fiber optic rotary joint was connected to the MiniCube and suspended above the behavioral chamber with a rotary joint holder in order to deliver and receive light through the implanted optical fiber. The other end of the rotary joint was connected to the mono fiber optic patch cord via M3 connector and attached with a zirconia sleeve to the implanted fiber optic as above. The F1 (500–550 nm) port of the MiniCube was connected to the photoreceiver (AC low mode, New Focus 2151 Visible Femtowatt Photoreceiver, New Focus, San Jose, CA) via a fiber optic adapter (Doric Lenses) that was finally connected back to the fiber photometry console through an analog port. The 405/470/560 nm system was set up similarly, except a 560 nm LED was incorporated (modulated at 333.786 Hz), a six-port MiniCube with two integrated photodetector heads was used (iFMC6_IE(400-410)_E1(460–490)_F1(500–540)_E2(555–570)_F2(580–680)_S), and Doric Fluorescence Detector Amplifiers were used (AC 1× or 10× mode, DFD_FOA_FC). A TTL adapter (SG-231, Med Associates Inc) was connected to the digital input/output port to allow for timestamping when events occurred in the behavioral chamber. Signal was recorded using Doric Neuroscience Studio (V 5.3.3.14) via the Lock-In demodulation mode with a sampling rate of 12.0 kS/s. Data were decimated by a factor of 100 and saved as a comma-separated file.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Pre-processing</title><p>Pre-processing of raw data was performed using a modified version of a MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) script provided by Doric. The baseline fluorescence (F0) was calculated using a first-order least mean squares regression over the ~30 min recording session. Second-order least mean squares regressions were used when photobleaching of the sensor was more pronounced, as in the case of NBM-BLA terminal fiber recordings. The change in fluorescence for a given time point (ΔF) was calculated as the difference between it and F0, divided by F0, which was multiplied by 100 to yield %ΔF/F0. The %ΔF/F0 was calculated independently for both the signal (465 nm) and reference (405 nm) channels to assess the degree of movement artifact. Since little movement artifact was observed in the recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>, tan lines), the signal %ΔF/F0 was analyzed alone (the code provided allows for running the entire analysis pipeline with the reference channel %ΔF/F0 if desired). The %ΔF/F0 was z-scored to give the final Z%ΔF/F0 reported here. For the BLA CaMKIIα cell recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>), the reference channel displayed some mirroring (moving in the opposite direction) compared to the signal. This is likely because 405 nm is not the ‘true’ isosbestic point for GCaMP and we were instead measuring some changes in calcium-unbound GCaMP rather than calcium-insensitive GCaMP signal alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sych et al., 2019</xref>). Graphs and heatmaps for averaged traces aligned to actions were based on licking bout epoch filtering code from TDT (Alachua, FL; link in code comments).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Heatmaps</title><p>Combined action heatmaps were generated in MATLAB (2020a) by analyzing data 5 s preceding tone onset (rewarded trials only) to 5 s after receptacle entry. Actions were aligned despite variable latencies by evenly splitting a maximum of 4 s post-tone onset/pre-correct nose poke and 1 s post-correct nose poke/pre-receptacle entry for each trial within a day. The resulting aligned trials were averaged to generate daily averages that made up the rows of the individual animal heatmaps. Blanks in the rows of heatmaps (black time bins) indicate time bins added for alignment, meaning that no trials for that day had a latency that stretched the entire window. Only rewarded trials where the mouse entered the receptacle within 5 s after nose poke were analyzed. Full or partial training days were excluded from analysis if there were acquisition issues such as the patch cord losing contact with the fiber or behavioral apparatus malfunction. Lack of trials (fewer than three) for analysis or recording issues led to missing rows of fiber photometry data in the heatmap despite having behavioral data, in which case these rows were skipped rather than adding entire blank rows. Due to individual differences in behavior, across-mouse average data was calculated by using a selection of days in which behavior was roughly similar or milestones such as the first and last day of Pre-Training, first day earning 10 rewards in Training, first day crossing acquisition threshold (and maintaining afterward), last day of Training, last day of Extinction (with three or more rewarded trials that met analysis criteria). Additional days were included in across-mouse average heatmaps when possible. Incorrect nose poke heatmaps were generated by averaging signals for 5 s before and 5 s after incorrect nose pokes that were not preceded by an incorrect nose poke in the last 5 s. The incorrect nose poke heatmaps averaged across mice were generated using the same selection of days as the combined action heatmaps for a given experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Bootstrapped confidence interval analyses</title><p>Bootstrapped confidence intervals (bCIs) of the Z-scored % ΔF/F0 fiber photometry data within and across mice were generated using the methods described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2020</xref> for the following events: tone onset, correct nose poke, receptacle entry, and incorrect nose poke. For the within-mouse analysis by day, trials were aligned to event onset, and bCIs were generated for events that had at least 3 trials from 5 s before to 10 s after each event. Each series of data were bootstrapped 10,000 times and a two-sided 99% confidence interval was constructed. Data were considered significantly different from baseline (Z% ΔF/F0 = 0) when their 99% bCIs did not contain zero for an interval of time designated by a consecutive threshold of 0.5 s.</p><p>To avoid comparing vastly different numbers of trials, in graphs where correct and incorrect nose pokes were plotted together, incorrect nose pokes were downsampled to match the number of correct nose poke trials. For Incorrect Nose Pokes graphs where last Pre-Training Day and Training Day 1 were plotted together, both days were downsampled to the number of correct nose pokes on the last Pre-Training Day.</p><p>For the combined action bCI plots (tone onset, correct nose poke, and receptacle entry), the selection of days for each mouse matched that of the cohort-averaged combined action heatmaps. The three-event plots were combined by cropping to match the maximum latencies used in the combined action heatmaps. For the across-mouse averaged bCI plots, analyses were carried out as above except the bootstrapping used mouse trial averages. The mean lines for across-mouse averaged bCI plots were calculated by taking the mean of all individual trials together. The NBM-BLA cholinergic terminal fiber experiment required combining the two independent cohorts to obtain n ≥ 3. For the incorrect nose poke bCI plots, the number of trials used for each day was downsampled to 20 if a mouse performed more than 20.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Pharmacology</title><p>Male wild-type C57BL/6J mice were injected i.p. 30 min before each Pre-Training and Training session with a volume of 10 mL/kg with the following compounds: 1× DPBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 1 mg/kg mecamylamine hydrochloride (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 0.5 mg/kg (-) scopolamine hydrochloride (Millipore Sigma), or 1 mg/kg mecamylamine + 0.5 mg/kg scopolamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> + <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Histology</title><p>After completion of behavioral experiments, animals were anesthetized with 1× Fatal-Plus (Vortech Pharmaceuticals).

These mice had 5 dof Pre-Training because they were trained concurrently with another cohort of mice (not shown) that required an extra day to reach two consecutive days of 20 rewards earned and were advanced to a VI 20 schedule of reinforcement during Training after 9 d to promote responding. Training was extended to allow all mice to acquire. Due to time constraints during acquisition, Mouse 3 in this cohort was moved to Extinction after 20 d of Training because it had acquired earlier, was earning the most rewards, and we wanted to record more extinction days. (<bold>B</bold>) Mice in the BLA ACh3.0 and NBM-BLA terminal fiber replicate experiments were advanced to 1 d of Extinction after only 7 d of Training due to the COVID-19 shutdown. (<bold>C</bold>) BLA ACh3.0 and NBM-BLA terminal fiber jRCaMP1b mice were analyzed as dual channel mice just through Pre-Training and were instead used as replicates of the BLA ACh3.0 experiment. One of the mice had apparatus errors during Training and had to be excluded. (<bold>D</bold>) Mice in the initial BLA CaMKIIα GCaMP6 were trained outside of the sound attenuating chambers. Mouse 1 progressed from Pre-Training to Training a day earlier than the rest of the group and was able to have an extra day of Training before the 2 d of Extinction. Mice in this group were advanced to a VI 20 schedule of reinforcement during Training after 6–7 d to promote responding. Training was extended to allow more mice to acquire.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-57335-supp1-v3.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-57335-transrepform-v3.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

weeks from surgery. Animals were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (100 mg ketamine and 6 mg xylazine/kg body weight injected ip). Then the mice were transcardially perfused with a sucrose-based solution (see below). After decapitation, the brain was rapidly transferred into a sucrose-based cutting solution bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and maintained at ~3°C. This solution contained (in mM): sucrose 230; KCl 2.5; MgSO<sub>4</sub> 10; CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.25; NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 26; glucose 10 and pyruvate 1.5. Coronal brain slices (300 µm) were prepared using a Leica VT1000S vibratome (Leica Biosystems Inc). Slices were equilibrated with a mixture of oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and sucrose-based cutting solution at room temperature (24–26°C) for at least 1 hr before transfer to the recording chamber. Pyruvate (0.15–0.75 mM) was added to reduce oxidative damage and enhance survival.

The authors use a variety of powerful techniques to examine and manipulate ACh levels and neuronal activity in this brain region. The findings support the conclusion that ACh facilitates conditioning in a cue-driven nosepoke task through actions on a muscarinic receptor. The quality of the data are generally high, especially the fiber photometry data that exhibits little-to-no artifactual signal in most of the experiments. Important controls are included for the most crucial experiments. There are some important and real design strengths here. These include inclusion of data from a pretraining phase for each experiment (showing neatly that the ACh system is neither non-specifically recruited nor non-specifically contributing to general behaviours in this task), concurrent measurement of release via ACh3.0 and terminal activity via jRCaMP1b (showing strong temporal agreement between the measures), pharmacological identification of the critical receptor family, augmentation of learning in the task via ChR2 excitation, and inclusion of useful controls (non-contingent stimulation) that constrain interpretation. The manuscript is well-written with clear findings. Overall, the findings reported here are an important advance and are interesting for their knowledge gains about both ACh and amygdala function in a fundamentally important learning process. There are a few aspects of the study that require clarification, and additional analysis of existing data and other information should be included. No new experiments are required.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The first revision relates to the unpaired stimulation experiment. There are three points to address here:</p><p>– The duration of the ACh effect suggested by the explicitly unpaired stimulation procedure appears to be on the order or 10s of seconds. This is consistent with mAChR involvement as the authors suggest. It is possible that ACh release induced by optogenetic stimulation is longer-lasting than that induced by CS delivery. This possibility should be considered, and the authors might want to discuss the known durations of ACh modulatory actions. The possibility of co-release of another neurotransmitter or modulator with this optical stimulation should also be considered (Saunders et al., 2015). It may be that strong ACh release activates long-term synaptic plasticity independent of neural responses to CS or reward delivery, and the authors might also mention this possibility.</p><p>– How did the authors determine the pattern of light stimulation used in the optogenetic experiments? Were effects of this stimulation pattern examined in slices (Figure 4B only shows responses to lower frequency stimulation)? Please state the frequency and duration of ChR2 stimulation in the main text (subsection “Stimulation of cholinergic terminals in BLA improves cue-reward learning”, first paragraph).</p><p>– One of the surprising findings here was that yoked ChR2 stimulation was as effective in enhancing performance. This was surprising given how well timed the endogenous signals are in this task. This finding was not really explored in the Discussion and it appears to contradict interpretation at some key places in the Discussion (e.g., –subsection “Increasing BLA acetylcholine levels enhances cue-reward learning”). Also, the yoked stimulation paradigm may actually be something of a &quot;semi-yoking&quot; procedure in that stimulation was not time-locked to stimulation in the original training group. Have other authors used the term yoked for this exact type of procedure?</p><p>2) It is surprising that such a complicated conditioning paradigm (i.e. presentation of a time-out period after incorrect responses in addition to reward for correct responses) is required for learning to respond specifically to the reward-predicting CS. Perhaps this is related to the several days of shaping as this may reinforce a strategy of near-automatized nosepoking that is then harder to modify in subsequent conditioning phases. Was it necessary to shape mice for this long? Also, the task appears to use a Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) conditioning design. If this is the case, perhaps the authors should use that term to describe the paradigm at some point in the manuscript, as that is a generally-accepted term that will be instantly recognized by many readers.</p><p>Following the comment above, it isn't clear if all mice learned the task, both in the training period and at the end (i.e. were levels of nose poking greater for correct versus incorrect?). The separation of these data between main and supplementary figures, and the required use of different scales, makes it difficult for the reader to understand the comparative frequencies of the behaviours. The authors should indicate what proportion of mice met the criteria for learning and a clearer statement of the criteria for successful completion of each training phase should also be included in the Materials and methods.</p><p>3) There are a few points with the photometry data that need to be addressed.</p><p>– In the photometry experiments, the group sizes are relatively small (4) and on some important control experiments (cross talk between the sensors) only single subject data are shown, and this might be addressed in the manuscript. The absence of any quantitative analysis of photometry is a also potential issue, but may well be related to sample sizes. The authors do provide a thoughtful and careful descriptive, qualitative analysis of photometry data, but statistical analyses (either using trial or subjects) appear absent. For the reader, this is especially relevant when trying to understand the relevance of signals around the incorrect nosepoke. There are approaches (within-subject bootstrapped confidence intervals to ask if CI includes 0% df/f or permutation tests) that could be applied. Again, the most straightforward and transparent solution could be to explain this choice to readers.</p><p>– For the fiber photometry data, how were data handled if there was mirroring in the 405 channel? If the data in this channel do not reflect calcium changes, presumably the data in the other channels are most likely artifacts. Were these periods then eliminated from analysis as others have done?</p><p>– Figure 3—figure supplement 1C is the only instance where the 405 channel shows a noticeable change. Do the authors have any idea why the large decrease was observed in this experiment?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57335.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The first revision relates to the unpaired stimulation experiment.

We have added an explicit statement of this:</p><p>“It is also possible that optogenetic-mediated ACh release may last longer than endogenous, tone-evoked release. A simultaneous stimulation and recording approach would be required to compare ACh release under both conditions (Pisansky et al., 2019).”</p><p>We also added text to the Introduction that explicitly mentions the differing timescales of nAChR and mAChR action:</p><p>“The effect of ACh signaling can differ depending on the receptor, as metabotropic mAChRs work on a slower timescale than the rapid, ionotropic nAChRs (Gu and Yakel, 2011; Picciotto et al., 2012).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The possibility of co-release of another neurotransmitter or modulator with this optical stimulation should also be considered (Saunders et al., 2015).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that co-release of other neurotransmitters along with acetylcholine should be considered and unintentionally neglected to discuss this in the previous version of the manuscript. We have added the following text to the Discussion:</p><p>“It is important to note that basal forebrain neurons have been demonstrated to co-release ACh and GABA (Ma et al., 2018; Saunders et al., 2015), and cholinergic basal forebrain neurons that project to the BLA have been shown to co-express a glutamate transporter (Ma et al., 2018; Poulin et al., 2006).

We believe that the neural signals induced by CS or reward are likely necessary to induce firing of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, but once ACh is released, it likely influences the circuit for tens of seconds and induces plasticity that alters BLA responses on a much longer timescale. This is addressed in the Discussion:</p><p>“This suggests that the effect of increased cholinergic signaling in the BLA is long lasting, and that stimulation during a learning session is sufficient to potentiate synaptic events linking the cue to a salient outcome – even if CS and/or reward delivery are presented tens of seconds later.

To avoid confusion, we changed the name of the “Yoked” group to “Non-contingent ChR2” throughout the manuscript and modified the description of the group:</p><p>“…we repeated the experiment in an independent cohort of mice with an additional non-contingent ChR2 group that received the same number of stimulation trains as the contingent ChR2 group, but in which light stimulation was explicitly unpaired with task events (Figure 6A + Figure 6—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is surprising that such a complicated conditioning paradigm (i.e. presentation of a time-out period after incorrect responses in addition to reward for correct responses) is required for learning to respond specifically to the reward-predicting CS.

Was it necessary to shape mice for this long?</p></disp-quote><p>We were also surprised that a timeout period was required for mice to acquire the contingency. However, in our initial piloting for the behavioral paradigm, mice did not decrease incorrect nose poking after 7 days of Pre-Training, and only decreased incorrect nose poking after including the timeout period. We agree that this could be related to the several days of behavioral shaping before training. The one day of reward receptacle “Free Reward” and 4-5 days of nose poke “FR1 Shaping” were required to ensure all mice in a cohort earned at least 20 rewards for two consecutive days before advancing to Pre-Training. We preferred to advance all mice together after 4-5 days of shaping in order to avoid excluding mice from the experiment. This also ensured that each mouse underwent the same number of training sessions within and across experiments. This was not always possible, though, because in the initial BLA ACh3.0 and BLA CaMKIIα fiber photometry experiments we trained mice outside of the sound attenuating chambers (Figure 2A-E + Figure 3) and required one extra day of FR1 shaping to learn the task. We think it could be interesting to investigate if a timeout period is necessary to learn the cue-reward contingency if mice are advanced individually based on their behavior during shaping, however, for the purposes of these experiments, we chose to prioritize consistency in training across cohorts. (Note: in the revised manuscript we have removed the term “shaping” and changed it to “operant familiarization” to avoid confusion. See point below.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the task appears to use a Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) conditioning design. If this is the case, perhaps the authors should use that term to describe the paradigm at some point in the manuscript, as that is a generally-accepted term that will be instantly recognized by many readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern, but we believe there may be a misunderstanding here because of our use of the term “shaping”, which could be confused with the autoshaping commonly seen in PIT. However, the “shaping” performed here was simply familiarization with the operant chamber and the nosepoke response to encourage mice to learn to perform the operant task. To avoid confusion, we now refer to this phase as “operant familiarization”. Mice are not exposed to the auditory tone signaling that an active nose poke can be made to receive a reward until the “Pre-Training” phase of the task. More directly, the mice do not form a Pavlovian association between the tone and reward before being required to nose poke for reward (Cartoni et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Following the comment above, it isn't clear if all mice learned the task, both in the training period and at the end (i.e. were levels of nose poking greater for correct versus incorrect?).</p></disp-quote><p>All mice included in fiber photometry figures (Figures 1-3) acquired the task.

We did not include the rewards earned and incorrect nose pokes overlaid in the same graph because the far greater number of incorrect nose pokes during the “Pre-Training” period dwarfs the rewards earned and prevents the overlay from being useful. However, we provide the data used in the figures in a readily plottable format (Excel sheets in Dryad).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should indicate what proportion of mice met the criteria for learning and a clearer statement of the criteria for successful completion of each training phase should also be included in the Materials and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>In general, mice progressed from FR1 Nosepoke Training to Pre-Training after 30 rewards were earned by the group for at least two consecutive days (which was when the majority of mice in the group passed the individual threshold for acquisition of 20 rewards earned), typically 4 days. Mice progressed from Pre-Training typically after 4 days or when all mice had earned at least 20 rewards for two consecutive days, whichever came first. Task acquisition for individual animals was defined as earning 20 rewards during the Training phase of the task. Training lasted for 12 days when possible, but was extended for fiber photometry experiments carried outside of the sound attenuating chambers.</p><p>For the optogenetic stimulation and pharmacological antagonist studies, some groups included mice that never acquired the task by the end of Training. All of these mice underwent the standard 4 days of Pre-Training and 12 days of Training (as determined by initial task piloting). All mice shown in the fiber photometry figures acquired the task, but some mice in these cohorts did not acquire the task by the end of Training and were excluded from analyses We now include Supplementary file 1 to demonstrate more clearly the proportion of mice that met acquisition criteria, any excluded mice, and any deviations from the standard paradigm.</p><p>We have defined task acquisition and criteria more clearly for successful completion of each training phase in the Materials and methods section as follows:</p><p>“After the mice reached criterion on FR1 operant familiarization (group average of 30 rewards for 2 consecutive days, usually 4-5 days), mice were advanced to the Pre-Training phase.

The BLA ACh3.0 and BLA CaMKII<sup>+</sup> GCaMP6s replication cohorts cannot be easily combined with the original cohorts due to differences in the number of behavioral sessions performed, but importantly, the replication studies show comparable outcomes as the original experiments and now all groups have at least one cohort that was trained inside the sound attenuating chambers in the optimized behavioral setup. Since the original and NBM-BLA ChAT<sup>+</sup> terminal fiber GCaMP7s cohorts acquired at similar rates, they were combined to allow for cohort bootstrapping. The new BLA ACh3.0 cohort underwent the standard 4 days of Pre-Training, 12 days of Training, and 3 days of Extinction training, while the new NBM-BLA ChAT<sup>+</sup> terminal fiber GCaMP7s and BLA CaMKII<sup>+</sup> GCaMP6s cohorts ended Training prematurely at 7 days followed by 1 day of Extinction due to the COVID-19 shutdown. Data for all replication cohorts are shown in new supplementary figures, and mouse numbering is continued from original cohorts to avoid confusion.</p><p>The sensor cross talk control experiment was a proof of principle with only a single animal so we do not feel justified in drawing strong conclusions from the experiment. We did not refer to it in the Discussion, but wanted to include it as a supplementary figure, since it was a striking example of convergence that we consider as one of many control experiments. We have modified our description of the results from this one animal to further caution readers from drawing overly strong conclusions from the data as follows:</p><p>“While this was only a single animal and proof of principle for future studies, we found that NBM-BLA cholinergic terminal activity coincided with ACh levels (Figure 2—figure supplement 9F-G). Importantly, this relationship between ACh release and NBM-BLA terminal fiber activity was not explained by signal crosstalk (Figure 2—figure supplement 9H-I), further indicating that the BLA ACh measured comes at least in part from the NBM.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The absence of any quantitative analysis of photometry is a also potential issue, but may well be related to sample sizes.

For the reader, this is especially relevant when trying to understand the relevance of signals around the incorrect nosepoke. There are approaches (within-subject bootstrapped confidence intervals to ask if CI includes 0% df/f or permutation tests) that could be applied. Again, the most straightforward and transparent solution could be to explain this choice to readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We were hesitant to perform quantitative analyses because of the low sample sizes, as the reviewers inferred, and initially decided to limit ourselves to qualitative descriptions. We thank the reviewers for the suggestion of bootstrapped confidence intervals and have incorporated both within- and across- subject bootstrapped confidence intervals (bCI) to assist readers in interpreting our results (Jean-Richard-dit-Bressel et al., 2020). We have modified our line plots with FP data to incorporate significance bars to denote time bins when bCIs do not contain Z%ΔF/F0 = 0 for at least 0.5 sec. We have also included new bCI plots that show similar data to the tone-poke-reward retrieval heatmaps with indicators of significance. The same subset of days used for the across-mouse averaged data heatmaps was used for an example mouse (within mouse bCI) and averaged (when possible) bCI plots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For the fiber photometry data, how were data handled if there was mirroring in the 405 channel? If the data in this channel do not reflect calcium changes, presumably the data in the other channels are most likely artifacts. Were these periods then eliminated from analysis as others have done?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe gross systematic artefacts or instances when the 405 channel mirrored the 465 channel’s transients. In order to minimize the processing of our data we opted to run the analyses for the reference and signal channels separately instead of using a “reference-corrected” ΔF/F0. In addition to the non-Z-scored % ΔF/F0 comparison of reference and signal channels for correct and incorrect nose pokes, we ran the entire analysis pipeline for the reference channels for each experiment and did not see anywhere near the same magnitude of signal. For the case of the BLA CaMKIIα GCaMP6s signal, mirroring was observed due to a known phenomenon as the sensor binds to calcium (see response to the point below). We did not include a duplication of all graphs to avoid doubling the number of figures, but our Dryad upload includes an option for readers to easily rerun the entire analyses for the reference channel and compare the outputs themselves. We include one example comparison as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><p>In addition, to avoid confusion, we now explicitly define mirroring in the Materials and methods section to refer only to the situation when the reference channel moves in the opposite direction to the signal channel (see Point below).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57335-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3—figure supplement 1C is the only instance where the 405 channel shows a noticeable change. Do the authors have any idea why the large decrease was observed in this experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on published studies (see citations below), we believe that the mirroring in the 405 channel observed in the BLA CaMKIIα GCaMP experiment is due to a decrease in calcium-unbound GCaMP (as calcium-bound GCaMP increases). This is due to a reference LED that is not at the “true” isosbestic point for GCaMP. We have explained this more clearly:</p><p>“For the BLA CaMKIIα cell recordings (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-D), the reference channel displayed some mirroring (moving in the opposite direction) compared to the signal. This is likely because 405 nm is not the “true” isosbestic point for GCaMP and we were instead measuring some changes in calcium-unbound GCaMP rather than calcium-insensitive GCaMP signal alone (Barnett et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2016; Sych et al., 2019).”</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Cartoni, E., Balleine, B., &amp; Baldassarre, G.
