Understanding helicase mechanism requires that the basic physicochemical process of base pair separation be understood. This necessitates monitoring helicase activity directly, at high spatio-temporal resolution. Using optical tweezers with single base pair (bp) resolution, we analyzed DNA unwinding by XPD helicase, a Superfamily 2 (SF2) DNA helicase involved in DNA repair and transcription initiation. We show that monomeric XPD unwinds duplex DNA in 1-bp steps, yet exhibits frequent backsteps and undergoes conformational transitions manifested in 5-bp backward and forward steps. Quantifying the sequence dependence of XPD stepping dynamics with near base pair resolution, we provide the strongest and most direct evidence thus far that forward, single-base pair stepping of a helicase utilizes the spontaneous opening of the duplex. The proposed unwinding mechanism may be a universal feature of DNA helicases that move along DNA phosphodiester backbones.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00334.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00334.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00334.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>During many cellular processes, the double helix must be transiently unwound so that the enzymes responsible for maintaining the genome can access the two strands. During DNA synthesis, for instance, the two strands of DNA are first separated and then used as templates for the production of new strands. The role of destabilizing, separating and unwinding the double helix falls to enzymes known as DNA helicases.</p><p>Helicases are also involved in separating strands of nucleic acids during myriad other cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription and translation. While the functions of helicases are clear, the precise mechanisms by which they unwind DNA are not.</p><p>Here, Qi et al. have investigated the mechanism of a helicase called XPD, which is involved in DNA repair and the initiation of transcription of DNA into RNA. Using optical tweezers—in which a laser beam is used to exert extremely small forces on a single DNA molecule—they followed the activity of individual molecules of XPD as they unwound DNA with base pair resolution.</p><p>Qi et al. observed that the helicase unwinds DNA strands 1 base pair at a time, but that it sometimes moves backwards by 1 base pair and at other times makes 5 base pair backward and forward steps. The frequency of these backwards steps depends on the availability of ATP, and the sequence of the DNA. Due to the high resolution of the data, Qi et al. were able to correlate these stepping dynamics with the DNA sequence with base pair level accuracy. While some helicases actively separate the strands, using energy derived from ATP to break the hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases, Qi et al. showed that XPD appears to take advantage of momentary separations that arise spontaneously between base pairs.</p><p>As well as providing insights into the role of XPD in DNA repair and transcription, the work of Qi et al. presents a method that could be used to explore the mechanisms of other helicases. Given that the unwinding mechanism described here is likely to be a universal feature of enzymes related to XPD, the current work could shed light on a number of other cellular processes involving XPD-like helicases, such as homologous DNA recombination, inter-strand cross-link repair, and accurate chromosome segregation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00334.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00334.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd>Xeroderma pigmentosum group D helicase</kwd><kwd>molecular motor</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>optical tweezer</kwd><kwd>single molecule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB 09-52442</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chemla</surname><given-names>Yann R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 RR025341 A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chemla</surname><given-names>Yann R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spies</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Burroughs-Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chemla</surname><given-names>Yann R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ability of an enzyme called XPD helicase to unwind the double helix is influenced by the DNA sequence and the availability of energy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Helicases are vectorial enzymes that utilize ATP hydrolysis to translocate along single-stranded nucleic acids (NA) and separate the base pairs (bp) of the duplex. The two largest helicase superfamilies, SF1 and SF2, contain a conserved motor core comprised of a nucleotide binding site in the cleft between two RecA-like domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fairman-Williams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Raney et al., 2013</xref>).

Despite these findings, the mechanism of base pair separation has remained elusive. Ensemble and single-molecule kinetic studies of RecBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bianco and Kowalczykowski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lucius et al., 2004</xref>) and NS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dumont et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Myong et al., 2007</xref>) have reported unwinding in steps nested within larger steps. A more recent single-molecule study of NS3 helicase confirmed a single-base pair unwinding step size but also reported 1/2-bp steps, which were attributed to asynchronous release of the unwound NA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). Unwinding mechanisms where the helicase unwinds duplex as a monomeric inchworm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Velankar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>) or requires helicase oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lohman et al., 2008</xref>) have been proposed. Lastly, the mechanism of base pair separation—whether achieved by helicase destabilizing base pairs directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>) or by rectifying thermal breathing of the duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lionnet et al., 2007</xref>)—remains disputed. Previous studies investigating this question by varying NA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manosas et al., 2010</xref>) have been limited, as assumptions on helicase step size, slippage, and backstepping have prevented definitive statements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manosas et al., 2010</xref>). These studies have lacked the resolution to assess stepping dynamics directly. Distinguishing between mechanisms requires interrogating helicase activity at the single-protein level, and with high spatio-temporal resolution.</p><p>Here, we applied high-resolution dual-trap optical tweezers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbondanzieri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moffitt et al., 2009</xref>) to determine the mechanism underlying activity of XPD helicase from <italic>Ferroplasma acidarmanus.</italic> This approach allowed us to monitor individual XPD molecules acting on a dsDNA hairpin with base pair resolution. XPD is a prototypical 5′–3′ translocating SF2 helicase (SF2B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wolski et al., 2010</xref>). It consists of four structural domains: helicase domains 1 and 2 (HD1 and HD2), which contain all helicase signature motifs important for coupling ATP binding and hydrolysis to directional translocation along ssDNA, and two unique modular domains (ARCH and FeS) inserted in the conserved motor core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wolski et al., 2008</xref>). All known SF2B enzymes participate in DNA repair or support replication and, therefore, are important for maintenance of genomic integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">White, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). Human XPD is a player in nucleotide excision repair and transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Egly and Coin, 2011</xref>). Related FeS-containing helicases FANCJ, RTEL and CHLR1 share structural organization and likely the same unwinding mechanism as XPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gupta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">White and Dillingham, 2012</xref>). The features of the DNA unwinding mechanism determined for XPD may thus be broadly relevant to SF2 helicases, which all make contacts with the phosphodiester backbone of nucleic acids.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00334.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Unwinding activity of individual XPD helicase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of XPD helicase with DNA.

We further established that XPD is an inefficient helicase with low processivity that displays repetitive attempts at unwinding duplex DNA. In contrast to other helicases, backstepping plays a prominent role in XPD helicase mechanism. XPD exhibited frequent single-base pair backsteps, which depended on ATP concentration and DNA sequence, and larger backstepping events that likely corresponded to conformational rearrangements of the protein–DNA complex. Our high resolution assay allowed us, for the first time, to correlate with near base pair registration the effect of DNA sequence on XPD’s stepping dynamics. We show that XPD unwinding relies strongly on spontaneous opening of the base pairs ahead, and that this alone accounts for the observed low processivity. Based on our measured kinetic parameters we propose a mechanism for XPD unwinding and speculate on its applicability to other biomedically important SF2 helicases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single XPD helicase exhibits repetitive, non-processive unwinding bursts</title><p>We monitored XPD-mediated unwinding of an 89-bp hairpin containing a random DNA sequence (see ‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

While unwinding was gradual, re-annealing occurred in large (−6.3 ± 1.6 bp, mean ± SD; N = 144 bursts) and sudden backward jumps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, inset). The re-annealing rate was high (&gt;100 bp/s; N = 144 bursts), much faster than the translocation speed of 13 ± 2 nt/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Honda et al., 2009</xref>) and ATP independent, inconsistent with helicase translocation on the opposite strand, as observed in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dessinges et al., 2004</xref>). These observations suggest a mechanism of repetitive unwinding in which XPD can backslide by several base pairs without dissociating from its DNA substrate. Structures and biochemical studies suggest that the ARCH domain of XPD can encircle the translocating DNA strand during unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wolski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuper and Kisker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pugh et al., 2012</xref>), providing a potential structural basis for backsliding without dissociation (see ‘Discussion’). Although XPD’s behavior is reminiscent of the ‘repetitive shuttling’ previously reported for the SF1 helicase Rep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Myong et al., 2005</xref>), some key differences distinguish the two. First, Rep helicase shuttling was detected during translocation on ssDNA, not duplex unwinding. Second, shuttling in Rep is mediated by formation of a transient DNA loop that allows rapid ‘snapback’ to its initial position on DNA. Our data disfavors such a mechanism, as the re-annealing usually occurred in multiple jumps, rather than a single snapback. Furthermore, formation of a ∼12-bp loop is unlikely at the applied tension. As discussed below, our analysis of stepping kinetics further disfavor a looping mechanism in XPD. After several unwinding bursts and backslides (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), activity suddenly ceased, indicating protein dissociation. In none of our measurements (N = 363 traces) did activity return once a dissociation event was observed. The second notable feature is the low processivity of XPD helicase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Although the full hairpin measured 89 bp, on average only 12 ± 3 bp (mean ± SD; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) were unwound during each burst.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00334.007</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Summary of experimental data<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">*</xref></p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00334.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00334.007</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Sequence</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>ATP [µM]</td><td>6.25</td><td>12.5</td><td>25</td><td>50</td><td>250</td><td>500</td><td>12.5</td></tr><tr><td>No. of traces</td><td>5</td><td>50</td><td>31</td><td>13</td><td>12</td><td>40</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Total No. of bursts</td><td>13</td><td>118</td><td>82</td><td>40</td><td>41</td><td>144</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Burst / trace</td><td>2.0 ± 0.4</td><td>2.0 ± 0.3</td><td>2.6 ± 0.3</td><td>3.1 ± 0.4</td><td>3.7 ± 0.6</td><td>3.6 ± 0.5</td><td>4.7 ± 0.9</td></tr><tr><td>Mean processivity (bp)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2">†</xref></td><td>11 ± 2</td><td>11 ± 2</td><td>12 ± 3</td><td>13 ± 2</td><td>12 ± 3</td><td>12 ± 3</td><td>21 ± 6</td></tr><tr><td>No. of bursts for PWD (%)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn3">‡</xref></td><td>8 (61.5)</td><td>58 (49.2)</td><td>36 (43.9)</td><td>11 (27.5)</td><td>4 (9.8)</td><td>48 (33.3)</td><td>12(42.9)</td></tr><tr><td>No. of bursts for stepfitting<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn4">§</xref></td><td>11</td><td>64</td><td>70</td><td>17</td><td>16</td><td>126</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Total No. of steps</td><td>186</td><td>827</td><td>1022</td><td>179</td><td>207</td><td>1612</td><td>559</td></tr><tr><td>Non-fitting points (%)</td><td>4.7</td><td>3.1</td><td>5.7</td><td>4.0</td><td>6.3</td><td>6.2</td><td>5.2</td></tr><tr><td>No. of 1-bp steps<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn5">#</xref></td><td>115</td><td>522</td><td>646</td><td>94</td><td>101</td><td>845</td><td>332</td></tr><tr><td>Dwell time (ms)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn6">¶</xref></td><td>370 ± 35</td><td>274 ± 12</td><td>212 ± 8</td><td>201 ± 21</td><td>183 ± 18</td><td>178 ± 6</td><td>281 ± 14</td></tr><tr><td>Step size (bp)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn7">**</xref></td><td>1.1 ± 0.4</td><td>1.1 ± 0.5</td><td>1.1 ± 0.5</td><td>0.8 ± 0.2</td><td>1.1 ± 0.5</td><td>1.0 ± 0.4</td><td>0.9 ± 0.3</td></tr><tr><td>No. of +1/+1 bp step pairs<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn5">#</xref></td><td>54</td><td>271</td><td>351</td><td>62</td><td>69</td><td>643</td><td>169</td></tr><tr><td>No. of +1/−1 bp step pairs<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn5">#</xref></td><td>23</td><td>104</td><td>129</td><td>13</td><td>11</td><td>88</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>No. of −1/+1 bp step pairs<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn5">#</xref></td><td>26</td><td>99</td><td>117</td><td>7</td><td>15</td><td>87</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>No. of −1/−1 bp step pairs<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn5">#</xref></td><td>12</td><td>48</td><td>49</td><td>12</td><td>6</td><td>27</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>No. of large steps<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn5">#</xref></td><td>17</td><td>72</td><td>70</td><td>22</td><td>23</td><td>155</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Dwell time (ms)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn6">¶</xref></td><td>158 ± 38</td><td>150 ± 18</td><td>149 ± 18</td><td>162 ± 34</td><td>139 ± 29</td><td>127 ± 10</td><td>132 ± 29</td></tr><tr><td>Backstep size (bp)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn7">**</xref></td><td>−4.5 ± 0.8</td><td>−4.6 ± 1.1</td><td>−4.5 ± 0.7</td><td>−4.7 ± 0.8</td><td>−5.0 ± 1.0</td><td>−4.6 ± 0.9</td><td>−3.8 ± 0.6</td></tr><tr><td>Forward step size (bp)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn7">**</xref></td><td>4.0 ± 1.0</td><td>4.3 ± 0.9</td><td>4.5 ± 0.9</td><td>4.7 ± 1.1</td><td>4.5 ± 0.8</td><td>4.4 ± 0.9</td><td>3.6 ± 0.4</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><label>*</label><p>All data from hairpin “sequence 1” containing a 10-nt helicase binding site (see ‘Materials and methods’) at a 12 pN force.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn2"><label>†</label><p>Errors are SEM except where otherwise noted.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn3"><label>‡</label><p>Processivity is defined as the maximum number of base pairs unwound (mean ± SD).</p></fn><fn id="tblfn4"><label>§</label><p>A selection of bursts with low noise properties was used for PWD and step-fitting analysis (see ‘Materials and methods’).</p></fn><fn id="tblfn5"><label>#</label><p>Steps with size 0 ≤ d ≤ 2 were scored as +1-bp steps;

No unwinding activity was detected on the constructs containing a ssDNA binding site smaller than the expected XPD footprint (0-dT and 3-dT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), indicating that XPD helicase could not initiate unwinding of these substrates. In contrast, unwinding activity was readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>) when the binding sites were ≥10 nt. Interestingly, we observed two types of unwinding behaviors for long binding sites: a ‘low-processivity’ activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1D and 2C</xref>), in which ∼12 bp were unwound repetitively; and a ‘processive’ activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), in which the 89-bp hairpin was completely unwound. The latter was observed only with constructs containing binding sites &gt;10 nt that were expected to accommodate two or more XPD monomers (19-dT and 38-dT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This result suggests that individual motors can unwind ∼12 bp while multiple motors may cooperate to increase unwinding processivity or generate forces sufficient for overcoming difficult sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eoff and Raney, 2010</xref>). Traces were occasionally seen to revert from processive to low-processivity activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), potentially indicating dissociation of one of the cooperating XPD molecules while leaving the other engaged.

Provided the XPD concentration was low (≤1.8 nM, green line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), most of the activity observed was low-processivity, similar to that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. For XPD concentrations ≥6 nM, only processive activity could be detected (red line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), consistent with our interpretation that this activity resulted from multiple proteins. Control measurements performed in the absence of ATP showed no activity (navy line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

As shown in example traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, XPD unwound DNA in discrete steps but did not appear to step exclusively along one direction. Based on a pairwise distribution (PWD) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbondanzieri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dumont et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moffitt et al., 2009</xref>), we determined an elemental step size of 1 bp across all ATP concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Unwinding activity was also measured on two alternate hairpin sequences and across a range of tensions (see ‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). PWD analysis of these unwinding data revealed the same 1-bp step size throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that our determination of the step size is robust, independent of sequence or tension. In addition to the PWD analysis, we also applied a step-fitting algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kerssemakers et al., 2006</xref>) to fit the unwinding traces (red lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The histogram of step sizes from this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) corroborates the 1-bp elemental step size across the range of ATP concentrations assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Inspection of individual traces reveals that not all steps measured an exact integer number of base pairs. These events, which we attribute to measurement noise, are responsible for the width of the peaks in the PWD and in the step size histogram, but were not significant enough to disrupt the 1-bp pattern. In particular, our analyses provide little evidence for a statistically significant 0.5-bp step size, as recently reported for NS3 helicase and interpreted as a manifestation of transient DNA looping in that system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00334.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>XPD stepping behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative traces of XPD unwinding at 500, 250, 25, 12.5, and 6.25 μM ATP (black, light green, cyan, purple, and brown respectively; data filtered and decimated to 100 Hz ([ATP] = 500, 250 μM) and 50 Hz (25, 12.5, 6.25 μM).

Our step-fitting algorithm reveals that the majority of backsteps measure 1 bp while the less common large backsteps span −4.6 ± 0.9 bp (mean ± SD). In both cases the step sizes were independent of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Both types of events are distinct from the backsliding described above. Single-base pair backsteps have so far only been observed in high-resolution optical trap measurements of NS3 helicase, and appear rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, backsteps are very frequent for XPD. Moreover, the large 5-bp steps backward and forward exhibited by XPD appear to be a new feature of helicase stepping mechanics that, to our knowledge, has not been reported before.</p><p>To capture the complexity of observed backstepping behavior, we analyzed steps in pairs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> shows a scatter plot of the step sizes for all adjacent pairs of steps detected at 12.5 μM ATP and 12 pN. The different types of stepping behavior are evident. Red data points represent consecutive 1-bp forward steps, orange points depict step pairs with one or two 1-bp backsteps, and green points depict pairs with a large 5-bp backward or forward step. (We also observed a small fraction of 2-bp steps, which we attributed to closely spaced 1-bp steps missed by the step-finding algorithm.) Nearly all step pairs plotted corresponded to combinations of forward and backward 1-bp and ∼5-bp steps; the small fraction (∼5%, across all ATP concentrations, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) of events that did not fit categorization are represented by the gray points. We performed this analysis across the range of ATP concentrations assayed and determined the probability, <italic>p</italic><sub>−</sub>, of a 1-bp backstep relative to all 1-bp steps. <italic>p</italic><sub>−</sub> varied inversely with ATP, but importantly remained significant (∼15%) at saturating ATP concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We found that probabilities for pairs of adjacent 1-bp steps were simply products of individual probabilities (i.e., the probability for two consecutive backsteps was <italic>p</italic><sub>−</sub><sup>2</sup>), indicating that the direction of each 1-bp step was independent of the preceding step. In contrast, the large 5-bp steps displayed a strong correlation to past behavior; 5-bp backsteps were almost always followed by equal-size forward steps (−4.6 vs 4.4 ± 0.9 bp, mean ± SD; [ATP] = 500 μM and <italic>F</italic> = 12 pN; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This feature distinguishes the 5-bp backsteps from the backsliding events described above, as the latter were always followed by a 1-bp step. The pairing of 5-bp backsteps with 5-bp forward steps suggests that XPD kept track of its position along the hairpin after the initial backstep. The probability for 5-bp backsteps <italic>p</italic><sub>−5</sub> was low (5–10%) and depended weakly on ATP. Measurements across a range of tensions on alternate hairpin sequences revealed that the frequency of 5-bp steps depends inversely on force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; dependence on sequence is discussed further below). In addition to probabilities, we also determined the dwell times between steps. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, the dwell times <italic>τ</italic> between all 1-bp steps (forward or backward) exhibited Michaelis-Menten-like behavior. In contrast, dwell times between 5-bp backsteps and subsequent large forward steps were independent of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Distributions of those dwell times were exponential, indicating a single rate-limiting kinetic step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Stepping kinetics are highly sequence-dependent</title><p>To understand the mechanism underlying forward- and backstepping by XPD, we next investigated the role of DNA hairpin sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

In contrast to 3′–5′ SF1A helicases, which must remain in register with DNA because its bases are intercalated between aromatic residues of the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Velankar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee and Yang, 2006</xref>), SF1B and all SF2 helicases and related dsDNA translocases interact with the phosphodiester backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fairman-Williams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Raney et al., 2013</xref>). Such interaction may allow for a non-unitary step size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moffitt et al., 2009</xref>). Our high-resolution measurements of XPD steps establish unequivocally that this SF2B helicase unwinds DNA in uniform 1-bp steps, yet is an inefficient helicase. Unwinding is mitigated by frequent backsteps and duplex re-annealing. Although 1-bp backsteps are more frequent as ATP is decreased, the backstepping probability remains non-zero at saturating ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This indicates that 1-bp backsteps occur mainly when the helicase waits for the next ATP to bind, but also occasionally while in the ATP-bound state. Single-bp backsteps likely represent helicase slippage where XPD remains partially engaged with the ssDNA. (We distinguish this behavior from ‘backslides’ [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, inset], in which XPD moves backwards rapidly by many base pairs in one step, and which probably represent a more serious disengagement from the ssDNA.) The nature of the interaction between the motor core of XPD and DNA backbone is likely responsible for backstepping. This would be in a stark contrast with SF1A helicases, whose movement requires shifting in 1 nt register due to interaction with the bases. These essential features in the observed stepping dynamics are captured in the minimal kinetic model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00334.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of XPD unwinding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Minimal kinetic scheme for XPD stepping and backstepping.

From the structural overlap between this XPD structure and that of a related SF2 helicase (Vasa DEAD-box RNA helicase bound to ssRNA, PDB 2db3), one can extend the ssDNA into HD2 up to its interface with HD1 (green) by an additional 5 nt (plus 1 nt between the two ssDNA fragments). The ssDNA is expected to lie along the top surface of HD1 through the opening under the ARCH. There is a space for additional 3–5 nt, for a total of ∼10 nt bound to the motor core, longer than expected from known SF2 structures. A secondary binding site on the back can accommodate ∼5 nt between the aperture of the hole and the wedge structure that splits the duplex.

Based on structural data, we propose that these events represent rearrangements of the translocating DNA strand relative to a secondary binding site. Whereas typical SF2 helicases contain a bipartite nucleic acid binding site that accommodates up to 8 nt (or bp) of nucleic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fairman-Williams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beyer et al., 2013</xref>), XPD and related 5′–3′, FeS-containing helicases feature additional contacts with the translocating strand beyond this canonical binding site. Biochemical and structural analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuper and Kisker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pugh et al., 2012</xref>) indicate that the translocating strand passes from the canonical binding site through the opening formed by the two auxiliary domains (ARCH and FeS) and is guided by the residues of HD1 and FeS domains, forming a secondary DNA binding site to the wedge structure on the back of the FeS domain that splits the duplex. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, this site accommodates ∼5 nt. We propose that the observed 5-bp backsteps occur when the translocating strand dissociates from this secondary binding site, allowing the 5 nt normally occluded to re-anneal with the complementary strand. This renders the helicase incompetent for unwinding until the point of duplex separation reengages the wedge structure, necessitating reopening of the 5 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pugh et al., 2012</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that 5-bp backsteps are always followed by equal-size forward steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The observed force dependence of these events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) may indicate that higher substrate tensions prevent the displaced strand from binding to the secondary site, stabilizing the translocating strand’s interaction with this site. The 5-bp backstepping dynamics are included in the kinetic model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>.</p><p>The fact that 5-bp backsteps were observed on a variety of sequences, including homo-AT templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, purple curve) disfavors an alternate mechanism in which the backsteps represent transient formation of a short hairpin on either strand. Other alternatives for 5-bp steps such as a spring-loaded mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Appleby et al., 2011</xref>) are also implausible. Such a mechanism would require several hidden kinetic steps to occur per observed 5-bp step (i.e., ‘loading of the spring’), resulting in a non-exponential dwell time distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Myong et al., 2005</xref>), inconsistent with our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). While we cannot rule out all alternative models and ternary complex structures will be required for further validation, the proposed mechanism provides the most reasonable explanation of our observations. The 5-bp back and forward steps illustrate the importance of the secondary binding site in controlling XPD helicase activity: it separates the motor core from the wedge structure that splits the duplex. Unwinding occurs only when the translocating strand resides within this secondary DNA binding site. This not only allows control of 5′–3′ translocation and force generation by XPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pugh et al., 2012</xref>), but also stalls the helicase at bulky UV-induced damage, thereby triggering nucleotide excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathieu et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2013</xref>).</p><p>The backstepping behavior of XPD is highly sequence-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref>). Confronted with stable sequences (i.e., when <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>open</italic></sub> is small), the helicase exhibits a higher frequency of backsteps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This occurs primarily because the rate of stepping forward <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> is suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The linear dependence of <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> on <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>open</italic></sub> at saturating ATP suggests a ‘passive’ unwinding mechanism in which the helicase captures spontaneously opened base pairs at the ssDNA/dsDNA junction. However, a strictly passive model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betterton and Jülicher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delagoutte and von Hippel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manosas et al., 2010</xref>) requires that the rate be strictly proportional to <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>open</italic></sub>, whereas the observed linear trend exhibits an offset. This feature is indicative of an intrinsic destabilization of the duplex by the helicase, characteristic of an ‘active’ mechanism (see ‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>Based on the minimal kinetic scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, we fitted the kinetic data globally (dashed lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’). To model quantitatively the dependence of the stepping rates on <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>open</italic></sub> and any destabilizing interaction, we used the theoretical approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betterton and Jülicher (2005)</xref>. A global fit to the minimal kinetic scheme incorporating sequence dependence (solid lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–I</xref>) suggests ‘partially’ active unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The fork is destabilized by 1.9 <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic> through interaction with the protein, yet still slows the XPD’s progress. (In contrast, an alternative ‘strictly passive’ unwinding model does not yield as good a fit to the data; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The parameters of the best global fit are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. We highlight the fact that the fit yields a translocation rate <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>trans</italic></sub> ≈ 10 nt/s (obtained in the limit that <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>open</italic></sub> = 1), in excellent agreement with that determined from independent measurements of XPD translocation on ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Honda et al., 2009</xref>).

(Additional parameters in the model would be required to incorporate XPD backsliding and dissociation observed at the end of the unwinding bursts [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>]. Therefore, these simulations as currently constructed only reproduce a single unwinding burst).</p><p>The origin of the low processivity of XPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) is the sequence dependence. When <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> are equal, the average unwinding rate is zero. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>, this condition occurs when <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>open</italic></sub> ≈ 0.1, which matches the value of <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>open</italic></sub> at the hairpin position beyond which most helicases stall, for the three hairpin sequences assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Based on this argument, one would predict the processivity to decrease at lower tensions, as the equilibrium is shifted toward the closed hairpin conformation and <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>open</italic></sub> is decreased. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>, not only is this decrease observed but <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>open</italic></sub> ≈ 0.1 predicts the stall position to within 1 bp.</p><p>The biological function of this inefficient unwinding likely reflects the cellular role of XPD helicase, which requires unwinding of short duplex regions. The sequence-dependence of XPD’s unwinding activity we report here makes XPD suitable for its function in NER and transcription. Having a highly processive and vigorous helicase uncoupled from its respective macromolecular machinery (such as TFIIH complex in the case of XPD) would be undesirable for the cell. Protein partners may play an important role in facilitating and regulating XPD helicase unwinding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pugh et al., 2008b</xref>), akin to our use of tension in assisting the protein. The conserved domain architecture of all SF2B helicases (including human FANCJ, RTEL and CHLR1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">White, 2009</xref>) predicts that these helicases will share a common unwinding mechanism with XPD, despite a broad range of cellular functions. We thus speculate that distinct protein partners play a role in defining helicase role. It is known that XPD has functions outside of the TFIIH complex; by associating with different partners, XPD can play a role in chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito et al., 2010</xref>) and in the cell’s defense against retroviral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yoder et al., 2006</xref>). These molecular associations may target the SF2B helicase to a DNA structure requiring it activity and activate the SF2B helicase either for DNA unwinding or for remodeling of nucleoprotein complexes. The basic mechanistic features underlying duplex unwinding by these helicases are likely to be conserved for all SF2B enzymes and need to be understood before studies of the effect of partner proteins can be carried out. We anticipate that our high-resolution assay may help decipher the mechanisms and regulation of these helicases in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Optical tweezers</title><p>High-resolution dual-trap optical tweezers based on a previously reported design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bustamante et al., 2008</xref>) were used to study XPD helicase unwinding.

Several essential features in the data must be captured: the model must provide a mechanism by which (i) the mean dwell time satisfies Michaelis-Menten-like kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), (ii) the backstepping probability <italic>p<sub>−</sub></italic> increases as ATP is decreased, yet remains nonzero at saturating ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), (iii) large (∼5-bp) backsteps are always followed by large forward steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), and (iv) the probability of taking large backsteps exhibits a weak increase with increasing ATP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). All of these criteria are satisfied by the kinetic scheme depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>Criterion (i) requires that the mechanochemical cycle of the helicase contains a minimum of two kinetic steps: an ATP binding step, which becomes rate-limiting at low ATP concentrations, followed by an unwinding step, rate-limiting at saturating ATP concentrations. The rate constants for these steps are <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> (for the sake of generality we assume binding can be reversible, with a dissociation rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub>) and <italic>k</italic><sub>+</sub>, respectively. Criterion (ii) requires that there exist two competing pathways for backstepping. In one, the motor can backstep from the nucleotide-free state with rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. As ATP concentration is decreased, the motor resides longer in this state, thus increasing the probability of backstepping. In the second pathway, the ATP-bound motor may backstep with rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>∞</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. This provides a mechanism by which the motor can backstep even as ATP concentration becomes saturating. Criterion (iii) requires that the large 5-bp backsteps take the motor to an off-pathway state, in which return to the main mechanochemical cycle can only occur through a forward 5-bp step. The dependence on ATP from criterion (iv) is ensured by making entry into this off-pathway state occur from the nucleotide-bound state.</p><p>Based on this scheme, we determined several relevant kinetic parameters to compare to our measurements.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Leemor Joshua-Tor, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports.</p><p>The reviewers were impressed with the technical achievements described. An accurate step size has been determined directly for only a handful of motors, and so the high-resolution measurements described in this paper for this important helicase are impressive. The evidence for single base-step forward unwinding is convincing.</p><p>1) The reviewers do, however, have some concerns about the complex behavior consisting of the other step sizes: –1, and especially the +/–5bp, which are unique to this helicase. The suggestion that this is due to DNA release from a secondary site on the helicase has not been substantiated, nor has a satisfying biological explanation been provided. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> does not clearly show that the probability of taking 5bp steps depends on ATP concentration, as required by the modeling. In addition, it is interesting that the 5bp steps is smaller than the minimal nucleic acid binding site of this class of helicases, which is 6–7 bases. Perhaps a spring-loaded mechanism, such as that suggested by Appleby et al (JMB 2011), should be considered.</p><p>2) Of most concern with regard to modeling the complex stepping behavior is that the model contains eight fitting parameters. Such a large number of parameters could fit almost any small data set. In addition, the analyzed data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are rather scattered and many fits appear to be poor. What are the reduced chi-square values for these fits? More stringent tests for this model are called for. For example, can the model predict kinetic traces such as those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, which shows five rounds of repetitive unwinding bursts?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00334.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The reviewers do, however, have some concerns about the complex behavior consisting of the other step sizes: –1, and especially the +/–5bp, which are unique to this helicase.

In addition to this canonical nucleic acid binding site, XPD and related FeS-containing helicases feature additional contacts with the translocating strand. Biochemical and structural analyses previously published by us and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pugh et al., 2012</xref>) indicate that the translocating strand passes from the canonical binding site through the opening formed by the two auxiliary domains (Arch and FeS), and is guided by the residues of HD1 and FeS domains forming a secondary DNA binding site to the wedge structure on the back of the FeS domain. This secondary DNA binding site should accommodate approximately 5 nt of the translocating strand. This site is important for (i) enabling and controlling 5’-3’ translocation and force generation by XPD, (ii) for positioning the ss-dsDNA junction near the strand separating wedge, and (iii) for damage verification by XPD (Mathieu et al. <italic>Curr. Biol.</italic> 2013). If the translocating strand were to dissociate from the secondary binding site, the 5 nt occluded by this site would re-anneal with the complementary strand, resulting in a 5-bp back step, as observed in our data. To re-initiate unwinding, the point of duplex separation has to reengage the wedge structure necessitating reopening of the 5 bp. In our data, a 5-bp forward step is always observed following a 5-bp backward step and is never detected on its own, consistent with this structural model.</p><p>The 5-bp back and forward steps illustrate the importance of the secondary binding site in controlling XPD helicase activity: it separates the motor core from the wedge structure that splits the duplex. Unwinding occurs only when the translocating strand resides within this secondary DNA binding site. This not only allows control of the unwinding rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pugh et al., 2012</xref>), but also stalls the helicase at bulky UV-induced damage site, thereby triggering nucleotide excision repair (Mathieu et al. <italic>PNAS</italic>, 2010; Mathieu et al. <italic>Curr. Biol.</italic> 2013).</p><p>While we cannot rule out all alternative models and ternary complex structures will be required for further validation, the proposed mechanism provides the most reasonable explanation of our observations. In contrast, the spring-loaded mechanism suggested by the reviewers appears far less plausible. In this mechanism, one would expect multiple unwinding steps reflecting “loading of the spring” accompanied by sequestering of the unwound DNA, followed by release of this DNA, which would be observed as a large forward step. It is difficult to imagine how such a model could explain how 5-bp backsteps are always followed by 5-bp forward steps, while also accounting for 1-bp forward and backward steps. Moreover, a spring-loaded mechanism would require several hidden kinetic steps to occur per observed step, resulting in a non-exponential dwell time distribution (see, for example, Myong et al. <italic>Nature</italic> 2005). This is inconsistent with our data; the dwell times for forward 5-bp steps are exponentially distributed, indicative of a single kinetic event.</p><p>In our revised manuscript, we have provided a more extensive discussion of these points. In addition, we have included a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref> showing that the dwell times for –5-bp backsteps are exponentially distributed.</p><p><italic>2) Of most concern with regard to modeling the complex stepping behavior is that the model contains eight fitting parameters. Such a large number of parameters could fit almost any small data set. In addition, the analyzed data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>are rather scattered and many fits appear to be poor. What are the reduced chi-square values for these fits? More stringent tests for this model are called for. For example, can the model predict kinetic traces such as those in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1D</italic></xref><italic>, which shows five rounds of repetitive unwinding bursts</italic>?</p><p>Our study design allows a wealth of information to be extracted from a relatively “small” dataset because individual steps are resolved. Each step contains information on directionality, step size, dwell time, and sequence. When multiplied by the several thousand steps detected (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) over varying ATP concentrations, the dataset can in fact provide strict constraints on a multi-parameter model.</p><p>Despite the apparent high number of fitting parameters, it is important to realize that these were in fact precisely determined by our data. To illustrate this point consider that our measurements yielded four independent quantities measured as a function of ATP (plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>): the probabilities for (i) 1-bp and (ii) 5-bp backsteps, the dwell times for (iii) 1-bp steps, and (iv) 5-bp backsteps. If these quantities had been fitted individually, a minimum of <italic>seven</italic> independent kinetic parameters would have been required to capture their dependence on ATP—two for each quantity, minus one for the 5-bp backstep dwell time that did not depend on ATP—rather than the <italic>six</italic> used in our model (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). (For instance, the dwell time for 1-bp steps would be fit to a Michaelis-Menten equation, yielding two parameters, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub>, etc) Similarly, the forward and backward rates (and the related backstepping probability, plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–I</xref>) were measured as a function of sequence. According to the model of Betterton and Julicher (<italic>Phys. Rev. E</italic>., 2005), a minimum of <italic>two</italic> additional parameters, <italic>f</italic> and <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>int</italic></sub> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), are required to capture the dependence on <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>open</italic></sub>.</p><p>Rather than fit each quantity independently with a larger total set of parameters, we felt it was more instructive to propose a minimal model that would <italic>globally</italic> fit all datasets simultaneously. The global model parameters are in fact more strictly constrained than those of independent fits to the same set of plots.</p><p>In our revised manuscript, we have expanded a discussion of our fitting strategy in the Materials and methods. In addition, we have provided chi-squared values for all global fits in the figure captions. We also provide a fit to an alternate strictly passive unwinding model (i.e. with <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>int</italic></sub> = 0) with smaller numbers of parameters to show that the current model provides a more optimal fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The reviewers also raised a specific point about the ATP dependence of the 5-bp backstep probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We agree that the dependence is quite weak, as mentioned in the manuscript text. One of the parameters in the global fit (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf39"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>≡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">off</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) produces this ATP dependence with non-zero value. The chi-squared value is minimized for <italic>C</italic> &gt; 0 although its dependence on <italic>C</italic> is weak (chi-squared values changed from 3.5 to 3.6 when varying <italic>C</italic> over a finite range), and the fits do not constrain the value of <italic>C</italic> very much. As described in the text (and see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) we lump this parameter into an effective binding rate constant<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf40"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">on</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">eff</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">on</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">off</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, which is more accurately constrained by the fits. The difference in the parameter values listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> with <italic>C</italic> &gt; 0 or with <italic>C</italic> = 0 is minimal, and this parameter is not essential to our model.</p><p>We have re-fitted our data to reflect changes to the data plots. The new fits are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figure 4E–F and 6A–I</xref>, and the fit parameter values (which only changed slightly) are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we also performed stochastic simulations based on our model to demonstrate that they reproduce observed features in the data. This is shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2 fig7s3">Figure 7–figure supplements 2 &amp; 3</xref>, and discussed within the text. It should be noted that additional parameters would be required to incorporate XPD backsliding (and dissociation) observed at the end of the unwinding bursts. Therefore, simulations based on our model as currently constructed will <italic>not</italic> reproduce repetitive unwinding bursts. They will, however, generate individual bursts with the correct stepping dwell times at each position.</p></body></sub-article></article>
