transmission, and disrupting this balance can cause neurodevelopmental disorders, for example, schizophrenia. MicroRNA-dependent gene regulation in pyramidal neurons is important for excitatory synaptic function and cognition, but its role in inhibitory interneurons is poorly understood. Here, we identify <italic>miR138-5p</italic> as a regulator of short-term memory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the mouse hippocampus. Sponge-mediated <italic>miR138-5p</italic> inactivation specifically in mouse parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons impairs spatial recognition memory and enhances GABAergic synaptic input onto pyramidal neurons. Cellular and behavioral phenotypes associated with <italic>miR138-5p</italic> inactivation are paralleled by an upregulation of the schizophrenia (SCZ)-associated <italic>Erbb4</italic>, which we validated as a direct <italic>miR138-5p</italic> target gene. Our findings suggest that <italic>miR138-5p</italic> is a critical regulator of PV interneuron function in mice, with implications for cognition and SCZ. More generally, they provide evidence that microRNAs orchestrate neural circuit development by fine-tuning both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>interneuron</kwd><kwd>short-term memory</kwd><kwd>inhibitory synapse</kwd><kwd>E-I balance</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHR 1136/4-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schratt</surname><given-names>Gerhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003006</institution-id><institution>EidgenÃ¶ssische Technische Hochschule ZÃ¼rich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24 18-2 (NeuroSno)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schratt</surname><given-names>Gerhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new molecular mechanism involving microRNA, which controls synaptic transmission in a specialized type of inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus and short-term memory in mice, was identified.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that act as negative regulators of mRNA translation and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartel, 2018</xref>). Over the last decade, a large body of evidence shows that miRNAs control excitatory neuron development, function, and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McNeill and Van Vactor, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schratt, 2009</xref>). Specific miRNAs, for example, miR-132, -134, and -138, have been identified which control dendritic spines, the major sites of excitatory synaptic contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schratt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siegel et al., 2009</xref>). The complete lack of miRNAs from excitatory forebrain neurons in Dicer-deficient mice enhances learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Konopka et al., 2010</xref>), and specific miRNAs have been linked to both short-term and long-term memory regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walgrave et al., 2021</xref>). Although miRNAs are likewise substantially expressed in inhibitory Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2012</xref>), relatively little is known about miRNA function in this cell type. The complete lack of miRNAs reduces the number of cortical interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tuncdemir et al., 2015</xref>) while the absence of miRNAs in interneurons expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) leads to cortical circuit dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qiu et al., 2020</xref>). miR-128 knockout in Drd1a-positive GABAergic medium spiny neurons of the striatum results in increased motor activity and fatal epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the rodent hippocampus, microcircuits of excitatory pyramidal neurons and local inhibitory interneurons provide an extensively studied model in the context of information processing, with specific implications for the control of spatial short-term and long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booker and Vida, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Markram et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>). Among the different interneuron classes, fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons play a particularly prominent role in controlling pyramidal neuron output to drive appropriate behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murray et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rico and MarÃ­n, 2011</xref>). For example, CA1 PV interneurons are required for spatial working memory, but neither for reference memory nor for memory acquisition in contextual fear conditioning (CFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuchs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lovett-Barron et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murray et al., 2011</xref>). PV interneuron dysfunction has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, most notably schizophrenia (SCZ), but also epilepsy and autism-spectrum disorders (ASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Del Pino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019</xref>). However, the role of specific miRNAs in PV interneurons in the context of higher cognitive function is completely elusive.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We previously identified the brain-enriched <italic>miR138-5p</italic> as an important regulator of excitatory synapse function in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siegel et al., 2009</xref>). To study the role of <italic>miR138-5p</italic> on a behavioral level, we generated mice with a conditional ROSA26 transgene (138-floxed) which allows expression of a <italic>miR138-5p</italic> inactivating sponge transcript harboring a lacZ coding sequence and six imperfect miR138-5p binding sites (6x-miR-138sponge) upon Cre-recombinase expression. Sponge transcripts sequester endogenous miRNA, thereby leading to miRNA inactivation and the derepression of cognate target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ebert and Sharp, 2010</xref>). 138-floxed mice without Cre transgene served as a control throughout the experiments. Since these control mice completely lack expression of any sponge-related transcript in vivo, we first carefully validated the specificity and efficiency of the 138-sponge transcript in primary rat hippocampal neurons. Therefore, we compared the 138-sponge transcript to an identical control sponge, except that the six imperfect miR-138 binding sites were replaced with a shuffled sequence not supposed to sequester any miRNA expressed in neurons (cf. Materials and methods). This analysis revealed a robust and specific inactivation of <italic>miR138-5p</italic> by 138-sponge in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a-c</xref>).</p><p>We then activated 138-sponge expression at embryonic stage in vivo by crossing 138-floxed mice to the ubiquitous Cre-driver line CMV-Cre (138-sponge<sup>ub</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). lacZ staining revealed highly penetrant expression of 6x-miR-138 sponge in the hippocampus of 138-floxed mice upon CMV-Cre expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1d</xref>). To test for the degree of <italic>miR138-5p</italic> inhibition in vivo, we made use of a dual fluorescence miR-138 sensor virus which we injected into the hippocampus of 138-sponge<sup>ub</sup> mice. Briefly, the sensor consists of a GFP coding sequence (cds) followed by two perfect miR-138 binding sites and a mCherry cds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1e</xref>). Thus, the lower the ratio of GFP/mCherry, the higher the cellular miR-138 activity. Quantifying GFP/mCherry ratios over many infected neurons revealed that in neurons with 6x-miR-138-sponge expression, GFP/mCherry ratios were significantly higher compared to controls, indicative of an efficient sequestering of endogenous <italic>miR138-5p</italic> by our sponge construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Impaired working memory in ubiquitous 138-sponge mice.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic overview of the strategy for generating 138-sponge<sup>ub</sup> mice.

In order to specify the origin for the observed gene expression changes, we compared DEGs to single-cell RNA-seq data from different cell types present in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1c</xref>).

Thus, we again injected a miR-138 pbds sensor construct into the hippocampus of control or miR-138 sponge<sup>Ub</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), but now counterstained for PV to quantify miR-138 activity in PV+ and PVâ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1c</xref>). Analysis of GFP/mCherry ratios revealed that expression of a miR-138 sponge significantly inactivated <italic>miR138-5p</italic> in PV+ neurons but had only a marginal effect in PVâ cells (which predominantly consist of excitatory pyramidal neurons). Thus, the observed lack of regulation of <italic>miR138-5p</italic> targets in excitatory pyramidal neurons of 138-sponge<sup>Ub</sup> mice is likely a result of inefficient sponge-mediated <italic>miR138-5p</italic> inhibition in this cell type. Since <italic>miR138-5p</italic> and alterations in PV+ interneuron function had recently been linked to SCZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>), we performed a comparison between DEGs from 138-sponge<sup>ub</sup> mouse hippocampus and cortical tissue of SCZ patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gandal et al., 2018</xref>). We found a significant overlap between genes upregulated in the 138-sponge<sup>ub</sup> hippocampus and SCZ patients (p=0.00884; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1d</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that <italic>miR138-5p</italic> inactivation due to expression of a miR-138 sponge predominantly affects PV+ interneurons leading to an upregulation of synaptic genes which are deregulated in SCZ.</p><p>To elaborate on the functional role of <italic>miR138-5p</italic> in PV+ interneurons, we generated 138-sponge<sup>PV</sup> mice by crossing 138-floxed mice to PV-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). In 138-sponge<sup>PV</sup> mice, the 6x-miR-138-sponge transcript is selectively expressed in the majority (about 90%) of PV-expressing inhibitory interneurons (PV-positive cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). On a behavioral level, we found that locomotion and anxiety-related behavior, as measured in the open field and EPM tests, was unaltered in 138-sponge<sup>PV</sup> mice compared to their littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1a-c</xref>). However, similar as 138-sponge<sup>ub</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>) and mice injected with rAAV-Dlx5/6-138-sponge into the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>), 138-sponge<sup>PV</sup> mice showed impairments in behavioral tasks addressing short-term memory, such as the Y-maze novelty preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) and NOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) tests. No genotype-dependent differences in spontaneous alternations in the Y-maze were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Similar to 138-sponge<sup>ub</sup> mice, associative long-term memory as assessed by conditional fear conditioning was not affected in 138-sponge<sup>PV</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1d</xref>). These results demonstrate that <italic>miR138-5p</italic> activity in PV-positive interneurons is required to sustain proper short-term memory. Next, we investigated electrophysiological alterations that might underlie the observed short-term memory deficits. In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of 138-sponge<sup>PV</sup> mice, similar to rAAV-Dlx5/6-138-sponge injected mice, frequency of mIPSC was significantly increased in 138-sponge<sup>PV</sup> as compared to control slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1a</xref>), while neither amplitude, nor rise or decay time were changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1b-d</xref>). The total number of PV-positive interneurons in the hippocampus was similar between 138-sponge<sup>PV</sup> and 138-floxed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1e</xref>), suggesting that mIPSC frequency changes either result from an increased number of inhibitory presynaptic boutons synapsing onto pyramidal cells or an enhanced neurotransmitter release. To distinguish between these possibilities, we first analyzed presynaptic boutons contacting CA1 pyramidal cells by staining slices obtained from 138-floxed and 138-sponge<sup>PV</sup> mice with antibodies against PV and the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). Our analysis revealed no significant difference in the number and intensity of PV-positive presynaptic boutons impinging onto the somata of CA1 pyramidal cells between 138-sponge<sup>PV</sup> mice and their littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). To probe for changes in presynaptic release probability, we first recorded extracellularly stimulated inhibitory PPRs (iPPRs) in CA1 pyramidal cells but did not observe differences between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Finally, we performed paired whole-cell recordings between presynaptic putative fast-spiking PV-positive interneurons in stratum pyramidale and postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6dâf</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1f</xref>). The analysis of unitary connections revealed increased, albeit not significant, unitary inhibitory postsynaptic current (uIPSC) amplitudes (including failures of transmission) and success rates (i.e., an action potential elicits an IPSC) in 138-sponge<sup>PV</sup> mice as compared to their control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). However, we did not observe significant changes in PPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Our further analysis though revealed a significant decrease of the coefficient of variation (CV), indicative of more reliable unitary synaptic connections between PV-positive interneurons and CA1 pyramidal neurons in 138-sponge<sup>PV</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). These findings may also explain why mIPSC frequency was found to be altered as these inhibitory currents reflect inputs of many GABAergic neurons onto a single excitatory pyramidal neuron. In conclusion, CA1 pyramidal neurons in 138-sponge<sup>PV</sup> mice receive increased inhibitory GABAergic synaptic input from putative fast-spiking PV-positive interneurons without detectable changes in perisomatic inhibitory bouton density or size.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Impaired short-term memory in PV-expressing interneuron specific miR-138 sponge mice.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic overview of the strategy for generating miR-138 sponge<sup>PV</sup> mice.

Particularly, we find that cell type-specific inhibition of <italic>miR138-5p</italic> in PV-positive interneurons enhances the reliability of unitary synaptic connections from putative fast-spiking PV-positive interneurons onto CA1 pyramidal neurons. The resulting increase in neurotransmitter release at this synapse is possibly due to an increase in the number of presynaptic release sites within individual boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakamoto et al., 2018</xref>), as we observed a decrease in CV, but did not detect significant changes in release probability. PV-positive interneurons are the main source of feedforward inhibition onto pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pouille and Scanziani, 2001</xref>) and have been functionally linked to working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murray et al., 2011</xref>), possibly via controlling gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">HÃ¡jos et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore propose a model whereby <italic>miR138-5p</italic> activity in PV+ interneurons is regulating neurotransmitter release, thereby keeping pyramidal cell output in a range required for proper information processing. Since <italic>miR138-5p</italic> controls dendritic spine morphogenesis in cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siegel et al., 2009</xref>), it might further regulate E-I balance in the hippocampal circuitry by controlling pyramidal neuron excitatory input. The absence of changes in excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of 138-sponge<sup>ub</sup> mice might be due to ineffective silencing of the highly abundant <italic>miR138-5p</italic> in pyramidal neurons via our approach. This view is supported by our observation that a <italic>miR138-5p</italic> sensor plasmid is effectively unsilenced in PV+, but not PVâ hippocampal neurons of 138-sponge<sup>ub</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1d</xref>) and by the lack of upregulation of <italic>miR138-5p</italic> targets preferentially expressed in pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1c</xref>). The molecular explanation for this PV-specific <italic>miR138-5p</italic> inactivation is currently unknown.</p><p>Sponge-mediated inactivation of miRNAs is routinely used in cell culture, but studies employing this approach in transgenic mice are still scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giusti et al., 2014</xref>), possibly in part because a stringent control would require the generation of an independent transgenic line. Here, we addressed this issue by comparing the effects of miR-138-sponge to a highly similar, but ineffective control sponge, in primary neurons in vitro and in the hippocampus in vivo using multiple assays. Thereby, we reproducibly observed 138-sponge specific effects on reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1b</xref>), dendritic spine size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1c</xref>), miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d and e</xref>), and short-term memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>), strongly arguing that the effects seen in miR-138-sponge mice are due to <italic>miR138-5p</italic> inactivation.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms downstream of <italic>miR138-5p</italic> inactivation leading to enhanced inhibition remain to be elucidated, but likely involve upregulation of proteins organizing inhibitory synapse function. An interesting candidate in this regard represents <italic>Erbb4</italic>, which has been shown to control GABAergic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fazzari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wen et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, release probability of GABAergic synapses onto pyramidal neurons was diminished in <italic>Erbb4</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), which is in agreement with our finding that elevated Erbb4 levels in miR-138 sponge mice are paralleled by higher mIPSC frequencies. However, additional presynaptic genes might function downstream of <italic>miR138-5p</italic>, for example, <italic>Rims3</italic>, which physically and functionally interacts with presynaptic voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VDCCs) and increases neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takada et al., 2015</xref>).

The targeting strategy allowed the generation of a constitutive LacZ-miRNA138 Sponge Knock-In (KI) allele in the C57Bl/6 mouse ROSA26 locus via targeted transgenesis. The presence of the loxP-flanked transcriptional STOP cassette is expected to terminate the transcription from the CAG promoter and thus prevent the expression of the NLS-LacZ miRNA138 Sponge cDNA, which allows this line to be used as a control (138-floxed line). The constitutive KI allele was obtained after Cre-mediated removal of the loxP-flanked transcriptional STOP cassette from the conditional KI allele, by crossing the 138-flox line with a B6.C-Tg(CMV-Cre)1Cgn (CMV-CRE) line, which allows the expression of the sponge construct (138-sponge<sup>ub</sup> mice).

The GFP intensity of 150â200 spines per cell was measured and normalized to the total intensity of the dendritic tree. For each experimental condition, at least 18 representative neurons derived from three independent experiments were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-2"><title>In vivo</title><p>Brains from 3-month-old 138-floxed and 138-sponge<sup>ub</sup> mice were processed with FD Rapid GolgiStain Kit (Gentaur GmbH, PK401) according to the manufacturerâs protocol.

Data were collected with an Axon MultiClamp 700B amplifier and a Digidata 1550B digitizer and analyzed with pClamp 11 software (all from Molecular Devices). Signals were filtered at 2 kHz for mEPSCs and mIPSCs and digitized at 5 kHz. Stimulus evoked and unitary postsynaptic currents were filtered at 4 kHz, fast-spiking interneurons at 10 kHz, both were digitized at 100 kHz. Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate capillary glass (Harvard Apparatus; GC150F-10) with a DMZ-Universal-Electrode-Puller (Zeitz) and had resistances between 2 and 3 MÎ©.</p><p>The extracellular solution (ACSF) was composed of (in mM) 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 glucose. For EPSCs measured in CA1 pyramidal cells and for fast-spiking interneurons, the intracellular solution was composed of 125 K-Gluconate, 20 KCl 0.5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 GTP, and 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine (adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH). Cells were held at â70 mV for mEPSCs and at â60 mV for stimulus evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs). 1 Î¼M Gabazine was added to isolate AMPA-mediated postsynaptic currents, additionally 1 Î¼M TTX for mEPSCs. For IPSCs intracellular solution was composed of 135 Cs-Gluconate, 5 KCl, 2 NaCl, 0.2 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 GTP, and 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine (adjusted to pH 7.3 with CsOH). Cells were held at +10 mV for mIPSCs and at â10 mV for stimulus evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) and uIPSCs. 25 Î¼M AP-5, 10 Î¼M NBQX, and 10 Î¼M SCH 50911 were added to isolate GABAa-mediated postsynaptic currents for eIPSCs, additionally 1 Î¼M TTX for mIPSCs. Synaptic currents were evoked by mono-polar stimulation with a patch pipette filled with ACSF and positioned in the middle of CA1 stratum radiatum for eEPSCs and in stratum pyramidale for eIPSCs. Series resistance of CA1 pyramidal neurons (not compensated; range, from 7.0 to 19.7 MÎ©; median, 11.3 MÎ©; IQR, 2.4 MÎ©) was monitored and recordings were discarded if series resistance changed by more than 20%. Membrane potentials were not corrected for liquid junction potential.</p><p>For paired recordings, whole-cell configuration was first established in putative fast-spiking interneurons. Cells were selected based on morphological appearance in stratum pyramidale of hippocampal CA1, on fast-spiking properties and on input resistance characteristics for PV-positive interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Que et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1f</xref>). Subsequently, whole-cell recordings were made from postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal neurons residing in close proximity to the presynaptic fast-spiking interneuron. Presynaptic fast-spiking interneurons were held in current-clamp mode and series resistance was compensated with the automatic bridge balance of the amplifier. The mean resting potential of the presynaptic fast-spiking interneurons was â65Â±4.1 mV (mean Â± sd; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1f</xref>). Fast-spiking interneurons were stimulated at 1 Hz for uIPSCs and at 0.03 Hz for paired-pulse uIPSCs. To characterize the discharge behavior of fast-spiking interneurons, depolarizing steps (50 pA) of 1500 ms were applied. The spiking frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1f</xref>) was determined at 800â1000 pA current injection. Input resistance was calculated from the mean deviation from baseline of steady-state voltage responses evoked by â150, â100, and â50 pA current injections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cell type enrichment analysis</title><p>For the cell type enrichment analysis, we used the single-cell data and annotation from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>.

To this end they overexpress a miR-138 sponge construct first ubiquitously and find that short term memory is impaired. Gene-expression analysis points to a specific role in inhibitory neurons, which the authors confirm by repeating key experiments in mutant mice in which the miR-138 sponge is expressed in PV-inhibitory neurons. This is a very interesting study that pioneers the analysis of microRNAs in a cell-type specific manner in the CNS. The following point represent helpful suggestion the authors could address before submission.</p><p>- A question that may come up is related to the mutant mice the controls. One could argue that the better control would the transgenic mice expressing the &quot;control sponge&quot;. At present the control group are mice that carry the construct but its not expressed, as far as I understood. The authors may want to address this issue upfront and discuss somewhere in the manuscript that their control animals are suitable.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that an independent line expressing a âcontrol spongeâ construct might represent a âgold standardâ control. However, we decided to take the current approach for two reasons: (1) considering the RRR principles of animal research, including an independent mouse line would have doubled the number of animals needed for experiments. (2) although a control sponge line addresses potential specificity issues of expressing a sponge transcript, it also has its own limitations since behavioural experiments cannot be done with littermates, which could also introduce variability. Nevertheless, we have rigorously validated the specificity of the miR-138 sponge construct by comparing it to a highly similar miR-138 control sponge construct in several assays: (i) miR-138 perfect binding site luciferase sensor assay (suppl. Figure 1A); (ii) dendritic spine size assay (suppl. Figure 1B); (iii) mIPSC electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal slices of intracerebrally injected mice (new Figure 4d, e); (iv) short-term memory assay in intracerebrally injected mice (new Figure 4b, c); (v) Erbb4 FISH in primary rat hippocampal neurons infected with Dlx-138-sponge (new Figure 3f). As suggested by this reviewer, we have discussed our approach in more detail in the revised manuscript (p.10-11, lines 307-316).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Moreover, as far as I understand it, the sponge construct will be expressed from early developmental stages in all cells of the body in the initial experiment. While the authors later study specifically PV neurons, this may also represent early neurodevelopmental effects. It might be helpful for the reader to explain the approach and rational in more detail. want the specifically focus on the role of miR-138 in neurodevelopmental diseases (schizophrenia is generally mentioned in the introduction) in which case the approach would make sense. However, I am not aware that miR-138 has been genetically linked yet to neurodevelopmental disease but I might have missed this. This could clarified specifically in the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that the phenotypes we observe might have an early developmental origin, at least in the ubiquitous sponge mouse line. However, as pointed out by reviewer 2, expression of PV doesnât kick in before the second postnatal week, arguing for a postnatal role of miR-138-5p in the PV-sponge model. Moreover, stereotactic injections of Dlx-138-sponge into the hippocampus (new Figure 4) were performed in young adult mice, providing further support that perturbing miR-138-5p at adult stages impacts physiology and behaviour. Our findings are thus in line with a link to a disease like schizophrenia whose onset is either during adolescence (early-onset) or in adulthood (late-onset). In fact, miR-138 has been linked to cognitive functions, and a rare variant in the miR-138-2 gene has been associated with schizophrenia (Watanabe et al., Psychiatry Res. 2014). We have now better clarified these links in the introduction and discussion of our revised manuscript. In addition, we have provided additional data showing a preferred deregulation of SCZ-associated genes in the miR-138 sponge model (new suppl. Figure 4d; see also below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 1B. To convincingly demonstrate the functionality of the construct in vivo it may help to assay the regulation of some confirmed targets at the mRNA/Protein level or point already here to the exp. later shown in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer, that showing target gene regulation is imperical to confirm the functionality of the miR-138 loss-of-function approach. However, we want to stress that a number of experiments in this context were already included in our original manuscript. (1) Expression of the sponge in mice in vivo leads to a preferential upregulation of predicted miR-138 targets compared to non-targets (Figure 2b), which provides strong evidence that expression of the construct leads to a specific loss-of-function of miR-138. (2) Validation by qPCR confirmed upregulation of PV-enriched genes at the RNA level, e.g. Rims3 and Erbb4. (3) In the revised manuscript, we further included protein data for Erbb4 upregulation in the hippocampus of miR-138-sponge<sup>Ub</sup> mice using Western blot (new Figure 3c). Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain conclusive Western blot results for Rims3 using several commercially available antibodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Supplemental Figure 1.: n=1 for pGL3 CTR may not be sufficient for statistical analysis. Panel (A) Please explain this assay in greater detail. What is measured here?</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, this assay has been repeated 3 times. The lack of error bar in the control conditions is due to normalization. Statistical test could still be performed with a 1-sample t-test, which revealed a significant difference. The experiment measures the endogenous activity of miR-138 in hippocampal neurons (based on the extent of cleavage of the luciferase reporter).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Supplemental Fig1d: No scale bar. Why show a small section of the cerebellum when later hippocampus is analyzed? I suggest to show a selection of brain regions with high quality images.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have now included a lacZ staining from the hippocampus in the revised manuscript (new suppl. Figure 1d).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 1. The authors may want to consider that no effect in the contextual fear conditioning may not be sufficient to claim that specifically short-term memory is affected in mutant mice. A more thorough behavioral characterization may be necessary or it should be discussed why this is not necessary in the context of the current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have now further included CFC data from the PV-sponge mouse line (new Suppl. Figure 5d), which also didnât reveal a significant genotype-dependent difference. That said, we fully agree that results from only one behavioural paradigm (CFC) are not sufficient to make general statements about the specific types of memories affected by miR-138 loss-of-function. However, since our laboratory is currently not set up to perform an extensive behavioural characterization of memory function using different tests, we consider such experiments beyond the scope of this revision. We therefore decided to tone down the statements in the manuscript related to short-term memory specificity accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 2: please explain in more detail (in the methods) the statistics behind the diff. expression analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>A more detailed statistical description has been included in the methods section of the revised manuscript (p. 18, l. 1074-1079).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 2d. To further strengthen the idea that DEG are enriched in inhibitory neurons, corresponding viol plots across cell types may help. The authors could plot for example selected genes are the eigen-vector expression of DEGs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that an alternative presentation of the DEG data could be helpful. We have therefore added another panel (new suppl. Figure 2c) illustrating the distribution of expression of theÂ sponge-upregulated-DEGs in the different cell types. In our view, this presentation is more easily interpretable compared to viol plots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The selection of Erbb4 and Rims3 for further analysis could be explained better.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the available data, we have now decided to prioritize on Erbb4 regulation in the revised manuscript (Rims3 data was moved to the supplement). We have further provided a more detailed rationale for studying Erbb4 in the context of inhibitory synaptic transmission and short-term memory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 3B.Maybe show representative images.</p></disp-quote><p>Representative pictures have now been included in the revised manuscript (new Figure 5b, left panel).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- How about FC and other long-term memory assays in 138-spongePVÂ´ mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now additionally performed CFC in 138-sponge-PV mice, and found no significant difference in memory performance between 138-sponge and control mice (new suppl. Figure 5d). As outlined above, additional memory assays are beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Please address the finding that behavior phenotypes are similar in 138-spongeub and 138-spongePVÂ´ mice, while e-physiology differs (mini ipsc).</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that this is a misunderstanding, since we did not measure mIPSCs in pyramidal neurons of 138-sponge<sup>Ub</sup> mice (in contrast to mEPSC, which surprisingly were not altered compared to control mice.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I guess an obvious question could be to show the regulation of miR-138 target genes in PV neurons and /or study the transcriptome in PV-neurons as a result of sponge expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that assessing the transcriptome specifically of PV neurons would be a logical next step. However, this is technically rather challenging, either involving FACS sorting of PV-positive neurons or single-cell RNAseq approaches, both of which are currently not established in the laboratory. We therefore feel that such experiments, also considering the limited new insight that would be expected from them, are beyond the scope of this revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The discussion is comparatively short. The specific reference to miR-138 as a target for schizophrenia and ASD provokes the question of more detailed analysis, e.g behavioral phenotypes for ASD and schizophrenia in mutant mice or comparing the DEG to genes de-regulated in other mouse models for these diseases.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that making more functional connections to ASD/schizophrenia would be exciting. However, this would involve a battery of additional mouse behavioural experiments, which is in our view clearly beyond the scope of this revision. Concerning the second point, we have performed a comparison between DEGs deregulated in the miR138 sponge model and a previous study about schizophrenia (Gandal et al., Science 2018). Excitingly, we found that the genes upregulated in the 138-sponge (at FDR&lt;0.05) are significantly enriched for genes found upregulated in the brain of SCZ patients (p~0.00884; new suppl. Figure 4d), which provides additional correlative evidence for an involvement of miR-138 in SCZ. Moreover, we have elaborated more on the role of miR-138 in cognition and SCZ in the discussion (p. 11-12, l. 339-351).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Given that the literature suggests of role for miR-138 also excitatory neurons, the phenotypes should be discussed in more detail. Why are mainly genes in inhibitory neurons affected in 138-spongeub mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our new results from a cell-type specific miR-138 sensor assay (new suppl. Figure 4c) we speculate that the reason for the preferential regulation in inhibitory neurons is the more efficient miR-138 inhibition in this cell type. This is now discussed in more detail (p. 10, l. 299-306). Please see also our comments to the other reviewers regarding this topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)): Generally this study addresses the cell-type specific role of microRNAs in the CNS, which is important to still innovative.</p><p>The finding that miR-138 controls specific functions in inhibitory neurons and that this is linkned to behavioral alterations is novel</p><p>The data will be mainly intersting for the neuroscientific community</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Understanding the role of miRNAs in different neuronal cell types remains a paramount goal in neuroscience. Using a conditional miR-138 sponge transgenic line, Daswani and colleagues demonstrate that miR-138 in parvalbumin+ (PV) GABAergic neurons is necessary for short-term memory. Further, they identify a possible cellular mechanism underlying this behavioral deficit: CA1 pyramidal neurons receive more inhibition from neighboring PVs. This work is timely, impactful, and an important contribution to the field. However, there are important aspects that needs to be addressed before publication:</p><p>Major:</p><p>It is surprising that the miR-138 sponge has no effect in pyramidal neurons. The authors' laboratory has published beautiful work showing that miR-138 has important roles for synaptogenesis in this cell type. The authors hypothesize that the expression levels of the miR-138 sponge might not be high enough for pyramidal neurons (where miR-138 is highly expressed) and instead it is sufficient for PVs. However, sensor data in Figure 1b and spines data in Sup Figure 1c are from pyramidal neurons. For the miR-138 sponge to be credible, the authors must demonstrate that, as they claim, the sponge is effectively working in PVs and only partially in pyramidal neurons. This could be achieved by showing that miR-138 is expressed at different levels in the two cell types: (i) analysis of miR-138 expression levels from He et al. (2012) in different cell types; (ii) FACS of PVs and pyramidal neurons and assessing miR-138 levels; (iii) quantifying miRNA FISH in different cell types. In addition, the authors should demonstrate that the miR-138 has different levels of efficacy in the two cell types, i.e. analyzing sensor data in PNs vs PVs (from cortical cultures or in vivo). If the results from this further analysis don't support the original hypothesis, the authors must find a plausible reason and validate it.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this reviewer that the absence of phenotype in pyramidal neurons is surprising and that we do not have a full explanation for this yet. To further test our hypothesis of an incomplete miR-138 inhibition in excitatory pyramidal neurons of the miR-138 sponge line, we have now performed a series of new experiments, largely following the suggestions made by this reviewer: (i) we monitored miR-138 expression from a published small RNA-seq study (He et al., 2012) (new suppl. Figure 3b). (Ii) we quantified miR-138 signal in already existing smFISH datasets from hippocampal neurons containing PNs and PVs (new suppl. Figure 3a). (Iii) we quantified mir-138 sensor activity in PNs and PVs in hippocampal slices stained for PN and PV markers (new suppl. Figure 4c). Altogether, this analysis suggests that while miR-138 is expressed to a similar level in PNs and PVs, its activity is markedly higher in PVs and more robustly inhibited in PVs by expression of a miR-138 sponge. Although the mechanistical underpinnings are unknown, these observations might explain why we preferentially observed miR-138-5p dependent regulation of interneuron-enriched genes in miR-138<sup>Ub</sup> sponge mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor:</p><p>The sensor data are somewhat confusing. It would benefit to add schemes of the sensor and sponge constructs and to represent the data in Figure 1b with a bar graph. To further support the claims of incomplete effects of the miR-138 sponge, the authors should have a mutated MRE sensor (maximum de-repression) and express the effect of the sponge in different cell types as percentage of maximum de-repression. Please also add text explaining the sensor experiments in more detail so that the non-specialist can follow.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by this reviewer, we have now added a scheme of the sensor and presented the data in Figure 1b as a bar graph. In addition, we have performed the sensor analysis separately for PNs and PVs (new suppl. Figure 4c). This analysis clearly shows that the degree of inhibition exerted by the 138-sponge is more pronounced in PV+ interneurons compared to PV- neurons, thereby supporting our model that transgenic expression of the miR-138 sponge preferentially de-represses miR-138-5p target genes in interneurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The choice of PV-Cre is interesting. PV-Cre does not kick in until the second postnatal week, it is notoriously not a very efficient Cre line, and although it correlates well in the cortex with basket cells, it turns on also in cerebellar purkinje cells and in the peripheral nervous system. Some of these limitations should be discussed, considering that behavior is used as readout.</p></disp-quote><p>The point about ectopic expression of PV-Cre in PV- cells in cerebellar purkinje cells and the peripheral nervous system is well taken. We therefore decided to perform a complementary approach where we delivered 138-sponge and control-sponge specifically to hippocampal interneurons by stereotactic injection of a rAAV-Dlx5/6 construct (new Figure 4). Intriguingly, the miR-138-sponge associated behavioural and electrophysiological phenotypes were fully recapitulated by this approach. Together with our detailed electrophysiological characterization of hippocampal PV+ interneurons in paired recordings (Figure 6), we are confident that hippocampal PV dysfunction contributes in an important way to the observed phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should remove emphasis from E/I. The physiology experiments performed don't assess E/I but E and I in isolation. It is the opinion of this reviewer that the work is impactful because it reveals novel miRNA mechanisms in GABAergic cells, no need to claiming anything else.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our claims about E/I are currently overstated, and have now toned down the respective statements in the revised manuscript (e.g. by removing emphasis from E/I in the introduction).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sup Figure 1c.

The paper from Daswani and colleagues is an important step forward in this direction. Somewhat serendipitously, the authors have found that miR-138 targets preferentially genes enriched in GABAergic interneurons. Indeed, PV-specific knockout of miR-138 recapitulates behavioral deficits induced by global miR-138 knockout. The only similar contributions are well referenced in the introduction: (i) Tuncdemir et al. (Fishell lab) performed MGE-specific Dicer knockout and found defects in GABAergic interneuron survival, migration, and lamination; (ii) Qiu et al. (Miao He lab) showed that Dicer ko in VIP cells induces long-term dysfunction in GABAergic interneuron computations and survival.</p><p>This manuscript should be of interest to both the miRNA field and the synaptic plasticity, learning and memory fields.</p><p>I am a neurobiologist that studies the roles of miRNAs in instructing network formation.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Daswani et al. report an interesting role for miR-138-5p in the control of short-term memory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. They notably built on an elegant transgenic model in which a miR-138 sponge is conditionally expressed using the Cre-Lox system and allows the sequestering of endogenous miR-138 in a cell-type specific manner. Using this model, the authors provide evidence that miR-138-5p expressed in parvalbumin-expressing neurons controls short-term memory as well as inhibitory synaptic input onto CA1 pyramidal neurons. Using RNAseq and qrtPCR, they identify presynaptic genes whose expression is regulated by miR-138 and possibly accounting for inhibitory synaptic alterations. Overall, the experiments are well conducted. The data are interesting, solid and logically presented and the methods are sufficiently described. However, there are some concerns that should be considered prior publication:</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>(1) In the abstract, the authors' claim that &quot;miR-138-5p regulates the expression of presynaptic genes in hippocampal parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons to control short-term memory&quot; is overstated. Indeed, while the authors provide compelling evidence that miR-138 sponge controls short-term memory, the causal evidence to demonstrate that this is going through the regulation of presynaptic genes expression is missing. Moreover, because they are using a transgenic model in which the 138-sponge is constitutively expressed in any cell types and brain areas, the short-term memory deficits found by the authors are not necessarily resulting from hippocampal synaptic alterations. Therefore, the authors should either tone down this claim or perform additional experiments to support their model (see points 3 and 4).</p></disp-quote><p>We largely agree with these statements and specifically address them under points 3 and 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) While the authors provide convincing data demonstrating the efficiency of the miR-138 sponge both in cultured neurons and in vivo using sensor constructs and luciferase assays, the only evidence that the 138-sponge specifically inhibits miR-138 is by using a control sponge in cultured neurons and by measuring luciferase activity from sensors or spine size. To better support the specificity of the 138-sponge, it is important to demonstrate the absence of effect of the control sponge on inhibitory synaptic transmission, at least in cultured neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by this reviewer, we have now performed additional experiments to support the specificity of the 138-sponge in interneurons. Therefore, we generated rAAV expressing 138-sponge selectively in interneurons due to the presence of a Dlx5/6 promoter (Dlx-138-sponge). (i) expression of Dlx-138-sponge, but not Dlx-control-sponge, elevated Erbb4 expression in rat hippocampal interneurons in culture as assessed by smFISH (new Figure 3f); (ii) stereotactic injection into the adult mouse hippocampus of Dlx-138-sponge, but not Dlx-control-sponge, impairs short-term memory (new Figure 4b, c) and inhibitory synaptic transmission in pyramidal neurons (new Figure 4d, e).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, it would be reassuring to see that not all miRNAs are regulated by miR-138 (for instance by using sensors for distinct miRNAs).</p></disp-quote><p>A priori, one cannot rule out that miR-138 inactivation indirectly regulates the expression and/or activity of other miRNAs, for example by regulating targets which control miRNA biogenesis. Therefore, the proposed sensor experiments for selected miRNA candidates are in our view not suitable to unequivocally judge the specificity of the miR-138 sponge approach. Moreover, such experiments would have required the stereotactic injection of at least two additional cohorts of mice, which was not covered by our currently approved animal experimentation license. Finally, only a low number of miRNAs could be screened with such an in vivo approach, making general conclusions difficult. By weighing all these arguments, we decided not to perform sensor experiments for additional miRNAs and instead added further experiments which support the specificity of the 138-sponge approach (see above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors propose that miR-138 expression in the hippocampus regulates short-term memory. Although there is evidence from previous studies that hippocampal PV+ interneurons are involved in short-term memory, the data do not directly address this point. Specific involvement of miR-138 in hippocampal PV+ interneurons could be easily tested through stereotaxic injections of rAAVs carrying PV-Cre in 138-floxed mice in order to drive the expression of miR-138 sponge selectively in CA1 hippocampal interneurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the data presented in the original manuscript didnât provide direct evidence for a role of the hippocampus in miR-138-dependent regulation of short-term memory. Therefore, we now inactivated miR-138-5p specifically in hippocampal interneurons by stereotactic injection of a Dlx-138-sponge rAAV construct (new Figure 4a, see above). This led to a similar impairment in both short-term memory (new. Figure 4b, c) and inhibitory synaptic transmission (new Figure 4d, e) as observed in 138-sponge<sup>Ub</sup> and 138-sponge<sup>PV</sup> mice. We did not pursue the PV-Cre injections into 138-floxed mice, since viral expression of PV-Cre (as opposed to transgenic expression in PV-Cre mice) apparently is not very specific and therefore not frequently used (personal communication).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Although not required for the paper as it is, experiments addressing the causal link between (1) the miR-138-dependent regulation of ErbB4 and/or RimS3 in CA1 interneurons and (2) the role of miR-138 in inhibitory synaptic transmission and/or short-term memory would considerably strengthen the model proposed. To address that, the authors could alter the expression/function of the candidate genes in their transgenic model. Alternatively, strategies could be used to selectively protect putative target from the action of miR-138-5p (e.g., using LNAs or 3'UTR mutants).</p></disp-quote><p>Addressing the molecular mechanism underlying impaired short-term memory and inhibitory transmission is clearly the next step in this project, but beyond the scope of the current manuscript, as also pointed out by this reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Description of statistics require clarifications: - n should be clearly defined in all figure legends (cells, cultures, animals, experiments?).</p><p>- The authors should indicate whether and how they tested for normal distribution of their data.</p><p>âfigure supplement Figure 1a-c and Suppl. Figure 3a : a non-parametric test should be used to compare the different conditions, considering the too low n number which does not allow to conclude on a normal distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now addressed these statistical issues in the revised manuscript. (i) we have now clearly defined n in all figure legends. (ii) normal distribution of the data was tested with the Shapiro-Wilk test in GraphPad (stated in the Methods section). When normal distribution was not observed, non-parametric tests were used (e.g. Mann-Whitney, Kolmogorov-Smirnov). (iii) we agree with this reviewer that the n for the indicated experiments is too low to conclude on a normal distribution with a common test. However, visual inspection of the data suggested normal distribution for luciferase assays presented in Suppl. Figure 1a-c, considering our long-term experience with these assays. We therefore did not see the necessity to use non-parametric tests in this case. Concerning the PV+ cell density count (previous Suppl. Figure 3a, new suppl. Figure 6e), we now applied the Mann-Whitney test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor issues: (1) The fact that excitatory synapses onto pyramidal neurons are unaffected in 138-sponge mice is puzzling when considering the previous study from the same authors (Siegel et al., 2009) as well as the results obtained in cultured neurons to validate the sponge (spine size measurements, Suppl. Figure 1). While the authors propose that 'the absence of changes in excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of 138-sponge-ub mice might be due to ineffective silencing of the highly abundant miR-138-5p in pyramidal neurons' they could actually refine their analysis to give support this hypothesis:</p><p>- By quantifying the signal from single-molecule FISH for miR-138 in Camk2a+ neurons versus Erbb4+ neurons (Figure 2e). In the images shown, it is not evident that excitatory neurons express more miR-138 in comparison to inhibitory ones.</p><p>- By quantifying the degree of inhibition of miR-138 in pyramidal neurons versus interneurons using the dual sensor system (GFP/mcherry signal). In Figure 1b, the authors do not discriminate between cell types. A lack of increase of the GFP signal in pyramidal cells may indicate an inability of those cells to express the sponge.</p><p>- By checking whether APT1, a known miR-138 target that they previously identified in excitatory neurons (Siegel et al., 2009) is also a regulated gene in 138-sponge mice. If APT1 expression remains unchanged, this could give support to the fact that the sponge is indeed ineffective in excitatory neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the comments made by this reviewer, which are also in agreement with those from reviewer 2 (see also our comments there). Concerning the last point of reviewer 3, we now checked the expression APT1 (new nomenclature LYPLA1), as well as two other validated miR-138 targets from excitatory neurons (SIRT1, Reln) in our RNA-seq data. None of these targets was differentially expressed (new suppl. Figure 2e). Together, this data supports our hypothesis that miR-138 is not effectively inhibited by the sponge transgene in PNs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The analysis of VGAT signal intensity in individual PV+ boutons may provide useful information about the content in vesicles per bouton. One could expect a higher VGAT intensity/bouton in 138-sponge mice, correlated with an increase number of release sites per bouton (as proposed by the authors) or a similar trend as for increased success rate or decreased PPR.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the analysis of VGAT signal intensity might provide additional information regarding the observed inhibitory synapse phenotype and therefore performed the respective analysis (new Figure 6b, right panel). However, this didnât reveal any significant differences between miR-138-sponge<sup>PV</sup> and control mice, suggesting that the gross morphology of inhibitory release sites is unchanged. Further ultrastructural investigation of synaptic release sites will require super-resolution microscopy, which is currently not established in the laboratory and therefore beyond the scope of this revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) For the following data, titles of the graph axis are not accurate and the authors should indicate more precisely what are the exact parameters measured: Figure 1b, Suppl.
