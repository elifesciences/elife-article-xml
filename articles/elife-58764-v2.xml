exposure, the increased energy demands of thermogenesis must be counterbalanced by increased energy intake. To investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this cold-induced hyperphagia, we asked whether agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons are activated when animals are placed in a cold environment and, if so, whether this response is required for the associated hyperphagia. We report that AgRP neuron activation occurs rapidly upon acute cold exposure, as do increases of both energy expenditure and energy intake, suggesting the mere perception of cold is sufficient to engage each of these responses. We further report that silencing of AgRP neurons selectively blocks the effect of cold exposure to increase food intake but has no effect on energy expenditure. Together, these findings establish a physiologically important role for AgRP neurons in the hyperphagic response to cold exposure.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In homeothermic species, maintenance of euthermia in the face of a wide range of ambient temperatures is critical for survival. In small homeotherms, countering cold stress requires not only that adaptive adjustments of heat production occur rapidly and potently, but also that they are achieved without depleting body fuel stored in the form of fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gordon, 1993</xref>). Thus, when animals are housed in a cool environment, energy expenditure swiftly increases to generate the heat needed to maintain core body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2011</xref>) and, so long as a food is readily available, a compensatory hyperphagia prevents changes to body fat mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaiyala et al., 2012</xref>). While much is known regarding the neurocircuitry underlying cold-induced thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Madden and Morrison, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakamura and Morrison, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tan and Knight, 2018</xref>), the origins of cold-induced hyperphagia remain poorly understood.</p><p>One potential explanation for cold-induced hyperphagia is that it is mounted as a secondary response to the negative energy balance state that results from cold-induced thermogenesis, analogous to what occurs in other states of negative energy balance. During caloric restriction, for example, the imposed negative energy balance and the associated reduction of body fat stores drives adaptive homeostatic responses aimed at returning body fat stores to pre-intervention values. Reduced energy expenditure and increased hunger drive are major components of this adaptive response, and both are thought to be primarily driven by humoral signals indicative of energy deficiency (e.g., reductions of leptin and insulin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schwartz et al., 2000</xref>). It has, therefore, been reasonably assumed that the hyperphagic response to cold requires the same signals of energy deficiency, and this hypothesis is supported by studies that have been conducted over time periods sufficient to induce hormonal changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bing et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hardie et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Puerta et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Among central targets of these humoral feedback signals are neurons located in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) that express agouti-related peptide (AgRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahn et al., 1998</xref>) which, when activated, potently stimulate feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aponte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atasoy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>). However, recent evidence suggests that, although AgRP neurons are regulated by humoral signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schwartz et al., 2000</xref>), they may also be under feed-forward control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen and Knight, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lowell, 2019</xref>) such that they can be activated by neurocircuits that integrate sensory cues from the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Betley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zimmer et al., 2019</xref>) and thereby avert a negative energy state. Based on these observations, we hypothesized a role for AgRP neuron activation in the adaptive increase in food intake induced by cold exposure, and that this effect is not secondary to the associated increase in energy expenditure or a state of negative energy balance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effect of chronic cold exposure on determinants of energy balance and hypothalamic neuropeptide expression</title><p>Our first goal was to confirm the previous findings regarding the effect of chronic cold exposure on energy homeostasis in normal mice. Using a mild, chronic cold-exposure paradigm (14°C for 5 days) and comparing outcomes to mice housed at room temperature (22°C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we found that, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morrison et al., 2014</xref>), core body temperature did not change significantly relative to controls housed at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), presumably owing to an associated increase in heat production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This thermogenic response was accompanied by a proportionate increase in energy intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaiyala et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ravussin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vallerand et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), such that neither body weight nor body fat mass changed significantly over the course of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>).

Despite our use of a mild cold-exposure paradigm, consistent with previous work using more severe cold-exposure paradigms (~4–5°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCarthy et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tang et al., 2009</xref>), we found increased expression of orexigenic <italic>Agrp</italic> and <italic>Npy</italic> mRNA in animals housed at 14°C when compared to controls housed at room temperature, while expression of <italic>Pomc</italic> and <italic>Pmch</italic> remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

Our findings show that, in response to the sudden change in ambient temperature, increases in heat production occurred rapidly, such that the thermogenic response needed to maintain core temperature was detected within 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and remained elevated for the duration of the 24 hr study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

By comparison, neither RQ nor ambulatory activity was affected during cold exposure, suggesting that they are unlikely to play an important role in the adaptive response to this challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Like the increase in heat production, the initial increase in the rate of food consumption was maintained throughout both light and dark cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Based on the rapidity of this feeding response, we infer that it was unlikely to have resulted from any detectable depletion of body fat or associated circulating signal (e.g., leptin).

Our current data suggest that this perspective should be revised.</p><p>Given the well-documented role of AgRP neurons in physiological control of food intake and energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schwartz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Timper and Brüning, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Varela and Horvath, 2012</xref>), we hypothesized that cold-induced hyperphagia is driven at least in part by activation of these neurons. We report that in normal mice, AgRP neurons are rapidly activated by cold exposure and that intact cold-induced hyperphagia requires this activation, since increased food intake in this setting was blocked by acute chemogenetic AgRP neuron silencing. We also show that the magnitude of food intake reduction induced by chemogenetic silencing of these neurons varies inversely with increasing ambient temperature, such that the effect is more pronounced in colder environments relative to thermoneutral conditions in which AgRP neuron activity is lower. Taken together, we conclude that under our experimental conditions (e.g., in the absence of negative energy balance induced, for example, by caloric restriction), the adaptive increase in food intake during acute cold exposure depends upon increases in AgRP neuron activity.</p><p>AgRP neurons are among the most studied hypothalamic neuronal populations involved in energy homeostasis. These GABAergic neurons co-express the potent orexigen neuropeptide Y (NPY) and are found exclusively in the ARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahn et al., 1998</xref>). An adjacent neuronal population expresses pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), and whereas AgRP neuron activation stimulates feeding, POMC-neuron activation has the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schwartz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, AgRP and POMC neurons are reciprocally regulated by leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schwartz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sohn et al., 2013</xref>) and other humoral signals, such that the effect of energy restriction to reduce body fat stores (and plasma leptin levels) causes both activation of AgRP neurons and inhibition of POMC neurons, a combined response that drives feeding until body fat stores and plasma leptin levels return to baseline values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwartz et al., 2017</xref>). These considerations raise the possibility that the feeding response to cold is mounted as a compensatory response triggered by increased thermogenesis, which in turn causes depletion of body fuel stores and associated reduction of adiposity (e.g., falling plasma leptin levels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bing et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Puerta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ricci et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tang et al., 2009</xref>). However, our data suggests that the rapidity with which AgRP neurons are activated in response to cold exposure is unlikely to be explained by this type of negative feedback control. Nevertheless, humoral negative feedback signals could certainly be recruited over time and play a role in sustained feeding responses to a cold challenge, even if they are not relevant to the initial hyperphagic response. Thus, future investigation of the role of hormones in sustaining the hyperphagic state during sustained cold exposure is warranted.</p><p>Recent work has established that in addition to negative feedback regulation by humoral signals relevant to body fuel stores, AgRP neuron activity is also influenced by ‘feed-forward’ signals that promote homeostasis by anticipating future changes to energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen and Knight, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lowell, 2019</xref>). Among relevant feed-forward signals are cues from the environment that anticipate eating (e.g., the sight or smell of food), which are presumably communicated indirectly to AgRP neurons via cortical areas that process the relevant sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Livneh et al., 2017</xref>). How this information is ultimately transmitted to AgRP neurons is unknown, but synaptic relays in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krashes et al., 2014</xref>), dorsomedial nucleus (DMH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garfield et al., 2016</xref>), and pre-optic area (POA) may play a role. The key point is that although food intake driven by AgRP neuron activation is commonly associated with states of negative energy balance and/or falling leptin levels, these neurons can also be activated by sensory-related stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen and Knight, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garfield et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krashes et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>These considerations have relevance to our finding that the activity of AgRP neurons rapidly increases following exposure to a cold environment, and that the activity of these neurons at thermoneutrality is lower. Additional support for this concept stems from recent evidence that AgRP neuron activity is regulated by sensed temperature in neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zimmer et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, exposure of P10 mice to a warm environment rapidly suppresses AgRP neuron activity, whereas pup isolation (with reduced thermal insulation from the nest, dam, and littermates) increases AgRP neuron activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zimmer et al., 2019</xref>). An important distinction from our work, however, is that in neonatal mice, these changes of AgRP neuron activity had no impact on food intake, consistent with previous work suggesting that control of food intake by AgRP neurons does not emerge until weaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gropp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luquet et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Another key finding reported herein is that in adult mice, the time course of increased AgRP neuron activity coincides with cold-induced increases of both energy expenditure and energy intake, and that each of these responses occur quite rapidly. Thus, by commencing continuous monitoring upon placing mice in a pre-cooled cage (rather than waiting for the cage to gradually cool to the desired temperature), we were able to show that the thermogenic response needed to maintain core body temperature for the duration of the study was achieved within 5 min. Even more impressive is that cold-induced hyperphagia had a similarly rapid onset, at least in mice studied during the mid-light cycle, when they are normally inactive and consume only a small percentage of their daily calories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ellacott et al., 2010</xref>). We interpret the rapidity and synchrony with which exposure to a cold environment activates AgRP neurons and engages feeding responses as being consistent with control via a ‘feed-forward’ mechanism, and future studies are warranted to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Our findings further show that chemogenetic inhibition of AgRP neurons selectively blocks cold-induced hyperphagia without impacting cold-induced increases of energy expenditure, RQ or ambulatory activity, suggesting cold-induced AgRP neuron activation is required for the feeding, but not the thermogenic response to this challenge. Initially, these observations seem at odds with published evidence that reduced energy expenditure accompanies hyperphagia induced by chemogenetic activation of AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cavalcanti-de-Albuquerque et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>), by fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cahill et al., 1966</xref>), or by ghrelin administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tschöp et al., 2000</xref>). This arrangement makes sense teleologically given that during fasting, the overarching need of fasted animals is to conserve fuel. In this setting, AgRP neurons are thought to play a pivotal role in both the drive to feed and the suppression of unnecessary fuel utilization, including thermogenesis. Cold exposure, alternatively, reflects a different physiological need state, wherein preservation of core body temperature is paramount, and this cannot be achieved without increased thermogenesis. Given these competing needs, it therefore seems paradoxical that AgRP neuron activation would be an essential component of the adaptive response to both fasting and cold exposure. Adding further complexity is the fact that fasting-associated AgRP neuron activation also inhibits the reproductive axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Padilla et al., 2017</xref>), whereas cold-exposed animals continue to reproduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnett, 1965</xref>).</p><p>One explanation for this seeming paradox is that functionally distinct subsets of AgRP neurons exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sternson and Atasoy, 2014</xref>), with those involved in feeding drive in the cold being distinct from those that control energy expenditure or reproductive function. In support of this hypothesis, our Fos staining shows that cold exposure activates only a subset of AgRP neurons, whereas fasting and ghrelin administration each activate the majority of AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, in the context that our animals were fed ad libitum for our studies, and AgRP neuron responsiveness is known to be influenced by feeding state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), we found that the magnitude of our cold-evoked calcium activity in AgRP neurons is less than what is observed following either fasting or ghrelin administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). These observations collectively support a model in which distinct subpopulations of AgRP neurons, projecting to different downstream brain areas, mediate opposing effects on energy intake and energy expenditure, and that cold exposure activates only the subset that stimulates feeding. Future studies to identify the downstream projection sites and determine the contribution of AgRP, NPY, or the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, to cold-induced feeding responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krashes et al., 2013</xref>) are a priority.</p><p>In conclusion, we report that AgRP neuron activation occurs rapidly during cold exposure, and that this response plays a key role to drive the associated hyperphagic, but not the thermogenic, response to this stimulus. Further, we demonstrate that the contribution made by AgRP neuron activation to food consumption is dependent on ambient temperature, constituting a large fraction of intake during cold exposure while playing a lesser role in a thermoneutral environment. In addition to advancing our understanding of the thermoregulatory system, insights into the neurocircuitry linking thermoregulation to AgRP neuron activity may help to identify novel strategies for obesity treatment by blunting the associated hyperphagic response.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Washington. Mice were individually housed in a temperature-controlled room with either a 12:12 hr or 14:10 hr light:dark cycle under specific pathogen-free conditions and were provided with ad libitum access to water and fed a standard laboratory chow (5001; 13% kcal fat, LabDiet, St. Louis, MO). Adult male C57Bl/6 wild-type mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories, ME, while AgRP-IRES-Cre mice (kindly provided to us by Dr. Streamson Chua, Jr, Albert Einstein College of Medicine) are readily available from Jackson Laboratories, and have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tong et al., 2008</xref>). The AgRP-Cre:GFP knock-in mice (version 2, v2) used in this study were generated by Dr. Richard Palmiter (University of Washington) by replacing the Cre:GFP cassette of the original line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sanz et al., 2015</xref>) with a new cassette designed to have attenuated expression of Cre:GFP. The new cassette differs from the original by: (a) removing the nuclear localization signal from Cre, (b) using a non-optimal initiation codon, (c) removing part of the N-terminal sequence of Cre, and (d) adding a 3’ untranslated region from the Myc gene that promotes a short mRNA half-life. Crossing mice with this new (v2) line with a conditional reporter line of mice (Gt(ROSA)26-LSL-TdTomato, Allen Institute Seattle WA) gives faithful expression only in AgRP neurons, unlike the original line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sanz et al., 2015</xref>) which occasionally resulted in ectopic expression in many parts of the brain. The new targeting construct was electroporated into G4 ES cells (C57Bl/6 × 129/SV) and clones with correct targeting were identified by southern blot of DNA digested with BamH1; 6 of 48 clones analyzed were correctly targeted. Three of these clones were injected into blastocysts from C57Bl/6 mice and one of them gave chimeras with a high percentage of agouti color. Those chimeras were bred with Gt(ROSA)26-FLPer mice to remove the frt-flanked Neo gene. Thereafter, the mice were backcrossed to C57Bl/6 mice for more than six generations before our experiments were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Viral constructs</title><p>Chemogenetic inhibition of AgRP neurons was achieved by microinjection of an AAV containing Cre-dependent cassette for the inhibitory DREADD, AAV1-CAG-DIO-hM4Di-YFP-WPRE-bGHpA (hM4Di: kindly provided by the laboratory of Dr. Larry Zweifel, University of Washington) or mCherry fluorophore control (AAV-hSyn-DIO-mCherry, Addgene, Watertown, MA), into brain areas containing Cre-expressing neurons (e.g., the ARC of AgRP-IRES-Cre mice). Activation of the DREADD receptor was induced by intraperitoneal administration of the agonist, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) (#C0832, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).

Briefly, animals were anesthetized using 1–3% isoflurane, their head shaved, and placed in three-dimensional stereotaxic frame (Kopf 1900, Cartesian Research Inc, CA). For inhibitory DREADD experiments, the skull was exposed with a small incision, and two small holes were drilled for bilateral microinjection (400 nl per side) of the inhibitory DREADD (hM4Di) AAV into the ARC of AgRP-IRES-Cre mice at stereotaxic coordinates based on the Mouse Brain Atlas: A/P: −1.2, M/L: ±0.3, D/V: −5.85 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franklin and Paxinos, 2013</xref>). For fiber photometry experiments, AAV was injected using a unilateral and angled approach (A/P: −1.85, D/V: −6.2, ~12.5° angle from midline). After viral injections, a fiber-optic ferrule (0.48 NA, Ø400 μm core; Doric Lenses, Quebec, Canada) was implanted using the same coordinates. All microinjections were performed using a Hamilton syringe with a 33-gauge needle at a flow rate of 100 nl/min (Micro4 controller, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), followed by a 5 min pause and slow withdrawal. Animals received a perioperative dose of buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.05 mg/kg sc; Reckitt Benckiser, Richmond, VA). After surgery, mice were allowed 3 weeks to recover to maximize virally transduced gene expression and to acclimate animals to handling and experimental paradigms prior to study.

Light was delivered via fiber-coupled LEDs (LED lights: M470F3 and M405FP1, LED driver: DC4104, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) and modulated by a real-time amplifier (RZ5P, Tucker-Davis Technology (TDT), Alachua, FL) at non-divisible frequencies (331 Hz and 231 Hz, respectively) to prevent signal interference between the channels. Excitation lights were bandpass filtered (475 ± 15 nm, 405 ± 5 nm; iFMC4, Doric Lenses, Quebec, QC, Canada) and the combined excitation light delivered through a fiber-optic patch cord (M75L01,Thorlabs) connected to a rotary joint (FRJ, 0.48 NA, Ø400 μm core; Doric Lenses) to prevent fiber-optic torsion during animal movement. A final connector patch cord (MFP, 0.48 NA, Ø400 μm core; Doric Lenses) was connected to the implanted fiber-optic via a ceramic mating sleeve (ADAL1, Thorlabs). Emitted light was collected through the same patch cord, bandpass filtered (525 ± 25 nm; iFMC4) and transduced to digital signals by an integrated photodetector head. Electrical signals were sampled at a rate of 1017.25 Hz and demodulated by the RZ5P real-time processor. Experiments were controlled by Synapse software (TDT).</p><p>Custom MATLAB scripts were developed for analyzing fiber photometry data. The isosbestic 405 nm excitation control signal was subtracted from the 470 nm excitation signal to remove movement artifacts from intracellular calcium-dependent GCaMP6s fluorescence. Baseline drift was evident in the signal due to slow photobleaching artifacts, particularly during the first several minutes of each recording session. A double exponential curve was fit to the raw trace of temperature-ramping experiments while a linear fit was applied to the raw trace of food presentation experiments and subtracted to correct for baseline drift. After baseline correction, dF/F (%) was calculated as individual fluorescence intensity measurements relative to median fluorescence of entire session for 470 nm channel. Averaged dF/F (%) for each temperature (30 or 14°C) were limited to the 10 min period either before or after the 1 min ramp either between the 14°C and 30°C transition or the 30°C and 14°C transition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Measuring determinants of energy balance</title><p>To examine the effect of chronic mild, cold exposure on comprehensive measures of energy homeostasis, mice were acclimated to metabolic cages housed within temperature- and humidity-controlled chambers, and either remained at 22°C or they were exposed to 14°C for 5 days. During this period, continuous measures of energy expenditure, RQ, ambulatory activity, and energy and water intake were recorded, and body composition was determined both before and after the thermogenic challenge.</p><p>To examine the effect of acute changes in ambient temperature on energy intake, wild-type mice (mean BW: 24.59 ± 0.31 g) were acclimated to metabolic cages housed within temperature- and humidity-controlled chambers. One-hour fasted mice were placed directly into metabolic cages housed within environmental chambers that were pre-set overnight at either 22°C or 14°C at 10 AM for 24 hr for continuous measures of energy expenditure, RQ, ambulatory activity, and energy intake. Animals were studied using a randomized crossover design in which housing conditions were separated by at least 72 hr, with each animal serving as its own control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Measuring Fos induction</title><p>To determine whether acute cold exposure induces Fos in AgRP neurons, sated AgRP-Cre:GFP mice were housed in temperature-controlled chambers pre-set overnight at either 22°C, 30°C, or 14°C for 90 min. Although food is typically removed during the period prior to Fos quantitation in this type of study (so as to minimize the impact that variation in food intake can have on the activity of AgRP neurons), we opted not to do so here, based on the concern that cold-exposed mice would experience a state of negative energy balance greater than occurred in controls housed at room temperature (owing to a comparatively greater rate of energy expenditure), and that this might confound data interpretation. Animals were then anesthetized and perfused as described below. Immunostaining for Fos was quantified by imaging at either 10× or 20× on a Leica SP8X confocal system with support from the University of Washington, W.M. Keck Microscopy Center. Images were merged using ImageJ (Fiji, NIH) and threshold adjusted to minimize nonspecific background fluorescence. Fos+ cells were then identified and counted in 35 µm sections obtained serially across the full rostral to caudal axis of the arcuate nucleus using the ‘analyze particles’ feature, such that consistent fluorescence and size thresholds were used throughout, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faber et al., 2018</xref>). For measures of Fos induction in additional thermoregulatory nuclei, two to three sections from each region were counted for each subject.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Measuring AgRP neuron activity</title><p>To assess the impact of cold exposure on AgRP neuron activity, mice were acutely housed on a custom thermal platform. Baseline GCaMP6s fluorescence signals were set to similar levels across animals by adjusting the intensities of the 470 nm and 405 nm LEDs, and a baseline recording was measured for 5 min. For temperature-challenge studies, mice were placed in a small custom-built plexiglass temperature chamber (3’ × 6’ × 6’) that was constructed to enclose a Peltier cooler platform that could be controlled by an external controller (TE Tech, TC720) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2016</xref>). Animals were acclimated on three separate days to tether and Peltier platform. For temperature ramp studies, animals were attached to tether and allowed 2–3 min for photobleaching before photometry recording is initiated. Temperature-ramp studies were designed to test GCaMP6s activity in AgRP neurons when transitioning from 30°C to 14°C or 14°C to 30°C. Animals were held at 30°C for 10 min before transitioning to 14°C for 10 min before returning to 30°C with each temperature ramp repeated twice during a recording session. Transitions between temperatures were all set to 60 s. Experiments were aligned to initial 22°C. As an added positive control, at the end of each study, animals were presented with a food pellet, which led to an expected reduction in AgRP neuron activity.</p><p>Prior to study, mice were acclimated to experimental procedures and AgRP-calcium responses to food presentation in a fast-refeed paradigm was used as a positive control to indicate successfully targeted animals. Briefly, overnight-fasted animals that failed to demonstrate ≥10% reduction in F/F in response to chow presentation were identified as surgical misses and excluded from further study; post hoc IHC validated poor viral expression and/or fiber-optic placement in these animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>DREADD-mediated inhibition of AgRP neurons</title><p>To determine whether activation of AgRP neurons is required for cold-induced hyperphagia, AgRP-IRES-Cre mice (mean BW: 36.10 ± 1.06 g) received a bilateral microinjection of the inhibitory DREADD (hM4Di) or mCherry fluorophore control directed to the ARC. After 3 weeks for recovery from surgery, acclimation to injection/handling, and expression of the transgene, animals were acclimated to environmental chambers to minimize stress. On the day prior to the experiment, animals were returned to their previous home cage and the environmental chambers were allowed 16 hr to come to temperature (30°C, 22°C, or at 14°C). On the experimental day, food was removed at 9 AM and mice received a pretreatment injection of either CNO (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline in a randomized crossover manner. At 10 AM, mice were placed into metabolic cages housed within environmental chambers set at either 30°C, 22°C, or 14°C with continuous measures of energy intake and energy expenditure recorded over a 4 hr period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistics</title><p>Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Significance was established at p&lt;0.05, two-tailed. For statistical comparisons involving core temperature, energy expenditure, ambulatory activity, RQ or energy intake, data obtained during chronic cold exposure (14°C) relative to room temperature (22°C) were reduced into average light and dark photoperiods for each mouse. A group by ambient temperature ANOVA with least significance difference pairwise tests compared mean values between groups. Where applicable, time-series data were analyzed using treatment by time-mixed factorial ANOVA or linear-mixed model analysis controlling for within-subjects correlated data using a random intercept model with treatment and time as fixed effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fitzmaurice et al., 2012</xref>). In studies with multiple comparisons made between two independent groups, two-way ANOVA was applied with Holm-Sidak correction for multiple comparisons, as requested. All post hoc comparisons following one-way ANOVA were determined using Sidak correction for multiple comparisons. A two-sample unpaired Student’s t-test was used for two-group comparisons and a paired t-test for within group comparisons.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Stephen Liberles as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Matthew Carter (Reviewer #2).

Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data. Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study investigates the neural basis of cold-induced hyperphagia.

Cold-induced hyperphagia is apparently not secondary to increased energy expenditure (as one might have expected) but instead seems to involve a neural pathway from temperature-sensing neurons to AGRP neurons, which is surprising and interesting. I do note that the DREADD experiments are a bit of a sledgehammer- any conditions that promote feeding would presumably be impacted by this manipulation, and there does seem to be a trend in 5F which might be significant with greater n, or slightly different experimental conditions (such as using food-restricted mice). The ideal experiment would be to block only the specific AGRP neuron inputs that mediate cold responses but this could be the subject of future exciting work. With the manuscript in its current form, the overall model is convincing, findings represent an important advance, and I support publication as is.

There are only a small number of substantive concerns:</p><p>1) A few comments about statistics and data analysis:</p><p>a) In Figure 1, why are the gene expression results for <italic>Agrp</italic>, <italic>Npy</italic>, <italic>Pomc</italic>, and <italic>Pmch</italic> plotted in different charts if they are representative of similar datasets?

The gold standard control group for a chemogenetic experiment is to inject CNO into animals injected with a non-DREADD transgene (e.g. a fluorescent reporter gene). This control ensures that it is the inhibition of the neurons of interest that mediate the reported effects, rather than CNO itself. Indeed, recent studies have shown that CNO itself does cause off-target effects and is capable of being metabolized by the body [see Gomez et al. (2017) Science; Mahler et al. (2018) Neuropsychopharmacology; Manvich et al. (2018) Scientific Reports]. Therefore, in the key results of Figure 5, the authors cannot state, definitively, that it is inhibition of AgRP neurons that blocks an increase in feeding, as it is possible that the doses of CNO administered (1.0 mg/kg as opposed to the 0.3 mg/kg used in many studies) may block increases in feeding. This point does not necessitate repeating all of the previously performed experiments, but should at least be acknowledged.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a well written and thoughtful manuscript providing evidence for the rapid regulation of the response to cold – one that raises a critical question about the role of compensatory feeding. The authors have done a good job of supporting the claim that the food intake, driven likely by activating AgRP neuron circuits, occurs before a negative energy balance has occurred. I am supportive of this manuscript but have a one main data request that is important and a couple of other questions regarding the context of the paper.</p><p>Main experimental concerns:</p><p>1) All the data are presented as Z scores. This prevents the reader from trying to understand the magnitude of the activity change. For example, in comparison to a ghrelin injection, how much of an increase in AgRP neuron activity is observed? Or could some other metric be used to compare this to other responses seen in the literature?</p><p>This may speak to the heterogeneous AgRP neuron activity response (see below) – as only a subset of neurons are activated. Or it could indicate that the activation is less intense then ghrelin. Either way, letting the reader know this comparison would be a valuable addition to the manuscript that would help frame future studies.</p><p>2) How is the AgRP neuron inhibition quantified? Is the Fos induced by cold completely gone?</p><p>a) This may also speak to why heat production is still intact – what if only half of the AgRP neuron activity was blocked?</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>3) A paradox is presented here in regards to published literature. Krashes et al., 2011 paper shows AgRP neuron activation decreases energy expenditure. Yet, these neurons are activated in the cold as an animal increase its energy expenditure. Discuss of this is warranted.</p><p>4) &quot;Instead, the data are more consistent with a model in which AgRP neuron activation contributes to cold-induced hyperphagia.&quot;</p><p>I understand that <italic>Agrp</italic> and <italic>Npy</italic> expression are upregulated in hunger, but is this tied uniquely to AgRP neuron activation? Has that experiment been done to enhance this hypothesis?</p><p>5) Figure 3A-C is never called out in text.</p><p>6) It is not clear from text/figure that 3F means that ~25% of AGRP neurons have Fos after cold exposure. Is that true? And what does that mean? Especially in light of the photometry data.</p><p>7) What do the authors make of the large number of non AgRP neurons in the arcuate that express Fos? (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><p>8) What is the grey shaded area in Figure 4E?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58764.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a nice and important study, and I support its publication in eLife.

Specifically, exposure of P10 mice to a warm environment rapidly suppresses AgRP neuron activity, whereas pup isolation (with reduced thermal insulation from the nest, dam, and littermates) has the opposite effect. With this said, however, an important distinction is that unlike in adult mice, Zimmer et al. report that “neonatal AgRP neuron activity does not stimulate food intake, suggesting that the role of AgRP neurons in feeding drive develops later in development.” This conclusion is consistent with other work suggesting that an effect of AgRP neuron activation to induce feeding behavior is not evident until after weaning (Gropp, et al., 2005, Luquet, et al., 2005).</p><p>Revised Discussion text: “These considerations have relevance to our finding that the activity of AgRP neurons rapidly increases following exposure to a cold environment, and that the activity of these neurons at thermoneutrality is lower. […] An important distinction from our work, however, is that in neonatal mice, these changes of AgRP-neuron activity had no impact on food intake, consistent with previous work suggesting that control of food intake by AgRP neurons does not emerge until weaning (Gropp et al., 2005; Luquet et al., 2005).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Deem et al. explores the necessity of AgRP neuronal activity in the phenomenon of cold-induced hyperphagia in mice.

The gold standard control group for a chemogenetic experiment is to inject CNO into animals injected with a non-DREADD transgene (e.g. a fluorescent reporter gene). This control ensures that it is the inhibition of the neurons of interest that mediate the reported effects, rather than CNO itself. Indeed, recent studies have shown that CNO itself does cause off-target effects and is capable of being metabolized by the body [see Gomez et al. (2017) Science; Mahler et al.

This point does not necessitate repeating all of the previously performed experiments, but should at least be acknowledged.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for requesting the inclusion of CNO controls for our feeding studies. In response to the reviewer’s request, we performed an additional study in a new cohort of AgRPIRES-Cre mice that received a bilateral injection of a DIO-eYFP control virus directed to the ARC. Mice then received an ip injection of either CNO or its vehicle (saline) in a randomized manner one hour prior to being placed in metabolic cages housed within temperature-controlled chambers previously set to either 14, 22 or 30°C for continuous measures of energy expenditure and energy intake. As expected, following saline administration, both energy expenditure and energy intake varied dose-dependently with ambient temperature, such that both were highest at the coldest temperature (i.e., 14°C), and the same response was observed in mice receiving CNO (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). By excluding an independent effect of CNO on either energy intake or energy expenditure, this finding further strengthens our conclusion that AgRP neuron activation is required for intact feeding responses to cold exposure.</p><p>Revised Results text: “Consistent with this prediction, we found that whereas inhibition of AgRP neurons had little effect on food intake in mice housed at 30°C (Figure 5D), intake was strongly reduced in animals housed at 14°C, while intake was only modestly inhibited by CNO in mice housed at 22°C (Figure 5F and H). […] Moreover, these responses cannot be explained by a nonspecific effect of CNO, as cold-induced increases of food intake and EE in AgRP-IRES-Cre mice expressing a control mCherry fluorophore did not differ following ip injection of CNO vs. saline (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is a well written and thoughtful manuscript providing evidence for the rapid regulation of the response to cold – one that raises a critical question about the role of compensatory feeding.

This is because fiber photometry studies on this neuronal population are typically performed during conditions where the animal is either fasted or calorically restricted, which maximally activates the population resulting in robust and largely uniform signal responses. Indeed, as alluded to by the reviewer, the relative magnitude of the AgRP neuron activity changes in response to ambient temperature (Figure 4) is more subtle relative to fasting or ghrelin administration. This assertion is based on our Fos immunohistochemical data, which shows that only a small subset of AgRP neurons (~25%; Figure 3F) are activated by cold exposure, whereas fasting and peripheral ghrelin administration result in more widespread induction of Fos (Liu et al., 2012, Andrews et al., 2008). This observation, as well reviewer points #3 and #6 below, bears on how best to interpret our findings in the context of relevant literature, and we have taken two key steps in response to these comments. First, we have increased the number of animals in our fiber photometry study, and second, we now present the fiber photometry data as absolute magnitude (dF/F (%)). We are pleased to report that these steps have served to strengthen our interpretation of the data. In addition, we have made revisions in the Materials and methods and Discussion sections.</p><p>Revised Discussion text: “In support of this hypothesis, our Fos staining shows that cold exposure activates only a subset of AgRP neurons, whereas fasting and ghrelin administration each activate the majority of AgRP neurons (Andrews et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2012). Similarly, in the context that our animals were fed ad libitum for our studies, and AgRP neuron responsiveness is known to be influenced by feeding state (Chen et al., 2015), we found that the magnitude of our cold-evoked calcium activity in AgRP neurons is less than what is observed following either fasting or ghrelin administration (Chen et al., 2015).”</p><p>Revised Materials and methods text: “After baseline correction, dF/F (%) was calculated as individual fluorescence intensity measurements relative to median fluorescence of entire session for 470nm channel.

Therefore, to demonstrate our ability to sufficiently inhibit AgRP neurons using DREADDs, we have included additional data showing that in AgRP-IRES-Cre mice that received the inhibitory DREADD virus, a pre-treatment injection of CNO attenuated cold-induced activation of Fos in AgRP neurons relative to saline-treated controls (Saline: 7.2+/-0.1% vs. CNO: 14.9+/-.85%, p = 0.006, unpaired student’s t-test) (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Revised Results text: “To test this hypothesis, we utilized a chemogenetic approach in which AgRP-IRES-Cre mice received bilateral microinjections into the ARC of an AAV construct containing a Cre-dependent cassette encoding the inhibitory designer receptor activated by a designer drug (DREADD), hM4Di:eYFP (Sanford et al., 2017) or a fluorescent reporter control alone (mCherry) (Figure 5A). […] To further validate the ability of the inhibitory DREADD to reduce AgRP neuron responsiveness, we found that pre-treatment injection of CNO in mice expressing the inhibitory DREADD in AgRP neurons attenuated cold-induced induction of Fos in AgRP neurons relative to saline-treated controls (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>3) A paradox is presented here in regards to published literature. Krashes et al., 2011 paper shows AgRP neuron activation decreases energy expenditure. Yet, these neurons are activated in the cold as an animal increase its energy expenditure. Discuss of this is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. Among potential explanations for this paradox is that AgRP neurons are not a homogeneous group and that subsets involved in cold-responsive hyperphagia may be distinct from those controlling energy expenditure. Accordingly, it is possible that during fasting, both subsets are activated, whereas during cold exposure the latter subset is not. This interpretation is consistent with data presented in our manuscript showing that cold exposure activates only a small subset of AgRP neurons (~25%; Figure 3F), whereas fasting appears to activate most if not all AgRP neurons. We therefore interpret our finding that although AgRP neuron silencing prevents cold-induced hyperphagia, it does not prevent the cold-induced increase of EE (in Figure 5I) as evidence that the two responses involve distinct subsets of these neurons. Thus, our data support a model in which thermoregulatory neurocircuits that mount the feeding response to cold exposure are distinct from those that induce thermogenesis, and that the former involves only the feeding-relevant subset of AgRP neurons, and not those capable of suppressing EE. A related point is that physiological and behavioral responses induced by AgRP neuron activation is known to vary depending on the availability of food; during fasting, food is not available by definition, whereas in our studies, food is available ad libitum during cold exposure. We have added text to address this issue (please also refer to point #1 and point #6).</p><p>Revised Discussion text: “Our findings further show that chemogenetic inhibition of AgRP neurons selectively blocks cold-induced hyperphagia without impacting cold-induced increases of energy expenditure, respiratory quotient or ambulatory activity, suggesting cold-induced AgRP neuron activation is required for the feeding, but not the thermogenic response to this challenge. […] Future studies to identify the downstream projection sites and determine the contribution of AgRP, NPY, or the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, to cold-induced feeding responses (Krashes et al., 2013) are a priority.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) &quot;Instead, the data are more consistent with a model in which AgRP neuron activation contributes to cold-induced hyperphagia.&quot;</p><p>I understand that Agrp and Npy expression are upregulated in hunger, but is this tied uniquely to AgRP neuron activation? Has that experiment been done to enhance this hypothesis?</p></disp-quote><p>While our findings demonstrate that activation of AgRP neurons is required for intact feeding responses to cold exposure, whether this effect is mediated via AgRP, NPY, or GABA (each of which can be released from these neurons) remains to be established. With this said, however, previous evidence suggests that whereas release of GABA or NPY is required for the rapid stimulation of feeding, the feeding effects of AgRP (via Mc4r antagonism) occur over a longer period following a delayed onset (Krashes et al., 2013). We agree that future studies are warranted to determine the relative roles of AgRP, NPY, and GABA as mediators of the adaptive hyperphagic response to cold exposure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 3A-C is never called out in text</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the text to correct this omission.</p><p>Edited Results text: “We then quantified the total number of <italic>Agrp</italic>+ (GFP), Fos+, and Fos+/AgRP+ across the entire rostral to caudal ARC (Figure 3A) with representative images from the center of this range presented in Figure 3B. Although the total number of AgRP+ neurons was comparable in all mice tested (Figure 3C), relative to mice maintained at 22°C, we found that both the total number of Fos+ cells in the ARC (Figure 3D) and, specifically, the number of Fos+ AgRP neurons (Figure 3E-F) was increased within 90-min of cold-exposure onset.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is not clear from text/figure that 3F means that ~25% of AGRP neurons have Fos after cold exposure. Is that true? And what does that mean?

As described in both points #1 and #3 above, we interpret the finding that only ~25% of AgRP neurons are Fos+ after cold exposure to suggest that, unlike fasting, cold exposure activates only a subset of AgRP neurons. This interpretation is consistent with our finding that the effect of chemogenetic AgRP neuron inhibition to block cold-induced hyperphagia occurs despite no effect on energy expenditure (Figure 5). Based on these considerations, we hypothesize that while subpopulations of AgRP neurons exist with distinct downstream projection sites that mediate opposing effects on energy intake and energy expenditure, only the subset that stimulates feeding is activated during cold exposure. Future studies to identify and more fully characterize AgRP neuronal subsets and their downstream targets are a priority.</p><p>A predicted consequence of this hypothesis is that the magnitude of activity change in AgRP neurons (as determined using FP) in response to cold exposure will be less than occurs during fasting or other challenges that activate AgRP neurons more broadly, such as ghrelin administration, and our data are consistent with this prediction (Please refer to point #1).</p><p>We have added text to address this issue (Please refer to point #1 and point #3 for revised Discussion text).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) What do the authors make of the large number of non AgRP neurons in the arcuate that express Fos? (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and additional studies are needed to identify these non-AgRP cold-responsive ARC neuronal subsets. Among the populations of the ARC capable of driving feeding are tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-expressing neurons (ARC<sup>TH</sup>) (X Zhang, J Neuro, 2015 and Nat Neuro, 2016). To shed additional light on their possible role in cold-induced hyperphagia, we performed an additional qRT-PCR experiment to test for increases in <italic>Th</italic> expression in the ARC with cold using RNA from the study in Figure 1.
