Here, we show that <italic>Brucella</italic>, the causative agent of brucellosis, the most prevalent bacterial zoonosis globally, subverts this immune defense pathway by activating regulated IRE1α-dependent decay (RIDD) of <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> mRNA encoding BLOS1, a protein that promotes endosome–lysosome fusion. RIDD-deficient cells and mice harboring a RIDD-incompetent variant of IRE1α were resistant to infection. Inactivation of the <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> gene impaired the ability to assemble BLOC-1-related complex (BORC), resulting in differential recruitment of BORC-related lysosome trafficking components, perinuclear trafficking of <italic>Brucella</italic>-containing vacuoles (BCVs), and enhanced susceptibility to infection. The RIDD-resistant <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> variant maintains the integrity of BORC and a higher-level association of BORC-related components that promote centrifugal lysosome trafficking, resulting in enhanced BCV peripheral trafficking and lysosomal destruction, and resistance to infection. These findings demonstrate that host RIDD activity on BLOS1 regulates <italic>Brucella</italic> intracellular parasitism by disrupting BORC-directed lysosomal trafficking. Notably, coronavirus murine hepatitis virus also subverted the RIDD–BLOS1 axis to promote intracellular replication. Our work establishes BLOS1 as a novel immune defense factor whose activity is hijacked by diverse pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group

Differential expression analysis was then performed to identify genes that were downregulated following Bm16M infection of wt-IRE1α cells but were unchanged or upregulated in either infected, drug-treated cells, or infected, m-IRE1α cells. Genes that displayed reduced expression (p &lt; 0.05) in response to infection at 4 and/or 24 h.p.i., and also whose infection-dependent reductions in expression were reversed upon treatment with 4μ8C, or in m-IRE1α cells, were defined as candidate ‘RIDD genes’.

First, we compared our list of candidate RIDD genes to genes previously reported to be subject to RIDD control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bright et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hollien et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">So et al., 2012</xref>). This comparison identified 40 genes that were previously shown to be substrates of IRE1α RNase activity and/or displayed expression patterns consistent with RIDD targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Second, we used real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) to measure the expression levels of several candidate RIDD genes, including <italic>Bloc1s1</italic>, <italic>Cd300lf</italic>, <italic>Diras2</italic>, and <italic>Txnip</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) during infection. We found that the expression of these genes was significantly lower in <italic>Brucella</italic>-infected wt-IRE1α cells than in m-IRE1α cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>). Third, we examined whether similar reductions in expression of candidate RIDD genes were observed in host cells infected with <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19 (BaS19, a vaccine strain) or BaS2308. We found that BaS19 or BaS2308 induced similar phenotypes as Bm16M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>), suggesting that the phenotype was not species specific. To determine whether RIDD-mediated Txnip expression was also regulated by the microRNA miR17, a molecule that affects TXNIP mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lerner et al., 2012</xref>), we measured the expression of miR-17 via qRT-PCR. We found that the expression of miR-17 was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Fourth, we used qRT-PCR to test the hypothesis that heat-killed bacteria induced similar changes in RIDD gene expression. We found that heat-killed bacteria did not cause a similar effect. Hence, the induction of RIDD activity in host cells required interactions with the viable agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3F</xref>) and was also T4SS dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Finally, we found that the expression of the key RIDD gene <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> was also reduced in ∆<italic>Xbp1</italic> BMDMs infected with Bm16M, or when ER stress was induced in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). These data suggested that the observed changes in host gene expression patterns were not a consequence of alterations in XBP1 transcription factor activity. Taken together, these data supported the hypotheses that (1) Bm16M infection induces RIDD activity in host cells and (2) RIDD activity confers enhanced susceptibility to intracellular parasitism by <italic>Brucella</italic>. However, these findings left open the question of the molecular mechanism by which RIDD activity controlled Bm16M replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>RIDD activity on <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> controls <italic>Brucella</italic> intracellular parasitism</title><p>Our RNA-seq analysis identified <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> as a <italic>Brucella</italic>-induced RIDD gene. BLOS1 is a subunit of both the BLOC-1 and BORC complexes and plays diverse roles in cell physiological and biological processes, including endosome–lysosome trafficking and fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guardia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pu et al., 2015</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> regulates microbial infection are largely unknown. This fact encouraged us to test the hypothesis that <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> plays a central role in regulating Bm16M intracellular parasitism. First, we generated a cell line carrying a nonfunctional <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> mutant allele (m<italic>Bloc1s1</italic>). Mammalian BLOS1 contains three conserved XAT hexapeptide-repeat motifs that are essential for acetyltransferase activity and may also be a necessary structure-defining feature for acetyl-CoA contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scott et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2021a</xref>). Using CRISPR/cas9-mediated gene editing, we mutated the first XAT hexapeptide-repeat motif, which in the wild-type encodes ‘EALDVH’, and in the mutant encodes ‘EVVDH or EVDH’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A cell line containing gene encoding Cas9 and a nonspecific gRNA was used as a control of the m<italic>Bloc1s1</italic> mutant line. Second, we generated a RIDD-resistant <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> cell line (henceforth Rr-<italic>Bloc1s1</italic>). In this line, a mutation (from ‘G’ to ‘U’) was introduced into <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> mRNA stem-loop structure (i.e., the target of IRE1α RNase activity) that rendered the mutated <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> mRNA stem-loop structure-resistant cleavage by IRE1α RNase. A <italic>Bloc1s1::Bloc1s1-HA</italic> line that overexpresses <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> (wt-<italic>Bloc1s1</italic>) served as a control of the Rr-<italic>Bloc1s1</italic> cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>We characterized the developed cell lines in several ways. First, we noted that α-tubulin acetylation levels had been reported to be controlled, in part, by BLOS1 activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we monitored α-tubulin acetylation to assess whether our developed cell lines did, in fact, display alterations in BLOS1 activity. We found that m<italic>Bloc1s1</italic> and Rr-<italic>Bloc1s1</italic> cells displayed reduced levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and maintained relatively higher levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), respectively, of acetylated α-tubulin, compared to their corresponding controls. These data supported the hypothesis that these cells had the expected levels of BLOS1 activity. Second, we tested the replication of the pathogen in different <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> cell lines. We found that m<italic>Bloc1s1</italic> cells exhibited increased susceptibility to Bm16M infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), whereas Rr-<italic>Bloc1s1</italic> cells or wild-type controls treated with 4μ8C supported dramatically reduced intracellular bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, we monitored the expression levels of BLOS1 protein during a 48-hr time course of infection. We found that BLOS1 expression was reduced at 16 h.p.i., and continuously decreased during Bm16M infection in wt-IRE1α control cells; however, in m-IRE1α BMDMs, BLOS1 expression was relatively stable or increased (at 48 h.p.i.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

However, the observed subcellular trafficking defect of the pathogen in host cells harboring mutant or deficient variants of IREα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggested that BLOS1 may control the intracellular parasitism of the pathogen by regulating its subcellular trafficking. To illuminate this aspect, we first characterized the m<italic>Bloc1s1</italic>, Rr-<italic>Bloc1s1</italic>, and the corresponding control cell lines by treating them with tunicamycin (Tm, an UPR inducer) or 4μ8C, or infected them with Bm16M. We then assessed the trafficking of the pathogen in these cells using CIM. We found that low levels of BLOS1 or nonfunctional BLOS1 in uninfected or infected cells were associated with the accumulation of late endosome/lysosome (LE/Lys) membranes in the vicinity of nuclei, reduced colocalization of latex beads with cathepsin D, and increased perinuclear LC3b index or autophagic activity near nuclei, in both control and Tm-treated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, C, E, G</xref>). In these studies, the LC3b index was defined as: (Total number of identified cells with the ratio of the mean LC3b intensity in the cytoplasm to that in the nucleus &lt;1)/(Total number of the analyzed cells). In contrast, overexpression of BLOS1 (the wild-type cells expressing wt-<italic>Bloc1s1</italic> or Rr-<italic>Bloc1s1</italic>) reduced LE/Lys perinuclear accumulation, increased the localization of latex beads in cathepsin D<sup>+</sup> compartments, and reduced perinuclear autophagic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B, D, F, H</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we performed protein co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays to measure the association of BORC components with each other in <italic>Brucella-</italic>infected or -uninfected host cells.

Cells undergoing ER stress following treatment with UPR inducers (e.g., thapsingargin, Tm) increase TXNIP protein levels and mRNA stability by reducing levels of the TXNIP destabilizing microRNA, miR-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lerner et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, RIDD might be expected to increase the stability of TXNIP mRNA by attacking the miR-17 that affects TXNIP mRNA stability. However, a recent report demonstrated that in vitro cultivated host cells or mouse tissues infected by BaS2308 display reduced expression levels of TXNIP mRNA and/or protein as well as miR-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with these results, we found that both TXNIP mRNA and miR-17 were destabilized during <italic>Brucella</italic> infection. These findings suggest that the downregulation of TXNIP during <italic>Brucella</italic> infection is miR-17 independent. The functions of other RIDD genes and the mechanisms by which they regulate miRNAs and their targets during <italic>Brucella</italic> infection constitutes an interesting area for further investigation.</p><p>Our findings support a stepwise working model by which <italic>Brucella</italic> subverts the host RIDD pathway to facilitate intracellular parasitism by disrupting BORC-directed lysosomal trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>).</p><p>First, <italic>Brucella</italic> enters host cell via the endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>, right portion). Bacterial infection also induces UPR in host cells, a process associated with activation of IRE1α kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pandey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Taguchi et al., 2015</xref>) and RNase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; this work) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>, step 1). Second, degradation of the RIDD target <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> by IRE1α RNase activity results in depletion of BLOS1 proteins and reduced association with BORC components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>, steps 2 and 3). Third, these events drive the trafficking of BCVs to the ER and their perinuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>, steps 4 and 5), mitigate further fusion of BCVs with cytosolic lysosomes, and limit BCV trafficking to LE/Lys in peripheral regions where these organelles possess enhanced degradative functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>, dash-blue line). Finally, the accumulation of BCVs decorated with ER proteins increases due to the fusion of BCVs with ER membranes and/or with noncanonical macrophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pandey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Starr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Taguchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>, steps 5 and 6). These final events support the intracellular replication of the pathogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence support the proposed mechanism. First, <italic>Brucella</italic> infection activates IRE1α RNase activity as evidenced by <italic>Xbp1</italic> mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, the intracellular replication of the pathogen is not impaired in <italic>Xbp1</italic> KO cells and mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N–P</xref>). These findings support the hypothesis that IRE1α RNase activity is required for <italic>Brucella</italic> infection in an IRE1α-XBP1 independent fashion. Second, in addition to splicing <italic>Xbp1</italic>, IRE1α cleaves other mRNAs, resulting in their RIDD-mediated decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2019</xref>). We identified several mRNAs, including <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>), that contain predicted stem-loop structures that were inferred to be targets of IRE1α RNase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moore and Hollien, 2015</xref>). The expression of these mRNAs was downregulated in response to <italic>Brucella</italic> infection. Host cells harboring nonfunctional <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> mutants were highly susceptible to pathogen infection, whereas cells that express a RIDD-resistant <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> variant were resistant to <italic>Brucella</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>).</p><p>Third, lysosome positioning regulated by BORC is a critical determinant of its functions. BORC associates peripherally with lysosomal membranes, where it recruits the small GTPase ARL8b to lysosomes. BORC and ARL8b promote lysosome movement by coupling to kinesin-1 (KIF5b) or kinesin-3 (KIF1b), which preferentially moves lysosomes on perinuclear tracks enriched in acetylated α-tubulin or on peripheral tracks enriched in tyrosinated α-tubulin, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guardia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pu et al., 2015</xref>). Interference with BORC or other components of this pathway drives lysosome trafficking to the cell center via dynein. Thus, cells lacking BORC display a perinuclear clustering of lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pu et al., 2015</xref>). Ragulator (a GEF for the Rag GTPases that signal amino acid levels to mTORC1) directly interacts with and inhibits BORC functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pu et al., 2017</xref>). Building upon these observations, we show that <italic>Brucella</italic> infection results in <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> degradation and disassembly of BORC; moreover, during <italic>Brucella</italic> intracellular trafficking and replication, colocalization of mTORC1, ARL8b, and KIF1b with BCVs or lysosomes was reduced in control cells, and in cells expressing nonfunctional variants of BLOS1; however, KIF5b localization with BCVs or lysosomes was increased or in a higher level in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Colocalization of the BORC-related lysosome trafficking factors (i.e., ARL8b, KIF1b, and mTORC1) with BCVs or lysosomes in cells expressing Rr-<italic>Bloc1s1</italic> variants were maintained at a relatively higher level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). These findings demonstrate that blocking BORC function via the disassembly of the BORC complex through depletion of <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> by <italic>Brucella</italic> infection drives BCVs toward the perinuclear region and ER accumulation, which likely facilitates the fusion of BCVs with the ER, thereby supporting intracellular parasitism.</p><p>Finally, RIDD-mediated <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> degradation may promote BCV fusion with autophagosomes. Nutrient-starved cells display perinuclear clustering of lysosomes, which influences autophagosome formation and autophagosome–lysosome fusion rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korolchuk et al., 2011</xref>). Lysosome perinuclear clustering during starvation, ER stress induced by accumulation of misfolded proteins, drug treatments, and pathogen infection can disrupt metabolic homeostasis, thereby necessitating the induction of cell biological processes that return the cell to equilibrium. Macroautophagy and degradation of sequestered cytosolic materials by fusion of autophagosomes/macrophagosomes with lysosomes can promote the re-establishment of homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korolchuk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pu et al., 2017</xref>). Degradation of <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> mRNA by IRE1α leads to the perinuclear accumulation of LE/Lys in response to ER stress in mouse cells. Overriding <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> degradation results in ER stress sensitivity and the aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins. The LE/Lys perinuclear-trafficking and LE-associated endocytic transport promote the efficient degradation of these protein aggregates. Therefore, <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> regulation via RIDD facilitates LE-mediated autophagy of protein aggregates, thereby promoting cell survival during stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2019</xref>). Hepatocytes from <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> liver-specific knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DelVecchio et al., 2002</xref>) cells accumulate autolysosomes and lysosomes. In LKO hepatocytes, the initiation or extension of lysosomal tubules is abolished, which impairs autophagic lysosome reformation and results in the accumulation of enlarged autolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2021b</xref>). <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> degradation by the RIDD pathway promotes BCV perinuclear or ER-region clustering and may also avoid the peripheral movement of BCVs away from the ER region as a consequence of reduced α-tubulin acetylation. These processes may facilitate BCV fusion with ER membranes or (macro)phagosomes, promote the enlargement of aBCVs and further bacterial replication, and ultimately relieve <italic>Brucella</italic>-induced ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pandey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Starr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Taguchi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition to <italic>Brucella</italic>, the betacoronavirus MHV also subverts the RIDD–BLOS1 axis to promote intracellular replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H, I</xref>), thereby indicating that RIDD control of BLOS1 activity is not pathogen specific. How the host RIDD<italic>–Bloc1s1</italic> axis regulates interactions between host cells and coronaviruses merits further investigation. However, additional possibilities for regulatory control can be envisioned. First, coronaviruses utilize many proteins such as nsp1 to inhibit host protein synthesis in the first 6 hr of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakagawa and Makino, 2021</xref>). Second, BLOS1 contains a potential coronavirus 3C-like protease cleavage site, LQ^SAPS, near its C-terminus, thereby rendering it potentially susceptible to direct subversion by coronaviral pathogens. Finally, coronaviruses have evolved to subvert host interferon defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thoms et al., 2020</xref>), which may contribute to immune evasion. Future work will be directed toward examining these possibilities and the roles and mechanisms by which the RIDD-<italic>Bloc1s1</italic> axis controls these and other host–pathogen interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All the key resources used in the work are listed in Key resources table used in this work.</p><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Brucella abortus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain 2308</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Maintained by the de Figueiredo lab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">WT strain</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>B. abortus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">S19</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Maintained by the de Figueiredo lab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Smooth vaccine strain</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>B. melitensis</italic>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">16M</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Maintained by the de Figueiredo lab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">WT strain</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>B. melitensis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">16M Δ<italic>VirB2</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Maintained by the de Figueiredo lab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Δ<italic>VirB2</italic> derived from 16M</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>B. melitensis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">16M Δ<italic>VjbR</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Maintained by the de Figueiredo lab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Δ<italic>vjbR</italic> derived from 16M</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Mouse Hepatitis Virus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">A59</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from Leibowitz lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Lentivirus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LLV-LentiGUIDE-Puro-Bloc1s1.1-gRNA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">The de Figueiredo lab;

It has been established that RIDD is able to increase the stability of TXNIP mRNA by attacking the microRNA miR-17 that affects TXNIP mRNA stability (PMID: 22883233). In the absence of IRE1a nuclease activity, it is predicted that miR-17 should be stabilized, which will destabilize TXNIP mRNA. Yet, the authors saw increased TXNIP mRNA levels. It is necessary to determine how such increase occurs (by higher transcription? Is miR-17 involved here?).</p><p>2) Additional clarification/discussion/editing is needed based on the reviewer comments listed below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this work, the authors elucidate a mechanism by which the Brucella-induced UPR supports intracellular bacterial parasitism. Brucella activates IRE1-dependent RIDD, which degrades Blos1 mRNA, encoding a key regulator of lysosomal disposition within the cell. Lysosomal evasion and ER fusion is essential for Brucella replication and Blos1 degradation appears essential for both these events. At the end of the study, they note that IRE1 RNAse activity and Blos1 also seem important for murine hepatitis virus replication.</p><p>The major strengths of this work are the new insights into how Brucella manipulates a host cell process to enhance survival and adaptive trafficking within the cell. Their story is well supported through the use of pharmacologic manipulations, IRE1 RNase conditional mice, a series of Blos1 mutant cell lines (both non-functional and RNase resistant), and immunofluorescence microscopy. Overall, this work adds significantly to our understanding of Brucella intracellular parasitism.</p><p>The greatest weakness is that the story is hard to follow related to confusing wording and insufficiently tight correspondence between figure panels and text. Description of the methods is not always adequate. Section and figure titles do not always go with the subsequent text. Also, the title is misleading and emphasis on diverse pathogen utilization of this mechanism in abstract and discussion (final paragraph!) is disproportionate to the work done. Out of ~90 figure panels (not even including &gt;60 supplemental data panels) only 2 are devoted to MHV. While the MHV data is interesting and suggestive, MHV is an extremely different pathogen with a different lifestyle. The title should reflect the work, which is almost entirely about Brucella.</p><p>More specific issues and suggestions for the authors:</p><p>Figure 1: The LPS stimulation of the bone marrow macrophages is not described in the Figure legend or in the methods. In the text you state the mice (how many?) were infected intra-peritoneally, then in the methods you state they were infected intra-nasally. Please specify which method was used. In Figure 1K, you should show standard CFU rather than the derivative &quot;replication efficiency&quot;. The inset for 1h hpi does not add anything except tiny writing. What is the &quot;inflammation score&quot;?</p><p>P7. Bottom paragraph leaps around in logic: The initial sentence of the paragraph says you will examine trafficking, but then lines 21-24 go to control experiments regarding IRE1 levels and phosphorylation status that should probably have been introduced much earlier in the story. Then the next lines (25-29) are almost an exact replica of lines 24-29 on the previous page.</p><p>P8: you state that in WT, the pathogen transiently traffics through MPR+ compartments, but this is not evident on the confocal image and looks scarcely above 0 upon quantitation. Is it a timing issue?</p><p>P9: This is an example of the inadequate correlation between text and figure. You mention doing real time PCR to look at specific genes (3D-F), but the figures references in the text are &quot;Figure 3A-C; Figure 3-Source dataset 1.&quot; It would help the reader for the figure to be laid out from top to bottom in the order it's described in the text. Also, the title of the Figure 3 &quot;RIDD (regulated IRE1-dependent decay)-BLOS1 axis controls Brucella host cell infection&quot; has nothing to do with Blos control of infection. This Figure is about identification of RIDD targets during infection. Control of infection does not come up until Figure 4.</p><p>There is probably more to the rationale for going after Blos than it being unknown how it regulates microbial infection.</p><p>Suppl Figure 1: There's a western blot showing compete IRE1 KO in the MEFs. This might be confusing for people who may not realize that you're talking about different IRE1 model animals. It would help in the supplemental data to show the western blot of equivalent IRE1 levels in the CKO and WT as well as intact phosphorylation following UPR induction.</p><p>On page 11, It would be helpful to let the reader know that you had characterized the cells before using them (supplemental data) – otherwise the reader hears you are going to assess effects of drug treatment and Blos on trafficking and then suddenly gets information about Cathepsin-beads and LC3. The supplement has a lot of complex data referred to in the main text. It would help the reader to know which panels go with the corresponding description. How is the &quot;perinuclear index&quot; determined? In Figure 4-supplement 3E LAMTOR staining is performed, but it's not described what the significance of this is until later in the text.</p><p>In all the immunofluorescent images, it is very difficult to make out the pink-red co-localization. This is especially difficult for images in Figures 5 and 6. Perhaps arrows could point out peri-nuclear vs peripheral accumulation?</p><p>Sentences that try to put too much information in one, linked with &quot;or&quot; phrases, are difficult to follow. For instance, p12 lines 18-22: &quot;BCV interactions with KIF1b+ or KIF5b+, which preferentially drive lysosomes on peripheral tracks or perinuclear/ER tracks decreased or increased, respectively, in control, mBlos1, and wt-Blos1 cells; however the opposite phenomena were observed in Rr-Blos1 cells. Respectively refers to what? The following 3 conditions?</p><p>Figure 4: It would help to put the quantitation in the same order as the blot. Also, the lanes look like they're incorrectly labelled. For instance, in the wt cells, there's an increase in ac-tubulin density between untreated and 4u8C in the quantitation, but in the western, it looks like there is a lot less. Also, in adding 4u8c to Tm, shouldn't this block RIDD degradation of Blos and bring Ac-Tub back to baseline UT levels? What are the red stars vs blue stars? This should be described in the figure legend text. In 4K, shouldn't the stars above the blue bar at 24h be a different color since it's a different comparison than the pale greenish bars? What is fluorescent integrated density?</p><p>P15. Line 8 you conclude that your work explained events &quot;supporting intracellular replication and cell-cell movement of the pathogen&quot;. I would agree with the replication, but the work does not address the latter at all.</p><p>P16. Line 20: what do you mean by &quot;independent&quot; perinuclear-trafficking?</p><p>Figure 7: Consider putting more labels on the graphs so we can tell which molecule was IP'd. What is the difference between SNAPINd and SNAPINm? Again, it would help to specify what the red stars refer to. In 7I, is the difference between control Blos and 24h infected Blos expression statistically significant? The 6 steps of the cartoon are not described in the legend and text only goes through 4. What is the significance of the dotted lines? What are the blue squiggles in endosomes? Why is some writing in Red?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>By RNAi screenings, de Figueiredo and colleagues in 2008 found that IRE1α, one of the three key regulator of unfold protein response is required for intracellular replication of Brucella spp., but the mechanism underlying such requirement remains mysterious. The current study by the same group went a long way to show that regulated IRE1α-dependent decay (RIDD) mediated by the nuclease activity of IRE1a (not its kinase activity) is responsible for the phenotype. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that the nuclease activity of IRE1a induced by Brucella infection reduces the protein level of BLOS1, thus blocking the delivery of the bacterial phagosome BCV to the lysosome, and promoting its association with the endoplasmic reticulum, a process known to benefit the bacteria. Most of the conclusions were supported by strong results from multiple complementary methods (e.g. conditional KO mice, stable cell lines, etc.) with appropriate controls, and the manuscript is well written and easy to follow.</p><p>p14, line 4. From the described results, non-functional BLOS1 does not directly &quot;promote&quot; the trafficking of the pathogen to the ER. Maybe &quot;permitted&quot; or &quot;allowed&quot; is better.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;<italic>Brucella</italic> activates the host RIDD pathway to subvert BLOS1-directed immune defense&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jos van der Meer (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>As indicated below, Reviewer #2 raises an important point with respect to TNXIP expression during Brucella infection. This will need to be addressed experimentally.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Thank you for responding so carefully to every point raised. The manuscript should be much easier to follow now and more accurate. No further requests.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It is surprising that the authors decided not to perform a quite straight experiment for an important conclusion of the paper. This reviewer simply asked the authors to determine whether under their experimental conditions Brucella infection induced RIDD cleaves miR-17, thus stabilizing mRNA of TXNIP (not asking for the mechanism of the potential difference in response to different ER stress cues). From the results here and published works by others, it seems that there is a mechanism to down regulate TXNIP probably in parallel to up regulation via cleaving miR-17 in cells infected with Brucella. I do not agree with the authors that this experiment is out of the scope of the current manuscript. The revised title and Abstract focus are so RIDD centered, it is necessary to put a nail on this issue by experiments. At the very least, the authors should use a previously luciferase reporter of the TXNIP promoter (PMID: 16301999) to assess how Brucella infection affects the expression. Finally, the paper by Hu et al., showed that miR-17 is NOT involved in the down regulation of TXNIP. The authors used this paper to support their conclusion but yet completely ignored it in their discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73625.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Additional experiments are requested based on this reviewer point: Figure 3D-G, particularly panel G.

Based on the Lerner et al., report (PMID: 22883233), <italic>Brucella</italic> infection should destabilize miR-17, resulting in stabilization of TXNIP mRNA levels. However, recently, Hu and colleagues demonstrated that in vitro cultivated host cells or mouse tissues infected by <italic>B. abortus</italic> S2308 dramatically reduced expression levels of TXNIP mRNA and/or protein (Hu et al., 2020). Consistent with this result, we found that <italic>B. melitensis</italic> 16M (Bm16M) infection increased IRE1α nuclease activity and activated RIDD, resulting in dramatic reductions in the expression levels of TXNIP mRNA. It should be noted that in the absence of IRE1α activity (m-IRE1α) or inhibition of IRE1α nuclease activity (by 4μ8C-treatment), the high expression levels of TXNIP mRNA in Bm16M infected m-IRE1α cells does not result from “increased” TXNIP mRNA levels in these cells (this expression level in fact is the basal expression level of TXNIP mRNA), but rather from the “dramatically decreased” TXNIP mRNA levels in IRE1α harboring cells (wt-IRE1α) infected by Bm16M (Revised Figure 3D-H).</p><p>The viewpoint that “RIDD is able to increase the stability of TXNIP mRNA by attacking the microRNA miR-17 that affects TXNIP mRNA stability” may be true in non-<italic>Brucella</italic>-infected cells (i.e., Mock and Mock + Tm)”. In the case of <italic>Brucella</italic> infection, however, the opposite result is observed in Hu et al., and also in our work. <italic>Brucella</italic> infection activates host cell RIDD activities that destabilizes both miR-17 and TXNIP. We thus infer that <italic>Brucella</italic> may also coordinate the synthesis and/or activities of other factors (e.g., bacterial effectors, host proteins) to control the expression of miR-17 and TXNIP, thereby blunting the programmed death of the infected cells. The outcome benefits <italic>Brucella</italic> intracellular parasitism since increased TXNIP mRNA or protein levels may ultimately result in programed cell death (Lerner et al., 2012). Finally, because (1) the involvement of miR-17 in <italic>Brucella</italic> infection has been proven by Hu and colleagues (Hu et al., 2020), and because (2) the involvement of host or pathogen factors, including miR-17, in the regulation of TXNIP mRNA/protein expression and/or related mechanisms will distract readers from our central story, we believe that additional investigation along these lines are out of scope for this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Additional clarification/discussion/editing is needed based on the reviewer comments listed below.</p></disp-quote><p>Additional clarification/discussion/editing has been performed in our revised manuscript to address this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this work, the authors elucidate a mechanism by which the Brucella-induced UPR supports intracellular bacterial parasitism.

Also, in adding 4u8c to Tm, shouldn't this block RIDD degradation of Blos and bring Ac-Tub back to baseline UT levels? What are the red stars vs blue stars?

The previous blotting images have been replaced by the more convincing ones and the quantitative bar graph has also been rearranged. Regarding the co-treatment of 4μ8C and Tm: Theoretically, co-treatment should bring Ac-Tub back to the baseline level of the untreated sample.

Specifically, the authors demonstrate that the nuclease activity of IRE1a induced by Brucella infection reduces the protein level of BLOS1, thus blocking the delivery of the bacterial phagosome BCV to the lysosome, and promoting its association with the endoplasmic reticulum, a process known to benefit the bacteria.

This reviewer simply asked the authors to determine whether under their experimental conditions Brucella infection induced RIDD cleaves miR-17, thus stabilizing mRNA of TXNIP (not asking for the mechanism of the potential difference in response to different ER stress cues). From the results here and published works by others, it seems that there is a mechanism to down regulate TXNIP probably in parallel to up regulation via cleaving miR-17 in cells infected with Brucella. I do not agree with the authors that this experiment is out of the scope of the current manuscript. The revised title and Abstract focus are so RIDD centered, it is necessary to put a nail on this issue by experiments. At the very least, the authors should use a previously luciferase reporter of the TXNIP promoter (PMID: 16301999) to assess how Brucella infection affects the expression. Finally, the paper by Hu et al., showed that miR-17 is NOT involved in the down regulation of TXNIP. The authors used this paper to support their conclusion but yet completely ignored it in their discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. As per the suggestion, we performed additional experiments to determine whether under our experimental conditions <italic>Brucella</italic>-induced RIDD cleaves miR-17, thus stabilizing mRNA of TXNIP.
