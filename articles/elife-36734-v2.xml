When viral RNA transcripts are detected, type III systems adopt an activated state that licenses DNA interference and synthesis of cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA). cOA activates nucleases and transcription factors that orchestrate the antiviral response. We demonstrate that cOA synthesis is subject to tight temporal control, commencing on target RNA binding, and is deactivated rapidly as target RNA is cleaved and dissociates. Mismatches in the target RNA are well tolerated and still activate the cyclase domain, except when located close to the 3’ end of the target. Phosphorothioate modification reduces target RNA cleavage and stimulates cOA production. The ‘RNA shredding’ activity originally ascribed to type III systems may thus be a reflection of an exquisite mechanism for control of the Cas10 subunit, rather than a direct antiviral defence.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36734.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The gene editing tool often known simply as CRISPR has become well known in recent years. Its potential applications are wide ranging, including uses in research, healthcare and agriculture. Yet, the CRISPR system originated in microbes where it helps to protect them from viral infections. Viruses infect by inserting their own genes into a host cell, and – almost like a pair of scissors – the CRISPR system can cut up the virus’s DNA to stop infections.</p><p>CRISPR experts know the popular form of CRISPR as type II, but there are others. Type III CRISPR is less useful as a genetic tool but does also protect microbes from viruses. In addition to targeting DNA, type III CRISPR targets the related RNA molecules from viruses. When it encounters RNA from a virus, the type III CRISPR produces a small molecule called cyclic oligoadenylate (or cOA for short). The cOA molecule activates enzymes known as non-specific ribonucleases, which can destroy all the RNA in the cell. This defence is a less subtle than that provided type II CRISPR and can also damage the cell by destroying other RNA molecules that the microbes use to survive. As such, proper regulation is essential to prevent the type III system from unnecessarily killing the infected cell.</p><p>Rouillon et al. studied the control of the type III CRISPR system from the heat-loving microbe <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic>, which is found in volcanic springs. This species has been a model for studies of the CRISPR system for many years, in part because its proteins are very stable which makes them easier to work with in the laboratory. The results show that the type III CRISPR makes cOA by combining four molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into a ring. CRISPR responds immediately to viral RNA in the cell. It also detaches from the RNA as soon as it starts to be destroyed. Rapid activation and silencing of the production cOA ensures that the CRISPR system is tightly controlled.</p><p>These findings reveal that cOA production is tightly linked to the abundance of viral RNA, ensuring a proportional and timely response to infection. Using cOA amplifies the cell's response because it allows a single RNA molecule to activate a larger change.</p><p>Type III CRISPR systems are widespread in nature, and a better understanding of them could improve the yield of products, like yoghurt, that depend on healthy bacteria; currently viruses cause a lot of economic damage in this industry. Further research in this area could also lead to new antibiotics that over-activate type III CRISPR to destroy bacterial cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Sulfolobus solfataricus</kwd><kwd>archaea</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>Cas10</kwd><kwd>cyclic oligoadenylate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Challenge grant CH160014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Malcolm F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project grant BB/M000400/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Malcolm F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Generation of the anti-viral second messenger cyclic oligoadenylate by type III CRISPR systems is tightly controlled in response to viral RNA load and sequence.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CRISPR systems provide adaptive immunity in prokaryotes against mobile genetic elements (MGE). DNA sequences derived from MGE are incorporated into the host genome separated by short direct repeats, forming the CRISPR locus. This is transcribed and processed to generate CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) that are loaded into effector complexes, programming them to detect and subsequently destroy the cognate MGE when the cell next encounters one. Class two effector complexes include Cas9, which has seen wide application in genome engineering. Class one complexes are more intricate, multisubunit systems that use a backbone built around Cas7 subunits which binds the crRNA. This backbone subunit is present in multiple copies and is conserved across the Class one effectors, which are further differentiated into type I, III and IV systems (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>]). The type I complexes, typified by Cascade (type I-E) from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, bind target DNA and then recruit the Cas3 enzyme via an interaction with the Cse1 subunit, resulting in Cas3 mediated DNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hochstrasser et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, type III complexes bind invading RNA species, activating several different enzymatic activities present within the complex (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tamulaitis et al., 2017</xref>]). The Cas7-mediated ‘backbone cleavage’ activity degrades bound target RNA with a characteristic 6-nucleotide spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Staals et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tamulaitis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hale et al., 2014</xref>). The HD-nuclease domain of the large Cas10 subunit is responsible for target DNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Elmore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Estrella et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kazlauskiene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Han et al., 2017a</xref>). This is activated when target RNA is bound by the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Samai et al., 2015</xref>), providing a mechanism for transcription-dependent DNA targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Deng et al., 2013</xref>) that allows lysogenic phage to persist in the host chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Goldberg et al., 2014</xref>). Type III CRISPR systems are much more tolerant of mismatches with nucleic acid targets than other types, making viral escape difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pyenson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manica et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Manica et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Most recently a third activity of type III effector complexes has been described. For some time, it was known that many type III system operons encode a protein such as Csm6 or Csx1 that is not part of the effector complex. These genes have been shown to be important for CRISPR-based immunity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Deng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). The proteins have a CARF (CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold) domain linked to a HEPN (higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide binding) domain and have weak ribonuclease activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Niewoehner and Jinek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sheppard et al., 2016</xref>). CARF domains were predicted to bind some form of cyclic nucleotide, perhaps as an allosteric effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lintner et al., 2011</xref>) but the source of the effector was unknown. This puzzle was solved when it was demonstrated that the cyclase domain of Cas10 can synthesise cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) molecules from ATP, when activated by target RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kazlauskiene et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Niewoehner et al., 2017</xref>). cOA species consist of 3 to 6 membered rings of AMP with 3’ and 5’ linkages and have not been observed in any other biological context. cOA in turn binds to and activates Csm6 and Csx1, enhancing their ribonuclease activity. cOA thus represents a new type of second messenger, generated by type III CRISPR effector complexes, that sculpts the cellular response to invasion by MGE (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koonin and Makarova, 2018</xref>]).</p><p>The crenarchaeaon <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> has been a model for studies of the CRISPR-Cas system for many years (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Garrett et al., 2015</xref>]). <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> encodes two type III effector systems: a Cmr (type III-B) complex, which has a unique Cmr7 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), and a Csm (type III-D) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rouillon et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Both have a Cas7 backbone and a large Cas10 subunit with HD and cyclase domains, but they differ in their structural organisation and nuclease activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> Cmr has two distinct target RNA cleavage modes and has not been observed to cleave DNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast the Csm complex has the canonical Cas7-mediated ‘backbone’ target RNA cleavage activity and a DNA nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). The <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> CRISPR system also has six CRISPR-associated CARF-domain proteins of which one is predicted to be HEPN nucleases (Sso1389), two belong to the Csa3-like transcription factor family (Sso1444 and 1445) and three have indeterminate function (Sso1393, 1397 and 2081) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This suggests that <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> can mount a sophisticated and wide-ranging antiviral response through cOA signalling. Large-scale changes in gene expression on viral infection in <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Quax et al., 2013</xref>), which may be at least partly due to cOA signalling. However, to date, cOA synthesis has not been directly demonstrated in any type III system in the archaea. Recently, a HEPN family Csx1 nuclease from the related organism <italic>S. islandicus</italic> was shown to be activated by mRNA with a 3’ polyadenylate tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Han et al., 2017b</xref>), which opens another possible mechanism for activation of this antiviral response, independent of cOA signalling. Furthermore, viral infection induces dormancy in <italic>S. islandicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bautista et al., 2015</xref>), which could be consistent with activation of a cOA-dependent ribonuclease or cOA-dependent changes in transcription.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36734.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The CRISPR locus and cOA signalling proteins in <italic>S. solfataricus.</italic></title><p>The six CRISPR loci (<bold>A-F</bold>) are shown in black.

We describe a new method to generate short oligoadenosine molecules with a 3’-cyclic phosphate moiety and use this to determine that cOA<sub>4</sub> is the relevant activator for Csx1. Activation of cOA synthesis is sensitive to changes at the 3’ end of RNA targets, next to Cas10. The deactivation of cOA synthesis is shown to correlate with backbone cleavage towards the centre of bound target RNA, leading to rapid product release.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>S. solfataricus</italic> Csm generates cOA in response to target RNA binding</title><p>cOA synthesis has so far been observed directly in two bacterial type III systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kazlauskiene et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Niewoehner et al., 2017</xref>). To study the system in the archaeon <italic>S. solfataricus</italic>, we first purified the Csm complex and the CARF nuclease Csx1 (Sso1389) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To determine whether the Csm complex in <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> can synthesise cOA, we incubated Csm with target RNA (A26) in the presence of ATP. Using a radioactively labelled target RNA, we first confirmed that the wild-type Csm complex can bind and cleave the target RNA via ‘backbone-mediated’ cleavage by the Cas7 subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), as demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Three cleavage sites (B1-B3) are clearly visible, and a fourth (B4) is very faint. Targeted mutations that abrogate the active site of the HD domain and cyclase domain (denoted HD and GGDD, respectively) did not affect this backbone cleavage mode. The presence of 1 mM ATP in these reactions also had little effect on activity. Next, we performed the same reactions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> but with unlabelled target RNA, phenol-chloroform extracted the products of reactions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> to deproteinise them and added this solution to a reaction containing purified Csx1 (Sso1389) along with a radioactively labelled RNA substrate (A1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Cleavage of the target RNA by Csx1 at five positions (arrowed) was only observed with products of reactions that had included ATP as well as Csm with a wild-type cyclase domain. The cleavage sites map to C/U dinucleotides for this substrate (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). An active Csm HD domain was not required for stimulation of Csx1. These data suggest that Csx1 is activated by a small molecule that is synthesised by the cyclase domain of Csm when it is incubated with target RNA in the presence of ATP, consistent with an active cOA-signalling pathway in <italic>S. solfataricus</italic>. By carrying out the reaction shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> in the presence of α-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP, followed by separation of reaction products by denaturing gel electrophoresis, we observed synthesis of small radioactive oligomers, dependent on an active Csm cyclase domain, consistent with cOA synthesis by the Csm complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to confirm that the major product corresponded to cOA<sub>4</sub>, with much lower amounts of other cyclic molecules present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36734.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>S. solfataricus</italic> Csm synthesises cOA on target RNA binding, activating the Csx1 nuclease.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Backbone-mediated cleavage of a labelled target RNA.

It is difficult to generate large amounts of cOA of defined ring size by enzymatic means; the type III systems are complex ribonucleoprotein machines, and each generates a mixture of cOA molecules with different ring sizes, often in non-ideal proportions. Linear oligoadenylates can activate CARF-domain nucleases, an effect stimulated by the presence of a cyclic 2’,3’-phosphate terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Niewoehner et al., 2017</xref>). However, standard phosphoramidite synthesis is problematic for small oligonucleotides below six nucleotides in length. In order to generate large quantities of defined signalling species, we have devised a convenient method for the generation of linear polyadenylates with a 2’,3’ cyclic phosphate – a species that has an identical mass to the corresponding cOA.

It follows that the synthesis of cOA should be under tight control. Activation of the cyclase domain of the Csm complex occurs on target RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which presumably initiates a conformational change that activates the cyclase domain. To investigate this further, we tested the activation of cOA synthesis using a variety of oligonucleotide target RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Viral-derived target RNA is naturally mismatched with the CRISPR-derived 5’ handle of the crRNA. When the target RNA is complementary to the 5’ handle of the crRNA sequence, or when the 5 nt mismatched 3’-end of target RNA is missing, backbone cleavage still occurs but the cyclase domain is not activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This confirms previous observations with <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> Csm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kazlauskiene et al., 2017</xref>). We next tested the effect of mismatches by introducing pairs of mismatches at a variety of positions along the target RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Target MM1 and MM2, with two mismatches spanning cleavage site B1 and B2 respectively, abolished backbone cleavage at the mutated position, but cleavage at other sites was still observed. Single mismatches flanking site B1 reduced but did not abolish backbone cleavage at site B1 (MM1a and 1b), whilst the double mismatch adjacent to site B1 (MM0.5) reduced cleavage at that site very significantly, suggesting local perturbation. None of the double mismatches introduced 5’ to site B1 on the target RNA reduced cOA synthesis, showing that they behave very similarly to fully cognate target RNA. In contrast, a double mismatch positioned two nt (MM0.5) or four nt (MM1) from the 3’ end of the matching target RNA resulted in complete abolition of cOA synthesis. Together, these data suggest that Csm is particularly sensitive to disruptions of targets at the 3’ end nearest the Cas10 subunit, whether by truncation, base-pairing with the crRNA 5’-handle, or mismatch (discussed later).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36734.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Effect of mismatched targets on cOA production.</title><p>Oligonucleotides containing mismatches ranging along the length of the target RNA were used to test both backbone cleavage and cOA synthesis activity by Csm.

We therefore quantified the rate of dissociation of cleaved target RNA by carrying out a cleavage reaction over time and running the products in a native gel. RNA remaining bound to Csm was held up in the wells whilst released RNA migrated through the gel. Dissociated, radioactively labelled target RNA cleavage products were trapped by the addition of a cold DNA oligonucleotide of complementary sequence to generate a RNA:DNA heteroduplex that migrated at a defined position in the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).

Given the preponderance of CARF-family proteins associated with type III systems and the conservation of the cyclase domain, this is likely to be a general phenomenon. The major product of cOA synthesis by this complex is cOA<sub>4</sub>, with much smaller amounts of other cyclic and linear oligoadenylates observed. For the <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> system, the generation of cOA<sub>4</sub> fits with the binding pocket modelled for the CARF domain of the transcription factor Csa3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lintner et al., 2011</xref>), and with the observation that OA<sub>4</sub> activates the CARF nuclease Csx1 in the related organism <italic>S. islandicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Han et al., 2017b</xref>). <italic>Enterococcus italicus</italic> Csm generates mostly cOA<sub>6</sub>, and this molecule is the effector for the corresponding Csm6 enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Niewoehner et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, the major product generated by the <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> enzyme is cOA<sub>3</sub>, despite the fact that the corresponding Csm6 protein is activated by cOA<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kazlauskiene et al., 2017</xref>). Given that CARF domains are formed by dimeric subunits, the corresponding activators are likely to have a 2-fold axis of symmetry, which fits with observations that cOA<sub>4</sub> and cOA<sub>6</sub> are both activators of CARF nucleases. In contrast, cOA<sub>3</sub> and cOA<sub>5</sub> lack this symmetry and are unlikely to bind to CARF domains. They may be irrelevant in the context of signalling by type III systems, or alternatively may be activators for families of effector proteins that utilise a different domain for ligand binding.</p><p>To circumvent the difficulty in generating defined activators of CARF domain proteins, we have developed a facile technique that takes advantage of the specificity of the <italic>E. coli</italic> toxin MazF, which cleaves RNA 5’ to an ACA sequence, generating a 3’ cyclic phosphate group. Linear analogues of cOA can be generated with the same mass and charge as the cyclic equivalents in a cost effective and scalable manner and be radioactively labelled if required. This approach could prove particularly useful for smaller molecules such as OA<sub>4</sub>, where phosphoramidite synthesis is problematic.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Activation of cOA synthesis</title><p>Target RNA binding has been shown to activate both the HD nuclease and cOA synthesis activities of diverse type III systems. This is likely to result from conformational changes in the complex, and the Cas10 subunit in particular. A 5° rotation of the Cas10 subunit on target RNA binding has been observed for <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> Cmr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>), which may reflect this activation. We observe that the activation of cOA synthesis is rapid, with activity detected within the first minute of incubation of Csm with target RNA transcripts. As for <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> Csm, activation requires a 3’ extension to the target RNA that does not base-pair with the 5’-handle of the crRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kazlauskiene et al., 2017</xref>]). In our standard oligonucleotide substrates there is a 5 nt 3’- overhang, which fits the minimum requirement predicted from the biochemical and modelling study of the Siksnys group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kazlauskiene et al., 2016</xref>). This short stretch of RNA presumably interacts with the Cas10 and/or the Csm4 subunit in such a way that a conformational change occurs in this region of the complex, resulting in the activation of both the HD nuclease and GGDD cyclase active sites, paving the way for DNA degradation and, through cOA signalling, the activation of HEPN family ribonucleases.</p><p>As observed for other type III systems, there is a high degree of tolerance for mismatches in target RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pyenson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manica et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goldberg et al., 2018</xref>), which all tend to be cleaved, and thus removed from the enzyme. By extending this analysis to examine cOA synthesis, we observe that 2 nt mismatches 5’ to site B1 do activate the cyclase domain and would thus elicit a full anti-viral response. However, the target RNAs with a double mismatch at or 3’ to site B1 (corresponding to positions within 4–5 nt of the 3’ end of target RNA base-paired with the crRNA), whilst still cleaved, did not activate cOA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests an important role for the 3’ end of the bound target RNA close to the Cas10 subunit where sequence requirements are more stringent. Presumably, destabilization of the RNA duplex in this region can lead to changes in the conformation of the single-stranded 3’ end of the target RNA, resulting in failure to activate the cyclase domain. Viral targets that manage to mutate in this key area may thus have more chance of escaping from cOA-mediated HEPN nuclease activation, which is a key determinant of type III CRISPR immunity. In contrast, substantial blocks of mismatches in this general area do not prevent phage targeting by the <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> type III-A system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pyenson et al., 2017</xref>). This could be due to differences between the activation of the cyclase and HD nuclease domains of Cas10, or to differences between type III-A and III-D systems and deserves further analysis.</p><p>The degree of specificity of the HEPN family nucleases against viral targets is still a matter for conjecture. The Marraffini group report that Csm6 selectively targets phage transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>), and the spatial coupling of the HD nuclease activity of Cas10 to actively transcribing viral RNA targets could ensure at least partial selectivity for foreign nucleic acids. Nonetheless, it seems likely that host nucleic acids would be caught in the cross-fire of this ‘scorched earth’ attack, leading to a shutdown in host gene expression or even cell death – which, as pointed out previously, could be a sensible option if viral infection is established in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Elmore et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, viral infection has been shown to result in dormancy and cell death <italic>in S. islandicus</italic>, which harbours a type III CRISPR system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bautista et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Switching off cOA synthesis</title><p>The activation of the HD nuclease and cyclase domains of Cas10 as a result of target RNA binding is not an irreversible event. Logically, it could be predicted that these domains are deactivated either when target RNA is cleaved, or when it dissociates from the complex, with a time lag possible in either circumstance. Backbone cleavage of RNA was the first activity detected in type III CRISPR systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hale et al., 2009</xref>), and appears to be ubiquitous. Nonetheless, this activity is not essential for type III-mediated immunity against phage infection in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Samai et al., 2015</xref>). Terns and colleagues suggested that target RNA cleavage may represent a means for deactivation of the DNA nuclease activity of type III systems, as cleavage of the RNA transcript would cause the type III effector to ‘drift away’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Elmore et al., 2016</xref>). Rather than spatial separation though, it seems more likely that target RNA cleavage and subsequent dissociation allows a collapse back to an inactive ground state of Cas10, switching off the highly potent HD nuclease and cOA signalling activities.</p><p>The Csm (III-A) complex from <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> and <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> also appear to cut target RNA first at the 3’ end nearest the Cas10 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Staals et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tamulaitis et al., 2014</xref>), and cleavage by <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> Csm is rapid – of the order of 5 s under single turnover conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kazlauskiene et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Thermatoga maritima</italic> Cmr (III-B) cleaves target RNA with six nt spacing at four sites, with cleavage fastest at site 2, which is 11 nt from the 3’ end of the target RNA. Cleavage is rapid under single turnover conditions, reaching completion within 1 min for site 2 and 5 min for site 4, which is 23 nt from the 3’ end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Estrella et al., 2016</xref>). The rate of product release has not previously been quantified in any system. For <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> Csm, multiple turnover kinetic experiments suggested that product dissociation, whilst rate limiting, was moderately fast (k = 3 min<sup>−1</sup>). However, activation of the DNase activity of the HD domain persisted over a much longer timescale, 30–60 min. The authors suggested that the activated state of <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> Csm persists after target RNA dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kazlauskiene et al., 2016</xref>), but an alternative is that there is heterogeneity in the population of Csm enzymes, with some remaining bound to RNA targets and hence preserved in an active state for much longer periods than others. For <italic>T. maritima</italic> Cmr, cleaved target RNA dissociation also correlated with the deactivation of the HD nuclease domain, although the rates were not measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Estrella et al., 2016</xref>). Many of these uncertainties arise from the difficulty inherent in quantifying nuclease activity in these systems.</p><p>To delineate the roles of backbone cleavage and RNA dissociation in the control of cOA synthesis, we carried out a detailed kinetic analysis, quantifying the rates of target RNA cleavage and subsequent dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). We observed comparatively rapid cleavage at sites B1 (0.19 min<sup>−1</sup>) and B2 (0.08 min<sup>−1</sup>), nearest to the 3’ end of the target RNA and proximal to the Cas10 subunit, and much slower cleavage of more distal sites. The trend for faster cleavage at the 3’ end is clear from studies of other type III systems. The overall cleavage rate of a transcript RNA, which is a more physiologically relevant target, was very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The introduction of phosphorothioate linkages spanning sites B1 and B2 reduced but did not abolish target RNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and we noted a highly significant increase in cOA production with these substrates, consistent with a link between target RNA cleavage and cOA synthesis. By trapping the dissociated RNA we could quantify the rate of product release directly for the first time for a type III system. We determined a rate of 0.07 min<sup>−1</sup> for dissociation of the 5’ end of the target RNA – a very close match to the rate of cleavage at site B2 in the centre of the RNA. Furthermore, the decrease in the rate of cOA synthesis by activated Csm over time also fitted an exponential with a rate of 0.05 min<sup>−1</sup>, ten times faster than the rate of cleavage at site B3. Thus, it appears that full target RNA digestion may not be required for product release.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36734.021</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Kinetic scheme for activation and inactivation of cOA production.</title><p>In its ground state, Csm adopts a conformation where the HD nuclease and cyclase domains are inactive.

Cleaved RNA dissociation is observed with an off rate of 0.07 min<sup>−1</sup>, suggesting it may be rate limited by cleavage at site B2 and does not require cleavage at site B3. The production of cOA is quickly switched off, consistent with a rapid return to the inactive ground state.

Rather, the chemical step of RNA cleavage determines the rate of product release. As our assays were carried out at 70°C, close to the growth temperature of <italic>S. solfataricus</italic>, RNA duplexes of around 20 bp would be only marginally stable in the absence of stabilising protein interactions. This fits the situation in <italic>S. islandicus</italic>, where target RNA forming less than 20 bp with the crRNA was observed to dissociate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Han et al., 2017a</xref>). It is also consistent with the general observation for type III systems that target RNA cleavage products tend to accumulate under single turnover conditions rather than undergoing processive cleavage to the smallest possible products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Staals et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tamulaitis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hale et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Han et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, RNA cleavage and dissociation results in the simultaneous deactivation of the cyclase domain, presumably due to rapid conformational change to the ground state. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that target RNA cleavage (and therefore dissociation) in type III systems functions as an ‘off switch’ for the cyclase and HD nuclease active sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Estrella et al., 2016</xref>). This, rather than the protective effect of direct degradation of viral transcripts, may be the primary role of target RNA cleavage. After all, a single target RNA may trigger synthesis of many molecules of cOA, which in turn would activate multiple HEPN ribonucleases for active RNA degradation – a potent amplification of antiviral defences. Under multiple turnover conditions that may be more reflective of a high viral load in the cell, the cyclase domain is activated for longer periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). RNA substrates that are not <italic>bona fide</italic> targets are still cleaved and thus cleared from the binding site, but do not activate cOA synthesis, allowing the Csm complex to seek other targets.</p><p>Several studies have reported that the HD nuclease activity of type III systems persists up to 1 hr, despite target RNA cleavage reaching completion within a few minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tamulaitis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Estrella et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kazlauskiene et al., 2016</xref>). This raises the possibility that the HD nuclease and cyclase domains experience different half-lives in the activated state, with the former persisting for much longer. It could make sense to switch off the cyclase activity quickly, as the resultant cOA would provide a much more persistent activation of CARF-family nucleases and transcription factors. A systematic study of the temporal control of HD nuclease activity is required to resolve this question. Ultimately, the removal of the cOA second messenger by an as-yet unidentified phosphodiesterase is likely to play an important part in the control of type III systems. This should be a priority for future study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic>)</td><td>Csm complex (eight subunits)</td><td>PMID: 24119402</td><td/><td>virus expression construct</td></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic>)</td><td>Csx1/Sso1389</td><td>this paper</td><td valign="bottom">UniProtKB - Q97YD5</td><td>plasmid expression construct</td></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Eschericia coli</italic>)</td><td>MazEF</td><td>PMID: 22447587</td><td valign="bottom"/><td>plasmid expression construct</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Csm complex expression and purification</title><p>The Csm (III-D) complex (wild-type, HD and GGDD variants) was expressed and purified from <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).

In the case of the spiking experiment, <sup>32</sup>P-α-ATP was added to a final concentration of 2 nM in the reaction (at 0, 20 or 40 min). The quantification of free <sup>32</sup>P-α-ATP versus <sup>32</sup>P-α-ATP incorporated in cOA allowed determination of a total ATP ratio used in cyclase reaction that is lower than 10% (50 µM) for the longest time points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Generation of active MazF and linear oligoadenylates</title><p>MazF was used to generate linear oligoadenylate. Active MazF was initially obtained by incubating 1 mg of MazEF with 0.1 units Factor X (Sigma-Aldrich) activated in FXa buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 1 mM DTT for 3 hr at 37°C. MazEF digestion with bovine trypsin (Promega) (1600:1 ratio) was found to yield a similar level of active MazF when incubated in the same buffer for 15 min. Therefore, MazF was predominantly generated by trypsin digestion and used immediately. Linear oligoadenylate was generated by incubating MazF with 30 µM A3, A4, A5 or A6 RNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) in FXa buffer for 2.5 hr at 37°C. Products were phenol-chloroform extracted, and then chloroform extracted and frozen at −20°C. Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20% acrylamide, 7M urea and 1x TBE) followed by phosphorimaging of MazF-cleaved <sup>32</sup>P end-labelled A3, A4, A5 and A6 RNA was used to assess successful generation of intended linear OA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Csx1 activation assay</title><p>Csx1 and Csx1 H345N mutant were diluted in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA. 250 nM of Csx1 dimer was incubated with 0.01% (v/v) cOA activator or 3 µM linear oligoadenylate (A3, A4, A5 or A6) and 50 nM <sup>32</sup>P-5’-labelled substrate RNA in Csx1 buffer containing 20 mM MES pH 5.5, 100 mM K-glutamate and 1 mM DTT. Two control reactions, both containing only 50 nM RNA and buffer were incubated at 4°C or 50°C, respectively. All other reactions were incubated at 50°C and quenched at 5, 15 or 30 min by the addition of a reaction volume equivalent of 100% formamide prior to freezing at −20°C. RNA cleavage by Csx1 was visualised by phosphorimaging following denaturing gel electrophoresis. Csx1 is stable and active at 70°C, but the choice of 50°C reduced background substrate RNA cleavage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis was performed on a Thermo Scientific Velos Pro instrument equipped with HESI source and Dionex UltiMate 3000 chromatography system. Compounds were separated on a Kinetex 2.6 µm EVO C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, Phenomenex) using a linear gradient of 2–15% acetonitrile against 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8 (gradient start delay 5 min, gradient length 28 min) at a flow rate of 350 µl min<sup>−1</sup> and column temperature of 40°C. Data were acquired on the FT mass analyzer in negative ion mode with scan range <italic>m/z</italic> 150–1500. Source voltage was set to 3.5 kV, capillary temperature was 350°C, and source heater temperature was 250°C.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Prof Masayori Inouye for the kind provision of the expression plasmid for <italic>E. coli</italic> MazEF, and Prof Virgis Siksnys for provision of a sample of cyclic oligoadenylate used for our preliminary screening.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz serving both as Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Erik Sontheimer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this article, the authors biochemically characterize the synthesis of cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) by the Csm complex from a type III-D CRISPR-Cas system in <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic>. This activity has been studied previously in bacterial type III-A systems, but not in archaea, and not in type III-D. The authors purified the Csm complex, validated its nuclease activity, and showed that the cyclic oligoadenylates (cOAs) generated by the Cas10 subunit of Csm activate Csx1's ssRNA nuclease activity. As expected, their biochemical assays show that the production of cOA (mostly the tetramer) is induced upon target RNA binding to Csm. They further demonstrate that product release by the Csm complex is correlated with the inactivation of the cyclase activity of Cas10, possibly through conformational changes. Their creative method in using a bacterial toxin (MazF) to generate cOA species can be used by other researchers interested in studying cOA-related pathways. For the most part, the biochemistry is nicely done. There are relatively few unexpected findings here in light of what has been shown elsewhere, but nonetheless, work of this nature is important to advance our mechanistic view of type III CRISPR interference.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The study would be strengthened if the authors addressed the following points.</p><p>The first is experimental:</p><p>The authors posit a model in which RNA cleavage and subsequent product release deactivate cOA synthesis, and several lines of evidence (mainly correlated rates) support this. However, a key prediction is that <italic>blocking</italic> the cleavage of bound RNAs should slow product release and lead to nearly constitutive cOA synthesis. This key prediction was not tested even though it would add considerable strength to the conclusion. Such blockage could be achieved by mutating the Csm4 active site, or by using a target RNA that carries chemical modifications (perhaps 2'-O-methyl residues and/or phosphorothioates on both sides of the cleavage sites) that prevent hydrolysis. The latter would require the demonstration that such modified targets are still bound by the crRNA-loaded complex, but this should not be difficult (if the answer is yes).</p><p>The rest require rewording or further explanation:</p><p>- The authors state (including in the Abstract) that RNA shredding is likely to be important for cOA synthesis deactivation rather than direct antiviral defense. It is not clear why this needs to be framed as an either/or – why could both not be true?</p><p>- Figure 6: The rate constant measurement for k<sub>B1</sub> and k<sub>B2</sub> maybe problematic here. The authors need to provide a detailed description of how the rate constants were calculated. For example, B1 bands accumulated by cleavage at B1 position, but also diminish upon B2 cleavage.</p><p>- How did the authors reach the conclusion that &quot;cleavage up to the centre of the target RNA (site B2) appears sufficient to allow product dissociation&quot;? What is the identity of RNA 5' end + trap DNA in Figure 8A? Can you provide a B2RNA + trap DNA marker?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36734.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The study would be strengthened if the authors addressed the following points.</p><p>The first is experimental:</p><p>The authors posit a model in which RNA cleavage and subsequent product release deactivate cOA synthesis, and several lines of evidence (mainly correlated rates) support this.

We showed previously that we cannot inactivate the type III-D Csm system backbone cleavage by mutagenesis (Zhang et al., 2016). Accordingly, we designed a target RNA oligonucleotide with two sets of three phosphorothioate linkages spanning cleavage sites B1 and B2. This RNA target is cleaved significantly more slowly than the unmodified RNA and results in the synthesis of 4-fold higher levels of cOA. There is a particular reduction in cleavage at site B2, which fits with the idea that cleavage up to site B2 is important for product release. A new figure 8 and accompanying text have been added. We agree this strengthens the paper considerably.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The rest require rewording or further explanation:</p><p>- The authors state (including in the Abstract) that RNA shredding is likely to be important for cOA synthesis deactivation rather than direct antiviral defense.

In the Abstract, we altered this sentence to say that “RNA shredding […] <italic>may thus be</italic> a reflection”.</p><p>In the discussion, we rephrased the relevant section to read:</p><p>“These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that target RNA cleavage (and therefore dissociation) by type III systems functions as an “off switch” for the cyclase and HD nuclease active sites (Estrella, Kuo and Bailey, 2016). This, rather than the protective effect of direct degradation of viral transcripts, may be the primary role of target RNA cleavage.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 6: The rate constant measurement for k<sub>B1</sub> and k<sub>B2</sub> maybe problematic here. The authors need to provide a detailed description of how the rate constants were calculated. For example, B1 bands accumulated by cleavage at B1 position, but also diminish upon B2 cleavage.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. Although interconversion of B1 bands to B2 products is limited, we do see a slight decrease in B1 at later time points. The effect is limited, partly because not all the product is cleaved, but also seems to be a general property of these enzymes, as discussed in the Discussion in this section:</p><p>“It is also consistent with the general observation for type III systems that target RNA cleavage products tend to accumulate under single turnover conditions rather than undergoing processive cleavage to the smallest possible products (Staals et al., 2014; Tamulaitis et al., 2014; Hale et al., 2014; Liu and Naismith, 2009).”</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree with the referee that there could be a danger of underestimating the rate of B1 cleavage to some extent due to limited conversion to B2 products. We have therefore determined the rate constants for B1 and B2 cleavage from the early time points and have added the following sentence to the Materials and methods:</p><p>“For the transcript cleavage, a single experiment was quantified, but replicates were qualitatively similar. […] This appears to be a minor effect however (see Discussion).”</p><p>We have added further detail and appropriate citations for the methods used to calculate all rate constants:</p><p>“For kinetic analysis, cleaved and uncleaved species were quantified using the Bio-Formats plugin (Linkert et al., 2010) of ImageJ (Schneider, Rasband and Eliceiri, 2012) as distributed in the Fiji package (Schindelin et al., 2012) and fitted to a single exponential curve using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software), as described previously (Sternberg, Haurwitz and Doudna, 2012).”</p><p>As we switched to this software package, which is optimised for the accurate quantification of phosphorimages, we recalculated all rates. This has resulted in small changes to the absolute rates as noted, but no changes to the overall interpretation of the data and conclusions drawn.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- How did the authors reach the conclusion that &quot;cleavage up to the centre of the target RNA (site B2) appears sufficient to allow product dissociation&quot;? What is the identity of RNA 5' end + trap DNA in Figure 8A? Can you provide a B2RNA + trap DNA marker?</p></disp-quote><p>As the referee points out, an important control was missing. We have provided an additional control by synthesising a synthetic RNA oligonucleotide (Target RNA B2 product) and demonstrating that, when hybridised to the DNA trapper, the heteroduplex runs at the same place in the gel as the main trapped product. This is now shown in Figure 9—figure supplement 1 (which was originally Figure 8).</p></body></sub-article></article>
