trafficking events. Membrane contact sites serve as platforms for direct lipid exchange and calcium fluxes between two organelles. Here, we show that VAPA, an ER transmembrane contact site tether, plays a crucial role during cell motility. CaCo2 adenocarcinoma epithelial cells depleted for VAPA exhibit several collective and individual motility defects, disorganized actin cytoskeleton and altered protrusive activity. During migration, VAPA is required for the maintenance of PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 levels at the plasma membrane, but not for PI(4)P homeostasis in the Golgi and endosomal compartments. Importantly, we show that VAPA regulates the dynamics of focal adhesions (FA) through its MSP domain, is essential to stabilize and anchor ventral ER-PM contact sites to FA, and mediates microtubule-dependent FA disassembly. To conclude, our results reveal unknown functions for VAPA-mediated membrane contact sites during cell motility and provide a dynamic picture of ER-PM contact sites connection with FA mediated by VAPA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>membrane contact sites</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>lipid trafficking</kwd><kwd>phosphoinositides</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Gefluc Les Entreprises contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heuzé</surname><given-names>Mélina L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006431</institution-id><institution>Canceropôle Ile de France and INCa</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-1-EMERG-51</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heuzé</surname><given-names>Mélina L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>La Ligue contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RS23/75-66</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heuzé</surname><given-names>Mélina L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Université Paris Cité</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Labex Who am I ?, ANR-11-LABX-0071, Idex ANR-11-IDEX-0005-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heuzé</surname><given-names>Mélina L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-20-CE13-0021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verbavatz</surname><given-names>Jean-Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>La Ligue contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siegfried</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>La Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4th year fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siegfried</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Depletion of VAPA in cancer cells induces defects in actin organization, adhesion dynamics and cell migration, together with a perturbation of phosphoinositide levels at the plasma membrane and a lack of anchoring of ER-PM contact sites to focal adhesions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lipid identity of membrane compartments is highly regulated within cells and plays a key role in a diversity of cellular processes. During cell motility, lipids, in particular Phosphoinositides (PInst), are local determinants of molecular events leading to cell polarization, the formation of actin-driven protrusions and turnover of focal adhesions (FA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammond and Burke, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsujita and Itoh, 2015</xref>). PI(4,5)P2, the most abundant PInst at the plasma membrane, controls FA dynamics by regulating the binding of talin to integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thapa et al., 2012</xref>) and the polarized trafficking of integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nader et al., 2016</xref>). PI(4,5)P2 is described as a modulator of actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamics, either directly through the recruitment of several actin-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Senju et al., 2017</xref>), or indirectly by regulating the activation of RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lacalle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2010</xref>) and Cdc42 GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daste et al., 2017</xref>). The product of PI(4,5)P2 phosphorylation, PI(3,4,5)P3, also plays a crucial role in cell motility at the plasma membrane (PM). Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that PI(3,4,5)P3 acts as a ‘compass lipid’ that stabilizes the direction of migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Funamoto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hannigan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lam et al., 2012</xref>) through the activation of Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kunisaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Welch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yoshii et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Membrane lipids are transported through vesicular transport, but also through non-vesicular transport at so-named membrane contact sites (MCS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>). MCS are sites of close apposition between two membranes, often the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and the membrane of another organelle, at a distance of less than 80 nm, where exchanges of lipids, Ca2 +and metabolites take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prinz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scorrano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). While the activity of lipid transfer at MCS was observed decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vance, 1990</xref>), their implication in patho-physiological processes such as cell motility has gained interest only recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prinz et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we studied the role of VAPA, a tethering protein at ER-mediated MCS during cell motility. VAPA is a member of the highly conserved VAP family of proteins, together with VAPB. VAP proteins are integral ER membrane proteins bridging the ER membrane to the membrane of other compartments by assembling with numerous partners including lipid transfer proteins that bind the target membrane, such as Nir proteins and OSBP-related (ORP) proteins. The assembly of most of VAP complexes relies on the interaction between the conserved N-terminal MSP (Major Sperm Protein) domain of VAPs and the FFAT (2 phenyl alanines in an acidic tract) motif on their partner. VAPs also contain a central coiled-coil dimerization domain and an ER transmembrane domain in their C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murphy and Levine, 2016</xref>). VAP proteins are involved in several cellular functions such as lipid transport, membrane trafficking, the unfolded protein response pathway and microtubules organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamemura and Chihara, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lev et al., 2008</xref>). VAP complexes with lipid transfer proteins control the homeostasis of PInst and sterols at various intracellular locations. At ER-PM contact sites, the VAP/Nir2 and VAP/ORP3 complexes regulate the transport of Phosphoinositol (PI) and PI(4)P respectively. Together with membrane-associated kinases and phosphatases, they contribute to modulating locally the pool of PI(4)P, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 at the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang and Liou, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gulyás et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the association of VAPs with OSBP-related proteins modifies the level of PI(4)P at endosomal membranes and at the Golgi, therefore regulating trafficking events in these two compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kawasaki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mesmin et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, VAP proteins mediate cholesterol transport at ER-Golgi, ER-endosome and ER-peroxisome MCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hua et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mesmin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilhelm et al., 2017</xref>). Depending on the cell type and organism, the loss of VAP proteins can lead to either a reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peretti et al., 2008</xref>) or an accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wakana et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Subra et al., 2023</xref>) of PI(4)P levels in the Golgi membranes and its redistribution on endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2016</xref>). In yeast, depleting VAP orthologs results in the accumulation of PI(4)P at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stefan et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, these observations prompted us to hypothesize that VAPs, by regulating PInst homeostasis, could contribute to cell motility processes. Importantly, two partners of VAPs at ER-PM contact sites, ORP3 and Nir2, have been shown to regulate cell motility processes through different pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D’Souza et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keinan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lehto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weber-Boyvat et al., 2015</xref>). As a first-line approach, we decided to investigate the effects of VAPA depletion alone on the motility of human adenocarcinoma Caco2 cells. We observed strong motility defects, suggesting that VAPA is required for proper cell motility and that VAPB is not sufficient to compensate for the loss of VAPA. We then aimed to understand the precise function of VAPA in this process. Here, we show that the depletion of VAPA strongly impacts the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, the dynamics of protrusions and the turnover of FA during migration. The role of VAPA stands mainly at the PM where it regulates PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 homeostasis, the stability of ER-PM contact sites and their local anchoring at FA, thereby regulating FA disassembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>VAPA is required for proper cell migration and cell spreading</title><p>To assess the role of VAPA during cell motility, we generated, using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, stable Caco-2 cells either depleted for VAPA (VAPA KO), or expressing non-targeting sequences (Control). VAPA KO cells exhibited a complete and specific depletion of VAPA protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). In VAPA KO cells, VAPB was well distributed throughout the ER and its levels were slightly increased, albeit non significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We first assessed the capacity of VAPA KO and Control monolayers to migrate collectively upon space release on fibronectin-coated glass. In order to avoid any proliferation bias, we treated the cells with mitomycin. In these conditions, VAPA KO monolayers filled the open space less efficiently than Control monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The analysis of leader cells trajectories revealed that VAPA KO leader cells were displacing faster but with a remarkable lack of directionality compared to Control leader cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>), which could account for the slower colonization capacity VAPA KO monolayers. This collective migration impairment was at least partially cell-intrinsic, as single VAPA KO cells displacing on a 2D surface exhibited identical defects compared to VAPA KO leader cells in monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref>). Moreover, upon plating, VAPA KO cells were spreading much faster than Control cells, also indicating a cell-autonomous defect arising in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref>). In order to determine the contribution of the MSP domain of VAPA in these phenotypes, we generated stable VAPA KO cell lines expressing a Wild-type form of VAPA (named VAPA KO +WT) or an MSP-mutated form of VAPA (named VAPA KO +KDMD) bearing the K94D M96D mutation that was previously shown to abolish FFAT binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaiser et al., 2005</xref>). Both VAPA constructs, fused to mCherry, localized to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The expression of mCherry-VAPA WT restored either partially or totally the collective migration capacity of VAPA KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) and their spreading behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref>), indicating that the loss of VAPA was indeed responsible for the defects observed in VAPA KO cells. Importantly, the VAPA KDMD mutant failed to rescue these phenotypes in VAPA KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–G , and K–L</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Altogether, our results identify VAPA as a novel actor of collective and individual cell motility processes, and point to a determinant role of the FFAT-binding MSP domain in VAPA protein.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>VAPA is required for proper cell migration and cell spreading.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left panel: Representative immunoblots showing the levels of VAPA and Tubulin in Control and VAPA KO cells.

To facilitate the analysis, we decided to focus on leader cells, standing at the leading edge of migrating monolayers (24–48 hr after insert removal), as these cells move in a given direction with a polarized and reproducible morphology. We observed an alteration of cell-matrix adhesions in VAPA KO cells that formed larger central FA compared to Control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Peripheral FA, located at the leading edge tip where nascent adhesions form, exhibited the same size in Control and VAPA KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). The expression of VAPA WT in VAPA KO cells restored the size of central FA, but it was not the case with VAPA KDMD, indicating that VAPA regulates FA size through its association with proteins containing an FFAT motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). We then compared the organization of actin cytoskeleton in the four cell lines. In Control cells, the F-actin and cortactin stainings revealed the presence of numerous and thick parallel transverse actin arcs at the front, accompanied by cortactin-rich subdomains of branched actin standing at the front edge corresponding to lamellipodial extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). We indeed observed periodic waves of protrusion-retraction arising in these cells every 15 min in average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and H</xref>). By contrast, VAPA KO cells exhibited disorganized and thinner transverse actin arcs, wider cortactin-rich subdomains occupying most of the leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and F–G</xref>) and giving rise to long-lasting protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and H</xref>). Similarly to the FA phenotype, we were able to recover the organization of actin, the size of cortactin-rich domains and the frequency of protrusions by expressing VAPA WT but not the MSP mutant VAPA KDMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and F–H</xref>). To conclude, we show that VAPA controls different aspects of cell motility, namely the maintenance of FA size and the preservation of the spatial and temporal organization of the actin cytoskeleton. These functions depend on the association of VAPA with FFAT-motif containing proteins such as lipid transfer proteins, suggesting that lipid transfer is probably required.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>VAPA regulates focal adhesions and actin cytoskeleton through its MSP domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images with zoom boxes of central (green squares) and peripheral (blue squares) paxillin-labeled focal adhesions from Control, VAPA KO, VAPA KO +WT and VAPA KO +KDMD leader cells in migrating monolayers 24 -48hr after insert removal.

To test the lipid transfer hypothesis, we first characterized to which extend its deletion affected PInst homeostasis. Previous studies have shown that depleting both VAPA and VAPB affected the levels of PI(4)P at the Golgi and PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stefan et al., 2011</xref>), and induced the accumulation of PI(4)P in early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2016</xref>). Using a GFP-PH-OSBP probe, we detected a major intra-cellular pool of PI(4)P at similar levels in the Golgi compartment in Control and VAPA KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Importantly, the depletion of VAPA alone was not sufficient to observe an accumulation of PI(4)P in early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>) which is in agreement with the SupFig. S1D by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2016</xref> showing no effect on intra-cellular PI(4)P distribution when only VAPA is depleted in HeLa cells. This result suggests that VAPB, which is slightly more abondant in VAPA KO cells, can compensate for the absence of VAPA at ER-Golgi and ER-endosome contact sites thus maintaining PI(4)P homeostasis at the Golgi and endosomes in VAPA KO Caco-2 cells. We then analyzed the amount of PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 at the PM using the mCherry-P4M SidM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hammond et al., 2014</xref>) and the RFP-PH-PLCδ1 probes respectively.

To this aim, we took advantage of a fluorescent probe, GFP-MAPPER, which selectively labels ER-PM contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). When expressed in Caco-2 cells, GFP-MAPPER distributed as foci along ER tubules both in Control and VAPA KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and appeared at ER-PM appositions detected by TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Moreover, we could observe GFP-MAPPER foci along VAPA-containing ER tubules highlighted with an exogenous mCherry-VAPA WT protein expressed in Control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) or with an anti-VAPA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At the front of leader cells, GFP-MAPPER foci divided in two subpools: the dorsal subpool ongoing forward movement with the migrating cell and the ventral subpool remaining immobile relative to the substrate, suggesting that ventral ER-PM contact sites might be anchored to cell-matrix adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Using electron microscopy, we were indeed able to identify numerous ER-PM contact sites sitting at the ventral leading edge of migrating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). At the ultrastructural level, the depletion of VAPA had no significant effect on ER-PM contact sites regardless of their location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). However, the dynamic analysis of GFP-MAPPER foci revealed that ventral ER-PM contact sites, which barely moved (400 nm/min on average) and persisted generally more than 10 min in Control cells, were significantly less stable both spatially and temporally in VAPA KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). To conclude, our results identify a sub-pool of ER-PM contact sites docked to the substrate at the front of migrating cells, and whose spatio-temporal stability requires VAPA.

While the assembly rate of FA was similar in both cell lines, their disassembly rate was slower in VAPA KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). In addition, VAPA KO FA exhibited a longer lifetime in average, with a majority lasting at least 40 min, instead of 30 min in Control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and D</xref>). The expression of VAPA WT in VAPA KO cells restored the lifetime of FA, unlike VAPA KDMD mutant, indicating that not only the size of FA but also their lifetime depended on the interaction of VAPA with FFAT-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). One way to disassemble FA is through clathrin-mediated endocytosis of integrins which has been shown to depend on microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezratty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ezratty et al., 2005</xref>).

In Control cells, the majority of central FA (75%) exhibited one or more GFP-MAPPER foci in their vicinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Using super-resolutive Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM), we could determine that the peaks of the most proximal GFP-MAPPER foci partially superposed on the peaks of FA, with a distance of around 50–150 nm at 50% of the peaks, suggesting that the two elements were either in contact or in close proximity. Some GFP-MAPPER foci were even found inside the perimeter of FA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In VAPA KO cells, only 30% of central FA were standing proximal to at least one GFP-MAPPER foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). The expression of VAPA WT or the mutant VAPA KDMD in VAPA KO cells restored the high percentage of central FA proximal to GFP-MAPPER foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that the MSP domain of VAPA was not required for the physical proximity between central FA and ER-PM contact sites. Unlike central FA, almost none of the peripheral FA were proximal to GFP-MAPPER foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that ER-PM contact sites are probably getting closer to FA after their assembly. Indeed<bold>,</bold> when we monitored the time course of mCherry-Vinculin and GFP-MAPPER signals within the perimeter of single FA by TIRF microscopy, we could establish that in Control cells, for most FA (71,4%), the first GFP-MAPPER foci appearing in the FA vicinity was detected after FA assembly and before its disassembly, with a preferential arrival within the 10 min preceding disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). Once detected, this first GFP-MAPPER foci seemed to anchor to the pre-existing FA, as it was persisting 6 min on average in the FA vicinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and F</xref>). In VAPA KO cells, where only 30% of FA were found in proximity to GFP-MAPPER foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>), there was no preferential time distribution of arrival of the first GFP-MAPPER foci, with 47,6% of them arriving before FA disassembly and 52.4% after FA disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>).

We show that VAPA is required for both single and collective cell migration, cell spreading, protrusive waves, actin cytoskeleton dynamics and FA turnover. These processes require the MSP domain of VAPA, suggesting that they are regulated through VAPA-mediated lipid transfer mechanisms.</p><p>Our study reveals a non-redundant function for VAPA in cell motility among the VAP family of proteins in Caco2 cells. Indeed, the presence of endogenous VAPB in VAPA KO cells, even at slightly higher levels, was not sufficient to compensate the loss of VAPA. The function of VAPA in cell migration seems to arise from its specific role at ER-PM contact sites where it was necessary to maintain high levels of PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 independently of VAPB. It was not the case at the Golgi or endosomes, where the depletion of VAPA alone had no effect on PI(4)P levels, which is in agreement with previous observations by Dong et al in HeLa cells depleted for VAPA only (SupFigS1D of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that VAPB might compensate for the absence of VAPA at ER-Golgi and ER-endosomes contact sites and that migration defects in VAPA KO cells were not a result of a dysfunction of lipid transfer in the secretory pathway. Together with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peretti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stefan et al., 2011</xref>), our results converge to the idea that VAPA and VAPB might fulfill both redundant and specific tasks in lipid homeostasis and cellular functions.</p><p>PI(4,5)P2 and its phosphorylation product PI(3,4,5)P3 have been described for decades as central orchestrators of cell motility through regulation of actin dynamics, FA maturation and turnover, membrane organization and curvature, and intracellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mandal, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsujita and Itoh, 2015</xref>). Notably, several previous studies have shown that altering the global synthesis of PI(4,5)P2, either by knockdown of certain isoforms of the PIPKI kinase which phosphorylates PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chao et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thapa et al., 2012</xref>), or by optogenetic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Idevall-Hagren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiong et al., 2016</xref>), results in defects that are comparable to the ones observed in VAPA KO cells – namely disorganization of actin, protrusion defects, FA persistence and loss of directional movement. Thus, the phenotypes of VAPA KO cells could be solely explained by a global reduction in PI(4,5)P2 levels at the PM. However, our results clearly show that VAPA not only regulates PI(4,5)P2 homeostasis at the PM, but also fulfills a function at FA where it stably anchors ER-PM contact sites and promotes microtubule-dependent FA disassembly. Importantly, we provide for the first time a quantitative spatio-temporal connection between ER-PM contact sites and FA dynamics in polarized and migrating cells.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ideas and speculation</title><p>Based on these results, we propose a hypothetical model in which VAPA, through local regulation of lipid transfer in the vicinity of FA would induce the internalization of integrins through clathrin-mediated endocytosis which depends on PI(4,5)P2 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chao et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nader et al., 2016</xref>) and on microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezratty et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, MCS have already been shown to directly regulate endocytosis in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Encinar Del Dedo et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Through which mechanisms could VAPA control the dynamics of FA and their close proximity with ER-PM contact sites? Our results show that the MSP domain of VAPA is required for the regulation of FA dynamics. Importantly, two lipid transfer proteins interacting with VAPA at ER-PM contact sites, Nir2 and ORP3, have been previously described as regulators of FA dynamics and cell motility, establishing them as potential drivers for the specific function of VAPA at FA. Nir2, which interacts with VAPs at ER-PM and ER-Golgi contact sites and regulates PI transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang and Liou, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peretti et al., 2008</xref>), favors epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keinan et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly to VAPA KO cells, the depletion of Nir2 in HeLa cells induces a decrease of PI(4,5)P2 levels at the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>), indicating that a part of VAPA effect on PInst homeostasis could be supported by VAPA/Nir2-mediated lipid transfer. ORP3, which extracts PI(4)P from the PM at ER-PM contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gulyás et al., 2020</xref>), positively regulates the R-Ras pathway promoting cell-matrix adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lehto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weber-Boyvat et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, ORP3 was found to be recruited to disassembling FA upon calcium influx and to favour their turnover through lipid exchange and crosstalk with STIM1/Orai1-mediated calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D’Souza et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>But VAPA might not act at FA just through its MSP domain. Indeed, we show that VAPA favours the proximity between FA and ER-PM contact sites independently of its MSP domain. Thus, we could imagine that VAPA also associates to FFAT-lacking proteins that would mediate the anchoring of ER to FA. Previous studies have highlighted the role of ER proteins in FA turnover and maturation that could be potential candidates. Kinectin, an integral ER membrane protein interacting with kinesin, has been shown to control the apposition of ER to FA through a microtubule-dependent transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guadagno et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ng et al., 2016</xref>). Another protein, the phosphatase PTP1B, which localizes to the cytoplasmic face of the ER and was identified as a partner of VAPA using a BioID approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonicka et al., 2020</xref>), is targeted to newly formed FA and contributes to their maturation through dephosphorylation of its substrate p130Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dadke and Chernoff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernández et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, the role of VAPA-mediated contact sites at FA could not only be the local modulation of lipid transfer, but also the establishment of a common platform mediating the anchoring of ER and microtubules close to FA where several processes, like lipid transfer, calcium exchange and vesicular transport could converge and participate to FA dynamics.</p><p>To conclude, our study reveals unknown functions for VAPA in cell motility processes and in local anchoring of ER-PM contact sites to FA. For a long time, we have assumed that PInst regulation at FA will principally be mediated by the interplay of lipid kinases and phosphatases. Our work reinforces the idea that lipid transfer would be an additional pathway for lipids to be controlled at FA and provides evidences for a spatio-temporal connection between MCS and FA mediated by VAPA. Finally, this work opens new roads to decipher the precise molecular determinants of VAPA function and to explore the role of VAPA during cancerogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The complete list of materials is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>CaCo-2 cells, originally acquired from ATCC, were kindly provided by Dr. D.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Felix Campelo as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>We all agree that this manuscript reports potentially very interesting findings, but we also think that additional data will be needed to support the claims. The essential revisions requested are the following (1-3 will require new experiments, 4-6 might not, but additional discussion is requested):</p><p>1) Show additional rescue experiments (and/or test some of the findings with other KO clones). Especially regarding those experiments presented in Figures 1,5, and 6. We all agreed that this is perhaps the major gap in the paper.

VAPA should be shown at ER-PM contacts in Figure 4 and Fig6 and in the recommended rescue experiments.</p><p>2) The data in the paper are from a single Crispr/Cas9 clone of VAPA KO. It is important to confirm some findings with other clones.</p><p>3) The direct link between VAPA, PI(4,5P)2 and FA disassembly is missing. The Nir2 (/ORP/lipid transfer pathway) hypothesis should be tested, by KO or siRNA, in cell motility or FA turnover experiment. Integrin endocytosis should be tested in VAPA KO and in rescue experiments. VAPA should be shown at ER-PM contacts near FA with Nir2 or another protein acting on PI(4,5)P2.</p><p>4) The authors assessed PI(4)P levels at Golgi and endosomes but not at the PM. As for PI(4,5)P2, it was tested at dorsal PM, but not at the ventral area where FA disassembly occurs. These measurements should be done. For PI(4)P, it would be wise to use the P4M-SiDM probe (PMID 24711504), rather than OSBP-PH which seems highly recruited to the Golgi but not to other membranes. Moreover, previous studies showed that not only VAPB but also VAPA is present at ER-Golgi and ER-endosome contacts in different cell types (by binding to CERT, OSBP, ORPs), with striking effects on PI(4)P modulation. How do the authors explain this apparent discrepancy?</p><p>5) For statistics it is highly recommended to use superplots (PMID 32346721). In addition, showing data with only ~10 cells analyzed per condition, as in Figure 3, is hardly acceptable.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>6) The two sets of images in Fig5E are difficult to compare because the starting point of FA formation is different. The rate of FA assembly appears to be 10 min longer in VAPA KO than in the control, which is not consistent with quantification. It is also difficult to judge the delay in disassembly. The time-lapse images should be comparable by showing the same acquisition times.</p><p>7) The authors claim that &quot;contacts&quot; are created between ER-PM contact sites and FA based on a one-pixel overlap (Fig6A, B), but whether the resolution of the image used here allows going that far is questionable.</p><p>8) The authors must show the effect on microtubule network during the washout experiment in Fig5F. The loss of FA size is difficult to see based on the images. The bar chart should be replaced by a panel in which individual measurements are shown (see point 5).</p><p>– Line 55. VAP not only binds to lipid transfer proteins.</p><p>– Line 185.

However, the fact that the size and the lifetime of focal adhesions were rescued in VAPA KO+WT but not in VAPA KO+KDMD (Figure 2A-C and Figure 5D) is a proof that the defects of focal adhesion dynamics observed in VAPA KO cells is due to the absence of VAPA and depends on its MSP domain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It was not clear to me, based on the image in Figure 2B, that the cortactin signal in the KOs is different from Control.

In addition, as requested by the Reviewer, we analyzed the cell areas after 24 hours in the 4 cell lines. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, after 24 hours, the phenotype was inverted compared to 1 hour spreading: the depletion of VAPA induced a strong decrease of the cell area, restored by the expression of exogenous VAPA WT but not VAPA KDMD. This phenotype might be due to the fact that after 24 hours, the cells are not spreading anymore, but have started to move in 2D as individual cells, so their shape and area are intimately linked to their motile behaviour. The small size of VAPA KO cells is correlated to their faster way to move, while Control cells are more static cells with a “fried egg” shape and a high surface spreading. This observation is also well visible in Figure 1H. However, in motile monolayers, VAPA KO cells look bigger than Control cells, which is the opposite of individual motile cells. We think this decrepancy might be due to the fact that in monolayers, the cell area is also influenced by the presence and the integrity of cell-cell junctions that could be altered in VAPA KO cells.</p><p>Altogether, our new data clearly show that the size differences are indeed due to the absence of VAPA rather than a size variability due to clonal selection.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of cell area 24 hours after plating.</title><p>A.

At that stage, we can’t give any experimental explanation for this, but we can speculate on the reasons why VAPA KO cells have longer-lived FAs and move faster.</p><p>First, the group of Denis Wirtz showed, some time ago, that for slow-moving cells (like individual Caco2 cells), an increase in FAs size correlates with a faster cell speed (Kim and Wirtz, 2013), highlighting the fact that having bigger FAs does not necessarily prevent the cells from moving faster.</p><p>Second, even if VAPA KO focal adhesions live longer, we have no information on their molecular composition, their maturation/activation status, their connection with the actin-cytoskeleton and their mechano-sensitivity.

Do you think that the observed changes are cell type (CACO2) specific?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for mentioning this work by Wakana et al. that we have now added to the manuscript (Lines 77-78). In this study, as in the 3 other studies that we cite in the manuscript (Lines 76-80), the authors depleted both VAPA and VAPB and observed, depending on the cell type and organism, either a reduction (Peretti et al., 2008) or an accumulation (Mao et al., 2019; Wakana et al., 2021) of PI4P levels in the Golgi membranes and its redistribution on endosomes (Dong et al., 2016). The main difference with our study is that we depleted only VAPA. As discussed in lines 159-169 and 265-277, our results showing no effect of VAPA depletion on PI4P at the Golgi or endosomes can be explained by a possible redundancy of VAPA and VAPB in these 2 compartments. In other words, in our VAPA KO cells, the presence of VAPB would be enough to maintain the levels of PI4P at the Golgi and endosomes. This is corroborated by the results of P. di Camilli’s group (Dong et al., 2016) who did not observe any defect in the intra-cellular distribution of PI4P in cells expressing only VAPB (see Figure S1D in their paper).</p><p>Moreover, our results show that something different happens at the PM where the presence of VAPB does not seem to be enough to maintain the levels of PI4P and PI(4,5)P2. Interestingly, the same phenotype has been observed in Nir2 depleted cells (discussed in lines 308-311).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Have the authors considered the possibility to use other means to measure PI4P levels at the Golgi (e.g. antibody staining)?</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to stain our cells with anti-PI4P antibodies but didn’t get a sufficient signal to be able to quantify properly the images.

Concerning the proliferation rate, in order to avoid any proliferation bias, we inhibited cell division by treating the cells with mitomycin.

It is indeed highly probable that VAPA regulates junctional organization, as PI(4,5)P2 has been shown to control endocytosis of cadherins and organization of the actin cortex. So the phenotype observed in collective migration might be due, at least in part, to a function of VAPA at cell-cell contacts. However, as we observe the same motility phenotype on individual cells (Figure 1H-J), we can be confident on the fact that the role of VAPA on cell motility is at least partially independent of cell-cell junctions, as mentioned in Lines 109-112.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2A: the authors focus on the larger FA observed in VAPA KO cells compared to the control cells in the &quot;interior&quot; of the cell. However, from the pictures displayed in Figure 2A, it seems that there is more paxillin signal in the cell periphery of control and VAPA KO + mCh-VAPA KDMD. Is there any effect of VAPA depletion on adhesive structures at the cell contour?</p><p>The same comment can be raised for results shown in Figure 5F. Did the authors measure FA dynamics both at the cell center and at the cell periphery? Do the different FA populations have the same behavior in VAPA depletion conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for raising this point. We have now added some data on peripheral FA that, in fact, correspond to the population of nascent adhesions and focal complexes. As shown in Fig. 2A-C and Fig. 6A-B, we observed no difference between the cell lines, or a very slight one, in the size of peripheral FA and their proximity with GFP-MAPPER foci. These results suggest that VAPA is not involved in the first steps of FA assembly, which is consistent with the observation that Control and VAPA KO FA assemble at the same speed (Fig. 5B), and that GFP-MAPPER foci appear in the vicinity of FA after their assembly (Fig. 6C-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2C: remove the &quot;e&quot; to &quot;cortactin&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This error has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Using data presented in Figure6, the authors claim (lines 201-203) &quot; Thus, we show that VAPA is required for the anchoring of ER-PM contact sites to FA, which happens at the time of FA disassembly&quot;</p><p>To consolidate their interpretation, performing the same experiments as the ones conducted for Fig6 C-E but in VAPA KO cells and in VAPA KO cells expressing VAPA construct (rescue experiment) would be necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added new data in Figure 6, showing that in VAPA KO cells, there is no preferential arrival of the 1<sup>st</sup> GFP-MAPPER foci before FA disassembly (Figure 6C-E), and that the proximity between FA and GFP-MAPPER foci lasts shorter (Figure 6F). Unfortunately, because of technical issues with our new TIRF microscope, we were not able to include Rescue cell lines in these experiments that necessitated more acquisitions. However, we added some data on the Rescue cell lines in Figure 6A-B showing that VAPA is indeed necessary for the proximity between central FA and GFP-MAPPER.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion (lines 232-237) and in Figure 7, the authors discuss the role of VAPA-mediated ER-PM contact sites and FA in integrin trafficking. However, in this manuscript, no experiments regarding integrin trafficking were performed. To my opinion, other possible mechanisms might be added to Figure 7 such as the role of VAPA for calcium influx, STIM1 and ORP3.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the Reviewer, which is why we removed the model that we felt was too speculative and didn’t give an exhaustive view of the possible hypothesis. We also integrated the part of the Discussion describing potential hypothesis in the “Ideas and Speculation” subsection (Lines 294338). The possible connection with STIM1 and ORP3 is discussed in this subsection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Main recommendations</p><p>1) Results and hypotheses arising from VAPA KO should be tested by rescue experiments with WT and mutants (such as in Figure 2A). VAPA should be shown at ER-PM contacts in Figure 4 and Fig6 and in the recommended rescue experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for raising these points and giving us the opportunity to improve the paper. As explained in our responses to Reviewer #1, we have now added a significant amount of data in the 2 VAPA KO cell lines expressing either VAPA WT or the mutant VAPA KDMD. Their phenotypes were analyzed in most of the cellular processes studied in the paper and described in figures 1, 2, 5 and 6: collective cell migration (Figure 1D-G), cell spreading (Figure 1K-L), organization of actin cytoskeleton (Figure 2D, 2F-G), protrusion dynamics (Figure 2D-E, 2H), focal adhesions size (Figure 2A-C), lifetime (Figure 5D) and proximity with GFP-MAPPER foci (Figure 6A-B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>VAPA should be shown at ER-PM contacts in Figure 4 and Fig6 and in the recommended rescue experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the Reviewer, we have added images of endogenous or exogenous VAPA at ER-PM contact sites:</p><p>– by confocal microscopy in Control cells transiently expressing Cherry-VAPAWT and GFP-MAPPER (Figure 4C)</p><p>– by confocal microscopy in Control cells transiently expressing GFP-MAPPER and immuno-stained with anti-VAPA antibodies (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A)</p><p>In addition, in Figure 6G, we added a TIRF image showing the localization of exogenous VAPAWT expressed in VAPA KO cells co-localizing with ER-PM contact sites close to focal adhesions, which reinforces our results showing the local function of VAPA at focal adhesions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data in the paper are from a single Crispr/Cas9 clone of VAPA KO. It is important to confirm some findings with other clones.</p></disp-quote><p>The editors requested additional data in Rescue cell lines and/or other VAPA KO clones. Considering the difficulties we’ve had during this review process (in particular the departure of the first author and the technical issues with our TIRF microscope) and the amount of additional experiments requested, we chose to concentrate on the Rescue cell lines. Indeed, they offered the double advantage of testing whether the phenotypes observed in VAPA KO cells are due to VAPA depletion and to interrogate the role of the MSP domain in the different processes studied.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The direct link between VAPA, PI(4,5P)2 and FA disassembly is missing. The Nir2 (/ORP/lipid transfer pathway) hypothesis should be tested, by KO or siRNA, in cell motility or FA turnover experiment. Integrin endocytosis should be tested in VAPA KO and in rescue experiments. VAPA should be shown at ER-PM contacts near FA with Nir2 or another protein acting on PI(4,5)P2.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that our paper doesn’t give any experimental evidence on the molecular mechanisms involved in the function of VAPA during cell motility. However, we feel that these elements would be beyond the scope of this work, as mentioned by the Editors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors assessed PI(4)P levels at Golgi and endosomes but not at the PM. As for PI(4,5)P2, it was tested at dorsal PM, but not at the ventral area where FA disassembly occurs. These measurements should be done. For PI(4)P, it would be wise to use the P4M-SiDM probe (PMID 24711504), rather than OSBP-PH which seems highly recruited to the Golgi but not to other membranes.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the Reviewer, we have now added some data on PI(4)P using the P4M-SiDM probe (Figure 3D-E). As for PI(4, 5)P2, we observed lower amounts of PI(4)P at the plasma membrane of VAPA KO cells. We have tried to assess the local regulation of PI(4,5)P2 and PI(4)P on the ventral area where FA disassembly occurs, but we were not able to see any variations, probably because the events we were trying to catch are very transient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, previous studies showed that not only VAPB but also VAPA is present at ER-Golgi and ER-endosome contacts in different cell types (by binding to CERT, OSBP, ORPs), with striking effects on PI(4)P modulation. How do the authors explain this apparent discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>Our finding that VAPA depletion doesn’t have any effect on PI(4)P at the Golgi is, in fact, not in contradiction with published work. Indeed, in the 4 studies that we cite in the manuscript (Lines 7680), the authors depleted both VAPA and VAPB and observed, depending on the cell type and organism, either a reduction (Peretti et al., 2008) or an accumulation (Mao et al., 2019; Wakana et al., 2021) of PI4P levels in the Golgi membranes and its redistribution on endosomes (Dong et al., 2016). The main difference with our study is that we depleted only VAPA. As discussed in lines 159-169 and 265-277, our results can be explained by a possible redundancy of VAPA and VAPB in these 2 compartments. In other words, in our VAPA KO cells, the presence of VAPB would be enough to maintain the levels of PI4P at the Golgi and endosomes. This is corroborated by the results of P. di Camilli’s group (Dong et al., 2016) who did not observe any defect in the intra-cellular distribution of PI4P in cells expressing only VAPB (see Figure S1D in their paper).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For statistics it is highly recommended to use superplots (PMID 32346721). In addition, showing data with only ~10 cells analyzed per condition, as in Figure 3, is hardly acceptable.</p></disp-quote><p>Most of the data that were represented as bar graphs have been modified to Scatter plots or Box and Whiskers, to allow the visualization of individual events. As suggested by the Reviewer, we increased the number of cells analyzed in Figure 3C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p><p>6) The two sets of images in Fig5E are difficult to compare because the starting point of FA formation is different. The rate of FA assembly appears to be 10 min longer in VAPA KO than in the control, which is not consistent with quantification. It is also difficult to judge the delay in disassembly. The time-lapse images should be comparable by showing the same acquisition times.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing out this mistake. As suggested, we have now represented image sequences with the same starting point of FA formation and the same acquisition times in Control and VAPA KO cells (Figure 5A). They are also more representative of the phenotypes observed in the quantification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors claim that &quot;contacts&quot; are created between ER-PM contact sites and FA based on a one-pixel overlap (Fig6A, B), but whether the resolution of the image used here allows going that far is questionable.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the Reviewer that “contacts” is not the appropriate word here, considering the resolution used. We have now removed this word from the manuscript. Using a super resolutive SIM microscope, we were able to determine that GFP-MAPPER foci and FA were distant of around 50150nm (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). Moreover, the analysis of GFP-MAPPER foci dynamics revealed that in Control cells, they persisted several minutes (in average 6 minutes) in the vicinity of FA (Figure 6F), suggesting that they were either directly or indirectly anchored to FA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors must show the effect on microtubule network during the washout experiment in Fig5F. The loss of FA size is difficult to see based on the images. The bar chart should be replaced by a panel in which individual measurements are shown (see point 5).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added images of the microtubules network at different time points of the washout experiment (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). They show a relatively fast recovery of the microtubule network after washout of nocodazole. As suggested by the Reviewer, we put more representative images of FA staining in Figure 5E and replaced the bar graph by Scatter plots in Figure 5F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 55.
