id="abs1"><title>Background:</title><p>Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) are at high risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It is unknown whether beginning to have sexual intercourse results in changes to immune mediators in the cervicovaginal tract that contribute to this risk.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>We collected cervicovaginal lavages from Kenyan AGYW in the months before and after first penile-vaginal sexual intercourse and measured the concentrations of 20 immune mediators. We compared concentrations pre- and post-first sex using mixed effect models. We additionally performed a systematic review to identify similar studies and combined them with our results by meta-analysis of individual participant data.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>We included 180 samples from 95 AGYW, with 44% providing only pre-first sex samples, 35% matched pre and post, and 21% only post. We consistently detected 19/20 immune mediators, all of which increased post-first sex (p&lt;0.05 for 13/19; Holm-Bonferroni-adjusted p&lt;0.05 for IL-1β, IL-2, and CXCL8). Effects remained similar after excluding samples with STIs and high Nugent scores. Concentrations increased cumulatively over time after date of first sex, with an estimated doubling time of about 5 months.</p><p>Our systematic review identified two eligible studies, one of 93 Belgian participants, and the other of 18 American participants. Nine immune mediators were measured in at least two-thirds of studies. Meta-analysis confirmed higher levels post-first sex for 8/9 immune mediators (p&lt;0.05 for six mediators, most prominently IL-1α, IL-1β, and CXCL8).</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Cervicovaginal immune mediator concentrations were higher in women who reported that they started sexual activity. Results were consistent across three studies conducted on three different continents.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This research was funded by R01 HD091996-01 (ACR), by P01 AI 030731-25 (Project 1) (AW), R01 AI116292 (FH), R03 AI154366 (FH) and by the Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) of the University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center AI027757.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adolescent girls and young women</kwd><kwd>sexual intercourse</kwd><kwd>cytokines</kwd><kwd>mucosal immunity</kwd><kwd>immune activation</kwd><kwd>genital immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD091996</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roxby</surname><given-names>Alison C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI030731</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wald</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI116292</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hladik</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI154366</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hladik</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI027757</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hladik</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The immune system in the vagina becomes more active when young women begin to have sexual intercourse, and this immune activity could influence the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) aged 15–24 are at high risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and are disproportionately affected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), accounting for as many as 80% of new HIV infections in some countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">UNAIDS, 2019</xref>). In Kenya, in particular, a quarter of new HIV infections occur in AGYW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">National AIDS Control Council, 2018</xref>). Because of the disproportionate impact of HIV on AGYW, understanding the behavioral and physiological components of heightened STI risk in this population presents an opportunity to reduce HIV infections.</p><p>The period following first penile-vaginal sexual intercourse (“first sex”) marks the start of vulnerability to STIs and is associated with higher acquisition of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and STIs than later in life. The reasons for this increased susceptibility remain unclear, because (1) studies of mucosal immunity in AGYW are challenging, and (2) it can be difficult to distinguish immune changes that are a consequence of STI acquisition from changes that occur independently of STIs. Understanding changes in cervicovaginal tract (CVT) immune mediators following first sex may help identify interventions to decrease the risk of STI and HIV acquisition in AGYW.</p><p>In this study, we measured immune mediators in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) specimens collected from a unique longitudinal cohort of Kenyan AGYW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Casmir et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuh et al., 2020</xref>), an especially vulnerable population. By comparing specimens collected in the months before and after first sex, our goal was to measure changes in CVT immune mediators following start of sexual intercourse. Extensive clinical information was available about participants, including acquisition of STIs.</p><p>To generalize our findings to broader populations, we also conducted a systematic review of published literature to identify other studies of cervicovaginal immune mediators in AGYW before and after first sexual intercourse. We sought individual participant data from study authors and performed meta-analyses of individual immune mediators, assessing changes in immune mediator concentration before and after first sex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

study procedures</title><p>This study used specimens collected from the Kenya Girls Study, a previously described longitudinal cohort study of AGYW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Casmir et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuh et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, AGYW aged 16–20 were recruited in Thika, Kenya. Enrolled participants returned quarterly, where they were interviewed about their sexual behavior and provided vaginal swabs, CVLs, and blood. For the sub-study described in this paper, we selected a group of 195 samples from the larger Kenya girls study, including samples from participants who provided only pre-first sex samples, participants who provided only post-first sex samples, and participants who provided both pre- and post-first sex samples. The sample size was chosen based on selection of all available samples from all participants who reported sexual intercourse and a matching number of participants who did not.</p><p>Human subjects approval was obtained from the Kenya Medical Research Institute Scientific Ethics Review Unit (protocol 2760) and the University of Washington Institutional Review Board (number 00000946). Participants under age 18 provided written informed assent, and written informed consent was obtained from a parent/guardian. Participants assented privately from parents/guardians, after asking questions and deciding whether they wanted to participate free of parental influence. Participants age 18 or older provided written informed consent.</p><p>CVLs were collected using flexible tubing in the vagina to avoid a speculum examination. 5 cc of sterile saline was instilled into the vagina via tubing by the study clinician, left for 15 s, then aspirated into the syringe. Lavage fluid was spun for 10 min at 800×g; supernatant was removed, re-spun for 10 min, and stored in 2 mL aliquots at –80°C.</p><p>Participants were tested for STIs and BV. Vaginal swabs were tested for NG, CT, and TV using the Gen-Probe Aptima test (Hologic, Marlborough, MA) and for HSV-1 and HSV-2 by in-house PCR. Nugent scoring was performed on smears from vaginal swabs for BV; scores ≥7 were considered BV, scores 4–6 were considered intermediate, and scores ≤3 were considered no dysbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nugent et al., 1991</xref>). Blood was tested for HIV using the Vironostika HIV Uni-Form II Ag-Ab (Biomerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) and for HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies using in-house Western blot.</p><p>STI tests were performed annually in the parent study. Therefore, STI testing had not been performed at some timepoints selected for this sub-study. For samples with no concurrent STI result, we determined STI status as follows: If the annual tests both before and after the untested visit were negative, we inferred a negative result for that visit. If either annual test was positive, STI testing was performed for that timepoint. Negative CT and NG tests were inferred for 28 samples as well as negative TV tests for 45 samples.</p><p>Participants were tested for pregnancy via rapid urinary pregnancy test if they reported missed menses. Serum samples were tested for progesterone by automated immunoassay (Cobas E411, Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Participants were defined to be in the follicular phase if serum progesterone was &lt;3 ng/mL, in the luteal phase if serum progesterone was ≥3 ng/mL, and ‘other’ if more than 35 days since the start of their last menstrual period had passed (indicating irregular menstruation, use of hormonal contraception, or pregnancy). Participants were assumed not to be using contraception until they reported sexual intercourse.</p><p>PSA was measured in CVL using the Human Kallikrein 3/PSA DuoSet ELISA (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Samples were considered positive if the PSA concentration was ≥10 ng/mL. Total protein concentrations were measured using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). PSA and total protein concentrations were calculated using four-parameter logistic curves fit to the standard curves. Vaginal swabs were tested for Y-chromosome DNA by Quantifiler Duo DNA Quantification Kit (Life Technologies).</p><p>The immune mediator data reported in this article was previously included in a meta-analysis of changes in immune mediator concentrations during the menstrual cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hughes et al., 2022</xref>), where it is referred to as “Hughes-unpublished”.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Immune mediator quantification</title><p>We selected 20 immune mediators to measure in CVLs. These immune mediators were selected based on prior human and/or non-human primate studies as being consistently up- or down-regulated prior to HIV or STI transmission events, and therefore playing a key role in genital tract immunity to STIs. Concentrations of immune mediators were measured in CVL using Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) R-Plex/U-Plex kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions and read on the MESO QuickPlex SQ 120. Pre- and post-first sex samples were present on every plate, and the scientists were blinded to sample identity. CVLs were diluted 100-fold for measurement of IL-1RA and 10-fold for CXCL9 and CCL5. Concentrations were determined using four parameter logistic fits in MSD Discovery Workbench software.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Definition of first sexual intercourse</title><p>Samples were categorized as pre- or post-first sex based on participant report of ever engaging in penile-vaginal penetrative sex.

Core Team, 2018</xref>) version 4.0.0 with the packages plater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">M Hughes, 2016</xref>) and tidyverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wickham et al., 2019</xref>) in addition to the statistical packages described below.</p><p>For MSD, concentrations of each analyte were averaged across replicate wells and log2-transformed. Replicates with concentrations below the reported lower limits of detection were assigned the value of half the lower limit of detection. Samples were defined as detectable if the concentration was above the lower limit of detection for at least one of the two replicate wells. Some samples were excluded due to rare STIs or missing data (fully described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), these exclusion criteria were not pre-established.</p><p>We performed primary and secondary analyses. For the primary analysis, we used univariate models to estimate the difference between cytokine concentrations in pre- and post-first sex samples (assessed by effect size and p-value). Pre- and post-first sex were modeled as a binary fixed effect and participant as a random effect to account for multiple samples per participant using mixed-effect models with the R packages lme4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) and lmerTest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuznetsova et al., 2017</xref>). Log2-transformed immune mediator concentrations were used as the outcome for immune mediators if more than 50% of samples were above the limit of detection. For the remaining immune mediators, logistic models were used with the outcome being above/below the lower limit of detection. Logistic models were used for immune mediators with low levels of detection because the distributions become increasingly non-normal as more samples fall below the lower limit of detection. We adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Holm-Bonferroni method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holm, 1979</xref>).</p><p>We performed several secondary analyses. We tested whether pregnancy, STIs, BV, and contraception explained our results by repeating our primary, univariate analysis on the subset of samples negative for all of these variables. In addition, we repeated our univariate models using immune mediator concentrations normalized to total protein. Furthermore, we performed univariate models on the subset of samples from participants who provided both pre- and post-first sex samples. Finally, we fit multivariate models with additional fixed effects: age, education at enrollment, rural/urban residence at enrollment, and roof material at enrollment (an indicator of poverty). In all cases, we assessed whether these factors had a major influence on results by comparing the effect sizes from the primary analysis to the effect sizes from the secondary analysis.</p><p>We additionally wished to assess whether immune mediator concentrations changed over time with respect to the date of first sex. To assess this question, we fit mixed-effect models with linear splines, using days since first sex as a fixed effect and participant as a random effect, with the outcome being the concentration of immune mediator (log2 pg/mL). For the splines, we used a knot at day 0, which was the day of first sex.</p><p>All code and raw data are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref> and on GitHub at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/seaaan/ThikaPrePostSexManuscript/">https://github.com/seaaan/ThikaPrePostSexManuscript/</ext-link> (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:3739afdd6b6534850672d9131dfd7eee8e185a79;origin=https://github.com/seaaan/ThikaPrePostSexManuscript;visit=swh:1:snp:3d045d5d9e32d2605cca80f74e560b46f5f2318a;anchor=swh:1:rev:ef3bd4bee186be79944ebd821fd5e1bb2e89a26b">swh:1:rev:ef3bd4bee186be79944ebd821fd5e1bb2e89a26b</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hughes, 2022</xref>).

Each study was required to include samples from before and after first penile-vaginal sexual intercourse, but we did not require that there be pre- and post-first sex samples from each participant. Samples were required to be categorized as pre- or post-first sex based on participant report of ever engaging in penile-vaginal penetrative sex.

Individual participant data were verified by replicating analyses published in the prior manuscripts. Pre/post-first sex status was standardized across studies: in particular, one study included samples from participants reporting genital touching without penile-vaginal sexual intercourse. We categorized these samples as pre-first sex in accordance with our definition above. No personally identifiable information was obtained from the studies included in the meta-analysis.

In particular, pregnancy, CT infection, HSV-2 seropositivity, use of contraception, and elevated Nugent score are all known to affect cervicovaginal immune mediator concentrations. Because of this, we wished to know whether one or more of these factors was responsible for the differences we observed between pre- and post-first sex samples. To address this possibility, we repeated our analysis on a restricted sample set, excluding all samples where at the visit the participant was pregnant, positive for CT or HSV-2, reported using contraception, or had a Nugent score of 4 or greater. The analysis of these 137 samples (102 pre- and 35 post-first sex) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AB</xref>.

The strongest evidence was for IL-1β, IL-2, and CXCL8, but all measured immune mediators followed a similar pattern. In addition, we observed strong linear associations between time since first sex and immune mediator concentration, compared to flat levels over time pre-first sex. These results were tested with several analytical approaches: limiting to only paired samples, limiting to samples without known causes of inflammation (BV, STIs, or pregnancy), adjusting for socioeconomic cofactors, and adjusting for multiple comparisons, but with all of these methods, the increased levels of immune mediators post-sex remained consistent.</p><p>We further performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data, identifying two previous studies conducted in Belgium and the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jespers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghosh et al., 2018</xref>). Meta-analysis combining all three studies found that the start of sexual activity was associated with increased concentrations for 8/9 immune mediators, with particularly strong evidence for IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and CXCL8. The impressive agreement across these three studies strengthens the conclusion that the start of sexual activity is associated with increases in a wide range of CVT immune mediators.</p><p>While we observed a clear association between sexual activity and higher immune mediator concentrations, there is room for caution about whether the association is causal. For example, there could be differences in social determinants of health between the participants who do and do not engage in sexual activity. These differences were largely unmeasured in all three studies and may contribute to the changes we observed in immune mediator levels pre- and post-first sex. In our Kenyan study, we had information from the baseline visit about participant age, education, income, and housing. The effects of first sex on immune mediators remained the same after adjusting for these variables, suggesting that age, education, income, and housing at baseline do not explain the differences we observed. However, we did not assess these variables for changes over time, only at baseline.</p><p>The fully paired subset of our cohort (where participants provided pre- and post-samples) had smaller effect sizes than the full cohort. Most effects remained positive, but they were smaller in magnitude than in the primary analysis, and all were non-significant. A possible explanation for the smaller effects is that immune mediator concentrations increase over time post-first sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The post-first sex samples in the fully paired subset were collected sooner after first sex (median 32 days) than those from the participants who provided only post-first sex samples (median 157 days). Thus, the effects may have been weaker in the fully paired subset, in part, because the samples were obtained such a short time after first sex. Another possible explanation for the smaller effects is unmeasured confounding in the full cohort. Because participants in this subset provided both pre- and post-first sex samples, the subset largely controls for unmeasured confounding factors. These unmeasured factors could have inflated the effect sizes in the full cohort. A future study with a larger number of participants followed from pre- to post-first sex and with additional specimens collected for a longer period of time post-sex would be necessary to resolve this uncertainty.</p><p>While it has long been suspected that sexual activity induces CVT changes, our study, with post-first sex samples collected a median of only 66 days after first sex, clarifies that the association of inflammatory changes with sexual activity occurs very early after the start of sexual activity. In addition to an early start of the inflammatory changes post-first sex, we observed an accumulation over time. The rates of increase over time varied between immune mediators, but on average indicated a doubling in concentration within about 5 months. For example, the immune mediator with the median rate of increase was CCL20 and it increased by 0.69 log2 pg/mL per 100 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, the association appears even without any incipient BV or STI, and might need to be considered a normal component of sexual activity.</p><p>The observed increases in inflammation may be important clinically in modifying risk of STI acquisition and in promoting fertility. There has been speculation that AGYW are at increased risk of STI due to physiological differences in the CVT compared to older women, in addition to behavioral risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hwang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Masson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McKinnon and Karim, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Venkatesh and Cu-Uvin, 2013</xref>). Our research shows that there is an association between starting to have sex and increases in immune mediator concentration. Whether the increase in immune mediators brings protection from or vulnerability to STIs is unclear. Increased inflammation may prepare the CVT to prevent infection upon exposure. At the same time, increased expression of inflammatory mediators may recruit CD4 T cells, increasing the abundance of HIV target cells and potentially the risk of HIV infection. In addition to preventing infection, immune mediators play important roles in implantation and pregnancy. Therefore, the associations we observed with increases in immune mediators and start of sexual activity may be relevant for fertility. For example, IL-6 induces sperm capacitation, increasing its fertilizing ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laflamme et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, trophoblast cells secrete immune mediators to attract and regulate immune cells within the placenta, which is a necessary process for successful pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mor et al., 2011</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mechanism of immune mediator increase</title><p>Several mechanisms may play a role in the association of sexual activity with increased CVT immune mediator concentrations: BV, semen exposure, vaginal practices including washing, and physical microtrauma.</p><p>Numerous studies show that BV is rare prior to first sex, increases after first sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tabrizi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fethers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fethers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fethers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Francis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Francis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mitchell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thoma et al., 2011a</xref>), is associated with recent sexual activity, and is associated with exposure to semen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gajer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jewanraj et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mngomezulu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thoma et al., 2011b</xref>). Therefore, vaginal bacteria may play a role in these increased immune mediator levels. Jespers et al. reported that the increased CVT cytokines they observed post-sex were partly mediated by increases in detection and concentration of <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> and <italic>Atopobium vaginae (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jespers et al., 2016</xref>). Our finding of higher IL-1α and IL-1β post-first sex is consistent with literature linking BV to increased CVT IL-1α and IL-1β. However, BV is also associated with reduced CXCL10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Masson et al., 2019</xref>), which conflicts with our finding of increased CXCL10 after first sex. Our data demonstrate conclusively that even when limited to only women with no BV, immune mediators were increased post-first sex. However, a leading hypothesis for increased CVT concentrations post-first sex may be the establishment of non-Lactobacillus bacterial populations.</p><p>Exposure to semen has been associated with increases in cervical leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pandya and Cohen, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thompson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharkey et al., 2012</xref>) and inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6 and CXCL10, in most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jewanraj et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mngomezulu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharkey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Francis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jespers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kyongo et al., 2012</xref>) but not all studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agnew et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakra et al., 2016</xref>).

Others have suggested that increases in immune mediators following exposure to semen may be a result of semen directly transferring cytokines into the CVT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deese et al., 2021</xref>). However, detection of immune mediators directly transferred by semen is unlikely to explain our results, because semen was rarely detected in our study (by Y-chromosome DNA and PSA).</p><p>Vaginal washing changes the microbiome and increases BV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lokken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Low et al., 2011</xref>).

However, exposure to semen may be necessary for the inflammatory response to intercourse, because condoms have been shown to block that response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharkey et al., 2012</xref>). Our study was unable to evaluate the role of microtrauma in the inflammatory response observed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strengths of our study include a large, well-characterized cohort with multiple specimens per participant. Our sampling technique allowed collection of CVL without a speculum exam, which improved the feasibility of this research in a population with limited sexual experience. In addition, our systematic review and meta-analysis place our results in the context of what is known in the literature and synthesize all three studies. Despite the diversity of these studies and populations, all three studies showed consistent results.</p><p>An important limitation of our study is possible misclassification of specimens from pre-sexual activity. It is important to note that all three cohorts presented here were specifically designed to assess the sexual activity of adolescents and used best practices in ascertaining this challenging key variable. Of the 123 samples where participants reported no sexual activity, we classified 12 (9.8%) as post-first sex based on STI, pregnancy, Y-chromosome, or PSA results. Misclassification of specimens as pre/post-first sex is a challenge in this field, which we did our best to mitigate, but residual misclassification is possible.</p><p>In a secondary analysis, we removed all samples where the participant used contraception, was pregnant, had a Nugent score above 3, or was positive for HSV-2 or CT. The results of this analysis were similar to our primary, univariate analysis of the full cohort. These factors have complex relationships with sexual activity: Each can be caused by sexual activity and several of these variables could also be influenced (in part) by changes in immune mediator level. Thus, they may mediate the effect of sex on immune mediator levels, or they may be a consequence of it. Our goal with this secondary analysis was not to precisely estimate the direct effect of beginning sexual activity in the absence of these factors, but rather to determine whether these factors solely explained our results. Because the effects remained after removing these samples, we conclude that these factors by themselves do not solely explain the results we observed.</p><p>We observed similar results across three different studies in both low- and high-income settings. The largest limitation is that the total sample size across all three studies was less than 500 AGYW. Our study did include a number of cases of chlamydia and BV, increasing its generalizability, given the commonness of these conditions. However, our study notably included few cases of HSV-2, a very common STI, which may reduce its generalizability if HSV-2 modifies the effect of sexual activity on immune mediators. Similarly, we excluded a small number of samples due to trichomonas or gonorrhea infection or active local HSV-1/HSV-2 production because there were too few samples to reliably analyze. Moreover, our Kenyan cohort included little socioeconomic diversity, with participants being similar in income, housing, education, and ethnicity but still revealed similar results to AGYW on other continents.</p><p>We observed higher total protein concentrations in the post-first sex samples, translating to smaller differences between pre- and post-first sex groups when immune mediator concentrations were normalized to total protein. It is possible that the increases in total protein concentration post-first sex are associated with the general increases in immune mediators observed post-first sex. However, immune mediators remained higher post-first sex even after normalizing to total protein, so global protein upregulation does not completely explain this phenomenon.</p><p>The three studies included in the meta-analysis differed in important ways which could affect comparability. These differences included country of origin, presence of BV in the population, sample collection method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dezzutti et al., 2011</xref>), and immunoassay platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chowdhury et al., 2009</xref>). However, statistical heterogeneity was low to moderate for most immune mediators, indicating that the between-study variability was largely what would be expected due to random sampling. The high statistical heterogeneity for TNF-α indicates a need for further study of that mediator. Because we obtained the raw individual participant data from each study, we were able to analyze all three studies using the same methods, which improves their comparability.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We identified consistent increases in cervicovaginal immune mediators among participants after first penile-vaginal sexual intercourse. The dynamic nature of the inflammatory milieu after sexual activity may be a catalyst for changes that could promote acquisition of STIs. Because these specimens are from AGYW with little pre-existing BV or STI, our research is suggestive that this inflammatory milieu may provide risk independent of STIs or vaginal dysbiosis. Further research should focus on the exact causes of inflammation associated with first sex and assess whether this inflammation is potentially harmful or whether it offers any benefits. We envision that this information will contribute to expanding our toolset in the fight against the high STI susceptibility observed in AGYW.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Kenneth Ngure was supported by the International AIDS Society to attend AIDS 2022.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Ricardo Azziz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Please consider and discuss the potential for unmeasured confounding and mediation in the analysis, with potentially changes to the regression models in response to reviewer comments.</p><p>2. Please temper causal claims in the abstract and Discussion and provide further discussion as to alternative potential explanations for the findings.</p><p>3. Provide further description in the methods of the spline analysis.</p><p>4. Discuss the consistency in effect sizes between the paired and unpaired analyses.</p><p>5. Provide further discussion on whether there was difficulty in obtaining pre-sex samples from women, and whether there is a potential for selection bias due to unrepresentative sampling prior to sex.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The authors use causal language throughout the paper, implying that sex increases the level of immune markers. While they are welcome to hypothesize this in the discussion, I would suggest being more cautious when describing the results in the main text, abstract, and title and use more descriptive language instead (Cervicovaginal immune mediators are higher in vaginal samples of women who report having initiated sex, rather than &quot;Cervicovaginal immune mediators increase when young women begin to have sexual intercourse&quot; – increase is a verb that implies causality), given the observational nature of the study and the potential for bias. I would suggest discussing more of the possibility of the biases mentioned below.</p><p>– In Table 1 I would have liked to see more demographic and socioeconomic variables measured in the study. As mentioned, studies of sexual behavior are very vulnerable to confounding due to social determinants of health. While it is possible that these variables are not different in pre- and post- sex samples in this study, it is necessary to show this for the reader to assess whether there is a potential for confounding.</p><p>– The variables included in the multivariate model are not appropriate if the objective is to adjust for confounders, as many of the variables are not confounders and are rather mediators or potentially downstream effects of immune markers. Adjusting for these would lead to a biased estimate of the causal effect of vaginal sex. The authors should take more time to reflect on the potential causal relationships between these variables and how they influence their analysis. Some reflections:</p><p>– Age: is the most clear-cut confounder in this analysis and should certainly be included in the model, as age influences sexual behavior and is likely to be correlated with levels of immune markers.</p><p>– Menstrual phase: is appropriate to include in the model despite not necessarily meeting the traditional definition of a confounder. The menstrual phase is unlikely to influence the initiation of sex. However, there may be chance differences in menstrual phase between samples pre- and post-sex that may warrant adjustment. As the menstrual phase is not a mediator or a downstream effect of sex, adjustment for this variable will not bias results.</p><p>– Pregnancy and contraception: these variables are potential mediators on the causal pathway between initiation of sex and levels of immune markers, and should not be included in the model. If the objective of the authors is to measure only the direct (non-mediated) effect of sex, then a more complex mediation analysis would be needed to disentangle the effects of sex, pregnancy, and contraception, and the model would need to include potential confounders which are associated with pregnancy and contraception use (ex. socioeconomic variables).</p><p>– Nugent score, Chlamydia infection, and HSV-2 seropositivity: these are complex variables that could be both mediators of the effects of sex but also downstream effects of changes in levels of immune markers. It is therefore problematic to adjust for these as they are potentially colliders on the causal pathway, and adjustment would potentially lead to selection (collider) bias. See the article by Hernán (Hernán A Structural Approach to Selection Bias, Epidemiology: 2004 – Volume 15 – Issue 5 – p 615-625 https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ede.0000135174.63482.43), especially figures 3-4.</p><p>– Unmeasured confounders: there is potentially some residual unmeasured confounding from variables which influence sexual initiation and which also potentially influence immune response which are not included in the model. The most likely are variables related to social determinants of health (socioeconomic status, ethnicity, etc.). If the authors have access to these variables from the original study, they should consider their inclusion in the model, especially if they are strongly correlated with sexual initiation.</p><p>– The strongest evidence that there is likely to be potential selection bias and unmeasured confounding in the main (unpaired) analysis comes from the paired analysis, where the point estimates for the effect sizes are much smaller than in the main analysis. I think this analysis is the strongest analysis in the paper and am surprised in fact that this was not considered as the main analysis. The authors should discuss the results from this analysis more, as the paired analysis controls for many of the unmeasured confounders that would bias the results in the main analysis, so the results from this analysis are more likely to be valid estimates of causal effect than the results from the unpaired analysis.</p><p>– While the analysis for effect of time in Figure 4 is interesting, I would have liked to see p-values for the spline effect in the model. It is easy to fit different curves pre- and post-sex, but it does not necessarily follow that the addition of a spline leads to a significant improvement in the model performance. If the p-values for the spline are not significant, it would suggest the data does not support that there is an effect of time since initiating sex. Furthermore, this analysis should be described in the methods, I did not see this analysis described anywhere.</p><p>– The analysis of the correlation between estimates from different models (Figure 5D) has no analytical utility and should be removed. It is expected the results from different models would be correlated as they are based on the same data. High correlation between estimates from different analyses does not mean that the results or the model structure is valid; the validity of an analysis is based on subject matter knowledge and consideration of whether the analysis is appropriate for the question at hand. This analysis is therefore not informative.</p><p>– The logistic and linear regressions provide different information about the data; the logistic regression informs us on whether a particular marker is more likely to be detected in post-sex samples, whereas the linear regression informs us on whether the level of a marker is higher in post-sex samples. I would have therefore been interested in seeing the results from both regression models for all of the markers, instead of showing the linear regression results for some and the logistic regression results for others.</p><p>– I think Figure 3 is a good way to present results (multiplicative change in marker levels). I would suggest also adding the point estimates of the ratios and their confidence intervals on the right-hand side of each estimate (forest plot style), as the ratio estimates are more intuitive than the regression coefficients in Table 2. Also, the figures should distinguish between the scale of the axes (log 2) vs the units of the axes. Usually, the parentheses in the labels are used to indicate the axis units. The (log2) in the label may therefore confuse readers, as the axes do not show the effect of an increase in a log2 unit, but the ratios pre- vs. post-sex on a log2 scale. This could be better explained in the legend.</p><p>– Figure 5C and 5D appear to be mislabeled.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– How easy technically to get CVL from AGYW pre-first sex? How is it possible to discern the impact of the sampling on the mediators?</p><p>– Why exclude STIs if these can be controlled for in the MV models? Also unclear why differentiating sexual activity and STIs is so critical if the effects of both often co-occur after sexual activity is initiated. Perhaps this makes sense since STIs were rare, but it seems like it could affect generalizability.</p><p>– The sensitivity analysis of participants sampled only pre- and post- sex is a strength, as this comparison will likely reduce heterogeneity between individuals. Here the focus should be less on P-values and more on consistency between effect sizes. A correlation is presented, but this could be heterogeneous because of estimates being stronger or weaker in the paired analysis. Therefore it may make more sense to compare these on a case-by-case basis, depending on the consistency in these trends.</p><p>– Abstract- doesn't make sense to say a &quot;median&quot; 54% increase, as the % increase will mean something different for different markers, depending on their individual distributions. Markers with wider distributions will naturally have great % increases.</p><p>– Re the 57 samples reported after first sex, and the 12 samples deemed as such due to pregnancy, presence of semen biomarkers, STIs etc- is the assumption that the 12 samples did not overlap with the 57, e.g. represent under-reporting of first sex?</p><p>– In figure 5, even though most covariates didn't affect the estimates, would some of these be considered possible &quot;mediators&quot; as opposed to &quot;confounders&quot;. E.g. BV has been associated with lower CXCL10 levels, so changes in BV post sex (which has also been shown) could lead to decreases in some of these key chemokines. This is worth considering, in particular since participants were sampled for the most part a long time before/after sex. It does appear in the Discussion. Is there clear enough evidence to conclude that the effects are unlikely to be due to sex alone? The Discussion of this on page 16 re: CXCL10 does not seem to match how the data are presented.</p><p>– Adjusting for protein concentration- certainly worth reporting this increases post-sex, but could this be due to general increases in inflammation following sex.</p><p>– Bottom of page 12, paragraph starting with &quot;The specimens from the fully-paired…&quot; – it is unclear what the point of this paragraph is.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78565.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We collected CVL specimens without the use of a speculum exam, which made it more feasible to collect pre-sex specimens. In addition, we used the meta-analysis as a further way to verify results from outside of our own cohort to try to assess whether these results were applicable in other geographic populations and with different laboratories. We feel satisfied that our cohort results are similar to other cohorts in our meta-analysis. This issue is further discussed in the response to reviewer 2 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The authors use causal language throughout the paper, implying that sex increases the level of immune markers. While they are welcome to hypothesize this in the discussion, I would suggest being more cautious when describing the results in the main text, abstract, and title and use more descriptive language instead (Cervicovaginal immune mediators are higher in vaginal samples of women who report having initiated sex, rather than &quot;Cervicovaginal immune mediators increase when young women begin to have sexual intercourse&quot; – increase is a verb that implies causality), given the observational nature of the study and the potential for bias. I would suggest discussing more of the possibility of the biases mentioned below.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the language throughout describing the results as an association rather than suggesting causality. These changes are tracked in the revised manuscript; many were very small modifications of sentences, so we have not reproduced them here.</p><p>We added two paragraphs to the Discussion (pages 18-19) where we give a more nuanced assessment of the possibility of causality as well as alternative explanations for the results we observed. These paragraphs read as follows:</p><p>“While we observed a clear association between sexual activity and higher immune mediator concentrations, there is room for caution about whether the association is causal. For example, there could be differences in social determinants of health between the participants who do and do not engage in sexual activity. These differences were largely unmeasured in all three studies and may contribute to the changes we observed in immune mediator levels pre- and post-first sex. In our Kenyan study, we had information from the baseline visit about participant age, education, income, and housing. The effects of first sex on immune mediators remained the same after adjusting for these variables, suggesting that age, education, income, and housing at baseline do not explain the differences we observed. However, we did not assess these variables for changes over time, only at baseline.</p><p>“The fully paired subset of our cohort (where participants provided pre and post samples) had smaller effect sizes than the full cohort. Most effects remained positive, but they were smaller in magnitude than in the primary analysis and all were non-significant. A possible explanation for the smaller effects is that immune mediator concentrations increase over time post-first sex (Figure 4). The post-first sex samples in the fully paired subset were collected sooner after first sex (median 32 days) than those from the participants who provided only post-first sex samples (median 157 days). Thus, the effects may have been weaker in the fully paired subset, in part, because the samples were obtained such a short time after first sex. Another possible explanation for the smaller effects is unmeasured confounding in the full cohort. Because participants in this subset provided both pre- and post-first sex samples, the subset largely controls for unmeasured confounding factors. These unmeasured factors could have inflated the effect sizes in the full cohort. A future study with a larger number of participants followed from pre- to post-first sex and with additional specimens collected for a longer period of time post-sex would be necessary to resolve this uncertainty.”</p><p>We changed the title to “Starting to have sexual intercourse is associated with increases in cervicovaginal immune mediators in young women: a prospective study and meta-analysis”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Table 1 I would have liked to see more demographic and socioeconomic variables measured in the study. As mentioned, studies of sexual behavior are very vulnerable to confounding due to social determinants of health. While it is possible that these variables are not different in pre- and post- sex samples in this study, it is necessary to show this for the reader to assess whether there is a potential for confounding.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the helpful comments about social determinants of health both here and throughout this review. We have added information about education, income, rural/urban residence, and roof material (an indicator of poverty) to Table 1 (page 7). These questions were only asked at the enrollment visit. In addition, we now state that all participants were Black Africans assigned female at birth (page 6). Kenyan ethnicity was not collected from participants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The variables included in the multivariate model are not appropriate if the objective is to adjust for confounders, as many of the variables are not confounders and are rather mediators or potentially downstream effects of immune markers. Adjusting for these would lead to a biased estimate of the causal effect of vaginal sex. The authors should take more time to reflect on the potential causal relationships between these variables and how they influence their analysis. Some reflections:</p><p>– Age: is the most clear-cut confounder in this analysis and should certainly be included in the model, as age influences sexual behavior and is likely to be correlated with levels of immune markers.</p><p>– Menstrual phase: is appropriate to include in the model despite not necessarily meeting the traditional definition of a confounder. The menstrual phase is unlikely to influence the initiation of sex. However, there may be chance differences in menstrual phase between samples pre- and post-sex that may warrant adjustment. As the menstrual phase is not a mediator or a downstream effect of sex, adjustment for this variable will not bias results.</p><p>– Pregnancy and contraception: these variables are potential mediators on the causal pathway between initiation of sex and levels of immune markers, and should not be included in the model. If the objective of the authors is to measure only the direct (non-mediated) effect of sex, then a more complex mediation analysis would be needed to disentangle the effects of sex, pregnancy, and contraception, and the model would need to include potential confounders which are associated with pregnancy and contraception use (ex. socioeconomic variables).</p><p>– Nugent score, Chlamydia infection, and HSV-2 seropositivity: these are complex variables that could be both mediators of the effects of sex but also downstream effects of changes in levels of immune markers. It is therefore problematic to adjust for these as they are potentially colliders on the causal pathway, and adjustment would potentially lead to selection (collider) bias. See the article by Hernán (Hernán A Structural Approach to Selection Bias, Epidemiology: 2004 – Volume 15 – Issue 5 – p 615-625 https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ede.0000135174.63482.43), especially figures 3-4.</p><p>– Unmeasured confounders: there is potentially some residual unmeasured confounding from variables which influence sexual initiation and which also potentially influence immune response which are not included in the model. The most likely are variables related to social determinants of health (socioeconomic status, ethnicity, etc.). If the authors have access to these variables from the original study, they should consider their inclusion in the model, especially if they are strongly correlated with sexual initiation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these insightful comments. In response, we made the following major changes:</p><p>1) Removed the multivariable model</p><p>2) Added a new multivariable model with a new model that adjusts for age, education, income, rural/urban residence, and roof material (proxy for household wealth). The effect sizes from this new model are very similar to the effect sizes from the univariate model.</p><p>a. Results page 13: “In addition, we sought to assess whether the differences between pre- and post-first sex would be explained by social determinants of health. There was limited diversity in our cohort in these variables, in particular in terms of race and ethnicity. We adjusted the models from our primary analysis for age, education, whether the participants reported a regular source of income, whether the participants lived in an urban or rural environment, and whether the participants lived in a home with a metal or tile roof (lacking such a roof being an indicator of poverty). As shown in Figure 5AB, the effect sizes from the multivariate models were similar to those from the univariate models, suggesting that these variables do not explain the results we observed.”</p><p>b. Discussion pages 18-19: Quoted two comments above.</p><p>3) Conducted a new univariate analysis on a subset of samples that were negative for pregnancy, contraception, BV, HSV-2, and CT. Our goal with this analysis was not to precisely estimate the direct effect of beginning sexual activity in the absence of these factors, but rather to determine whether these factors solely explained our results. Essentially we felt that if the differences between pre- and post-first sex completely disappeared when we removed these samples, then our results weren’t very interesting. That finding would indicate that it was just one of those factors causing the difference between pre- and post. Because the differences don’t disappear, we conclude that those factors are not the sole cause of the differences we observe – the differences must be caused by either beginning sexual intercourse or some other unmeasured variable(s).</p><p>a. Results page 12: “We next sought to determine whether the differences between pre- and post-first sex could be explained by co-variates that differed between the groups or that are known to affect immune mediator concentrations (Table 1). In particular, pregnancy, CT infection, HSV-2 seropositivity, use of contraception, and elevated Nugent score are all known to affect cervicovaginal immune mediator concentrations. Because of this, we wished to know whether one or more of these factors was responsible for the differences we observed between pre- and post-first sex samples. To address this possibility, we repeated our analysis on a restricted sample set, excluding all samples where at the visit the participant was pregnant, positive for CT or HSV-2, reported using contraception, or had a Nugent score of 4 or greater. The analysis of these 137 samples (102 pre- and 35 post-first sex) are shown in Figure 5AB. The effects remained positive for all immune mediators in this subset analysis, indicating that the differences we saw between pre- and post-first sex samples were not solely a result of acquisition of STIs or pregnancy.”</p><p>b. Discussion page 21: “In a secondary analysis, we removed all samples where the participant used contraception, was pregnant, had a Nugent score above 3, or was positive for HSV-2 or CT. The results of this analysis was similar to our primary, univariate analysis of the full cohort. These factors have complex relationships with sexual activity: Each can be caused by sexual activity and several of these variables could also be influenced (in part) by changes in immune mediator level. Thus, they may mediate the effect of sex on immune mediator levels or they may be a consequence of it. Our goal with this secondary analysis was not to precisely estimate the direct effect of beginning sexual activity in the absence of these factors, but rather to determine whether these factors solely explained our results. Because the effects remained after removing these samples, we conclude that these factors by themselves do not solely explain the results we observed.”</p><p>4) Removed claims that we have eliminated all important confounding factors and wrote a more nuanced paragraph about causality in the Discussion (quoted two comments above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The strongest evidence that there is likely to be potential selection bias and unmeasured confounding in the main (unpaired) analysis comes from the paired analysis, where the point estimates for the effect sizes are much smaller than in the main analysis.

We describe how this analysis suggests that the analysis of the full cohort may be over-estimating the effect. In addition, we describe how the shorter time since first sex in the fully-paired subset may also contribute to the smaller effect sizes. We conclude by recommending a larger paired study in the future with longer follow-up. The paragraph reads as follows (Discussion pages 18-19):</p><p>“The fully paired subset of our cohort (where participants provided pre and post samples) had smaller effect sizes than the full cohort. Most effects remained positive, but they were smaller in magnitude than in the primary analysis and all were non-significant. A possible explanation for the smaller effects is that immune mediator concentrations increase over time post-first sex (Figure 4). The post-first sex samples in the fully paired subset were collected sooner after first sex (median 32 days) than those from the participants who provided only post-first sex samples (median 157 days). Thus, the effects may have been weaker in the fully paired subset, in part, because the samples were obtained such a short time after first sex.

It is easy to fit different curves pre- and post-sex, but it does not necessarily follow that the addition of a spline leads to a significant improvement in the model performance. If the p-values for the spline are not significant, it would suggest the data does not support that there is an effect of time since initiating sex. Furthermore, this analysis should be described in the methods, I did not see this analysis described anywhere.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments about the spline analysis in Figure 4. In the first submission, we fit separate models pre- and post-first sex. In response to this comment, we changed to single models using linear splines, with a knot at day 0 (the day of first sex). This new analysis is shown in Figure 4. In addition, we added a new table (new Table 4; page 12), including the p-values for the time-dependent spline effects (of which 17/19 are significant at p&lt;0.05).</p><p>Results page 10-11: “As shown in Figure 4 and Table 4, immune mediator concentrations were generally stable for three years prior to first sex and then increased sharply in the year following first sex. The change in slope following first sex was statistically significant at p&lt;0.05 for 17/19 immune mediators. This pattern is consistent with cumulative increases in immune mediator concentrations following first sex.”</p><p>In addition, we have more thoroughly described this analysis in the Methods section. Thank you for pointing out that we had neglected to describe this analysis in the Methods.</p><p>Methods page 28: “We additionally wished to assess whether immune mediator concentrations changed over time with respect to the date of first sex. To assess this question, we fit mixed-effects models with linear splines, using days since first sex as a fixed effect and participant as a random effect, with the outcome being the concentration of immune mediator (log2 pg/mL). For the splines, we used a knot at day 0, which was the day of first sex.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The analysis of the correlation between estimates from different models (Figure 5D) has no analytical utility and should be removed. It is expected the results from different models would be correlated as they are based on the same data. High correlation between estimates from different analyses does not mean that the results or the model structure is valid; the validity of an analysis is based on subject matter knowledge and consideration of whether the analysis is appropriate for the question at hand.

I would have therefore been interested in seeing the results from both regression models for all of the markers, instead of showing the linear regression results for some and the logistic regression results for others.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason we used logistic regressions for low-detected immune mediators is that the distributions of the concentrations deviates strongly from the normal distribution when most samples are below the limit of detection. We didn’t feel that linear regression was appropriate in those cases and while logistic regression certainly provides different information, we felt that it was the best alternative. Similarly, we could not have performed logistic regression on every immune mediator, as several immune mediators were detected in every sample.</p><p>We have added a sentence to the methods explaining our rationale for this choice (page 28: “Logistic models were used for immune mediators with low levels of detection because the distributions become increasingly non-normal as more samples fall below the lower limit of detection”).</p><p>For completeness, the <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref> shows the results of linear and logistic models fit on every immune mediator. The Coef columns are the log2 difference for the linear models and the log-odds for the logistic model. The direction and significance of the changes overall are similar by both models. The coefficients have the same sign whether linear or logistic for every immune mediator except CCL5. The biggest p-value differences between models appear for immune mediators which were detected in most samples, which often had low p-values by linear analysis but had higher p-values by logistic analyses (IL6, CCL3, IL1b, CXCL10, CXCL9), presumably because such a small number of samples were undetectable for those immune mediators.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom"><bold>Linear</bold></th><th valign="bottom"><bold>Logistic</bold></th><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Assay</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Coef</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Std.

(multiplicative change in marker levels). I would suggest also adding the point estimates of the ratios and their confidence intervals on the right-hand side of each estimate (forest plot style), as the ratio estimates are more intuitive than the regression coefficients in Table 2. Also, the figures should distinguish between the scale of the axes (log 2) vs the units of the axes. Usually, the parentheses in the labels are used to indicate the axis units. The (log2) in the label may therefore confuse readers, as the axes do not show the effect of an increase in a log2 unit, but the ratios pre- vs. post-sex on a log2 scale. This could be better explained in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these helpful suggestions. We made the following changes:</p><p>– Relabeled the axes and improved the legends of Figures 3, 5, and 6</p><p>– Added ratios and CIs to the side of each estimate in Figure 3</p><p>– We did not add these values to Figures 5 or 6 because they would have made the figures too complicated. The values are available in Additional File 2 for both figures as well as in the forest plots in Additional File 6 for Figure 6.</p><p>– We also added the ratios and CIs to Tables 2, 3, and 5.

We have corrected this mistake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– How easy technically to get CVL from AGYW pre-first sex? How is it possible to discern the impact of the sampling on the mediators?</p></disp-quote><p>We used an innovative sampling technique that collected CVL without use of a speculum, which was thought to be unpleasant and unnecessary in AGYW pre-first sex. We placed a small amount of IV tubing in the fornix and instilled saline in that way, this was well tolerated. We have added a sentence to the Strengths and limitations section of the Discussion noting that this method made it technically possible to perform the study (page 20: “Our sampling technique allowed collection of CVL without a speculum exam, which improved the feasibility of this research in a population with limited sexual experience”).</p><p>In addition, we sought to recruit from a broad population. Our study used a community recruitment strategy and did not recruit from adolescents seeking clinical care, therefore we might have recruited youth who were uncomfortable with clinical procedures. We used the meta-analysis as a further way to verify results from outside of our own cohort to try to assess whether these results were applicable in other geographic populations and with different laboratories. We feel satisfied that our cohort results are similar to other cohorts in our meta-analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why exclude STIs if these can be controlled for in the MV models?</p></disp-quote><p>We excluded 5 samples due to rare STIs because we felt we could not accurately control for them in the multivariate models given the small sample sizes (n=1-2 per STI). We clarified this point in the Results section. However, we included samples with more common (in our cohort) STIs.</p><p>Excluded: Trichomonas (1 sample), Gonorrhea (1 sample), active genital HSV-1 infection (1 sample), active genital HSV-2 infection (2 samples), where “active” means DNA was detected in a genital sample.</p><p>Included: Chlamydia, HSV-1 seropositive, HSV-2 seropositive, (samples with BV were also included)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also unclear why differentiating sexual activity and STIs is so critical if the effects of both often co-occur after sexual activity is initiated. Perhaps this makes sense since STIs were rare, but it seems like it could affect generalizability.</p></disp-quote><p>Our goal was to determine if sexual activity itself affects the genital immune milieu. For that reason, we felt it was important to determine whether any changes were solely a result of STIs. If we had observed changes in the univariate model that disappeared after controlling for STIs, we would have concluded that cytokine changes post-first sex were only a result of STIs. Instead, we observed that the changes persisted, suggesting that they are associated with sexual activity itself (or some other unknown factor), but not specifically the STIs present in the cohort.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The sensitivity analysis of participants sampled only pre- and post- sex is a strength, as this comparison will likely reduce heterogeneity between individuals. Here the focus should be less on P-values and more on consistency between effect sizes. A correlation is presented, but this could be heterogeneous because of estimates being stronger or weaker in the paired analysis. Therefore it may make more sense to compare these on a case-by-case basis, depending on the consistency in these trends.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments. As also discussed in the response to Reviewer 1, we have removed the correlations. We have substantially expanded our discussion of this analysis and focused on comparing effect sizes in our interpretation. We have additionally tempered our claims of causality based on this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Abstract- doesn't make sense to say a &quot;median&quot; 54% increase, as the % increase will mean something different for different markers, depending on their individual distributions. Markers with wider distributions will naturally have great % increases.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this passage from the abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Re the 57 samples reported after first sex, and the 12 samples deemed as such due to pregnancy, presence of semen biomarkers, STIs etc- is the assumption that the 12 samples did not overlap with the 57, e.g. represent under-reporting of first sex?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out that this issue was confusing. We added a sentence to the Results clarifying that there were a total of 69 post-first sex samples (57 reported and 12 inferred based on test results). The relevant section (page 5) now reads:</p><p>“Of these, 111 samples from 75 participants were classified as pre-first sex and 57 samples from 45 participants were obtained after reported first sex. In addition, 12 samples from 8 participants were classified as post-sex due to presence of Y-chromosome DNA, PSA or because of pregnancy or a positive <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (CT) test at that visit or a prior visit. Thus, there were a total of 69 post-sex specimens from 53 participants.”</p><p>The (important!) issue of underreporting is discussed in the Strengths and limitations section of the Discussion:</p><p>Page 20-21: “An important limitation of our study is possible misclassification of specimens from pre-sexual activity. It is important to note that all three cohorts presented here were specifically designed to assess the sexual activity of adolescents and used best practices in ascertaining this challenging key variable. Of the 123 samples where participants reported no sexual activity, we classified 12 (9.8%) as post-first sex based on STI, pregnancy, Y-chromosome, or PSA results. Misclassification of specimens as pre/post-first sex is a challenge in this field, which we did our best to mitigate, but residual misclassification is possible.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In figure 5, even though most covariates didn't affect the estimates, would some of these be considered possible &quot;mediators&quot; as opposed to &quot;confounders&quot;. E.g. BV has been associated with lower CXCL10 levels, so changes in BV post sex (which has also been shown) could lead to decreases in some of these key chemokines. This is worth considering, in particular since participants were sampled for the most part a long time before/after sex. It does appear in the Discussion. Is there clear enough evidence to conclude that the effects are unlikely to be due to sex alone? The Discussion of this on page 16 re: CXCL10 does not seem to match how the data are presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments about certain co-variates being mediators rather than confounders. This issue was also raised by Reviewer 1. We have substantially changed our multivariate model and reworked the presentation and discussion of results pertaining to the covariates. We additionally added a new analysis of a subset of the full cohort containing only the subset of samples that were negative for pregnancy, contraception, BV, HSV-2, and CT. Because the effects remain positive in that subset, we conclude that these factors are not solely causing the effects we see. Rather, the effects likely derive from sex itself as well as possible unmeasured variables.</p><p>We removed the Discussion of CXCL10 because it derived from the earlier multivariable model, which is no longer in the paper. We agree with you about CXCL10: BV decreases CXCL10 and BV increases post-first sex. Though we still see an increase in CXCL10 post-first sex, BV is probably reducing its magnitude compared to the increase that would be seen without BV. Thoroughly disentangling these interactions is beyond the scope of this paper and set of samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Adjusting for protein concentration- certainly worth reporting this increases post-sex, but could this be due to general increases in inflammation following sex.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have added it to the Discussion on page 21: “It is possible that the increases in total protein concentration post-first sex are associated with the general increases in immune mediators observed post-first sex.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Bottom of page 12, paragraph starting with &quot;The specimens from the fully-paired…&quot; – it is unclear what the point of this paragraph is.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the purpose of this paragraph was not clear as written. The purpose was to discuss the comparability of specimens from the fully-paired subset to the rest of the specimens and we have rephrased the paragraph to make that clear (now on page 15).</p><p>“The specimens from the fully-paired subset were generally comparable to the specimens from the participants who only provided post specimens, with one important difference: the post specimens in the fully-paired subset were obtained sooner after reported date of first sex (p = 4.7E-8). In the fully-paired subset, the post-first sex samples came only about a month after first sex (median 31.5 days). In contrast, the post-first sex samples from the other participants came about four months after first sex (median 157 days). The age of the participants at the time of first sex, however, was similar (18.9 years in each subset, p = 0.90).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
