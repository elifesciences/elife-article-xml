groups of evolutionarily related genes. One large gene family that has experienced rapid evolution lies within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), whose proteins serve critical roles in innate and adaptive immunity. Across the ∼60 million year history of the primates, some MHC genes have turned over completely, some have changed function, some have converged in function, and others have remained essentially unchanged. Past work has typically focused on identifying MHC alleles within particular species or comparing gene content, but more work is needed to understand the overall evolution of the gene family across species. Thus, despite the immunologic importance of the MHC and its peculiar evolutionary history, we lack a complete picture of MHC evolution in the primates. We readdress this question using sequences from dozens of MHC genes and pseudogenes spanning the entire primate order, building a comprehensive set of gene and allele trees with modern methods. Overall, we find that the Class I gene subfamily is evolving much more quickly than the Class II gene subfamily, with the exception of the Class II MHC-DRB genes. We also pay special attention to the often-ignored pseudogenes, which we use to reconstruct different events in the evolution of the Class I region. We find that despite the shared function of the MHC across species, different species employ different genes, haplotypes, and patterns of variation to achieve a successful immune response. Our trees and extensive literature review represent the most comprehensive look into primate MHC evolution to date.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>MHC</kwd><kwd>gene family</kwd><kwd>phylogenetics</kwd><kwd>Major Histocompatibility Complex</kwd><kwd>Human Leukocyte Antigen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>P. cynocephalus</italic></kwd><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd><kwd>Primate</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HG011432</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fortier</surname><given-names>Alyssa Lyn</given-names></name><name><surname>Pritchard</surname><given-names>Jonathan K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HG008140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fortier</surname><given-names>Alyssa Lyn</given-names></name><name><surname>Pritchard</surname><given-names>Jonathan K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/021nxhr62</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1656518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fortier</surname><given-names>Alyssa Lyn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Major Histocompatibility Complex region evolves via gene birth-and-death, resulting in short-lived genes, rapidly expanding gene subfamilies, and many gene fragments.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene families are groups of related genes categorized by functional similarity or presumed evolutionary relatedness. Based on clustering of their proteins’ sequences, human genes fall into hundreds to thousands of distinct families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Gu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Li et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Demuth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Friedman and Hughes, 2003</xref>). Families originate from successive gene duplications, although particular gene copies or entire families can also be lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Nei et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Demuth et al., 2006</xref>). For example, there are hundreds of genes that are specific to human or chimpanzee and have no orthologs in the other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Demuth et al., 2006</xref>). This birth-and-death evolution is distinct from evolution at the nucleotide or protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Thornton and DeSalle, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Hahn et al., 2005</xref>). However, phylogenetics can still be applied to understand the relationships within families of genes, providing insight into speciation and specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Thornton and DeSalle, 2000</xref>).</p><p>One large gene family is united by a common protein structure called the ‘MHC fold’. Having originated in the jawed vertebrates, this group of genes is now involved in diverse functions including lipid metabolism, iron uptake regulation, and immune system function (proteins such as zinc-α2-glycoprotein [ZAG], human hemochromatosis protein [HFE], MHC class I chain–related proteins [MICA, MICB], and the CD1 family; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Hansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Kupfermann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Kaufman, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Adams and Luoma, 2013</xref>). However, here we focus on the Class I and Class II MHC genes whose protein products present peptides to T-cells (‘classical’ genes) and/or interact with other immune cell receptors like killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) or leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs; both ‘classical’ and ‘non-classical’ genes). The classical genes are conventionally known to be highly polymorphic, have an excess of missense variants, and even share alleles across species, all indicative of balancing selection at the allele level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Maccari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Maccari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Robinson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Hughes and Nei, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Hughes and Nei, 1989b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arden and Klein, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Mayer et al., 1988</xref>). In addition to variation within individual genes, the region is also significantly structurally divergent across the primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Mao et al., 2024</xref>). Balancing selection is evident at the haplotype level as well, where haplotypes with drastically different functional gene content are retained in various primate populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Hans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">de Groot et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">de Groot et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Gleimer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Heijmans et al., 2020</xref>). This motivates the need to study the MHC holistically as a gene family. Even though species may retain different sets of genes and haplotypes, related genes likely function similarly, facilitating comparisons across species. Thus, by treating the genes as a related set, our understanding improves significantly compared to considering single genes in isolation. Because gene family birth-and-death is important to speciation and the MHC itself is highly relevant to organismal health, this family is an excellent case study for gene family evolutionary dynamics. Here, we focus on the primates, spanning approximately 60 million years within the over 500 million-year evolution of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010</xref>).</p><p>There are two classes of MHC genes within the greater family (Class I and Class II), and each class contains two functionally distinct types of genes: ‘classical’ and ‘non-classical’. ‘Classical’ MHC molecules perform antigen presentation to T cells with variable <italic>αβ</italic> TCRs—a key part of adaptive immunity—while ‘non-classical’ molecules have niche immune roles. The classical Class I molecules are generally highly polymorphic, ubiquitously expressed, and present short, intracellularly derived peptides to T cells. Many of them also serve as ligands for other types of immune cell receptors and influence innate immunity (see Appendix 1; General roles of MHC and MHC-like genes; for an overview; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Parham and Moffett, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Guethlein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Hans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Wroblewski et al., 2019</xref>). The non-classical Class I molecules have limited polymorphism, restricted expression, and perform specific tasks such as mediating maternal-fetal interaction and monitoring levels of MHC synthesis. In humans, the classical Class I genes are HLA-A, -B, and -C, and the non-classical Class I genes are HLA-E, -F, and -G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Heijmans et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, the classical Class II molecules are expressed only on professional antigen-presenting cell types and present longer, extracellularly-derived peptides to T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Gfeller and Bassani-Sternberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Heijmans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Neefjes et al., 2011</xref>). The non-classical Class II molecules assist with loading peptides onto the classical Class II molecules before their transport to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Dijkstra and Yamaguchi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Neefjes et al., 2011</xref>). In humans, HLA-DP, -DQ, and -DR are the classical Class II molecules, and HLA-DM and -DO are the non-classical molecules (see Appendix 3 for more detail on all of these genes).</p><p>However, the landscape of MHC genes differs even across closely related species. Over evolutionary time, the Class I gene subfamily has been extraordinarily plastic, having undergone repeated expansions, neofunctionalizations, and losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Hans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Wilming et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Otting et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Heijmans et al., 2020</xref>). Convergent evolution has also occurred; in different primate lineages, the same gene may be inactivated, acquire a new function, or even evolve similar splice variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Hans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Wilming et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Otting et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Heijmans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Walter, 2020</xref>). As a result, it is often difficult to detect orthologous relationships in Class I even within the primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Hughes and Nei, 1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Piontkivska and Nei, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Go et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Flügge et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">de Groot et al., 2020</xref>). Studies that focus only on the highly polymorphic binding-site-encoding exons are complicated by these phenomena, necessitating a more comprehensive look into MHC evolution across exons and species groups.</p><p>In contrast to Class I, the Class II region has been largely stable across the primates, but gene content still varies in other species. For example, the pig has lost the MHC-DP genes while expanding the number of MHC-DR genes, and the cat has lost both the MHC-DQ and -DP genes, relying entirely on MHC-DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Hammer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Okano et al., 2020</xref>). The use of the different Class II molecules appears to be fluid, at least over longer timescales, motivating the need to fill in the gaps in knowledge in the primate tree.</p><p>Due to the large volume of existing MHC literature, results are scattered across hundreds of papers, each presenting findings from a limited number of species or genes. Thus, we first performed an extensive literature review to identify the genes and haplotypes known to be present in different primate species. We present a detailed summary of these genes and their functions in Appendix 3. We also performed a <italic>BLAST</italic> search using a custom IPD-based MHC allele database against several available reference genomes to discover which genes were present on various primate reference haplotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our <italic>BLAST</italic> search and our search of NCBI RefSeq confirmed the presence of various genes in several species for the first time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> show the landscape of MHC genes present in different primate species for Class I and Class II, respectively. The inclusion of sequences from dozens of new species across all genes and the often-ignored pseudogenes helps us paint a more detailed picture of MHC evolution in the primates.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Class I MHC genes present in different species.</title><p>The primate evolutionary tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Kuderna et al., 2023</xref>) is shown on the left-hand side (nonprimate icons are shown in beige).

These trees permit us to explore the overall evolution of the gene family and relationships between genes, as well as trace particular allelic lineages over time. Across the trees, we see examples of rapid gene turnover over just a few million years, evidence for long-term balancing selection retaining allelic lineages, and slowly evolving genes where orthology is retained for long time periods. In this paper, we describe broad-scale differences between classes and discuss some specific results about the relationships between genes. In a companion paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Fortier and Pritchard, 2025</xref>), we explore the patterns of polymorphism within individual genes, finding evidence for deep trans-species polymorphism at multiple genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Data</title><p>We collected MHC nucleotide sequences for all genes from the IPD-MHC/HLA database, a large repository for MHC alleles from humans, non-human primates, and other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Maccari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Maccari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Robinson et al., 2024</xref>). Although extensive, this database includes few or no sequences from several key lineages including the gibbon, tarsier, and lemur. Thus, we supplemented our set of alleles using sequences from NCBI RefSeq (see asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Because the MHC genes make up an evolutionarily related family, they can all be aligned. Using MUSCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Edgar, 2004</xref>), we aligned all Class I sequences together, all Class IIA sequences together, and all Class IIB sequences together. We then constructed trees for various subsets of these sequences using <italic>BEAST2</italic>, a Bayesian MCMC phylogenetic inference method (see Materials and methods; Bayesian phylogenetic analysis for more detail; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bouckaert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bouckaert et al., 2019</xref>). One major advantage of <italic>BEAST2</italic> over less tunable methods is that it can allow evolutionary rates to vary across sites, which is important for genes such as these which experience rapid evolution in functional regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). We also considered each exon separately to minimize the impact of recombination as well as to compare and contrast the binding-site-encoding exons with non-binding-site-encoding exons. We did not analyze the introns due to a lack of available data and difficulty aligning intron sequences across genes.</p><p>Here, we present these densely sampled Bayesian phylogenetic trees which include sequences from 106 species and dozens of MHC genes. In this paper, we focus on the Class I, Class IIA, and Class IIB multi-gene trees and discuss overall relationships between genes. Our companion paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Fortier and Pritchard, 2025</xref>) explores individual clades/gene groups within these multi-gene trees to understand allele relationships and assess support for trans-species polymorphism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The MHC across the primates</title><p>The MHC is a particularly dynamic example of a gene family due to intense selective pressure driven by host-pathogen co-evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ebert and Fields, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Radwan et al., 2020</xref>). Within the family, genes have duplicated, changed function, and been lost many times in different lineages. As a result, even closely related species can have different sets of MHC genes. Thus, while the MHC has been extensively studied in humans, there is a limit to how much we can learn from a single species. Leveraging information from other species helps us understand the evolution of the entire family and provides key context as to how it currently operates in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams and Parham, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Thornton and DeSalle, 2000</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, we compare the genes present in different species. In both, each column represents an orthologous gene, while the left-hand side shows the evolutionary tree for primates and our closest non-primate relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Foley et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Kuderna et al., 2023</xref>). Humans are part of the ape clade (red label), which is most closely related to the old-world monkeys (OWM; blue label). Next, the ape/OWM clade is most closely related to the new-world monkeys (NWM; orange label), and the ape/OWM/NWM clade is collectively known as the <italic>Simiiformes</italic>. Only species with rows highlighted in gray have had their MHC regions extensively studied (and thus only for these rows is the absence of a gene symbol meaningful). Gene presence in each species is indicated by symbols in each column, and the symbols also indicate the function of the gene and whether it is fixed in the species. Symbols with an asterisk indicate contributions from this work.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows that not all Class I genes are shared by apes and OWM, and much fewer are shared between apes/OWM and NWM. Genes have also been differently expanded in different lineages. While humans and most other apes have a single copy of each gene, the OWM and NWM have multiple copies of nearly all genes. Additionally, many genes exhibit functional plasticity; for example, MHC-G is a non-classical gene in the apes and a pseudogene in the OWM (it is not 1:1 orthologous to NWM MHC-G). The differences between even closely related primate groups indicate that the Class I region is evolving very rapidly.</p><p>In contrast, the Class II genes are more stable, as the same genes can be found in even distantly related mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The notable exception to this pattern is the MHC-DRB group of genes, indicated by dark blue symbols in the middle of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. While some of the individual MHC-DRB genes are orthologous between apes and OWM, indicated by symbols in the same column (e.g. MHC-DRB5), others are limited to the apes alone (e.g. MHC-DRB2). Furthermore, no individual MHC-DRB genes (with the possible exception of MHC-DRB9) are shared between apes/OWM and NWM, pointing to their extremely rapid evolution. Aside from MHC-DRB, the other genes have been relatively stable, although there have been expansions in certain lineages—such as separate duplications of the MHC-DQA and -DQB genes in apes/OWM, NWM, and mouse lemur. Thus, both of the MHC Class I and Class II gene subfamilies appear to be subject to birth-and-death evolution, with Class I and MHC-DRB undergoing the process more rapidly than non-DRB Class II.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Evolution of a gene family</title><p>Now that we had a better picture of the landscape of MHC genes present in different primates, we wanted to understand the genes’ relationships.

This exon is the least likely to be affected by convergent evolution, making its tree’s structure easier to interpret. This tree—which contains hundreds of tips—has been further simplified for visualization purposes by collapsing clades of related tips, although two fully-expanded clades are shown in panels B and C. We find that sequences do not always assort by locus, as would be expected for a typical gene. For example, ape MHC-J is separated from OWM MHC-J, which is more closely related to ape/OWM MHC-G. Meanwhile, NWM MHC-G does not group with ape/OWM MHC-G, instead falling outside of the clade containing ape/OWM MHC-A, -G, -J, and -K. This supports the fact that the NWM MHC-G genes are broadly orthologous to a large group of genes which expanded within the ape/OWM lineage, rather than being directly orthologous to the ape/OWM MHC-G genes. Appendix 3 explains each of these genes in detail, including previous work and findings from this study.</p><p>However, some clades/genes do behave in the expected fashion; that is, with their subtrees matching the overall species tree. One such gene is non-classical MHC-F, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. Although the gene has duplicated in the common marmoset (Caja-F), this subtree closely matches the species tree shown in the upper right. This indicates that MHC-F is truly 1:1 orthologous across apes, OWM, and NWM. Orthology between apes and OWM (but not with NWM) is also observed for pseudogenes MHC-L, -K, -J, and -V and non-classical MHC-E and -G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). For the other NWM genes, orthology with apes/OWM is less clear.</p><p>While genes such as MHC-F have trees which closely match the overall species tree, other genes show markedly different patterns, such as NWM MHC-G. This gene group is broadly orthologous to a large set of ape/OWM genes and pseudogenes, as its ancestor expanded independently in both lineages. In NWM, the many functional MHC-G genes are classical, and there are also a large number of MHC-G-related pseudogenes. Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, NWM MHC-G sequences do not always group by species (colored box with abbreviation), instead forming mixed-species clades. Thus, while some MHC-G duplications appear to have occurred prior to speciation events within the NWM, others are species-specific. Similar patterns of expansion are seen among the MHC-A and -B genes of the OWM and the MHC-B genes of the NWM, indicating rapid evolution of many of the Class I genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>).</p><p>Now turning to the Class II genes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows summary trees for exon 3 (non-PBR) for the Class IIA and IIB sequence sets. In the Class II genes, exon 3 does not encode the binding site and is thus less likely to be affected by convergent evolution. In contrast to Class I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), Class II sequences group entirely and unambiguously by gene, shown by the collapsed trees in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. However, the subtrees for each gene exhibit varying patterns. As with Class I, non-classical genes tend to evolve in a ‘typical’ fashion with sequences assorting according to the species tree. This is clearly the case for non-classical MHC-DMA, -DMB, -DOA, and -DOB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). MHC-DRA and -DPA—although classical—also follow this pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the other classical genes’ subtrees look very different from the species tree.</p><p>There are several reasons why particular MHC gene trees can differ from the overall species tree. Incomplete lineage sorting can happen purely by chance, especially if species have recently diverged. However, balancing selection can cause alleles to be longer-lived, resulting in incomplete lineage sorting even among deeply diverged species; this is called trans-species polymorphism (TSP). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> illustrates this phenomenon for MHC-DPB. Within the OWM clade (shades of green), sequences group by allelic lineage (see Appendix 2 for details on allele nomenclature) rather than by species. For example, crab-eating macaque allele Mafa-DPB1*09:02:01:01 groups with green monkey allele Chsa-DPB1*09:01 (both members of the DPB1*09 lineage) rather than with the other macaque alleles (Mane-, Mamu-, Math-, and Malo-DPB1), despite the fact that these species are 15 million years separated from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Kuderna et al., 2023</xref>). We see this pattern in many Class II genes and some Class I genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplements 8</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">10</xref>). In our companion paper, we explore each of these genes further and evaluate the strength of support for TSP in each gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Fortier and Pritchard, 2025</xref>).</p><p>Another way to obtain discordant trees is in the case of recent expansions of genes. Such expansions make it difficult to assign sequences to loci, resulting in clades where sequences (ostensibly from the same locus) do not group by species. An example of this is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> for the NWM Class I gene MHC-G; long-read sequencing of more NWM haplotypes will help to identify individual genes. The Class II MHC-DRB genes have also expanded, although locus assignments are somewhat clearer. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> shows the Class II subtree for MHC-DRB, where ape sequences (red/orange boxes) are interspersed with OWM sequences (green boxes). The MHC-DRB genes have specific named loci (e.g. MHC-DRB1 or -DRB2), but in this tree only MHC-DRB5 sequences group by named locus (the collapsed ape/OWM MHC-DRB5 clade can be found about 1/3 from the bottom of the tree). The failure of the other named loci to group together indicates a lack of 1:1 orthology between apes, OWM, and NWM for these genes, meaning their names reflect previously observed functional similarity more than evolutionary relatedness. This rapid evolution makes the MHC-DRB genes unique among the Class II genes. Therefore, we created a ‘focused’ tree with more MHC-DRB sequences in order to explore the evolution of this subgroup further, which is presented in a later section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>).</p><p>Gene conversion is a third way that gene trees might differ from the overall species tree. Gene conversion is the unidirectional copying of a sequence onto a similar sequence (usually another allele or a related locus), which results in two sequences being unusually similar even if they are not related by descent. We consider this possibility in the next section.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Detection of gene conversion</title><p>Because the MHC contains many related genes in close proximity, gene conversion—the unidirectional exchange of sequence between two similar sequences—can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). We used the program GENECONV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Sawyer, 1999</xref>) to infer pairs of sequences of which one has likely been converted by the other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). We recovered known gene conversion events, such as between human allelic lineages HLA-B*38 and HLA-B*67:02, as well as novel events, such as between gorilla allelic lineages Gogo-B*01 and Gogo-B*03 and ape/OWM lineages MHC-DQA1*01 and MHC-DQA1*05.</p><p>However, most of the GENECONV tracts implicated the same pair of loci but in many different groups of species. We interpreted these as gene conversion events that must have happened a long time ago in the early history of the two genes, and they are likely to blame for the topological differences from exon to exon among the trees. For example, in exon 2, the Class I pseudogene MHC-K groups with MHC-G, while in exon 3, it groups with MHC-F, and in exon 4, it groups outside of MHC-G, -J, and -A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The uncertain early branching structure we observe in our trees may be due to these ancient gene conversion events.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The importance of the pseudogenization process</title><p>Gene birth-and-death drives the evolution of a gene family as a whole. The ‘death’ can include the deletion of all or part of a gene from the genome or pseudogenization by means of inactivating mutations, which can leave gene remnants behind. In Class I, we find many pseudogenes that have been produced in this process; while countless more have undoubtedly already been deleted from primate genomes, many full-length and fragment pseudogenes still remain. Although non-functional, these sequences provide insight into the granular process of birth-and-death as well as improve tree inference.</p><p>Full Class I haplotypes including the pseudogenes are known only for human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and macaque, and even so we do not have sequences for <italic>all</italic> the balanced haplotypes in each species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Anzai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Wilming et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Shiina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Karl et al., 2023</xref>). From these studies, we know that few functional Class I genes are shared by apes/OWMs and NWMs, and so far, no shared pseudogenes have been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Lugo and Cadavid, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Kono et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cadavid et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Maccari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Maccari et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the Class I genes in the two groups have been generated by a largely separate series of duplications, neofunctionalizations, and losses. This means that turnover has occurred on a relatively short timescale, and understanding the pseudogenes within the apes and OWM can thus shed light on the evolution of the region more granularly. These ancient remnants could provide clues as to when genes or whole blocks were duplicated, which regions are more prone to duplication, and how the MHC may have functioned in ancestral species.</p><p>The Class I MHC region is further divided into three polymorphic blocks—α, κ, and β—that each contain MHC genes but are separated by well-conserved non-MHC genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Kulski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dawkins et al., 1999</xref>). The majority of the Class I genes are located in the α-block, which in humans includes 12 MHC genes and pseudogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Shiina et al., 2017</xref>). The α-block also contains a large number of repetitive elements and gene fragments belonging to other gene families, and their specific repeating pattern in humans led to the conclusion that the region was formed by successive block duplications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Shiina et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Kulski et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Kulski et al., 2000</xref>). Later, comparison of macaque and chimpanzee α-block haplotypes with the sequenced human haplotype bolstered this hypothesis, although the proposed series of events is not always consistent with phylogenetic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Kulski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Kulski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Geraghty et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Hughes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Messer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alexandrov et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Gleimer et al., 2011</xref>; see Appendix 3 for more detail). Improving existing theories about the evolution of this block is useful for disentangling the global pattern of MHC evolution from locus- and gene-specific influences. This could help us understand how selection on specific genes has affected entire linked regions.

MHC-V is a fragment pseudogene containing exons 1–3 which is located near MHC-F in the α-block. Previous work disagrees on the age of this fragment, with some suggesting it was fixed relatively early while others claiming it arose from one of the more recent block duplications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Shiina et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Kulski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Kulski et al., 2004</xref>). Our tree groups ape and OWM MHC-V together and places them as an outgroup to all of the classical and non-classical genes, including those of the NWM. Thus, the MHC-V fragment may be an ancient remnant of one of the ancestral Class I genes. We also dispute the hypothesis that MHC-V (a 5’-end fragment) and -P (a 3’-end fragment) are since-separated pieces of the same original gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Horton et al., 2008</xref>), as we found that both contain exon 3 and their exon 3 sequences clearly do not group together in our trees. Therefore, we support past work that has deemed MHC-V an old fragment.</p><p>We next focus on MHC-U, a previously uncharacterized fragment pseudogene containing only exon 3. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, we zoom in on the MHC-U clade within the exon 3 tree, corresponding to the asterisk in panel A. Our tree groups MHC-U with a clade of human, chimpanzee, and bonobo MHC-A, suggesting it duplicated from MHC-A in the ancestor of these three species. However, it is present on both chimpanzee haplotypes and nearly all human haplotypes, and we know that these haplotypes diverged earlier—in the ancestor of human and gorilla. Therefore, we presume that MHC-U will be found in the gorilla when more haplotypes are sequenced. Ours is the first work to show that MHC-U is actually an MHC-A-related gene fragment and that it likely originated in the human-gorilla ancestor.</p><p>Next, we expand the clade for MHC-K, a full-length pseudogene present in apes and OWM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In humans, only MHC-K is present, but on some chimpanzee haplotypes, both MHC-K and its duplicate MHC-KL are present. In gorillas, haplotypes can contain either MHC-K or -KL, and in OWM, there are many copies of MHC-K as they are part of one of the basic block duplication units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Karl et al., 2023</xref>). These pieces of evidence suggest that MHC-K and -KL duplicated in the ancestor of the apes. Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> shows that MHC-K and -KL are closely related and OWM MHC-K groups outside of both, supporting that the duplication (which also copied MHC-W, -A, and -T) occurred after the split of apes and OWM. We did not detect MHC-K or -KL sequences in either the gibbon or orangutan reference genomes during our <italic>BLAST</italic> search, so we cannot date this duplication event more precisely. The pseudogene may have been deleted from both genomes entirely, or it may be present on non-reference haplotypes. Sequencing of more haplotypes may help resolve the timing of this duplication event.</p><p>Another large group of related fragment pseudogenes in the Class I α-block includes MHC-W, -P, and -T (see Appendix 3 for more detail). Both our exon 3 and exon 4 trees indeed show a clear separation between the clade of MHC-W, -WL, -P, -T, -TL, and -OLI pseudogenes and the rest of the genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and C</xref>). On the chromosome, members of these two Class I subgroups are interleaved throughout the <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>𝛼</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft4">\begin{document}$\alpha$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>-block, suggesting that both groups are old and a series of block duplications occurred to form the current physical arrangement. Previous work on human sequences has shown that HLA-P, -W, -T, and -OLI are related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alexandrov et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Hughes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Kulski et al., 2005</xref>). However, humans do not have orthologs of every single primate gene, so utilizing other primate sequences is critical to understanding this subfamily’s evolution.</p><p>Thus, we next focus on the behavior of this subgroup in the trees. The MHC-W/WL/P/T/TL/OLI clade, marked with a <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>†</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft5">\begin{document}$\dagger$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, is expanded in panel D. We expected OWM MHC-W sequences to form a monophyletic clade either outside of all of the ape genes or with a single ape MHC gene, demonstrating orthology. Surprisingly, OWM MHC-W sequences instead formed four distinct clades, with one grouping with ape MHC-W/WL, one with ape MHC-P, one with ape MHC-T/TL, and one outside of all. Furthermore, based on the alleles present, each of these OWM MHC-W clades corresponds to a type of basic repeat block (as revealed by the published macaque MHC haplotype; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Karl et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Kulski et al., 2004</xref>). The correspondence between the distinct OWM MHC-W clades and the sequences’ physical locations on a haplotype lends further support to the hypothesis that macaque haplotypes were generated by tandem duplications. Additionally, the fact that the different OWM MHC-W clades each group with a different ape pseudogene suggests that there are actually three ape/OWM orthologous groups (see Appendix 3 for further explanation). Thus, for the first time, we show that there must have been three distinct MHC-W-like genes in the ape/OWM ancestor.</p><p>We also learned more about HLA-OLI, a recently discovered MHC pseudogene found on the same insertion segment that carries HLA-Y in a small fraction of the human population. Its discoverers analyzed only human sequences, finding that HLA-OLI was most similar (88%) to HLA-P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alexandrov et al., 2023</xref>). Our inclusion of non-human primate genes revealed that HLA-OLI is actually most similar in both structure and sequence to MHC-TL, a gene not found in humans and thus not included in the previous analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, since MHC-Y and -OLI are fully linked in humans and are located in close proximity, it is likely that they duplicated as a unit. Because MHC-Y is similar to MHC-AL/OKO and HLA-OLI is similar to MHC-TL, we hypothesize that they duplicated together from the latter genes, which are adjacent to each other on non-human haplotypes. MHC-Y has also been identified in gorillas (Gogo-Y; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Hans et al., 2017</xref>), so we anticipate that Gogo-OLI will soon be confirmed. This evidence suggests that the MHC-Y and -OLI-containing haplotype is at least as old as the human-gorilla split. Our study is the first to place MHC-OLI in the overall story of MHC haplotype evolution.</p><p>With these findings, in addition to many other observations from our trees and results from past literature (references in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), we propose a new hypothesis for the evolution of the Class I α-block. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows a possible evolutionary path for α-block haplotypes that could have led to the currently observed haplotypes. Haplotypes found so far in each species are at the bottom of the figure (with additional never-before-reported haplotypes from our <italic>BLAST</italic> search shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In particular, our work has revealed that MHC-V is an old fragment, three MHC-W-like genes were already established at the time of the ape/OWM ancestor, MHC-U is closely related to African ape MHC-A, and MHC-OLI is closely related to MHC-TL. Additionally, the OWM MHC-A fragment pseudogene is actually more similar to the ape MHC-A genes than to the other OWM MHC-A genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), supporting the existence of two MHC-A-like genes in the ape/OWM ancestor.

Among the Class II genes, there are few duplicated genes and generally only one way for the protein products to pair, for example MHC-DPA1 with MHC-DPB1. However, the MHC-DR genes are a notable exception to the general pattern; MHC-DRA can pair with any of the multiple functional MHC-DRB genes. In addition, MHC-DRB has many more related pseudogenes compared to the rest of the Class II genes, making the MHC-DR region’s pattern of evolution more reminiscent of Class I (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to see the varied landscape of MHC-DRB genes in different species). We explored the evolution of the MHC-DRB region in greater detail by creating focused trees with a larger set of MHC-DRB sequences.</p><p>In exon 2, which codes for the binding site, the MHC-DRB genes group mostly by name (e.g. MHC-DRB3) across apes, OWM, and NWM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8A</xref>). The exon 2 tree considered alone thus suggests that the genes are orthologous across apes, OWM, and NWM—which is how the genes were named in the first place. However, looking at this exon alone does not give us a complete picture. Exon 3 does not encode the binding site and is less likely to be affected by convergent evolution; its tree is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8B</xref>. In this tree, all NWM sequences group together (clade with blue boxes about halfway up the tree) instead of with other ape/OWM sequences, suggesting that the genes expanded separately in NWM and apes/OWM. Additionally, OWM MHC-DRB1 and -DRB3 form their own clade (green boxes near the top of the tree), and OWM MHC-DRB4 sequences group outside of several ape and NWM clades. We see that only three ape/OWM MHC-DRB genes/pseudogenes (MHC-DRB5, -DRB2/6, and -DRB9) form monophyletic clades, indicating that these three are the only orthologous MHC-DRB genes. Further, none are 1:1 orthologous to any particular NWM gene. Thus, the longevity of individual MHC-DRB genes in the primates appears to be less than 38 million years.</p><p>The longevity of MHC-DRB haplotypes is even shorter. Only one haplotype is shared between human and chimpanzee, and none are shared with gorilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">de Groot et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Heijmans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Hans et al., 2015</xref>). This shows that the region is evolving even more rapidly than Class I (where haplotypes are shared among human, chimpanzee, and gorilla; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These haplotypes, combined with past literature (cited in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) and our trees, allowed us to trace backward and propose a hypothesis for the evolution of the region, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Evolution of MHC-DRB.</title><p>The bottom of the tree shows current haplotypes in each species or species group; human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and old-world monkey haplotypes are well characterized, while orangutan, gibbon, and new-world monkey haplotypes are partially known.

However, some species are poorly represented in the data, so the relationships between their genes and haplotypes are somewhat unclear. In our exon 3 tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8B</xref>), orangutan alleles do not group definitively with any other ape lineages. Furthermore, the orangutan MHC-DRB3 gene groups with orangutan MHC-DRB1, suggesting that it may not be orthologous to the African ape MHC-DRB3 gene. We also found an orangutan sequence that groups with the human HLA-DRB2 pseudogene, suggesting that this gene has an ortholog in the orangutan. Several haplotypes have been previously identified in the gibbon, but since they rely on exon 2 sequence alone, it is unclear how these alleles relate to the known ape lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">de Groot et al., 2017b</xref>). Analysis of more orangutan and gibbon haplotypes will be essential for understanding how the region has evolved in the apes.</p><p>Overall, the MHC-DRB genes are not evolving in the same fashion as the rest of the Class II genes, even though they have a shared structure and function. This peculiar case illustrates that there are multiple ways to achieve a functional immune response from the same basic parts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Differences between MHC subfamilies</title><p>We explored the evolution of the Class I and Class II genes separately and noticed several differences between the classes. First, sequences group by gene rather than by species group in the Class II gene trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). Our inclusion of RefSeq sequences from distant groups of placental mammals confirms that most of the primate Class II genes have maintained orthology at least since the ancestor of placentals, 105 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Foley et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, our Class I trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) showed sequences more often grouping by species group than by gene, indicating that the genes turn over quickly and 1:1 orthology is often lost. Only non-classical MHC-F (and possibly MHC-E) are truly orthologous among the apes, OWM, and NWM, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Piontkivska and Nei, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams and Parham, 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Sawai et al., 2004</xref>). Additionally, our tarsier and <italic>Strepsirrhini</italic> sequences group outside of all <italic>Simiiformes</italic> Class I sequences, setting an upper bound on the maintenance of Class I orthology of 58 million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Kuderna et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Flügge et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>This turnover of genes at the MHC—rapid for Class I and slower for Class II—is generally believed to be due to host-pathogen co-evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Radwan et al., 2020</xref>). The MHC genes are critically important for survival, yet no single gene is so vital that its role must be preserved. For example, in the apes, the MHC-G gene is non-classical, but in the OWM, it has been inactivated and its role largely replaced by an MHC-A-related gene called MHC-AG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Heijmans et al., 2020</xref>). This process of turnover ultimately results in different sets of MHC genes being used in different lineages. For instance, separate expansions generated the classical Class I genes in NWM (all called MHC-G) and the <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>𝛼</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft9">\begin{document}$\alpha$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>-block genes in apes/OWM. Similarly, separate expansions generated the MHC-DRB genes of the NWM and of the apes/OWM. Aside from MHC-DRB, the other Class II genes have been largely stable across the mammals, although we do see some lineage-specific expansions and contractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Class I and Class II also differ in their degree of gene conversion. Our GENECONV analysis revealed two types of gene conversion events: (1) specific, more-recent events involving paralogous genes or particular allelic lineages and (2) broad-scale, very-old events involving two dissimilar loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). We discovered far more ‘specific’ events in Class I, while ‘broad-scale’ events were predominant in Class II. This could reflect the different age of these gene groups: Class I genes turn over more rapidly and allelic lineages are less diverged from each other, making gene conversion more likely. In contrast, Class II genes have much longer-lived (and more-diverged) allelic lineages, potentially explaining why we mainly picked up older events in the Class II GENECONV analysis.</p><p>The non-classical vs. classical distinction is another functionally meaningful way to partition the genes. The classical genes (of both classes) perform peptide presentation to T-cells, making them direct targets of host-pathogen co-evolution. In contrast, the non-classical genes are involved in innate immune surveillance or niche roles and may be less directly affected by this co-evolution. In our trees, sequences from non-classical genes of both classes often group by gene with tree topology matching the species tree, while sequences from classical genes do neither (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). We further explore the differences between classical and non-classical genes in our companion paper, finding ancient trans-species polymorphism at the classical genes but not at the non-classical genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Fortier and Pritchard, 2025</xref>). These pieces of evidence show that classical genes experience more turnover and are more often affected by long-term balancing selection or convergent evolution. Ultimately, selection acts upon functional differences between classical and non-classical genes in a manner that is largely independent of whether they belong to Class I or Class II, although the classes differ in their rate of evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The MHC proteins serve diverse roles in innate and adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Adams and Luoma, 2013</xref>).

Despite their varied functions, all Class I and Class II MHC genes are derived from a common ancestor, allowing us to compare genes to learn more about the evolution of the gene family as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Hansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Kupfermann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Kaufman, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Adams and Luoma, 2013</xref>). A few ∼20-year-old studies addressed the overall evolution of the MHC gene family via multi-gene alignment and phylogenetics, but the trees had many polytomies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams and Parham, 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Sawai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cardenas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Piontkivska and Nei, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Takahashi et al., 2000</xref>).

In this project, we revisited primate MHC evolution with more data from a wider range of species and a coherent analysis framework. We confirm and unify past findings, as well as contribute many new insights into the evolution of this complex family.</p><p>We found that the Class I genes turn over rapidly, with only the non-classical gene MHC-F being clearly orthologous across the <italic>Simiiformes</italic>. In the rest of the Class I <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>𝛼</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft10">\begin{document}$\alpha$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>-block, genes expanded entirely separately in the ape/OWM and NWM lineages. This process of expansion generated many full-length and fragment pseudogenes, which we found were equally important as the functional genes to understanding the evolution of the region as a whole. Specifically, we found that MHC-U is an MHC-A-related pseudogene, MHC-V is not closely related to MHC-P, and that there were at least three genes of the MHC-W/P/T/OLI family present in the ape/OWM ancestor. Including these pseudogenes in our trees helped us construct a new model of α-block haplotype evolution.</p><p>Generally, Class II genes do not turn over as rapidly as Class I genes, although there were exceptions. The classical MHC-DRB genes were even shorter-lived than the Class I genes, with most human MHC-DRB genes lacking 1:1 orthologs beyond the great apes. We also found that the classical MHC-DQA and -DQB genes were not as clearly orthologous across the primates as we expected; rather, they likely expanded separately in the ape/OWM and NWM lineages. In contrast, the classical MHC-DPA and -DPB genes were orthologous across the <italic>Simiiformes</italic>, and the non-classical Class II genes were 1:1 orthologous across most of the mammals we included. In both Class I and Class II, classical genes turned over more rapidly than non-classical genes and their trees exhibited more deviations from the expected species tree. Overall, our treatment of the genes as related entities instead of distinct cases helped us understand shared patterns of evolution across classes and species groups.</p><p>While there are clear differences in evolutionary rate between different subsets of the MHC gene family, it is unclear how rapidly the overall family has evolved compared to other immune and non-immune gene families. Over the evolution of the placental mammals, chromosomal breakpoints are more often located near immune genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Muffato et al., 2023</xref>), and the MHC region is significantly structurally divergent within the primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Mao et al., 2024</xref>). In one study of human, chimpanzee, and macaque gene families, MHC Class I genes showed significantly accelerated rates of evolution and were among the most-rapidly evolving gene families; however, many non-immune gene families were also identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Hahn et al., 2007</xref>). One hypothesis is that the MHC might evolve more rapidly than other gene families because many of its members have direct interaction with pathogen peptides, can bind with multiple different peptides, are expressed on the cell surface rather than in the cytosol, and are constitutively expressed rather than induced; however, more evidence is needed to support this rationale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">Vinkler et al., 2023</xref>). There are many other large immune-related gene families in vertebrates, such as killer Ig-like receptors (KIRs), leukocyte Ig-like receptors (LILRs), sialic acid-binding Ig-type lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">Vinkler et al., 2023</xref>). In the future, performing a comparable analysis on these other families will provide insight into whether our observations are unique to the MHC, are representative of immune gene families, or translate to gene families in general.</p><p>One concern when discussing gene families is the relative importance of birth-and-death and concerted evolution by gene conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Gu and Nei, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Nei and Rooney, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Klein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bergström and Gyllensten, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Gyllensten et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Nei et al., 1997</xref>). Gene conversion can cause adjacent small sequence tracts to have wildly different evolutionary histories, making it difficult to interpret a tree constructed from larger regions. Our phylogenetic analyses reveal different tree topologies depending on exon, and our GENECONV analysis pulled out several different sequence pairs, revealing that gene conversion has played a significant role in the evolution of the MHC genes. With this in mind, comparing trees across exons helps us interpret the overall trees and strengthens our conclusions. Neither birth-and-death nor concerted evolution can be ignored when discussing gene families.</p><p>Short-read sequencing has long been the primary approach for generating MHC sequence data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>). However, the MHC region is difficult to assemble owing to the large number of related genes, extreme polymorphism, and abundant repetitive regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Heijmans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, the extreme diversity of MHC haplotypes within some species has not been appreciated until recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">de Groot et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">de Groot et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">de Groot et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Gleimer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Hans et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Heijmans et al., 2020</xref>). To understand MHC evolution in the primates, it is imperative to fully characterize the many genes and haplotypes present in each species. Better MHC maps will allow us to estimate gene gain and loss rates, pinpoint orthologs across species, and understand how individual MHC repertoires translate to different functional responses. Long-read sequencing is already starting to gain traction in the MHC world, helping to resolve even the most complex haplotypes. For humans, high-quality MHC sequences have already been created using the Oxford Nanopore and PacBio HiFi methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">Wenger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Jain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Liu, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bruijnesteijn, 2023</xref>). Outside of humans, long-read sequencing has also been applied to the MHC regions of the Tasmanian devil, horse, yellow cardinal, duck, and macaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Domínguez et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Hu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">de Groot et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Karl et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Viļuma et al., 2017</xref>). Studying more MHC regions in even more species is needed to understand the myriad evolutionary strategies for a successful immune response. Long-read MHC sequencing across a rich array of primates will also prove essential. This data will help us answer evolutionary questions with better precision as well as provide necessary context for infectious and autoimmune disease pathogenesis in humans.</p><p>By treating the MHC genes as a gene family and including more data than ever before, this work enhances our understanding of the evolutionary history of this remarkable region. Our extensive set of trees incorporating classical genes, non-classical genes, pseudogenes, gene fragments, and alleles of medical interest across a wide range of species will provide context for future evolutionary, genomic, disease, and immunologic studies. For example, this work provides a jumping-off point for further exploration of the evolutionary processes affecting different subsets of the gene family and the nuances of immune system function in different species. This study also provides a necessary framework for understanding the evolution of particular allelic lineages within specific MHC genes, which we explore further in our companion paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Fortier and Pritchard, 2025</xref>).

search</title><p>To create the <italic>BLAST</italic> database, we first compiled all nucleotide MHC sequences from the IPD-MHC and IPD-IMGT/HLA databases into three fasta files: one containing the Class I sequences, one containing the Class II sequences, and one containing MHC-DRB9 sequences (see note below). We then constructed three custom databases from these sets of sequences using the <monospace>makeblastdb</monospace> command in <italic>BLAST</italic> version 2.11.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Camacho et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We then queried each of the three custom databases using the above reference genomes and screened the hits manually. This manual step was necessary because the reference sequences included highly similar genes that needed to be carefully teased apart; in addition, the MHC region contains many small, repeated fragments of genes that could show up as hits. We looked for both high sequence identity and a long alignment length while keeping in mind synteny and our expectations for reasonable alignment lengths and sequence identities (which differ by gene subgroup and the species being compared). In most cases, we were able to identify loci unambiguously, resulting in several newly reported haplotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The discovery of various genes in various species also allowed us to fill in gaps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>.</p><p>We generated a separate <italic>BLAST</italic> database for the MHC-DRB9 sequences because MHC-DRB9 was not reliably detected when <italic>BLAST</italic>ing the genomes against the all-Class II database. MHC-DRB9 is a partial-length pseudogene (aligning to just one exon), and it is more diverged from the other MHC-DRB sequences. As a result, queries to the all-Class II <italic>BLAST</italic> database only found the pseudogene occasionally (usually matching it to a different MHC-DRB gene with poor overall score or alignment length). To be sure that we were detecting MHC-DRB9 in particular (as opposed to other MHC-DRB genes or motifs across the region) and consistently across all of the primate genomes, we set up a separate <italic>BLAST</italic> database containing only MHC-DRB9 sequences as references. We queried the genomes against this database (in addition to the other databases) to maximize the number of MHC-DRB9 sequences we could find.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sequence selection</title><p>Because <italic>BEAST2</italic> is computationally limited by the number of sequences, it was necessary to prioritize certain sequences. To do this, we (very roughly) aligned as many exon 2 and 3 sequences as possible (from both NCBI RefSeq and the IPD database) using MUSCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Edgar, 2004</xref>) with default settings. We then constructed UPGMA trees in R to visualize the sequences. We preferentially selected sequences that were (1) in primate species not represented by the IPD database or (2) grouped with genes not well represented by the IPD database, and which were not similar/identical to other sequences. We also included several non-primate species to provide context and explore orthology beyond the primates. After choosing sequences with this preliminary screening method, we collected the full-length sequences for inclusion in further analyses. We limited sequences to one per species-gene pair for building the Class I, Class IIA, and Class IIB multi-gene trees (lists of alleles provided as Supplementary Files).</p><p>For Class I, we then re-aligned all genes together for each exon separately using MUSCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Edgar, 2004</xref>) with default settings (and manually adjusted). For Class II, alleles for each gene group (MHC-DMA, -DMB, -DOA, -DOB, -DPA, -DPB, -DQA, -DQB, -DRA, and -DRB) were aligned separately for each exon using MUSCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Edgar, 2004</xref>) with default settings (and manually adjusted). Since some Class II genes are too far diverged from one another to be reliably aligned automatically, the nucleotide alignments were then combined manually based on published amino acid alignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Radley et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Dijkstra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Dijkstra and Yamaguchi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Cuesta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Chazara et al., 2011</xref>). For Class IIA, exons 4 and 5 were concatenated together before this manual combination process because some analogous sites between genes are located across exons. For the same reason, exons 5 and 6 were concatenated together for Class IIB before combining. This produced three multi-gene alignments: Class I, Class IIA, and Class IIB.</p><p>We also aligned a larger set of sequences for each gene group to create our ‘focused’ trees that each zoomed in on a different subtree of the multi-gene trees. Details for this are located in the Methods of our companion paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Fortier and Pritchard, 2025</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Bayesian phylogenetic analysis</title><p>We constructed phylogenetic trees using <italic>BEAST2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bouckaert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bouckaert et al., 2019</xref>) with package substBMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). SubstBMA implements a spike-and-slab mixture model that simultaneously estimates the phylogenetic tree, the number of site partitions, the assignment of sites to partitions, the nucleotide substitution model, and a rate multiplier for each partition. Since we were chiefly interested in the partitions and their rate multipliers, we used the RDPM model as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Wu et al., 2013</xref>. In the RDPM model, the number of nucleotide substitution model categories is fixed to 1, so that all sites, regardless of rate partition, share the same estimated nucleotide substitution model. This reduces the number of parameters to be estimated and ensures that only evolutionary rates vary across site partitions, reducing overall model complexity. We used an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock because we wanted evolutionary rates to be able to vary among branches.</p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Priors</title><p>For the Dirichlet process priors, we used the informative priors constructed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Wu et al., 2013</xref> for their mammal dataset. This is appropriate because they include several of the same species and their mammals span approximately the same evolutionary time that we consider in our study. We also use their same priors on tree height, base rate distribution, and a Yule process coalescent prior. We did not specify a calibration point—a time-based prior on a node—because we did not expect our sequences to group according to the species tree.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Running <italic>BEAST2</italic></title><p>We ran <italic>BEAST2</italic> on various subsets of the three alignments. Considering exons separately helped to minimize the effects of recombination on the tree, while also allowing us to compare and contrast tree topologies for exons encoding the binding site vs. exons encoding the other domains. For Class I, we repeated the analysis for (1) exon 2 only (PBR), (2) exon 3 only (PBR), and (3) exon 4 only (non-PBR). For Class IIA, we used (1) exon 2 only (PBR) and (2) exon 3 only (non-PBR). For Class IIB, we analyzed (1) exon 2 only (PBR) and (2) exon 3 only (non-PBR). In the following, each ‘analysis’ refers to a collection of <italic>BEAST2</italic> runs using a particular subset of either the Class I, Class IIA, or Class IIB alignment. The procedure is exactly the same for the ‘focused’ trees, which each focus on a particular gene group within the Class I, Class IIA, or Class IIB alignment. More detail about the generation of the focused trees is located in the Materials and methods of our companion paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Fortier and Pritchard, 2025</xref>).</p><p>The XML files we used to run <italic>BEAST2</italic> were based closely on those used for the mammal dataset with the RDPM model and uncorrelated relaxed clock in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Wu et al., 2013</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jessiewu/substBMA/blob/master/examples/mammal/mammal_rdpm_uc.xml">https://github.com/jessiewu/substBMA/blob/master/examples/mammal/mammal_rdpm_uc.xml</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Vaughan, 2016</xref>). Running a model with per-site evolutionary rate categories and a relaxed clock means there are many parameters to estimate. Along with the large number of parameters, highly polymorphic and highly diverged sequences make it difficult for <italic>BEAST2</italic> to explore the state space. Thus, we undertook considerable effort to ensure good mixing and convergence of the chains. First, we employed coupled MCMC for all analyses. Coupled MCMC is essentially the same as the regular MCMC used in <italic>BEAST2</italic>, except that it uses additional ‘heated’ chains with increased acceptance probabilities that can traverse unfavorable intermediate states and allow the main chain to move away from an inferior local optimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Müller and Bouckaert, 2020</xref>). Using coupled MCMC, both speeds up <italic>BEAST2</italic> runs and improves mixing and convergence. We used four heated chains for each run with a delta temperature of 0.025. Second, we ran each BEAST2 run for 40,000,000 states, discarding the first 4,000,000 states as burn-in and sampling every 10,000 states. Third, we ran at least eight independent replicates of each analysis. The replicates use the exact same alignment and coupled MCMC settings but explore state space independently and thus are useful for improving the effective sample size of tricky parameters. As recommended by <italic>BEAST2</italic>, we examined all replicates in Tracer version 1.7.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Rambaut et al., 2018</xref>) to ensure that they were sampling from the same parameter distributions and had reached convergence. We excluded replicates for which this was not true, as these chains were probably stuck in suboptimal state space. Additionally, Tracer provides estimates of the effective sample size (ESS) for the combined set of states from all chosen replicates, and we required that the combined ESS be larger than 100 for all parameters. If there were fewer than 4 acceptable replicates or if the ESS was below 100 for any parameter, we re-ran more independent replicates of the analysis until these requirements were satisfied. We obtained between 7 and 14 acceptable replicates (median 8) per analysis for the Class I, Class IIA, and Class IIB runs.</p><p>For some analyses, computational limitations prevented <italic>BEAST2</italic> from being able to reach 40,000,000 states. In these situations, more replicates (of fewer states) were usually required to achieve good mixing and convergence. Regardless of how far these <italic>BEAST2</italic> runs got, the first 4,000,000 states from each run were still discarded as burn-in even though this represented more than 10% of states. The XML files required to run all our analyses are provided as Supplementary Files.</p><p>This extremely stringent procedure ensured that all of the replicates were exploring the same parameter space and were converging upon the same global optimum, allowing the ≥ 4 independent runs to be justifiably combined. We combined the acceptable replicates (discarding the first 4,000,000 states as burn-in) using <italic>LogCombiner</italic> version 2.6.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Drummond and Rambaut, 2007</xref>), which aggregates the results across all states. We then used the combined results for downstream analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Phylogenetic trees</title><p>After combining acceptable replicates, we obtained 17,927–28,384 phylogenies per gene/sequence subset for the Class I, Class IIA, and Class IIB trees (mean 25,154). We used TreeAnnotator version 2.6.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Drummond and Rambaut, 2007</xref>) to summarize each set of possible trees as a maximum clade credibility tree, which is the tree that maximizes the product of posterior clade probabilities. Since <italic>BEAST2</italic> samples trees from the posterior, one could in principle reduce the large set of trees to a smaller 95% credible set of trees representing the ‘true’ tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">BEA, 2024</xref>). However, given the high complexity of the model space, all our posterior trees were unique, meaning this was not possible in practice. Throughout this paper, we rely on summary trees for our observations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Integration with literature</title><p>Hundreds of authors have contributed to the study of MHC evolution, and their myriad published results played a key role in this project. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> illustrates our approach to this project, including how we used existing literature and how we divided results among this paper and its companion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Fortier and Pritchard, 2025</xref>). We first constructed large multi-gene trees encompassing all Class I, Class IIA, and Class IIB genes. These provided a backbone for us to investigate subtrees in more depth, adding more sequences and more species to construct ‘focused trees’ for each gene group. These, in combination with the literature, allowed us to create hypotheses about the evolution of the Class I α-block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and Class II MHC-DRB region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title><italic>BEAST2</italic> trees provide insight into MHC gene and allele relationships.</title><p>We first created multi-gene Bayesian phylogenetic trees using sequences from all genes and species, separated into Class I, Class IIA, and Class IIB groups.

It is generally advisable to use only synonymous sites when running the program on a protein-coding alignment, since silent sites within the same codon position are likely to be correlated. However, the extreme polymorphism in these MHC genes meant there were too few silent sites to use in the analysis. Thus, we considered all sites but caution that this could slightly overestimate the lengths of our inferred conversion tracts. For each alignment, we ran <italic>GENECONV</italic> with options <monospace>ListPairs, Allouter, Numsims = 10000, and Startseed = 310</monospace>. We collected all inferred ‘Global Inner’ (GI) fragments with sim_pval &lt; 0.05 (this is pre-corrected for multiple comparisons by the program).

MHC-like genes</title><p>The extremely polymorphic ‘classical’ MHC genes are mainly involved in adaptive immunity via their interaction with T cells. In contrast, the ‘non-classical’ genes display little polymorphism and have niche functions, sometimes with limited tissue expression. Additionally, certain classical and non-classical genes are involved in innate immunity, serving as ligands for receptors on Natural Killer (NK) cells and some T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Heijmans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">Vollmers et al., 2021</xref>). This appendix provides an overview of these two main functions; the roles of specific genes are discussed in Appendix 3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Peptide presentation to T cells</title><p>Each T cell has the capacity to recognize and respond to one of a countless number of possible foreign invaders. The ‘classical’ MHC gene products are responsible for peptide presentation—displaying small fragments of protein (called peptides) at the surface of the cell for recognition by these T cells. This process allows T cells to constantly monitor the body for non-self peptides, which could indicate a tumor or infection. T cell recognition of a foreign peptide then triggers destruction of the affected cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Dendrou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Neefjes et al., 2011</xref>). There are two groups of classical MHC molecules, Class I and Class II, which have slightly different roles.</p><p>Classical Class I MHC complexes are expressed on almost all nucleated cells and present cytosolic protein fragments 8-9 amino acids in length to the surface of the cell. The presented peptide is recognized by the T cell receptor (TCR) of a cytolytic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell. In contrast, Classical Class II complexes present mostly endocytosed extracellular protein fragments 12-25 amino acids in length, which are recognized by the TCRs of helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Unlike the widely expressed Class I proteins, Class II proteins are expressed only on specific antigen-presenting cell types, such as B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Gfeller and Bassani-Sternberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Heijmans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Neefjes et al., 2011</xref>). Both classes of molecules are retained within the cell and are eventually degraded unless they bind a peptide, at which point they are stable and transported to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Neefjes et al., 2011</xref>). The only exception is non-classical gene MHC-F, which can be stable as a peptide-unbound ‘open conformer’ (see Appendix 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Otting et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Class I and Class II differ in their mechanism of peptide presentation.</title><p>For Class I (left), endogenous proteins are broken down by a proteasome and imported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are loaded onto an awaiting MHC molecule. The peptide-bound MHC molecule is then transported to the cell surface via the Golgi, where it can interact with the T cell receptor (TCR) of a CD8<italic>+</italic> T cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Neefjes et al., 2011</xref>). The Class II pathway (right) is more complex. Here, exogenous proteins are endocytosed and broken down on their way to the MHC class II compartment (MIIC). MHC molecules originate in the ER, where they are loaded with the invariant chain (Ii). The Ii-bound MHC molecule is transported to the MIIC, where the Ii is trimmed and swapped out for an endocytosed peptide. This swap is catalyzed by the non-classical MHC molecule MHC-DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Neefjes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Dijkstra and Yamaguchi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Schulze and Wucherpfennig, 2012</xref>). The peptide-bound MHC molecule can then be transported to the cell surface to interact with the T cell receptor (TCR) of a CD4+ T cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Neefjes et al., 2011</xref>).

Some Class I alleles have epitopes that serve as ligands for the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) or C-type lectin receptors (CD94/NKG2) expressed on Natural Killer (NK) cells or the inhibitory leucocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILR) expressed on monocytes and some T-, B-, and NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Heijmans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Biassoni and Malnati, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Guethlein et al., 2015</xref>). Unlike T cell receptors, which are part of the ‘adaptive’ immune response due to their recognition of specific foreign peptides, these other types of receptors are part of the innate immune response, able to detect the general loss of self that occurs under cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Biassoni and Malnati, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Parham and Moffett, 2013</xref>). KIR, CD94/NKG2, and LILR come in two flavors: activating and inhibitory. Activating receptors trigger an immune response when they recognize an epitope, while inhibitory receptors prevent an immune response from taking place. The receptors that recognize MHC are generally inhibitory—if they detect the right amount of MHC molecules on the surface of the cell, then all is well and no immune response is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Biassoni and Malnati, 2018</xref>).</p><p>MHC and KIRs have co-evolved across the primates, and their interactions have also shaped polymorphism in the MHC region. Each receptor can only recognize a particular epitope, and not all MHC alleles have one of the recognizable epitopes. While many MHC-receptor interactions are conserved, such as that of non-classical MHC-E and CD94–NKG2A, others have been free to diversify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Parham and Moffett, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Guethlein et al., 2015</xref>). Over evolutionary time, particular lineages of KIRs have expanded or been lost as the allelic lineages they recognize have also expanded or been lost. For example, the classical MHC-C gene originated around the time of orangutan divergence. This corresponds with the expansion of the lineage III KIRs that are able to recognize MHC-C alleles—while old-world monkeys have just one (possibly non-functional) lineage III KIR, the great apes have up to 9 of these receptors. The expansion of lineage III also corresponds with the contraction of lineage II KIRs (which can recognize some MHC-A and -B alleles) in the great apes, supporting the fact that MHC-C has evolved to be the dominant KIR receptor in this group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Parham and Moffett, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Biassoni and Malnati, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Hilton and Parham, 2017</xref>).

First, the species of origin is indicated by a four-letter prefix consisting of the first two letters of the genus name and the first two letters of the species name, for example ‘Chsa-’ for Chlorocebus sabaeus, the green monkey. There are some exceptions, usually because these MHC systems were first investigated before the naming scheme was put into place. These include ‘HLA-’ for human, ‘H2-’ for mouse, ‘RT1-’ for rat, and ‘SLA-’ for swine, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">de Groot et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">de Groot et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>After the hyphen is the locus designation. Some species, such as humans, have a relatively simple landscape of MHC genes, making it easy to identify sequences that belong to a particular gene. However, other species have recent gene expansions and considerable region conformation diversity, making it difficult to assign alleles to genes. In some cases, these are given generic locus designations; for example, rhesus macaques have at least 19 paralogous B loci, but most are given the ambiguous name ‘Mamu-B’ (with the exception of a few well-characterized genes such as Mamu-B17). In other cases, unassigned sequences are given a working designation indicated by a ‘W’, such as ‘Popy-DRB*W113:01’. In this example, the allele definitely belongs to a DRB paralog, but it is unclear which one. Some locus names are given a ‘Ps’ suffix to indicate they are pseudogenes, such as ‘Caja-G5Ps’. However, not all pseudogenes are labeled this way, so one should not assume the lack of a ‘Ps’ suffix means a gene is functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">de Groot et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">de Groot et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="app2fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 2—figure 1.</label><caption><title>MHC allele nomenclature.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Human HLA alleles are named in a standard fashion, with the gene name followed by four colon-separated fields. The first field indicates a broad-scale allele group which sometimes corresponds to a serological antigen. The second field denotes a specific HLA protein. The third field indicates synonymous changes to the nucleotide sequence in the coding region, while the fourth field is used to distinguish alleles with differences in the noncoding regions.

Instead of ’HLA’, a prefix which concatenates the first two letters of the genus name with the first two letters of the species name is used, except in certain cases where the species’ MHC system was named long ago. Paralogs can be distinguished using numbers, but sequences unassigned to a particular locus or paralog might incorporate a ‘W’ in the gene name. Use of expression tags varies, with some being added to the end of the gene name instead of the end of the entire allele name. Pseudogenes can be denoted with a ‘p’ or ‘Ps’ in the gene name suffixes, gene names themselves, expression suffixes, or not at all. For both human and non-human alleles, the lack of an expression suffix does not imply normal expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">de Groot et al., 2020</xref>).

The first field designates the type or family. Types often, but not always, correspond to the broad serological reactivity of the allele, as many were named before full sequences were known. To facilitate comparison across closely related species, researchers generally try to give related MHC alleles the same first-field designation, for example, Gogo-A*02 and HLA-A*02. However, certain genes do not follow this general rule. For example, MHC-DPB1 has undergone considerable gene conversion, resulting in no distinct types; thus, a shared first-field designation between species is meaningless for this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">de Groot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">de Groot et al., 2020</xref>). The second field designates the allele subtype, or unique amino acid sequence. For example, ‘Patr-A*08:01’ and ‘Patr-A*08:02’ are part of the same allelic family, but have some nonsynonymous differences. Synonymous changes are specified by the third field. For example, ‘Paan-DPB1*03:01:01’ and ‘Paan-DPB1*03:01:02’ have silent substitutions which ultimately result in the same protein. Lastly, the fourth field is used to describe changes to the noncoding regions—that is, the 5’ and 3’ UTRs and the introns. Of course, this requires that these regions have been sequenced, so not all alleles will have a fourth field. Finally, alleles can also be followed by an optional suffix to describe expression changes, most commonly ‘N’ for a null/nonexpressed allele or ‘L’ for a lowly-expressed allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Hurley, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Douillard et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In general, caution must be taken in interpreting allele names. First, because not all alleles are resolved at three- and four-field resolution, the names are not all strictly hierarchical; alleles which have all four fields cannot always simply be truncated to obtain the two-field version. Second, because human alleles were named in order of discovery, alleles with very different one- or two-field designations could ultimately have the same nucleotide or amino acid sequence in the peptide-binding groove. When discussing functional consequences, it is relevant to group alleles by their nucleotide or amino acid sequence in the peptide-binding-site-encoding exons (designated G- and P-groups, respectively) and not necessarily by their one- or two-field name (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Hurley, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Douillard et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, the suffixes can be misleading because not every allele has had its expression level characterized—the absence of an ‘L’ does not mean that an allele has normal expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Hurley, 2021</xref>). Despite these small issues, the naming system is generally intuitive and very useful for understanding alleles at a glance. In this work, alleles obtained from the IPD-MHC and IPD-IMGT/HLA databases are named this way, but sequences obtained from RefSeq are labeled by accession number or location along a chromosome.</p></sec></app><app id="appendix-3"><title>Appendix 3</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s12"><title>The Class I subfamily</title><p>Humans have a (relatively) simple landscape of Class I genes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

The snub-nosed monkey, which belongs to the <italic>Colobinae</italic>, has blocks that nearly, but not exactly, match the macaque’s. However, there is only one copy of each duplication unit (in other words, non-duplicated). This suggests that this initial arrangement of genes—one copy each of MHC-AG, -G, -Apseudo, -K, and -A—was established prior to the radiation of all OWM. Independent deletions appear to have occurred in the baboon, gelada, and mantled guereza, while repeated block duplications likely occurred in the ancestor of the macaques and arrangements are shared by at least some species.</p><p>To investigate this further, we created Class I <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>𝛼</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft14">\begin{document}$\alpha$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>-block-focused trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and observed that OWM MHC-W sequences assort into clearly defined clades that are consistent with the region evolving by block duplications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, text, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Thus, the ape/OWM ancestor must have had two distinct MHC-A genes: one gave rise to all the ape MHC-A-related genes and became a pseudogene in the OWM lineage, and one was the ancestor of all the OWM MHC-A and -AG genes and was deleted from the ape lineage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s12-1-5"><title>MHC-A in the NWM</title><p>MHC-A is not present in the NWM; however, one study places the gene’s origin prior to the divergence of the NWM from the <italic>Catarrhini</italic> and proposes that it was subsequently lost in the NWM ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams and Parham, 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Heijmans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Sawai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Piontkivska and Nei, 2003</xref>).

Unlike other pseudogenes, MHC-H is reasonably diverse and substitutions are not evenly distributed across the gene. Because it is located near classical MHC-A, this could be due to hitchhiking; however, since the gene is apparently functional in other species, this pattern could also be evidence of past selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Grimsley et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Hughes and Hughes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Paganini et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>MHC-H has not been detected in gibbons, OWM, or NWM, suggesting the gene duplicated from MHC-A in the common ancestor of the great apes.

A nearly identical 60 kb indel to human was found in gorilla, confirming the location of Gogo-Y and supporting their orthologous relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alexandrov et al., 2023</xref>).

Our trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) show that Gogo-Y groups with human HLA-Y are clearly distinct from Gogo/Gobe-OKO, further lending support to the fact that MHC-Y is a separate gene that arose on an old haplotype. Nevertheless, MHC-Y is likely recombinant; it is similar to Patr-AL/Gogo-OKO/Gobe-OKO/Popy-A/Poab-A in exon 1, intron 1, exon 2, and intron 2, but it is similar to HLA-A/Patr-A/Papa-A/Gogo-A/Gobe-A across the rest of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Gleimer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Hans et al., 2017</xref>).

However, because MHC-Y and -OLI are 100% linked and MHC-Y is broadly similar to MHC-A-related genes while MHC-OLI is clearly similar to MHC-TL (see later section about MHC-OLI), we hypothesize that they arose via a block duplication of the nearby MHC-AL and -TL in the human/gorilla ancestor. This haplotype was then lost in the chimpanzee lineage. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> for a detailed visual explanation of our hypothesis.

While a few macaque MHC-B-related genes have been named—such as pseudogenes MHC-B02, -B10, -B14, -B19, and -B21 and transcribed genes MHC-B11, -B12, -B16, -B17, -B18, -B20, and -B22—most alleles remain unassigned to loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Heijmans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Shiina et al., 2017</xref>). Some genes even have alternative functions, such as rhesus macaque Mamu-B*098:01 (separate gene), which is specialized to bind a 5-mer lipopeptide derived from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">de Groot et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>As with the OWM MHC-A genes, the OWM MHC-B genes are arranged in distinct repeating blocks, implying that they were generated by block duplications (at least in macaques). From the complete macaque MHC haplotype, we see that there are three types of duplication blocks: one large block with six flanking pseudogenes (including fragment MHC-related pseudogene MHC-S), one medium block with two or three flanking pseudogenes, and one small block with just a single flanking pseudogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Karl et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Shiina et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the large block with MHC-S is also found in human, gorilla, and orangutan, suggesting that this block was present in the ancestor of apes/OWM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Karl et al., 2023</xref>). From the ancestral large block, all MHC-B genes were generated separately in the ape and OWM lineages, meaning no gene is 1:1 orthologous between the groups; this is reflected in our trees by all OWM MHC-B genes grouping together outside of all ape MHC-B genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). As noted previously, this also means that the OWM MHC-B genes present in the large blocks are likely the oldest and that the OWM MHC-B genes present in the medium and small blocks were derived from these within the OWM (or possibly just macaque) lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Karl et al., 2023</xref>). Looking at our <italic>BLAST</italic> results for OWM reference genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), we see that a similar repeating pattern of MHC-B and -S genes (large block) appears on the macaque references and the distantly-related snub-nosed monkey reference. This supports the fact that the large block was established early on. However, another pattern of MHC-B genes (intermingled small/medium blocks, without MHC-S) also seems to match between macaque and snub-nosed monkey, suggesting that the small and medium blocks of MHC-B genes were also established early on, at the beginning of OWM evolution. Different OWM haplotypes were then created via species-specific duplications and deletions.</p><p>Interestingly, while ape MHC-B genes are highly expressed, the older OWM MHC-B genes are all lowly expressed ‘minors’, and the newer OWM MHC-B genes are mostly highly expressed ‘majors’, showing how the roles of these genes can change over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Karl et al., 2023</xref>). Although we included a limited number of OWM MHC-B genes in our trees, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4C</xref> are consistent with the previously proposed block relationships, with old genes like MHC-B*098, -B02Ps, and -I forming a clade distinct from that of the newer genes, such as MHC-B11L and -B22. MHC-B19Ps (located on the far end of the OWM MHC-B segment) appears to be somewhat of an outlier, not grouping with the other OWM MHC-B sequences in ours and others’ trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Shiina et al., 2011</xref>). In our trees, we also included MHC-B genes from other OWM species, which scatter throughout the OWM clade. Without more sequences, it is difficult to determine whether some MHC-B genes were present before the diversification of various OWM species or if they expanded separately in different lineages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s12-2-3"><title>MHC-I</title><p>MHC-I is an OWM-specific MHC-B-related gene previously named MHC-B3.

Therefore, MHC-I is likely just a regular MHC-B paralog and is probably unfixed.

It is possible that the MHC-I genes were created separately in these species and then converged in the binding site, or that they are identical by descent and one underwent gene conversion in exon 4. Based on these trees, it seems that some MHC-B genes were established before the diversification of the macaque species, but it is unclear whether any were established earlier. More sequences are needed to determine whether MHC-I is really a special, conserved MHC-B-like gene or whether it is simply another of the many MHC-B paralogs that have been rapidly generated in the OWM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s12-2-4"><title>MHC-B in the NWM</title><p>There are multiple functional and non-functional NWM MHC-B genes, although many have low or tissue-specific expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Heijmans et al., 2020</xref>).

Therefore, MHC-DO can be thought of as a fine-tuner of the immunopeptidome rather than simply as an inhibitor of MHC-DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">Welsh and Sadegh-Nasseri, 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103545.3.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>eLife Assessment</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Enard</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of Arizona</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="evidence-strength"><kwd>Compelling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="claim-importance"><kwd>Important</kwd></kwd-group></front-stub><body><p>This <bold>important</bold> manuscript presents a thorough analysis of the evolution of Major Histocompatibility Complex gene families across Primates.

MHC genes are famed for their role in rapid evolution and extensive polymorphism in a variety of vertebrates. This paper presents a summary of gene-level gain and loss of orthologs and paralogs within MHC across the diversity of primates, using publicly available data.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This paper provides a strong case that MHC genes are rapidly gained (by paralog duplication) and lost over millions of years of macroevolution. The authors are able to identify MHC loci by homology across species, and from this infer gene duplications and losses using phylogenetic analyses. There is a remarkable amount of genic turnover, summarized in Figure 6 and Figure 7, either of which might be a future textbook figure of immune gene family evolution. The authors draw on state-of-the-art phylogenetic methods, and their inferences are robust insofar as the data might be complete enough to draw such conclusions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One concern about the present work is that it relies on public databases to draw inferences about gene loss, which is potentially risky if the publicly available sequence data are incomplete. To say, for example, that a particular MHC gene copy is absent in a taxon (e.g., Class I locus F absent in Guenons according to Figure 1), we need to trust that its absence from the available databases is an accurate reflection of its absence in the genome of the actual organisms. This may be a safe assumption, but it rests on the completeness of genome assembly (and gene annotations?) or people uploading relevant data. This reviewer would have been far more comfortable had the authors engaged in some active spot-checking, doing the lab work to try to confirm absences at least for some loci and some species. Without this, a reader is left to wonder whether gene loss is simply reflecting imperfect databases, which then undercuts confidence in estimates of rates of gene loss.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, just because a locus has not been confirmed in a species does not necessarily mean that it is absent. As we explain in the Figure 1 caption, only a few species have had their genomes extensively studied (gray background), and only for these species does the absence of a point in this figure mean that a locus is absent. The white background rows represent species that are not extensively studied, and we point out that the absence of a point does not mean that a locus is absent from the species, rather undiscovered. We have also added a parenthetical to the text to explain this (line 156): “Only species with rows highlighted in gray have had their MHC regions extensively studied (and thus only for these rows is the absence of a gene symbol meaningful).”</p><p>While we agree that spot-checking may be a helpful next step, one of the goals of this manuscript is to collect and synthesize the enormous volume of MHC evolution research in the primates, which will serve as a jumping-off point for other researchers to perform important wet lab work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some context is useful for comparing rates of gene turnover in MHC, to other loci. Changing gene copy numbers, duplications, and loss of duplicates, are common it seems across many loci and many organisms; is MHC exceptional in this regard, or merely behaving like any moderately large gene family? I would very much have liked to see comparable analyses done for other gene families (immune, like TLRs, or non-immune), and quantitative comparisons of evolutionary rates between MHC versus other genes. Does MHC gene composition evolve any faster than a random gene family? At present readers may be tempted to infer this, but evidence is not provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Our companion paper (Fortier and Pritchard, 2025) demonstrates that the MHC is a unique locus in many regards, such as its evidence for deep balancing selection and its excess of disease associations. Thus, we expect that it is evolving faster than any random gene family. It would be interesting to repeat this analysis for other gene families, but that is outside of the scope of this project. Additionally, allele databases for other gene families are not nearly as developed, but as more alleles become available for other polymorphic families, a comparable analysis could become possible.</p><p>We have added a paragraph to the discussion (lines 530-546) to clarify that we do not know for certain whether the MHC gene family is evolving rapidly compared to other gene families.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While on the topic of making comparisons, the authors make a few statements about relative rates. For instance, lines 447-8 compare gene topology of classical versus non-classical genes; and line 450 states that classical genes experience more turnover. But there are no quantitative values given to these rates to provide numerical comparisons, nor confidence intervals provided (these are needed, given that they are estimates), nor formal statistical comparisons to confirm our confidence that rates differ between types of genes.</p><p>More broadly, the paper uses sophisticated phylogenetic methods, but without taking advantage of macroevolutionary comparative methods that allow model-based estimation of macroevolutionary rates. I found the lack of quantitative measurements of rates of gene gain/loss to be a weakness of the present version of the paper, and something that should be readily remedied. When claiming that MHC Class I genes &quot;turn over rapidly&quot; (line 476) - what does rapidly mean? How rapidly? How does that compare to rates of genetic turnover at other families? Quantitative statements should be supported by quantitative estimates (and their confidence intervals).</p></disp-quote><p>These statements refer to qualitative observations, so we cannot provide numerical values. We simply conclude that certain gene groups evolve faster or slower based on the species and genes present in each clade. It is difficult to provide estimates because of the incomplete sampling of genes that survived to the present day. In addition, the presence or absence of various orthologs in different species still needs to be confirmed, at which point it might be useful to be more quantitative. We have also added a paragraph to the discussion to address this concern and advocate for similar analyses of other gene families in the future when more data is available (lines 530-546).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors refer to 'shared function of the MHC across species' (e.g. line 22); while this is likely true, they are not here presenting any functional data to confirm this, nor can they rule out neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization of gene duplicates. There is evidence in other vertebrates (e.g., cod) of MHC evolving appreciably altered functions, so one may not safely assume the function of a locus is static over long macroevolutionary periods, although that would be a plausible assumption at first glance.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we cannot assume that the function of a locus is static across time, especially for the MHC region. In our research, we read hundreds of papers that each focused on a small number of species or genes and gathered some information about them, sometimes based on functional experiments and sometimes on measures such as dN/dS. These provide some indication of a gene’s broad classification in a species or clade, even if the evidence is preliminary. Where possible, we used this preliminary evidence to give genes descriptors “classical,” “non-classical,” “dual characteristics,” “pseudogene,” “fixed”, or “unfixed.” Sometimes multiple individuals and haplotypes were analyzed, so we could even assign a minimum number of gene copies present in a species. We have aggregated all of these references into Supplementary Table 1 (for Class I/Figure 1) and Supplementary Table 2 (for Class II/Figure 2) along with specific details about which data points in these figures that each reference supports. We realize that many of these classifications are based on a small number of individuals or indirect measures, so they may change in the future as more functional data is generated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary history of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) gene family across primate species. Specifically, they sought to:</p><p>(1) Analyze the evolutionary patterns of MHC genes and pseudogenes across the entire primate order, spanning 60 million years of evolution.</p><p>(2) Build gene and allele trees to compare the evolutionary rates of MHC Class I and Class II genes, with a focus on identifying which genes have evolved rapidly and which have remained stable.</p><p>(3) Investigate the role of often-overlooked pseudogenes in reconstructing evolutionary events, especially within the Class I region.</p><p>(4) Highlight how different primate species use varied MHC genes, haplotypes, and genetic variation to mount successful immune responses, despite the shared function of the MHC across species.</p><p>(5) Fill gaps in the current understanding of MHC evolution by taking a broader, multi-species perspective using (a) phylogenomic analytical computing methods such as Beast2, Geneconv, BLAST, and the much larger computing capacities that have been developed and made available to researchers over the past few decades, (b) literature review for gene content and arrangement, and genomic rearrangements via haplotype comparisons.</p><p>(6) The authors overall conclusions based on their analyses and results are that 'different species employ different genes, haplotypes, and patterns of variation to achieve a successful immune response'.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Essentially, much of the information presented in this paper is already well-known in the MHC field of genomic and genetic research, with few new conclusions and with insufficient respect to past studies. Nevertheless, while MHC evolution is a well-studied area, this paper potentially adds some originality through its comprehensive, cross-species evolutionary analysis of primates, focus on pseudogenes and the modern, large-scale methods employed. Its originality lies in its broad evolutionary scope of the primate order among mammals with solid methodological and phylogenetic analyses.</p><p>The main strengths of this study are the use of large publicly available databases for primate MHC sequences, the intensive computing involved, the phylogenetic tool Beast2 to create multigene Bayesian phylogenetic trees using sequences from all genes and species, separated into Class I and Class II groups to provide a backbone of broad relationships to investigate subtrees, and the presentation of various subtrees as species and gene trees in an attempt to elucidate the unique gene duplications within the different species. The study provides some additional insights with summaries of MHC reference genomes and haplotypes in the context of a literature review to identify the gene content and haplotypes known to be present in different primate species. The phylogenetic overlays or ideograms (Figures 6 and 7) in part show the complexity of the evolution and organisation of the primate MHC genes via the orthologous and paralogous gene and species pathways progressively from the poorly-studied NWM, across a few moderately studied ape species, to the better-studied human MHC genes and haplotypes.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The title 'The Primate Major Histocompatibility Complex: An Illustrative Example of GeneFamily Evolution' suggests that the paper will explore how the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) in primates serves as a model for understanding gene family evolution. The term 'Illustrative Example' in the title would be appropriate if the paper aimed to use the primate Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) as a clear and representative case to demonstrate broader principles of gene family evolution. That is, the MHC gene family is not just one instance of gene family evolution but serves as a well-studied, insightful example that can highlight key mechanisms and concepts applicable to other gene families. However, this is not the case, this paper only covers specific details of primate MHC evolution without drawing broader lessons to any other gene families. So, the term 'Illustrative Example' is too broad or generalizing. In this case, a term like 'Case Study' or simply 'Example' would be more suitable. Perhaps, 'An Example of Gene Family Diversity' would be more precise. Also, an explanation or 'reminder' is suggested that this study is not about the origins of the MHC genes from the earliest jawed vertebrates per se (~600 mya), but it is an extension within a subspecies set that has emerged relatively late (~60 mya) in the evolutionary divergent pathways of the MHC genes, systems, and various vertebrate species.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your input on the title; we have changed it to “A case study of gene family evolution” instead.</p><p>Thank you also for pointing out the potential confusion about the time span of our study. We have added “Having originated in the jawed vertebrates,” to a sentence in the introduction (lines 38-39). We have also added the sentence “Here, we focus on the primates, spanning approximately 60 million years within the over 500-million-year evolution of the family (Flajnik 2010).“ to be more explicit about the context for our work (lines 59-61).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Phylogenomics. Particular weaknesses in this study are the limitations and problems associated with providing phylogenetic gene and species trees to try and solve the complex issue of the molecular mechanisms involved with imperfect gene duplications, losses, and rearrangements in a complex genomic region such as the MHC that is involved in various effects on the response and regulation of the immune system. A particular deficiency is drawing conclusions based on a single exon of the genes. Different exons present different trees. Which are the more reliable? Why were introns not included in the analyses? The authors attempt to overcome these limitations by including genomic haplotype analysis, duplication models, and the supporting or contradictory information available in previous publications. They succeed in part with this multidiscipline approach, but much is missed because of biased literature selection. The authors should include a paragraph about the benefits and limitations of the software that they have chosen for their analysis, and perhaps suggest some alternative tools that they might have tried comparatively. How were problems with Bayesian phylogeny such as computational intensity, choosing probabilities, choosing particular exons for analysis, assumptions of evolutionary models, rates of evolution, systemic bias, and absence of structural and functional information addressed and controlled for in this study?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that different exons have different trees, which is exactly why we repeated our analysis for each exon in order to compare and contrast them. In particular, the exons encoding the binding site of the resulting protein (exons 2 and 3 for Class I and exon 2 for Class II) show evidence for trans-species polymorphism and gene conversion. These phenomena lead to trees that do not follow the species tree and are fascinating in and of themselves, which we explore in detail in our companion paper (Fortier and Pritchard, 2025). Meanwhile, the non-peptide-binding extracellular-domain-encoding exon (exon 4 for Class I and exon 3 for Class II) is comparably sized to the binding-site-encoding exons and provides an interesting functional contrast. As this exon is likely less affected by trans-species polymorphism, gene conversion, and convergent evolution, we present results from it most often in the main text, though we occasionally touch on differences between the exons. See lines 191-196, 223-226, and 407-414 for some examples of how we discuss the exons in the text. Additionally, all trees from all of these exons can be found in the supplement.</p><p>We agree that introns would valuable to study in this context. Even though the non--binding-site-encoding exons are probably *less* affected by trans-species polymorphism, gene conversion, and convergent evolution, they are still functional. The introns, however, experience much more relaxed selection, if any, and comparing their trees to those for the exons would be valuable and illuminating. We did not generate intron trees for two reasons. Most importantly, there is a dearth of data available for the introns; in the databases we used, there was often intron data available only for human, chimpanzee, and sometimes macaque, and only for a small subset of the genes. This limitation is at odds with the comprehensive, many-gene-many-species approach which we feel is the main novelty of this work. Secondly, the introns that *are* available are difficult to align. Even aligning the exons across such a highly-diverged set of genes and pseudogenes was difficult and required manual effort. The introns proved even more difficult to try to align across genes. In the future, when more intron data is available and sufficient effort is put into aligning them, it will be possible and desirable to do a comparable analysis. We also added a sentence to the “Data” section to briefly explain why we did not include introns (lines 134-135).</p><p>We explain our Bayesian phylogenetics approach in detail in the Methods (lines 650-725), including our assumptions and our solutions to challenges specific to this application. For further explanation of the method itself, we suggest reading the original <italic>BEAST</italic> and <italic>BEAST2</italic> papers (Drummond &amp; Rambaut (2007), Drummond et al. (2012), Bouckaert et al. (2014), and Bouckaert et al. (2019)). Known structural and functional information helped us validate the alignments we used in this study, but the fact that such information is not fully known for every gene and species should not affect the method itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Gene families as haplotypes. In the Introduction, the MHC is referred to as a 'gene family', and in paragraph 2, it is described as being united by the 'MHC fold', despite exhibiting 'very diverse functions'. However, the MHC region is more accurately described as a multigene region containing diverse, haplotype-specific Conserved Polymorphic Sequences, many of which are likely to be regulatory rather than protein-coding. These regulatory elements are essential for controlling the expression of multiple MHC-related products, such as TNF and complement proteins, a relationship demonstrated over 30 years ago. Non-MHC fold loci such as TNF, complement, POU5F1, lncRNA, TRIM genes, LTA, LTB, NFkBIL1, etc, are present across all MHC haplotypes and play significant roles in regulation. Evolutionary selection must act on genotypes, considering both paternal and maternal haplotypes, rather than on individual genes alone. While it is valuable to compile databases for public use, their utility is diminished if they perpetuate outdated theories like the 'birth-and-death model'. The inclusion of prior information or assumptions used in a statistical or computational model, typically in Bayesian analysis, is commendable, but they should be based on genotypic data rather than older models. A more robust approach would consider the imperfect duplication of segments, the history of their conservation, and the functional differences in inheritance patterns. Additionally, the MHC should be examined as a genomic region, with ancestral haplotypes and sequence changes or rearrangements serving as key indicators of human evolution after the 'Out of Africa' migration, and with disease susceptibility providing a measurable outcome. There are more than 7000 different HLA-B and -C alleles at each locus, which suggests that there are many thousands of human HLA haplotypes to study. In this regard, the studies by Dawkins et al (1999 Immunol Rev 167,275), Shiina et al. (2006 Genetics 173,1555) on human MHC gene diversity and disease hitchhiking (haplotypes), and Sznarkowska et al. (2020 Cancers 12,1155) on the complex regulatory networks governing MHC expression, both in terms of immune transcription factor binding sites and regulatory non-coding RNAs, should be examined in greater detail, particularly in the context of MHC gene allelic diversity and locus organization in humans and other primates.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments. To clarify that the MHC “region” is different from (and contains) the MHC “gene family” as we describe it, we changed a sentence in the abstract (lines 8-10) from “One large gene family that has experienced rapid evolution is the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), whose proteins serve critical roles in innate and adaptive immunity.” to “One large gene family that has experienced rapid evolution lies within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), whose proteins serve critical roles in innate and adaptive immunity.” We know that the region is complex and contains many other genes and regulatory sequences; Figure 1 of our companion paper (Fortier and Pritchard, 2025) depicts these in order to show the reader that the MHC genes we focus on are just one part of the entire region.</p><p>We love the suggestion to look at the many thousands of alleles present at each of the classical loci. This is the focus of our complimentary paper (Fortier and Pritchard, 2025) which explores variation at the allele level. In the current paper, we look mainly at the differences between genes and the use of different genes in different species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Diversifying and/or concerted evolution. Both this and past studies highlight diversifying selection or balancing selection model is the dominant force in MHC evolution. This is primarily because the extreme polymorphism observed in MHC genes is advantageous for populations in terms of pathogen defence. Diversification increases the range of peptides that can be presented to T cells, enhancing the immune response. The peptide-binding regions of MHC genes are highly variable, and this variability is maintained through selection for immune function, especially in the face of rapidly evolving pathogens. In contrast, concerted evolution, which typically involves the homogenization of gene duplicates through processes like gene conversion or unequal crossing-over, seems to play a minimal role in MHC evolution. Although gene duplication events have occurred in the MHC region leading to the expansion of gene families, the resulting paralogs often undergo divergent evolution rather than being kept similar or homozygous by concerted evolution. Therefore, unlike gene families such as ribosomal RNA genes or histone genes, where concerted evolution leads to highly similar copies, MHC genes display much higher levels of allelic and functional diversification. Each MHC gene copy tends to evolve independently after duplication, acquiring unique polymorphisms that enhance the repertoire of antigen presentation, rather than undergoing homogenization through gene conversion. Also, in some populations with high polymorphism or genetic drift, allele frequencies may become similar over time without the influence of gene conversion. This similarity can be mistaken for gene conversion when it is simply due to neutral evolution or drift, particularly in small populations or bottlenecked species. Moreover, gene conversion might contribute to greater diversity by creating hybrids or mosaics between different MHC genes. In this regard, can the authors indicate what percentage of the gene numbers in their study have been homogenised by gene conversion compared to those that have been diversified by gene conversion?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the summary, and we feel we have appropriately discussed both gene conversion and diversifying selection in the context of the MHC genes. Because we cannot know for sure when and where gene conversion has occurred, we cannot quantify percentages of genes that have been homogenized or diversified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Duplication models. The phylogenetic overlays or ideograms (Figures 6 and 7) show considerable imperfect multigene duplications, losses, and rearrangements, but the paper's Discussion provides no in-depth consideration of the various multigenic models or mechanisms that can be used to explain the occurrence of such events. How do their duplication models compare to those proposed by others? For example, their text simply says on line 292, 'the proposed series of events is not always consistent with phylogenetic data'. How, why, when? Duplication models for the generation and extension of the human MHC class I genes as duplicons (extended gene or segmental genomic structures) by parsimonious imperfect tandem duplications with deletions and rearrangements in the alpha, beta, and kappa blocks were already formulated in the late 1990s and extended to the rhesus macaque in 2004 based on genomic haplotypic sequences. These studies were based on genomic sequences (genes, pseudogenes, retroelements), dot plot matrix comparisons, and phylogenetic analyses of gene and retroelement sequences using computer programs. It already was noted or proposed in these earlier 1999 studies that (1) the ancestor of HLA-P(90)/-T(16)/W(80) represented an old lineage separate from the other HLA class I genes in the alpha block, (2) HLA-U(21) is a duplicated fragment of HLA-A, (3) HLA-F and HLA-V(75) are among the earliest (progenitor) genes or outgroups within the alpha block, (4) distinct Alu and L1 retroelement sequences adjoining HLA-L(30), and HLA-N genomic segments (duplicons) in the kappa block are closely related to those in the HLA-B and HLA-C in the beta block; suggesting an inverted duplication and transposition of the HLA genes and retroelements between the beta and kappa regions. None of these prior human studies were referenced by Fortier and Pritchard in their paper. How does their human MHC class I gene duplication model (Fig. 6) such as gene duplication numbers and turnovers differ from those previously proposed and described by Kulski et al (1997 JME 45,599), (1999 JME 49,84), (2000 JME 50,510), Dawkins et al (1999 Immunol Rev 167,275), and Gaudieri et al (1999 GR 9,541)? Is this a case of reinventing the wheel?</p></disp-quote><p>Figures 6 and 7 are intended to synthesize and reconcile past findings and our own trees, so they do not strictly adhere to the findings of any particular study and cannot fully match all studies. In the supplement, Figure 6 - figure supplement 1 and Figure 7 - figure supplement 1 duly credit all of the past work that went into making these trees. Most previous papers focus on just one aspect of these trees, such as haplotypes within a species, a specific gene or allelic lineage relationship, or the branching pattern of particular gene groups. We believe it was necessary to bring all of these pieces of evidence together. Even among papers with the same focus (to understand the block duplications that generated the current physical layout of the MHC), results differ. For example, Geraghty (1992), Hughes (1995), Kulski (2004)/Kulski (2005), and Shiina (1999) all disagree on the exact branching order of the genes MHC-W, -P, and -T, and of MHC-G, -J, and -K. While the Kulski studies you pointed out were very thorough for their era, they still only relied on data from three species and one haplotype per species. Our work is not intended to replace or discredit these past works, simply build upon them with a larger set of species and sequences. We hope the hypotheses we propose in Figures 6 and 7 can help unify existing research and provide a more easily accessible jumping-off-point for future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results. The results are presented as new findings, whereas most if not all of the results' significance and importance already have been discussed in various other publications. Therefore, the authors might do better to combine the results and discussion into a single section with appropriate citations to previously published findings presented among their results for comparison. Do the trees and subsets differ from previous publications, albeit that they might have fewer comparative examples and samples than the present preprint? Alternatively, the results and discussion could be combined and presented as a review of the field, which would make more sense and be more honest than the current format of essentially rehashing old data.</p></disp-quote><p>In starting this project, we found that a large barrier to entry to this field of study is the immense amount of published literature over 30+ years. It is both time-consuming and confusing to read up on the many nuances of the MHC genes, their changing names, and their evolution, making it difficult to start new, innovative projects. We acknowledge that while our results are not entirely novel, the main advantage of our work is that it provides a thorough, comprehensive starting point for others to learn about the MHC quickly and dive into new research.

Another possibility is that one or two nucleotide mutations have occurred without a recombination resulting in a mistaken interpretation or conclusion of a recombination event.

We used the program GENECONV to infer gene conversion events, but there is considerable uncertainty owing to the ages of the genes and the inevitable point mutations that have occurred post-event.

The alpha block in some non-primate mammalian species such as pigs, rats, and mice has no MHC class I genes or only a few.

However, our analysis (Figure 5A) shows that MHC-V sequences form a monophyletic clade outside of the MHC-W/P/T group of genes as well as outside of the MHC-A/B/C/E/F/G/J/K/L group of genes, which is not consistent with MHC-A and -V being closely related. Thus, we conclude that MHC-V split off earlier than the differentiation of these other gene groups and is thus older than previously thought.

The work is timely because there is an obvious need to move beyond short amplicon-based polymorphism surveys and classical comparative genomic studies. The paper is data-rich and the approach taken by the authors, i.e. an integrative phylogeny of all MHC genes within a given class across species and the inclusion of often ignored pseudogenes, makes a lot of sense. The focus on primates is a good idea because of the wealth of genomic and, in some cases, functional data, and the relatively densely populated phylogenetic tree facilitates the reconstruction of rapid evolutionary events, providing insights into the mechanisms of MHC evolution. Appendices 1-2 may seem unusual at first glance, but I found them helpful in distilling the information that the authors consider essential, thus reducing the need for the reader to wade through a vast amount of literature. Appendix 3 is an extremely valuable companion in navigating the maze of primate MHC genes and associated terminology.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I have not identified major weaknesses and my comments are mostly requests for clarification and justification of some methodological choices.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you so much for your kind and supportive review!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Line 151: How is 'extensively studied' defined?</p></disp-quote><p>Extensively studied is not a strict definition, but a few organisms clearly stand apart from the rest in terms of how thoroughly their MHC regions have been studied.

The roles of these proteins are not necessarily conserved between closely related species, and experimental evidence is needed to evaluate this.

As the M&amp;M section is at the end of the MS (and contains limited justification), some information on two aspects is needed here for the benefit of the reader. First, as far as I understand, all phylogenetic inferences were based entirely on DNA sequences of individual (in some cases concatenated) exons. It would be useful for the reader to explain why you've chosen to rely on DNA rather than protein sequences, even though some of the genes you include in the phylogenetic analysis are highly divergent. Second, a reader might wonder how the &quot;maximum clade credibility tree&quot; from the Bayesian analysis compares to commonly seen trees with bootstrap support or posterior probability values assigned to particular clades. Personally, I think that the authors' approach to identifying and presenting representative trees is reasonable (although one might wonder why &quot;Maximum clade credibility tree&quot; and not &quot;Maximum credibility tree&quot; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.beast2.org/summarizing-posterior-trees/">https://www.beast2.org/summarizing-posterior-trees/</ext-link>), since they are working with a large number of short, sometimes divergent and sometimes rather similar sequences - in such cases, a requirement for strict clade support could result in trees composed largely of polytomies. However, I feel it's necessary to be explicit about this and to acknowledge that the relationships represented by fully resolved bifurcating representative trees and interpreted in the study may not actually be highly supported in the sense that many readers might expect. In other words, the reader should be aware from the outset of what the phylogenies that are so central to the paper represent.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to rely on DNA rather than protein sequences because convergent evolution is likely to happen in regions that code for extremely important functions such as adaptive and innate immunity. Convergent evolution acts upon proteins while trans-species polymorphism retains ancient nucleotide variation, so studying the DNA sequence can help tease apart convergent evolution from trans-species polymorphism.</p><p>As for the “maximum clade credibility tree”, this is a matter of confusing nomenclature. In the online reference guide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.beast2.org/summarizing-posterior-trees/">https://www.beast2.org/summarizing-posterior-trees/</ext-link>), the tree with the maximum product of the posterior clade probabilities is called the “maximum credibility tree” while the tree that has the maximum sum of posterior clade probabilities is called the “Maximum credibility tree”.
