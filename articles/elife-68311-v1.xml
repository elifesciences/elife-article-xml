cells through Fcγ receptor (FcγR)-driven phagocytosis of antibody-opsonized targets. Phagocytosis requires activation of multiple FcγRs, but the mechanism controlling the threshold for response is unclear. We developed a DNA origami-based engulfment system that allows precise nanoscale control of the number and spacing of ligands. When the number of ligands remains constant, reducing ligand spacing from 17.5 nm to 7 nm potently enhances engulfment, primarily by increasing efficiency of the engulfment-initiation process. Tighter ligand clustering increases receptor phosphorylation, as well as proximal downstream signals. Increasing the number of signaling domains recruited to a single ligand-receptor complex was not sufficient to recapitulate this effect, indicating that clustering of multiple receptors is required. Our results suggest that macrophages use information about local ligand densities to make critical engulfment decisions, which has implications for the mechanism of antibody-mediated phagocytosis and the design of immunotherapies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The word ‘phagocytosis’ means cellular eating. It is the process by which cells extend their membranes around foreign particles and engulf them. Macrophages, a type of immune cell found in every tissue of the body, perform phagocytosis to eat pathogens and diseased cells. To avoid eating healthy cells, macrophages focus on targets marked by proteins called antibodies. They look for cells coated with high levels of a type of antibody called immunoglobulin G, or IgG for short, but only eat cells coated with enough IgG, raising the question, can macrophages count?</p><p>Macrophages recognize IgG antibodies using cell surface receptors called Fc-gamma Receptors. When these receptors bind to IgG, they cluster together. Researchers do not yet know how the number of IgG antibodies per cluster, or the spacing between them, affects phagocytosis. To find this out, researchers need to be able to manipulate the clustering experimentally. One way to do this is using a technique called DNA origami. This technique creates nanoscale patterns of DNA strands on a target surface. If the part of a receptor that interacts with its target is then replaced with a complementary DNA strand to the strands on the target surface, the receptor will bind the surface following the nanoscale pattern. This allows researchers to generate synthetic targets with specific patterns of receptor-target interaction.</p><p>Kern et al. replaced the part of the macrophage Fc-gamma Receptor that interacts with IgG with a strand of DNA. They then used DNA origami to arrange complementary DNA strands on pegboards and attached these pegboards to silica beads. The different arrangements of DNA on these pegboards mimicked the types of antibody clusters macrophages might encounter on the surfaces of the cells and particles they have to engulf in the body. Kern et al. found that tight clusters of the DNA targets on the pegboards made the macrophages most likely to begin phagocytosis, particularly clusters of eight or more DNA strands spaced less than seven nanometers apart. Macrophages encountering these tight clusters showed an increase in Fc-gamma receptor activation, which is crucial for macrophage attack.</p><p>Whether or not macrophages can count, they can at least sense the level of clustering of IgG antibodies to determine if a target should be engulfed. Doctors use antibody therapies that rely on Fc-gamma receptor engagement to treat cancer, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding how clustering affects phagocytosis could aid in the design of new antibody treatments. It could also help improve the design of synthetic receptors to create designer immune cells that can attack specific targets. The next step will be to recreate the results from the synthetic system used by Kern et al. with natural receptors and antibodies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Phagocytosis</kwd><kwd>Antibody</kwd><kwd>DNA origami</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>Fc Receptor</kwd><kwd>synthetic biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vale</surname><given-names>Ronald D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM120990</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrissey</surname><given-names>Meghan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Manipulating nanoscale spacing of Fcγ receptors using DNA origami demonstrates that ligand clustering regulates receptor phosphorylation and phagocytosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Immune cells eliminate pathogens and diseased cells while limiting damage to healthy cells. Macrophages, professional phagocytes and key effectors of the innate immune system, play an important role in this process by engulfing opsonized targets bearing ‘eat me’ signals. One of the most common ‘eat me’ signals is the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, which can bind foreign proteins on infected cells or pathogens. IgG is recognized by Fcγ receptors (FcγR) in macrophages that drive antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DiLillo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Erwig and Gow, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2008</xref>). ADCP is a key mechanism of action for several cancer immunotherapies including rituximab, trastuzumab, and cetuximab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Uchida et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Watanabe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Weiskopf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weiskopf and Weissman, 2015</xref>). Exploring the design parameters of effective antibodies could provide valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms driving ADCP.</p><p>Activation of multiple FcγRs is required for a macrophage to engulf a three-dimensional target. FcγR-IgG must be present across the entire target to drive progressive closure of the phagocytic cup that surrounds the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Griffin et al., 1975</xref>). In addition, a critical antibody threshold across an entire target dictates an all-or-none engulfment response by the macrophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Although the mechanism of this thresholded response remains unclear, receptor clustering plays a role in regulating digital responses in other immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis and van der Merwe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holowka and Baird, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Veneziano et al., 2020</xref>). FcγR clustering may also regulate phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodridge et al., 2012</xref>). High-resolution imaging of macrophages has demonstrated that IgG-bound FcγRs form clusters (resolution of &gt;100 nm) within the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lopes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sobota et al., 2005</xref>). These small clusters, which recruit downstream effector proteins such as Syk-kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase, eventually coalesce into larger micron-scale patches as they migrate towards the center of the cell-target synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaumouillé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lopes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sobota et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Prior observational studies could not decouple ligand clustering from other parameters, such as ligand number or receptor mobility. As a result, we do not have a clear picture of how ligand number or molecular spacing regulates signal activation. To directly assess such questions, we have developed a reconstituted system that utilizes DNA origami to manipulate ligand patterns on a single-molecule level with nanometer resolution. We found that tightly spaced ligands strongly enhanced phagocytosis compared to the same number of more dispersed ligands. Through manipulating the number and spacing of ligands on individual origami pegboards, we found that eight or more ligands per cluster maximized FcγR-driven engulfment, and that macrophages preferentially engulfed targets that had receptor-ligand clusters spaced ≤7 nm apart. We demonstrated that tight ligand clustering enhanced receptor phosphorylation, and the generation of PIP<sub>3</sub> and actin filaments – critical downstream signaling molecules – at the phagocytic synapse. Together, our results suggest that the nanoscale clustering of receptors may allow macrophages to discriminate between lower density background stimuli and the higher density of ligands on opsonized targets. These results have implications for the design of immunotherapies that involve manipulating FcγR-driven engulfment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Developing a DNA-based chimeric antigen receptor to study phagocytosis</title><p>To study how isolated biochemical and biophysical ligand parameters affect engulfment, we sought to develop a well-defined and tunable engulfment system. Our lab previously developed a synthetic T cell signaling system, in which we replaced the receptor-ligand interaction (TCR-pMHC) with complimentary DNA oligos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>). We applied a similar DNA-based synthetic chimeric antigen receptor to study engulfment signaling in macrophages.

To compare engulfment dynamics mediated by 4T and 4S origami pegboards in the same experiment, we labeled each pegboard type with a different colored fluorophore, functionalized a set of beads with each type of pegboard, and added both bead types to macrophages at the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Macrophages interacted with beads functionalized with the 4T and 4S pegboards with comparable frequency (46 ± 7% total bead-cell contacts vs. 54 ± 7% total bead-cell contacts, respectively). However, the probability of engulfment initiation was significantly higher for the 4T (95 ± 5% of bead contacts) versus 4S (61 ± 9% of bead contacts) beads, and the probability that initiation events resulted in successful completion of engulfment was higher for 4T (69 ± 9% of initiation events) versus 4S (39 ± 11% of initiation events) beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

One possibility is that the clustering of four complete receptors is needed to drive segregation of the inhibitory phosphatase CD45 and allow sustained phosphorylation of the FcγR immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakalar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodridge et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmid et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, the 4-ligand cluster may be needed to obtain a critical intracellular concentration of FcγR ITAM signaling domains. To test for the latter possibility, we designed a synthetic receptor (DNA-CAR-4xγ) that contains four repeats of the intracellular domain of the DNA-CARγ connected by a GGSG linker between each repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We confirmed that this DNA-CAR-4xγ receptor was more potent in activating engulfment than an equivalent receptor (DNA-CAR-1xγ−3xΔITAM) in which the three C-terminal ITAM domains were mutated to phenylalanines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>). Keeping the number of intracellular ITAMs constant, we compared the engulfment efficiency mediated by two different receptors: (1) the DNA-CAR-4xγ that interacted with beads functionalized with 1-ligand origami and (2) the DNA-CAR-1xγ−3xΔITAM that interacted with beads coated with equivalent amounts of 4T origami (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). While the DNA-CAR-1xγ−3xΔITAM-expressing macrophages engulfed 4T origami beads, the DNA-CAR-4xγ macrophages failed to engulf the high-affinity 1-ligand origami beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To ensure that all four ITAM domains on the DNA-CAR-4xγ were signaling competent, we designed two additional DNA-CARs that placed the functional ITAM at the second and fourth position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These receptors were able to induce phagocytosis of 4T origami beads, indicating that the DNA-CAR-4xγ likely contains four functional ITAMs. Collectively, these results indicate that the tight clustering of multiple receptors is necessary for engulfment and increasing the number of intracellular signaling modules on a single receptor is not sufficient to surpass the threshold for activation of engulfment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Macrophages integrate information from many FcγR-antibody interactions to discriminate between highly opsonized targets and background signal from soluble antibody or sparsely opsonized targets. How the macrophage integrates signals from multiple FcγR binding events to make an all-or-none engulfment response is not clear. Here, we use DNA origami nanostructures to manipulate and assess how the nanoscale spatial organization of receptor-ligand interactions modulates FcγR signaling and the engulfment process. We found that tight ligand clustering increases the probability of initiating phagocytosis by enhancing FcγR phosphorylation.</p><p>Phagocytosis requires IgG across the entire target surface to initiate local receptor activation and to ‘zipper’ close the phagocytic cup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Griffin et al., 1975</xref>). Consistent with this zipper model, incomplete opsonization of a target surface, or micron-scale spaces between IgG patches, decreases engulfment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Griffin et al., 1975</xref>). Initially suggested as an alternative to the zipper model, the trigger model proposed that engulfment occurs once a threshold number of receptors interact with IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben M'Barek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Griffin et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Swanson and Baer, 1995</xref>). While this model has largely fallen out of favor, more recent studies have found that a critical IgG threshold is needed to activate the final stages of phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Our data suggest that there may also be a nanoscale density-dependent trigger for receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling. Taken together, these results suggest that both tight nanoscale IgG-FcγR clustering and a uniform distribution of IgG across the target are needed to direct signaling to ‘zipper’ close the phagocytic cup. Why might macrophages use this local density-dependent trigger to dictate engulfment responses? Macrophages constantly encounter background ‘eat me’ signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonzalez-Quintela et al., 2008</xref>). This hyper-local density measurement may buffer macrophages against background stimuli and weakly opsonized targets that are unlikely to have adjacent bound antibodies, while still robustly detecting and efficiently engulfing highly opsonized targets.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with previous results demonstrating that FcγR crosslinking correlates with increased ITAM phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kwiatkowska and Sobota, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sobota et al., 2005</xref>). While our data pinpoints a role for ligand spacing in regulating receptor phosphorylation, it is possible that later steps in the phagocytic signaling pathway are also directly affected by ligand spacing. The mechanism by which dense-ligand clustering promotes receptor phosphorylation remains an open question, although our data rule out a couple of models. Specifically, we demonstrate that nanoscale ligand clustering does not noticeably affect the amount of ligand-bound receptor at the phagocytic cup, and that ligand spacing continues to affect engulfment when avidity effects are diminished through the use of high-affinity receptor-ligands. Collectively, these data reveal that changes in receptor binding or recruitment caused by increased avidity are unlikely to account for the increased potency of clustered ligands. Our data also exclude the possibility that receptor clustering simply increases the local intracellular concentration of FcγR signaling domains as arranging FcγR ITAMs in tandem did not have the same effect as clustering multiple receptor-ligand interactions. However, it remains possible that the geometry of the intracellular signaling domains could be important for activating or localizing downstream signaling, and that tandem ITAMs on the same polypeptide cannot produce the same engulfment signals as ITAMs on separate parallel polypeptides.</p><p>One possible model to explain the observed ligand-density dependence of signaling involves the ordering of lipids around the FcγR. Segregated liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered membrane domains around immune receptor clusters have been reported to promote receptor phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bag et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dinic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eggeling et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kabouridis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simons and Ikonen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sohn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stone et al., 2017</xref>). FcγR clusters are associated with liquid-ordered domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beekman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Katsumata et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kwiatkowska and Sobota, 2001</xref>). Liquid-ordered domains recruit Src family kinases, which phosphorylate FcγRs, while liquid-disordered domains are enriched in the transmembrane phosphatase CD45, which dephosphorylates FcγRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bag et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sohn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stone et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, lipid ordering could provide a mechanism that leads to receptor activation if denser receptor-ligand clusters are more efficient in nucleating or associating with ordered lipid domains.</p><p>As an alternative model, a denser cluster of ligated receptors may enhance the steric exclusion of the bulky transmembrane proteins like the phosphatases CD45 and CD148 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakalar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodridge et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). CD45 is heavily glycosylated, making the extracellular domain 25–40 nm tall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis and van der Merwe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCall et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Woollett et al., 1985</xref>). Because of its size, CD45 is excluded from close cell-cell contacts, such as those mediated by IgG-FcγR, which have a dimension of 11.5 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakalar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burroughs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carbone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmid et al., 2016</xref>). IgG bound to antigens ≤ 10.5 nm from the target surface induces CD45 exclusion and engulfment (estimated total intermembrane distance of ≤22 nm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakalar et al., 2018</xref>). Our DNA origami structure is estimated to generate similar intermembrane spacing, consisting of hybridized receptor-ligand DNA (~9.4 nm), the origami pegboard (6 nm), and neutravidin (4 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosano et al., 1999</xref>). A higher receptor-ligand density constrains membrane shape fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krobath et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krobath et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Różycki et al., 2010</xref>), and this constraint may increase CD45 exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmid et al., 2016</xref>). Both the lipid ordering and the steric exclusion models predict at least a partial exclusion of the CD45 from the zone of the receptor cluster. However, the dimension of the tight cluster in particular is very small (7 by 3.5 nm) and measurement of protein concentration at this level is currently not easily achieved, even with super-resolution techniques. Overall, our results establish the molecular and spatial parameters necessary for FcγR activation and demonstrate that the spatial organization of IgG-FcγR interactions alone can affect engulfment decisions.</p><p>How does our synthetic DNA-CARγ receptor compare to endogenous FcγRs? Our DNA-CARs are single-chain receptors that recruit one intracellular signaling domain per ligand, similar to the single-chain human FcγRIIA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2006</xref>). FcγRIIA is ubiquitously expressed on human myeloid cells, and high-affinity FcRIIA alleles correlate with an increase in effectiveness of the ADCP-inducing drug rituximab and lupus susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruhns and Jönsson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2006</xref>). The majority of FcγR family members, including all activating mouse FcγRs and the human FcγRI and FcγRIIIA, are multimeric complexes composed of a ligand-binding α chain and a dimerized signaling γ chain. This results in two signaling γ chains recruited to each IgG ligand. The different stoichiometry between ligand-binding and intracellular signaling domains may affect some parameters like optimal cluster size. A second difference between the DNA-CARγ and the endogenous system is the presence of the CD86 transmembrane domain. We found that ligand spacing had a similar effect on phagocytosis when we replaced the CD86 transmembrane domain with the Fcα or Fcγ transmembrane domain. However, the Fcγ transmembrane domain construct triggered more bead internalization across all conditions. We hypothesize this could be because the transmembrane domain retains some ability to dimerize, recruiting more signaling domains to each ligand, or because it is better able to associate with lipid-ordered domains. Future studies that pattern either endogenous Fc receptor complex or IgG ligand could clarify these questions.</p><p>How does the spacing requirements for FcγR nanoclusters compare to other signaling systems? Engineered multivalent Fc oligomers revealed that IgE ligand geometry alters Fcε receptor signaling in mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sil et al., 2007</xref>). DNA origami nanoparticles and planar nanolithography arrays have previously examined optimal inter-ligand distance for the T cell receptor, B cell receptor, NK cell receptor CD16, death receptor Fas, and integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deeg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delcassian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Veneziano et al., 2020</xref>). Some systems, like integrin-mediated cell adhesion, appear to have very discrete threshold requirements for ligand spacing while others, like T cell activation, appear to continuously improve with reduced intermolecular spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2018</xref>). Our system may be more similar to the continuous improvement observed in T cell activation as our most spaced ligands (36.5 nm) are capable of activating some phagocytosis, albeit not as potently as the 4T. Interestingly, as the intermembrane distance between T cell and target increases, the requirement for tight ligand spacing becomes more stringent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that IgG bound to tall antigens may be more dependent on tight nanocluster spacing than short antigens. Planar arrays have also been used to vary inter-cluster spacing, in addition to inter-ligand spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>). Examining the optimal inter-cluster spacing during phagosome closure may be an interesting direction for future studies.</p><p>Our study on the spatial requirements of FcγR activation could have implications for the design of therapeutic antibodies or chimeric antigen receptors. Antibody therapies that rely on FcγR engagement are used to treat cancer, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Uchida et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Watanabe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Weiskopf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weiskopf and Weissman, 2015</xref>). Multimerizing Fc domains or targeting multiple antibodies to the same antigen may increase antibody potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, rituximab, a successful anti-CD20 therapy that potently induces ADCP, has two binding sites on its target antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Selecting clustered antigens or pharmacologically inducing antigen clustering may also increase antibody potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chew et al., 2020</xref>). These results suggest that oligomerization may lead to more effective therapy; however, a systematic study of the spatial parameters that affect FcγR activation has not been undertaken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakalar et al., 2018</xref>).

N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (BG-GLA-NHS)-functionalized benzylguanine was purchased from NEB (Cat# S9151S) and freshly reconstituted in DMSO to a final concentration of 83 mM. To functionalize the oligonucleotides with benzylguanine, the two solutions were mixed so that the molar ratio of oligonucleotide-amine:benzylguanine-NHS is 1:50 and the final concentration of HEPES is between 50 mM and 100 mM.

Cells were subsequently washed twice via centrifugation with 10 mL of imaging buffer to remove excess benzylguanine-labeled DNA and resuspended in 200 μL per 100,000 cells of imaging buffer containing 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Cells were then immediately added to each well and imaged. Data was only collected from a central region of interest (ROI) in the TIRF field. The origami fluorescent intensities along the x and y axes were plotted to ensure there was no drop off in signal and thus no uniformity of illumination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification of receptor and Syk recruitment to individual origami</title><p>Cells that expressed both the mNeonGreen-tagged DNA-CARγ receptor and the BFP-tagged Syk and had interactions with the 72-ligand origami were chosen for analysis in Fiji.

The lipid mixes were dried under argon gas and desiccated overnight to remove chloroform. The dried lipids were resuspended in 1 mL PBS, pH 7.2 (Gibco, Cat# 20012050) and stored under argon gas. Lipids were formed into small unilamellar vesicles via ≥30 rounds of freeze-thaws and cleared via ultracentrifugation (TLA120.1 rotor, 35,000 rpm/53,227×g, 35 min, 4°C). Lipids were stored at 4°C under argon gas in an Eppendorf tube for up to 2 weeks. To form bilayers on beads, 8.6 × 10<sup>8</sup> silica beads with a 4.89 µm diameter (10 µL of 10% solids, Bangs Labs, Cat# SS05N) were washed 2× with water followed by 2× with PBS by spinning at 300 rcf and decanting. Beads were then mixed with 1 mM SUVs in PBS, vortexed for 10 s at medium speed, covered in foil, and incubated in an end-over-end rotator at RT for 0.5–2 hr to allow bilayers to form over the beads. The beads were then washed 3× in PBS to remove excess SUVs and resuspended in 100 μL of 0.2% casein (Sigma, Cat# C5890) in PBS for 15 min at RT to block nonspecific binding. Neutravidin (Thermo, Cat# 31000) was added to the beads at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL for 20–30 min, and the beads were subsequently washed 3× in PBS with 0.2% casein and 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> to remove unbound neutravidin. The indicated amounts of biotinylated ssDNA or saturating amounts of DNA origami pegboards were added to the beads and incubated for 1 hr at RT with end-over-end mixing to allow for coupling. Beads were washed two times and resuspended in 100 μL PBS with 0.2% casein and 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> to remove uncoupled origami pegboards or ssDNA. When functionalizing SUV-coated beads with anti-biotin Alexa Fluor 647-IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Cat# 200-602-211, Lot# 137445), the IgG was added to the beads at 1 μM immediately following the casein blocking step, and beads were incubated for 1 hr at RT with end-over-end mixing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quantification of ssDNA, IgG, or origami on beads</title><p>To estimate the amount of ssDNA bound to each bead, we compared the fluorescence of Atto647-labeled DNA on the bead surface to calibrated fluorescent beads (Quantum Alexa Fluor 647, Bangs Lab) using confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine saturating conditions of IgG and origami pegboards, we titrated the amount of IgG or origami in the coupling reaction and used confocal microscopy to determine the concentration at which maximum coupling was achieved.

Wells were subsequently washed three times with PBS. Images were acquired using the HCS Site Generator plug-in in µManager and at least 100 cells were scored for each condition. When quantifying bead engulfment, cells were selected for analysis based on a threshold of GFP fluorescence, which was held constant throughout analysis for each individual experiment.

Bead contacts were identified by counting the number of beads that came into contact with the cells throughout the imaging time. Initiation events were identified by active membrane extension events around the bead. Engulfment completion was identified by complete internalization of the bead by the macrophage. The initiation time was quantified as the amount of time between bead contact (the first frame in which the bead contacted the macrophage) and engulfment initiation (the first frame in which membrane extension around the bead was visualized) and was only measured for beads that were completely internalized by the end of the imaging time. The engulfment time was quantified as the amount of time between engulfment initiation and engulfment completion (the first frame in which the bead has been fully internalized by the cell).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Quantification of synapse intensity of DNA-CARγ receptor, tSH2 Syk, PIP<sub>3</sub> reporter, and actin filaments</title><p>Phagocytic cups were selected for analysis based on clear initiation of membrane extension around the bead visualized by GFP fluorescence from the DNA-CARγ receptor.

Your DNA origami approach is able to operate in a range of intermolecular spacing that sits in between what can be achieved with protein oligomerization and methods based on arraying of metallic particles on planar substrates, which were the previous state of the art. The improved understanding of the physical requirements for phagocytosis that you have generated may also have applications in immunotherapy.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Tight nanoscale clustering of Fc γ-receptors using DNA origami promotes phagocytosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers at Review Commons, and the evaluation at <italic>eLife</italic> has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor.</p><p>This is a very nicely done synthetic biology/biophysics study on the effect of ligands spacing on phagocytosis. They use a DNA based recognition system similar to that previously use to investigate T cell signaling, but express the SNAP tag linked transmembrane receptor in a macrophage cell line and present the ligands using DNA origami mats to control the number and spacing of complementary ligands that are designed to be in the typical range for low or high affinity FcR, a receptor that can trigger phagocytosis. The study offers valuable quantitative data sets that will be of immediate interest to groups working in this area to understand principled of how this class of receptors work, and in the future, for design of synthetic receptors for immunotherapy applications.</p><p>Congratulations on your compelling exploration of the role of ligand spacing in phagocytosis using a DNA based chimeric receptor system and DNA origami.</p><p>The original reviewers concur that you have addressed their concerns. There is one issue to clarify.</p><p>1. One of the reviewers had asked for experiments with a &quot;receptor fusion construct&quot; (see 10.1038/s41467-019-10097-0) where you retain the alpha1-gamma2 architecture of the native FcR, but add the SNAP-DNA complex to the FcgR1 to determine if this changes the potency or spacing threshold. We understand that this might pose a number of challenges and its OK that you didn't do this. However, the new experiments using the FcgRI α TM and the FcR γ TM without the disulfides may need just a bit more explanation to not confuse readers. The reviewer noted that the FcR γ TM based constructs were more potent at phagocytosis, although, as you point out, they retained the trend of the spacing dependence. Even though the disulfides were not included, it's expected that the FcR γ construct will have a tendency to dimerise and that this may make it more potent. If this is the case, it still doesn't quite address the original question as you now have a synthetic receptor with two ligand binding and two signal transduction modules, whereas the &quot;receptor fusion&quot; would have just one ligand binding unit with two signal transduction modules. The nuances of this need to be discussed better and in relation to the configuration of most natural activating immunoreceptors. I hope this is clear and that you can easily address this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68311.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Overall, we were pleased that the reviewers found our study carefully designed and interesting. We have addressed their comments below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>The manuscript by Kern, et al., demonstrates that phagocytosis in macrophages is regulated in part by the intermolecular distance of phagocytosis-promoting receptors engaging phagocytic targets. Cells expressing chimeric receptors containing cytosolic domains of Fc receptors (FcR) and defined ligand-binding DNA domains were used to drive phagocytosis of opsonized glass beads coated with complementary DNA ligands of defined spacing and number. These so-called origami ligands allowed manipulation of receptor spacing following engagement, which allowed the demonstration that tight spacing of ligands (7 nm or 3.5 nm) optimized signaling for phagocytosis. The study is carefully performed and convincing. I have a few technical concerns and minor suggestions.</p><p>1. It is assumed that the origami preparations were entirely uniform. How much variation was there? Is that supported by TIRF microscopy of origami preparations? Was the TIRF microscopy calibrated for uniformity of fluorescence (ie., shade correction)?</p></disp-quote><p>Our laboratory, Dong et al., has extensively characterized the origami uniformity and robustness of these exact pegboards. This paper was just posted on bioRxiv (Dong et. al, 2021). We have also cited this paper in our revised manuscript in reference to the characterization of the DNA origami (Line 117).</p><p>We did not use any shade correction. Instead we only collected data from a central ROI in our TIRF field. To check for uniformity of illumination, we plotted the origami pegboard fluorescent intensity along the x and y axis. We observed very modest drop off in signal – the average signal intensity of origamis within 100 pixels of the edge is 76 ± 6% the intensity of origamis in a 100 pixel square in the center of the ROI. Fitting this data with a Gaussian model resulted in very poor R values. While this may account for some of the variation in signal intensity at individual points, we expect the normalized averages of each condition to be unaffected. We have amended the methods to describe this strategy (Lines 851-854).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68311-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Likewise, how much variation was there in the expression of the chimeric receptors? Large variation in receptor numbers per cell could significantly alter the quantitative studies. Aside from the flow sorting for cells expressing two different molecules, how were cells selected for analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this point. We confirmed comparable receptor expression levels at the cell cortex of the DNA CAR-𝛾 and the DNA CAR-adhesion used throughout the paper. We also have confirmed that receptor levels at the cell cortex were similar for the large DNA CAR constructs used in Figure 6C-D. This data is now included in Figures S5 and S7. We have also altered the text to include this (lines 169-172):</p><p>“Expression of the various DNA CARs at the cell cortex was comparable, and engulfment of beads functionalized with both the 4T and the 4S origami platforms was dependent on the Fc𝛾R signaling domain (Figure S5).”</p><p>When quantifying bead engulfment, cells were selected for analysis based on a threshold of GFP fluorescence, which was held constant throughout analysis for each individual experiment. We have amended the “Quantification of engulfment” methods section to convey this (​ lines 921-923).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The scale of the origami relative to the cells is difficult to discern in Figures 2C and D. Additional text would be helpful to indicate, for example, that the spots on the Figure 2D inset indicate entire origami rather than ligand spots on individual origami particles.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out, we see how the legend was unclear and have corrected it (lines 453-454), including specifically noting “Each diffraction limited magenta spot represents an origami pegboard.” We have also outlined the cell boundary in yellow to make the cell size more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 5 legend, line 482: How was macrophage membrane visualized for these measurements?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following clarification (line 535-536): “The​ macrophage membrane was visualized using the DNA CAR𝛾, which was present throughout the cell cortex.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Line 265: &quot;our data suggest that there may be a local density-dependent trigger for receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling&quot;. This threshold-dependent trigger response was also indicated in the study of Zhang, et al. 2010. PNAS.</p></disp-quote><p>The Zhang et al. study was influential in our study design, and we wish to give the appropriate credit. Zhang et al. found that a sufficient amount of IgG is necessary to activate late (but not early) steps in the phagocytic signaling pathway. In contrast, our study addresses IgG concentration in small nanoclusters. We find that this nanoscale density affects receptor phosphorylation. Thus, we think these two studies are distinct and complementary. Lines 283-287 now read:</p><p>“While this model has largely fallen out of favor, more recent studies have found that a critical IgG threshold is needed to activate the final stages of phagocytosis (Zhang et al., 2010). Our data suggest that there may also be a nanoscale density-dependent trigger for receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Line 55: Rephrase, “we found that a minimum threshold of 8 ligands per cluster maximized FcgR-driven engulfment.” It is difficult to picture how a minimum threshold maximizes something.</p></disp-quote><p>We now state “we found that 8 or more ligands per cluster maximized FcgR-driven engulfment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Line 184: Rephrase, &quot;we created… pegboards with very high-affinity DNA ligands that are predicted not to dissociate on a time scale of &gt;7 hr&quot;.

The basis of this study is the design of a chimeric Fc-receptor (DNA-CARg) comprising an extracellular SNAP-tag domain that can be loaded with single-stranded (ss) DNA, the transmembrane part of CD86 and the cytosolic part of the Fc-receptor g-chain containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) as well as a C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP). As control the authors used a similar designed DNA-CAR that is lacking the intracellular ITAM-containing FCg tail. The chosen target for this chimeric DNA-CAR, are silicon beads covered by a lipid bilayer that contains biotin-labelled lipids that, via Neutravidin, can be loaded with a biotinylated DNA origami pegboard displaying complimentary ss-DNA as ligand for the DNA-CAR. The DNA origami pegboard contains four ATTO647N fluorescence for visualization and the ssDNA ligand in different quantities and spacing.</p><p>Using these principles, the authors study how ligand affinity, concentration and spacing influence the activation of the DNA-CARg and the engulfment of the loaded beads.</p><p>The authors show that bead engulfment is increased between 2 till 8 ssDNA ligands on the pegboard. After this, ligand numbers do not play a role anymore in the engulfment. They then study the role of the ligand spacing using pegboards that either contain 4 single strand DNA ligands in close (7nm/3,5nm) proximity or a more spaced version using 21/17,5 nm or 35/38,5 nm. The authors find that the bead engulfment is maximally and positively affected by the close spacing of the ssDNA ligands. In their final experiments the authors vary the design of the DNA-CARs by tetramerization of the ITAM-containing Fcg-signaling subunit. In their discussion the authors mention different possibilities for the effect of spacing on the engulfment process.</p><p>I think that, in general, this is an interesting study. However, it has some caveats and open issues that should be clarified before its publication.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>1. As a general comment, it is somewhat a pity that the authors did not use the endogenous FcR as a control. It would have been quite easy for the authors to place the SNAP-tag domain on the Fcg extracellular domain which would allow to do all their experiments in parallel, not only with the DNA-CAR, but also with a DNA-containing wild type receptor. Such a control would be important because, by using a CD86 transmembrane domain, the authors do not know whether the nanoscale localization of their chimeric receptors is reflecting that of the endogenous Fcg receptor.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer completely. We have repeated experiments shown in Figure 4A with a DNA-CAR containing the Fc𝛾 transmembrane domain instead of CD86 as the reviewer suggests. We also included a DNA-CAR version of the Fc𝛾R1 α chain, although this construct was not expressed as well as the others. These data are now included in Figure S5, and referenced in ​ lines 167-168.​</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. An important issue that is discussed by the authors but not addressed in this manuscript is whether the different amount and spacing of the ligand is only impacting on signaling or also on the mechanical stress of the cells. Indeed, mechanical stress on the cytoskeleton arrangement could influence the engulfment process. For this, it would be very important to test that the different bead engulfment, for example, those shown in Figure 4, is strictly dependent on signaling kinases. The authors should repeat the experiment of Figure 4 a and b in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitors such as the Syk inhibitor R406 or the Src inhibitor PP2 to show whether the different phase of engulfment is dependent on the signaling function of these kinases. This crucial experiment is clearly missing from their study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an interesting point. We find that ligand spacing affects receptor phosphorylation; however this does not preclude effects on downstream aspects of the signaling pathway. We will clarify this by adding the following comment to the manuscript (line 299-301): “While our data pinpoints a role for ligand spacing in regulating receptor phosphorylation, it is possible that later steps in the phagocytic signaling pathway are also directly affected by ligand spacing.”</p><p>The DNA-CAR-adhesion in Figure 1 strongly suggests that intracellular signaling is essential for phagocytosis. We have now included additional controls using this construct as detailed in our response to point 3 below. Unfortunately, Src and Syk inhibitors or knockout abrogate Fc𝛾R mediated phagocytosis (for example, PMIDs 11698501, 9632805, 12176909, 15136586) and thus would eliminate phagocytosis in both the 4T and 4S conditions.​ This precludes analysis of downstream steps in the phagocytic signaling pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Another problem of this study is that the authors show in Figure 1A the control DNA-CAR-adhesion but then hardly use it in their study. For example, the crucial experiments shown in Figure 4 should be conducted in parallel with DNA-CAR-adhesion expressing macrophage cells. This study could provide another indication whether or not ITAM signaling is important for the engulfment process.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this control. It is now included in Figure S5 and S7. Figure 3D also shows that the DNA-CAR-adhesion combined with the 4T origami pegboards does not activate phagocytosis and we have amended the text to make this more clear (line 152).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Another important aspect is how the concentration of the loaded origami pegboard is influencing the engulfment process. In particular, it would be interesting to show the padlocks with different spacings such as the 4T closed spacing versus 4s large spacing show a different dependency on the concentration of this padlock loading on the beads. This would be another important experiment to add to their study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an interesting question. We suspect that at a very high origami density, 4S signaling would improve, and potentially approach the 4T. However, we are currently coating the beads in saturating levels of origami pegboards. Thus we cannot increase origami pegboard density and address this directly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. The definition of the ITAM is Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motif and not &quot;Immune Tyrosine Activation Motif&quot; as stated by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors discuss that it is the segregation of the inhibitory phosphatase CD45 from the clustered Fc receptors is the major mechanism explaining their finding that 4T closed spacing is more effective than 4s large spacing. With the event of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology it is trivial to delete the CD45 gene in the genome of the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line used in this study and I am puzzled why they author are not conducting such a simple but for their study very important experiment (it takes only 1-2 month to get the results).</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment may be informative but we have two concerns about its feasibility. First, CD45 is a phosphatase with many different roles in macrophage biology, including activating Src family kinases by dephosphorylating inhibitory phosphorylation sites (PMID 8175795, 18249142, 12414720). Second, CD45 is not the only bulky phosphatase segregated from receptor nanoclusters. For example, CD148 is also excluded from the phagocytic synapse (PMID 21525931). CD45 and CD148 double knockout macrophages show hyperphosphorylation of the inhibitory tyrosine on Src family kinases, severe inhibition of phagocytosis, and an overall decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation (PMID 18249142). CD45 knockout alone showed mild phenotypes in macrophages. We anticipate that knocking out CD45 alone would have little effect, and knocking out both of these phosphatases would preclude analysis of phagocytosis. Because of our feasibility concerns and the lengthy timeline for this experiment, we believe this is outside of the scope of our study.</p><p>In our discussion, we simplistically described our possible models in terms of CD45 exclusion, as the mechanisms of CD45 exclusion have been well characterized. This was an error and we have amended our discussion to read (lines 335-343):</p><p>“As an alternative model, a denser cluster of ligated receptors may enhance the steric exclusion of the bulky transmembrane proteins like the phosphatases CD45 and CD148 (Bakalar et al., 2018; Goodridge et al., 2012; Zhu, Brdicka, Katsumoto, Lin, and Weiss, 2008).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The innovative part of this study is the combination of SNAP-tag attached, chimeric Fc-receptor with the DNA origami pegboard technology to address important open question on receptor function.</p><p>Referees cross-commenting</p><p>I find most of my three reviewing colleagues reasonable</p><p>I also agree to Reviewer #1 comments 2</p><p>Likewise, how much variation was there in the expression of the chimeric receptors? Large variation in receptor numbers per cell could significantly alter the quantitative studies. Aside from the flow sorting for cells expressing two different molecules, how were cells selected for analysis?</p><p>But I want to add it is not only the amount of receptors but ils the nanoscale location that is key to receptor function</p></disp-quote><p>We have ensured that all receptors are trafficked to the cell surface. We have also measured their intensity at the cell cortex as discussed in response to Reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>This is a very nicely done synthetic biology/biophysics study on the effect of ligands spacing on phagocytosis. They use a DNA based recognition system that the group has previously use to investigate T cell signaling, but express the SNAP tag linked transmembrane receptor in a macrophage cell line and present the ligands using DNA origami mats to control the number and spacing of complementary ligands that are designed to be in the typical range for low or high affinity FcR, a receptor that can trigger phagocytosis. The study offers some very nice quantitative data sets that will be of immediate interest to groups working in this area and, in the future, for design of synthetic receptors for immunotherapy applications. Other groups are working on similar platform for TCR. I don't feel there is any need for more experiments, but I have some questions and suggestions. Answering and considering these could clarify the new biological knowledge gained.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their support of our manuscript. Given the reviewer’s statement that no new experiments are required, we have answered their questions to the best of our ability given the current data. Should the editor decide that any of these topics require experimental data to enhance the significance of the paper, we are happy to discuss new experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>I think the significance would be increased by addressing these questions, that would help understand how the synthesis system described related to other system directed as similar questions and more natural settings.</p><p>1. The densities of the freely mobile DNA ligands required to trigger phagocytosis is quite high. Was the length of the DNA duplexes optimized? The entire complex for both the intermediate and high affinity duplexes seems quite short, perhaps &lt;10 nm. Might the stimulation be more efficient if a short stretch of DS DNA is added to increase the length to 12-13 nm?</p></disp-quote><p>The extracellular domain of the DNA-CAR (SNAP tag and ssDNA strand) are approximately 10 nm (PMID 28340336). The biotinylated ligand ssDNA is attached to the bilayer via neutravidin, resulting in a predicted 14 nm intermembrane spacing. The endogenous IgG FcR complex is 11.5 nm. Bakalar et al. (PMID 29958103) tested the effect of antigen height on phagocytosis and found that the shortest intermembrane distance tested (approximately 15 nm) was the most effective. As the reviewer notes, the optimal distance between macrophage and target may be larger than our DNA-CAR. However we think the intermembrane spacing in our system is within the biologically relevant range.</p><p>We saw robust phagocytosis at 300 molecules/micron of ssDNA, which is similar to the IgG density used on supported lipid bilayer-coated beads in other phagocytosis studies (PMID 29958103, 32768386). As the reviewer noticed, this is significantly higher than ligand density necessary to activate T cells (PMID 28340336).​ We have added a comment on ligand density to lines 96-97.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Are the origami mats generally laterally mobile on the bilayers. If so, what is the diffusion coefficient? Can one detect the mats accumulating in the initial interface between the bead and cell, particularly in cased where there is no phagocytosis? Would immobility of the mats make them more efficient at mediating phagocytosis compared to the monodispersed ligands, which I assume are highly mobile and might even be &quot;slippery&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have confirmed that our bead protocol generally produces mobile bilayers, where his-tagged proteins can freely diffuse to the cell-bead interface (see accumulation of a his-tagged FRB binding to a transmembrane FKBP receptor at the cell-bead synapse below). We can qualitatively say that the origamis appear mobile on a planar lipid bilayer (see Dong et. al 2021 and images below). Directly measuring the diffusion coefficient on the beads is extremely difficult because the beads themselves are mobile (both diffusing and rotating), and cannot be imaged via TIRF. We do not see much accumulation of the origami at cell-bead synapses. This could reflect lower mobility of the origamis, or could be because the relative enrichment of origamis is difficult to detect over the signal from unligated origamis.</p><p>Overall, we expect the origami pegboards (tethered by 12 neutravidins) are less mobile than single strand DNA (tethered by a single neutravidin, supported by qualitative images below). We are uncertain whether this promotes phagocytosis. At least one study suggests that increased IgG mobility promotes phagocytosis (PMID 25771017). However, the zipper model would suggest that tethered ligands may provide a better foothold for the macrophage as it zippers the phagosome closed (PMID 14732161). Hypothetically, ligand mobility could affect signaling in two ways – first by promoting nanocluster formation, and second by serving as a stable platform for signaling as the phagosome closes. Since our system has pre-formed nanoclusters, the effect of ligand mobility may be quite different than in the endogenous setting.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>, a 10xHis-FRB labeled with AlexaFluor647 was conjugated to Ni-chelating lipids in the bead supported lipid bilayer. The macrophages express a synthetic receptor containing an extracellular FKBP and an intracellular GFP.

Breaking down the analysis into initiation and completion is interesting. When using the non-signalling adhesion constructs, would they get to the initiation stage or would that attachment be less extensive than the initiation phase.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. While we did not include the DNA-CAR-adhesion in our kinetic experiments, we have now quantified the frequency of cups that would match our ‘initiation’ criteria in 3 representative data sets where macrophages were fixed after 45 minutes of interaction with origami pegboard-coated beads. We found that an average of 16/125 of 4T beads touching DNA-CAR-adhesion macrophages met the ‘initiation’ criteria and an average of 2/125 were eaten (14% total). In comparison, we examined 4T beads touching DNA CAR𝛾 macrophages and found that on average 23/125 met the ‘initiation’ criteria, and 45/125 were already engulfed (54%). This suggests that the DNA-CAR-adhesion alone may induce enough interaction to meet our initiation criteria, but without active signaling from the FcR this extensive interaction is rare. We have added this data in a new Figure S6 and commented on this in lines 213-215.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It would be interesting to put these results in perspective of earier work on spacing with planar nanoarrays, although these can't be applied to beads. For integrin mediated adhesion there was a very distinct threshold for RGD ligand spacing that could be related to the size of some integrin-cytoskeletal linkers (PMID: 15067875). On the other hand, T cell activation seemed more continuous with changes in spacing over a wide range with no discrete threshold (PMID: 24117051, 24125583) unless the spacing was increased to allow access to CD45, in which case a more discrete threshold was generated (PMID: 29713075). The results here for phagocytosis with the very small ligands that would likely exclude CD45 seems to be more of a continuum without a discrete threshold, although high densities of ligand are needed. This issue of continuous sensing vs sharp threshold is biologically interesting so would be good assess this by as consistent standards are possible across systems.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an interesting body of literature worth adding to our discussion. We have added a paragraph that puts our study in the context of prior work on related systems, including these nanolithography studies (Line 364-382):</p><p>“How does the spacing requirements for Fc𝛾R nanoclusters compare to other signaling systems? Engineered multivalent Fc oligomers revealed that IgE ligand geometry alters Fcε receptor signaling in mast cells (Sil, Lee, Luo, Holowka, and Baird, 2007). ​DNA origami nanoparticles and planar nanolithography arrays have previously examined optimal inter-ligand distance for the T cell receptor, B cell receptor, NK cell receptor CD16, death receptor Fas, and integrins (Arnold et al., 2004; Berger et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2018; Deeg et al., 2013; Delcassian et al., 2013; Dong et al., 2021; Veneziano et al., 2020). ​Some systems, like integrin-mediated cell adhesion, appear to have very discrete threshold requirements for ligand spacing while others, like T cell activation, appear to continuously improve with reduced intermolecular spacing (Arnold et al., 2004; Cai et al., 2018). Our system may be more similar to the continuous improvement observed in T cell activation, as our most spaced ligands (36.5 nm) are capable of activating some phagocytosis, albeit not as potently as the 4T. Interestingly, as the intermembrane distance between T cell and target increases, the requirement for tight ligand spacing becomes more stringent (Cai et al., 2018). This suggests that IgG bound to tall antigens may be more dependent on tight nanocluster spacing than short antigens. Planar arrays have also been used to vary inter-cluster spacing, in addition to inter-ligand spacing (Cai et al., 2018; Freeman et al., 2016). Examining the optimal inter-cluster spacing during phagosome closure may be an interesting direction for future studies.”</p><p>Additional experiments performed in revision</p><p>In addition to these reviewer comments, we have added additional controls validating the DNA-CAR-4x𝛾 used in Figure 6c,d. We compared the DNA-CAR-4x𝛾 to versions of the DNA-CAR-1x𝛾 -3x𝛥 ITAM construct with the functional ITAM in the second and fourth positions (see the schematics now included Figure S7). We found that four individual receptors with a single ITAM each were able to induce phagocytosis regardless of which position the ITAM was in. However the DNA-CAR-4x𝛾 construct, which also contains 4 ITAMs, was not. This further validates the experiment presented in 6c,d. We also fixed minor errors we discovered in the presentation of data for Figures 1C and S1A.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The original reviewers concur that you have addressed their concerns. There is one issue to clarify.</p><p>1. One of the reviewers had asked for experiments with a &quot;receptor fusion construct&quot; (see 10.1038/s41467-019-10097-0) where you retain the alpha1-gamma2 architecture of the native FcR, but add the SNAP-DNA complex to the FcgR1 to determine if this changes the potency or spacing threshold. We understand that this might pose a number of challenges and its OK that you didn't do this. However, the new experiments using the FcgRI α TM and the FcR γ TM without the disulfides may need just a bit more explanation to not confuse readers. The reviewer noted that the FcR γ TM based constructs were more potent at phagocytosis, although, as you point out, they retained the trend of the spacing dependence. Even though the disulfides were not included, its expected that the FcR γ construct will have a tendency to dimerise and that this may make it more potent. If this is the case, it still doesn't quite address the original question as you now have a synthetic receptor with two ligand binding and two signal transduction modules, whereas the &quot;receptor fusion&quot; would have just one ligand binding unit with two signal transduction modules. The nuances of this need to be discussed better and in relation to the configuration of most natural activating immunoreceptors. I hope this is clear and that you can easily address this.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for misunderstanding this concern in the original comment. We did unsuccessfully try to generate an Fc ⍺ chain DNA CAR. We thought this CAR may be able to recruit the endogenous Fc γ chains and signal with the 1 ligand:2 signaling domain architecture present in most, but not all, activating FcγRs. However, this construct failed to induce engulfment of beads coated in ssDNA. Upon further examination we found that the majority of the protein was not trafficked to the cell surface. The TRuC strategy may be a better approach for generating a receptor with the correct architecture, although the position of the SNAP tag, the expression levels of the modified ⍺ chain, and the assembly into a multimeric receptor would all need to be controlled or optimized to ensure each ligand binding event correlates with a fully assembled complex and the overall architecture of the phagocytic synapse is maintained (ie, intermembrane spacing). Thus, we believe this is outside the scope of our study.</p><p>Instead, we have taken the suggestion to clarify the nuances of our study. We have amended the Results section to better describe the CARs with the Fc γ or ⍺ chain transmembrane domains (lines 163-169). We have also added the following paragraph to the discussion clarifying how our DNA CAR compares to the native FcγR complex:</p><p>“How does our synthetic DNA-CAR𝛾 receptor compare to endogenous FcγRs? Our DNA CARs are single chain receptors that recruit one intracellular signaling domain per ligand, similar to the single chain human FcγRIIA receptor (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2006). FcγRIIA is ubiquitously expressed on human myeloid cells, and high affinity FcRIIA alleles correlate with an increase in effectiveness of the ADCP-inducing drug Rituximab and lupus susceptibility (Bruhns and Jönsson, 2015; Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2006). The majority of FcγR family members, including all activating mouse FcγRs and the human FcγRI and FcγRIIIA are multimeric complexes composed of a ligand binding ⍺ chain and a dimerized signaling 𝛾 chain. This results in two signaling 𝛾 chains recruited to each IgG ligand. The different stoichiometry between ligand binding and intracellular signaling domains may affect some parameters like optimal cluster size. A second difference between the DNA-CAR𝛾 and the endogenous system is the presence of the CD86 transmembrane domain. We found that ligand spacing had a similar effect on phagocytosis when we replaced the CD86 transmembrane domain with the Fc ⍺ or Fc γ transmembrane domain. However, the Fc γ transmembrane domain construct triggered more bead internalization across all conditions. We hypothesize this could be because the transmembrane domain retains some ability to dimerize, recruiting more signaling domains to each ligand, or because it is better able to associate with lipid-ordered domains. Future studies that pattern either endogenous Fc Receptor complex or IgG ligand could clarify these questions.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
