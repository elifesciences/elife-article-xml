understood. Here, we investigate the functions of Oct4 by depleting and subsequently recovering it in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and conducting a time-resolved multiomics analysis. Oct4 depletion leads to an immediate loss of its binding to enhancers, accompanied by a decrease in mRNA synthesis from its target genes that are part of the transcriptional network that maintains pluripotency. Gradual decrease of Oct4 binding to enhancers does not immediately change the chromatin accessibility but reduces transcription of enhancers. Conversely, partial recovery of Oct4 expression results in a rapid increase in chromatin accessibility, whereas enhancer transcription does not fully recover. These results indicate different concentration-dependent activities of Oct4. Whereas normal ESC levels of Oct4 are required for transcription of pluripotency enhancers, low levels of Oct4 are sufficient to retain chromatin accessibility, likely together with other factors such as Sox2.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pluripotency</kwd><kwd>Oct4</kwd><kwd>enhancer</kwd><kwd>eRNA</kwd><kwd>chromatin accessibility</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB860</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cramer</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP1935</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cramer</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 2067/1-390729940</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cramer</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>882357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cramer</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>open access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cramer</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>669168</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schöler</surname><given-names>Hans R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>White Paper-project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schöler</surname><given-names>Hans R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schöler</surname><given-names>Hans R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Time-resolved multiomics analysis during Oct4 depletion and recovery reveals concentration-dependent activities of Oct4 in controlling enhancer transcription and chromatin accessibility in mouse embryonic stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The transcription factor (TF) Oct4 is essential for maintaining pluripotency in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Niwa et al., 2000</xref>) as well as in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nichols et al., 1998</xref>). Oct4 lies at the core of an intricate transcriptional regulatory network that maintains the pluripotent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>) and Oct4-driven protein–protein interactions are crucial for maintaining and inducing pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Esch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van den Berg et al., 2010</xref>). Oct4 knockout in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) leads to a quick disruption of the pluripotency state and differentiation of the ESCs into trophectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Niwa et al., 2000</xref>). Oct4 binds to enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schöler et al., 1989</xref>), which are cis-regulatory genomic elements that orchestrate gene expression in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerji et al., 1981</xref>). Oct4 function in maintaining pluripotency of ESCs has been attributed to the establishment of superenhancers (SEs), that have high occupancy of TFs and coactivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>). Degradation of Oct4 leads to preferential decrease of Oct4 and Mediator occupancy at SEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boija et al., 2018</xref>) and consequent downregulation of pluripotency genes that are located near SEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Oct4 cooperates with the TF Sox2 at thousands of genomic sites in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambrosetti et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Loh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yuan et al., 1995</xref>). Oct4 and Sox2 cooperatively bind the SoxOct composite motif present in their target enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lam et al., 2012</xref>). A previous study showed that prolonged depletion of Oct4 for 24 hr in ESCs resulted in a loss of chromatin accessibility at the majority of its occupied sites, accompanied by a loss of Sox2 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">King and Klose, 2017</xref>). Using an Oct4 protein depletion system in ESCs, another study suggested that chromatin accessibility is regulated in a highly dynamic manner with Oct4 being constantly required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friman et al., 2019</xref>). However, enhancer-driven gene expression regulation involves both the control of enhancer activity and chromatin accessibility, and it remains unclear how the two processes are regulated by Oct4 and how this amounts to the control of gene transcription.</p><p>Enhancers are often transcribed resulting in the production of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Santa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tuan et al., 1992</xref>). The functions of enhancer transcription and eRNA remain poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lewis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sartorelli and Lauberth, 2020</xref>). Transcribing Pol II at enhancers contributes to chromatin alterations by recruiting histone modifying and remodeling factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaikkonen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ling et al., 2004</xref>), and eRNA may be involved in gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bose et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gorbovytska et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaikkonen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mousavi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schaukowitch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sigova et al., 2015</xref>). The synthesis of eRNA correlates with the transactivation activity of enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Santa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Djebali et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Henriques et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Melgar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Michel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). The synthesis of eRNA can be used to identify putative enhancers by transient transcriptome sequencing (TT-seq), a method that captures newly synthesized RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schwalb et al., 2016</xref>). TT-seq combines a short pulse of 4-thiouridine (4sU) labeling with RNA fragmentation and monitors transcription changes at both enhancers and their target genes genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schwalb et al., 2016</xref>). TT-seq can quantify changes in enhancer transcription and is ideal to monitor immediate transcriptome changes after perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gressel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Michel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the functional roles of Oct4 in the control of pluripotency, we used depletion and subsequent recovery of Oct4 in mouse ESCs. We then conducted a high-resolution time course study to monitor changes in the transcriptome by TT-seq, changes in chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>), and changes in Oct4 and Sox2 occupancy by ChIP-seq. During Oct4 depletion, we found that loss of Oct4 from enhancers goes along with a decrease in mRNA synthesis from Oct4 target genes crucial for maintaining pluripotency. Moreover, eRNA synthesis decreased rapidly at Oct4-bound enhancers, whereas chromatin accessibility was generally decreased only later, after Oct4 levels had considerably dropped. In contrast, during partial recovery of Oct4 after full depletion, chromatin accessibility restored rapidly, whereas eRNA synthesis could not be fully recovered. These results suggest that low levels of Oct4 are sufficient to regulate chromatin accessibility, whereas normal ESC levels of Oct4 are required to maintain the transcription of pluripotency enhancers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Oct4 depletion and transcription unit annotation</title><p>To investigate the role of Oct4 in maintaining pluripotency, we used a doxycycline (DOX) inducible Oct4 knockout mouse embryonic stem cell line (mESC) ZHBTc4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Niwa et al., 2000</xref>).

In agreement with chromatin fractionation results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <bold>chromatin</bold>), Oct4 occupancy decreased after 3 hr and strongly dropped after 9 hr of DOX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This is consistent with the observed decrease in eRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In accordance with our previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), occupancy of Oct4 decreased more strongly at SEs compared to TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These results show that Oct4 binding is required for eRNA synthesis at a subset of Oct4-bound transcribed enhancers and particularly at SEs.</p><p>To investigate whether the observed decrease in Oct4 occupancy and eRNA synthesis at Oct4-bound transcribed enhancers coincided with a decrease of target mRNA synthesis, we paired transcriptionally downregulated SEs with their nearest transcribed genes. About half of these genes were downregulated (62 enhancer–gene pairs), and we found that mRNA synthesis decreased already after 3 hr of DOX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This is illustrated for the <italic>Klf4</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H, I</xref>). For the remaining half of SE-nearest genes mRNA synthesis was unaffected. In addition to the possibility that the target gene may not always be the nearest gene, we found significantly lower occupancy of Oct4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>, left) as well as significantly lower decrease of eRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>, right) in comparison to the affected SEs. This suggests that Oct4 occupancy and the degree of eRNA synthesis changes at transcriptionally downregulated SEs may play a role in transcription. Overall, these results are consistent with a function of Oct4 in activating both enhancer transcription and mRNA synthesis from its target genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Reduced Oct4 binding does not immediately influence chromatin accessibility</title><p>We next investigated changes in chromatin accessibility at Oct4-bound transcribed enhancers.

To further investigate the role of Oct4 in altering chromatin, we classified the downregulated Oct4-bound transcribed enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) based on their respective changes in chromatin accessibility. We defined two groups of downregulated transcribed enhancers, showing either decreased or unchanged chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In both groups, Oct4 binding to chromatin decreased over the time course and was associated with a decrease in eRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E</xref>). For the first group, depletion of Oct4 led to a decrease in eRNA synthesis and a reduction of chromatin accessibility, with downregulation of eRNA synthesis preceding the decrease in accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This is illustrated for the SE near the <italic>Klf4</italic> gene, which contains three enhancers of this group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). For the second group, depletion of Oct4 led to a decrease in eRNA synthesis without changes in chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

We hereafter refer to the three groups of Oct4-bound transcribed enhancers as Oct4-sensitive, -insensitive, and -independent enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Oct4-insensitive enhancers showed only a slight decrease of Sox2 binding at 15 hr.

This is consistent with our earlier observations at Oct4-bound transcribed enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>).

Using the original DOX concentration, Oct4 did not recover even after 24 hr of DOX washout, likely because of excessive DOX trapped in the cell membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). After optimization, we found that 1:600 dilution of conventional DOX concentration (1.67 ng/ml versus 1 μg/ml) delivers indistinguishable Oct4 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>) but allows a quick restoration after the washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We, therefore, chose 1:600 of DOX for the following recovery experiments. First, we tested if the pluripotent state can at all be restored after the absence of Oct4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The vast majority of ESCs could regain pluripotency after 15 hr of DOX treatment, fewer cells could recover after longer depletion of up to 48 hr, and none could recover after 72 hr.

A weak but significant upregulation of eRNA synthesis occured at Oct4-sensitive enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

In line with our previous motif analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), at 15 hr of DOX treatment, SoxOct footprints were the most significantly depleted in ATAC-seq signal, followed by Oct alone footprints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1G</xref>). This confirms that the changes in chromatin accessibility are driven by the loss of Oct4 and Sox2 binding. Consistently, SoxOct and Oct footprints were the most significantly enriched after 4.5 hr of recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Interestingly, later into the recovery process – after 9 hr of washout, open chromatin was enriched with not just SoxOct and Oct footprints, but also Klf footprints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1I</xref>), inferring the role of Klf TFs in re-establishing of pluripotency after Oct4 depletion.</p><p>Finally, we investigated the effects of partial Oct4 recovery on mRNA synthesis for genes that were differentially expressed upon Oct4 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>).

Taken together, these results indicate that partial recovery of Oct4 rapidly increases chromatin accessibility, followed by rebound of gene transcription activity, with the recovery of associated enhancer transcription being weaker.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we used Oct4 depletion from mouse ESCs and several genomic approaches to analyze the role of Oct4 in the maintenance of pluripotency over a high-resolution time course. We used a Tet-off system that allows gradual Oct4 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Niwa et al., 2000</xref>), within 15 hr. The gradual depletion provided insights into Oct4’s concentration-dependent role in gene expression regulation. Our data showed that loss of Oct4 from enhancers goes along with a decrease in mRNA synthesis from Oct4 target genes crucial for maintaining pluripotency.</p><p>During Oct4 depletion, enhancer and target gene transcription were very sensitive to even small reductions of Oct4 binding, whereas chromatin accessibility was either unaffected (Oct4-insensitive enhancers) or affected later when Oct4 levels decreased considerably (Oct4-sensitive enhancers). During partial recovery of Oct4, chromatin accessibility and enhancer transcription increased at Oct4-sensitive enhancers, but eRNA synthesis could not be fully reactivated, although chromatin accessibility was largely restored. Together, this indicates that normal ESC levels of Oct4 are required for enhancer transcription whereas low levels of Oct4 are sufficient to retain chromatin accessibility. This is also consistent with a recent study, in which the authors used an Oct4-low expressed protein depletion system in ESCs and observed that loss of chromatin accessibility was quasi-synchronized with Oct4 loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friman et al., 2019</xref>). As shown previously, ESCs with reduced Oct4 expression maintained a robust naive pluripotent state, but only wild-type Oct4 levels could enable effective differentiation to all embryonic lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Karwacki-Neisius et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Radzisheuskaya et al., 2013</xref>). It would be interesting to investigate if Oct4-induced eRNAs play a role in the stabilization of the pluripotency network, or in the capacity of the Oct4-high, but not Oct4-low, ESCs to differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fallatah et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Oct4 is thought to activate pluripotency genes by forming phase-separated condensates at SEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boija et al., 2018</xref>). This model is consistent with our observation that high levels of Oct4 are required to maintain and reactivate transcription in recovery experiments. A recent study suggests that TFs may bind DNA to form condensates and once the binding is saturated at high concentrations, the extra molecules can be absorbed into the condensates directly or via one-dimensional diffusion and therefore direct DNA binding is not required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morin et al., 2022</xref>). Based on such a model, it could be possible that low levels of Oct4 are sufficient to maintain its interaction pattern with DNA, whereas at high levels the saturated Oct4 molecules can be incorporated into the condensates directly and contribute to transcription activation.</p><p>Oct4 cooperates with Sox2 to regulate the vast majority of its targets in pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chronis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Malik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reményi et al., 2003</xref>). While Sox2 protein level remained unchanged throughout the 15 hr of DOX treatment, Sox2 was depleted from chromatin starting from 9-hr DOX treatment. Accordingly, at enhancers dependent on Oct4 for their accessibility (Oct4-sensitive enhancers) Sox2 remained transiently bound during the first 6 hr of DOX treatment and only decreased when chromatin accessibility also decreased. This can be explained by the proposed model that low levels of Oct4 are sufficient to retain chromatin accessible, thus leading to a loss of Sox2 binding only when Oct4 levels decreased to the point where chromatin accessibility can no longer be maintained. This befits the pioneer role of Oct4 in creating an open chromatin environment to support binding of other pluripotency factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">King and Klose, 2017</xref>). In addition, reduced levels of Oct4 may cooperate with Sox2 to temporarily retain enhancers accessible. Furthermore, we found enhanced binding of Sox2 at Oct4-bound enhancers after 3 hr of DOX treatment. This suggests that Oct4 may inhibit Sox2 binding at normal levels in ESCs, and agrees with a study that has shown that overexpression of Oct4 decreases Sox2 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biddle et al., 2019</xref>). This is similar to a recent study in which enhanced binding of Nanog was observed after complete degradation of Oct4 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our TF footprinting analysis detected a significant enrichment for Klf footprints at the later stages of Oct4 recovery. Klf TFs are at the core of pluripotency network and are crucial for induction of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nakagawa et al., 2008</xref>). Klf4 and Klf5 directly interact with Oct4 and Sox2 to promote reprogramming to iPSCs and maintenance of pluripotency in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wei et al., 2009</xref>). Oct4 cooperates with chromatin remodeler Brg1 to loosen the chromatin allowing Klf4 binding that facilitates reprogramming to pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, this implies that Oct4 creates an open chromatin environment to prepare for binding of Klf TFs to support further maturation of the pluripotency network during Oct4 recovery.</p><p>In a recent study, Oct4 protein was fully depleted within 2 hr using an auxin-inducible degron system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates et al., 2021</xref>). Using RNA-seq, the authors showed that full depletion of Oct4 leads to rapid downregulation of key pluripotency factors, consistent with our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). We used TT-seq, which is more sensitive than RNA-seq and directly detects changes in gene transcription upon perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Michel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schwalb et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, although Oct4 was depleted in different ways, both studies support the same conclusion that loss of Oct4 results in rapid downregulation of pluripotency-associated genes.</p><p>Analysis of the TT-seq data revealed that the used ZHBTc4 cells were contaminated with mycoplasma (Materials and methods). However, this does not alter the conclusions described in this manuscript. First, the ZHBTc4 cells exhibit normal growth patterns and morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Second, our experiments and analyses were all done in relation to the untreated ZHBTc4 cells. Third, as discussed, our results confirm previously published observations with mycoplasma-negative mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">King and Klose, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we investigated the role of Oct4 in regulating chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activity in pluripotent cells using high-resolution time course data for Oct4 depletion and subsequent recovery. We discovered that Oct4 has differential concentration-dependent activities in regulating enhancer transcription and chromatin accessibility in pluripotent stem cells. Normal ESC concentrations of Oct4 are required to maintain the transcription of pluripotency enhancers. In contrast, Oct4 regulates chromatin accessibility very rapidly even at low concentrations, capable of increasing chromatin accessibility within hours of induction.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Briefly, the whole genome was segmented into 200 bp consecutive bins and the midpoint of TT-seq fragments was then used to calculate the coverage for each bin for each sample. A pseudo-count was added to each bin to avoid noisy signals. In order to create a unified annotation independent of a specific time point, all TT-seq samples were combined. The R/Bioconductor package GenoSTAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zacher et al., 2017</xref>) was then used to learn a two-state hidden Markov model with a PoissonLog-Normal emission distribution in order to segment the genome into ‘transcribed’ and ‘untranscribed’ states. Transcribed regions overlapping at least 20% of their length with GENCODE annotated protein-coding gene or lincRNA and overlapping with an annotated exon were classified as mRNA/lincRNA and the rest was defined as ncRNA. Transcribed regions mapping to exons of the same protein-coding gene or lincRNA were combined to create a consecutive TU. In order to avoid spurious predictions, ATAC-seq data were used to call open chromatin regions (see below) and TUs without their promoter (±1 kb of transcription start site, TSS) overlapping with an opening chromatin region were removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). A minimal expression threshold was optimized based on expression difference between TUs with or without their promoter overlapping an opening chromatin region. This resulted in 26822 TUs originating from an open chromatin region with a minimal RPK of 26.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In order to overcome low expression or mappability issues, ncRNAs that are only 200 bp (1bin) apart were merged. Subsequently, TU start and end sites were refined to single nucleotide precision by finding borders of abrupt coverage increase or decrease between two consecutive segments in the four 200 bp bins located around the initially assigned start and stop sites via fitting a piecewise constant curve to the TT-seq coverage profiles for both replicates using the segmentation method from the R/Bioconductor package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huber et al., 2006</xref>) ncRNAs were then classified into the following four categories according to their respective location relative to protein-coding genes: upstream antisense RNA (uaRNA), convergent RNA (conRNA), antisense RNA (asRNA), and intergenic RNA (incRNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). ncRNAs located on the opposite strand of an mRNA were classified as asRNA if the TSS was located &gt;1 kbp downstream of the sense TSS, as uaRNA if the TSS was located &lt;1 kbp upstream of the sense TSS, and as conRNA if the TSS was located &lt;1 kbp downstream of the sense TSS. The remaining ncRNAs were classified as incRNA.</p><p>To annotate putative eRNAs we selected asRNAs and incRNAs. Since highly synthesized mRNAs can give rise to spurious and uncontinuous downstream transcription signal, we restricted the analysis to a subset of asRNA and incRNA that are located 1 kb far away from promoter related RNAs including mRNA, uaRNA, conRNA, and defined them as putative eRNA. We then merged them if the putative eRNAs fell within 1 kb of each other. eRNAs within 1 kb of Oct4-occupied opening regions were defined as Oct4-regulated eRNAs and the corresponding Oct4 peaks were classified as Oct4-bound transcribed enhancers.

For single-end ChIP-seq data, Bowtie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) was used for mapping with ‘<monospace>--local</monospace>’ option. SAMtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2009</xref>) was then used to remove alignments with MAPQ smaller than 7 (-q 7). All published ChIP-seq data were fully processed by ourselves. Detailed information for all ChIP-seq samples can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4 supp5 supp6">Supplementary files 4–6</xref>. For peak calling of published paired-end Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog ChIP-seq data, three replicates were pooled and MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) was used to call peaks with options: -f BAMPE -g mm. For our paired-end Oct4, Sox2 ChIP-seq data, peaks were called by MACS2 with the same options for each replicate.

Normalization factors were obtained by dividing the total <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> spike-ins read counts for each sample by the total spike-ins read counts of the sample with the lowest spike-ins read counts. For our Sox2 ChIP-seq data, data were normalized using a total number of uniquely mapped reads. ChIP-seq coverages were divided by the respective normalization factors. HTSeq-count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2015</xref>) was used to calculate fragment counts for peak features. Reads counts were divided by the respective normalization factors.</p><p>To avoid noisy signals, we only used Sox2 peaks that were detected by both replicates (consensus peaks) at 0-hr samples for Sox2 occupancy analysis. We overlapped Sox2 consensus peaks with Oct4-sensitive, -insensitive, and -independent enhancers and kept the overlapped peaks for the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C, D</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: David M Suter (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The implications of reduced (rather than absent) Oct4 protein during most of the timecourse of the experiments should be discussed.</p><p>2) Control datasets with analysis of enhancers not bound by Oct4, their chromatin accessibility and <italic>Sox2</italic> binding, need to be provided.</p><p>3) Report wider expression of pluripotency factors and possible trophectoderm differentiation during Oct4 depletion.</p><p>4) Explain limited impact of Oct4 depletion decommissioning super enhancers.</p><p>5) The claim that <italic>Sox2</italic> maintains chromatin accessibility requires further experimental support with <italic>Sox2</italic> loss of function.</p><p>6) Oct4 recovery experiments followed by nascent transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis should be provided to substantiate the claims.</p><p>7) Alternative interpretations suggested by the reviewers should be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To complete experiments (particularly analysis of regions not bound by Oct4, Oct4 recovery experiments and clarification of the role of <italic>Sox2</italic>), consider alternative explanations and provide a more balanced discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study utilizes transcription regulation to achieve depletion of Oct4; this results in a gradual reduction in Oct4 levels, meaning that Oct4 is still present throughout much of the timecourse. On the other hand, Oct4 is only fully removed and absent from chromatin after 12-15 hours, by which time 1000-1500 genes are shown to be differentially regulated. It has previously been described that ESCs can be maintained with low levels of Oct4, resulting in altered signalling requirements and gene expression (Karwacki-Neisius et al. 2013; Radzisheuskaya et al. 2013). Given that Oct4 protein is present at a reduced level for most of the timecourse, the implications of this altered cell state should be discussed.</p><p>There are several control datasets that should be described in order to determine how directly loss of Oct4 from enhancers affects their activity. For example, in figure 4, changes in eRNA synthesis at Oct4-bound enhancers are analysed, but there is no corresponding analysis of enhancers not bound by Oct4. Do these remain unchanged as would be expected if the removal of Oct4 from enhancer elements is directly responsible for the reduction in eRNA observed? Similarly, changes in chromatin accessibility are analysed at enhancers bound by Oct4, but it is possible that the changes observed in roughly half of these loci is driven by the change in cellular identity rather than by the loss of Oct4; how does the chromatin accessibility of enhancers not bound by Oct4 change, especially those associated with genes that are downregulated during exit from pluripotency?</p><p>It is widely described that loss of Oct4 results in trophectoderm-like differentiation. Was this also seen here?</p><p>In Figure 1A, the depletion of Oct4 protein would benefit from quantification.</p><p>Figure 1 shows that <italic>Sox2</italic> and Nanog protein levels are stable for some time during Oct4 depletion. It would be useful to see how stable the expression of a wider array of pluripotency-associated factors, for example from the TT-seq data.</p><p>In Figure 4G, super enhancers which are bound by Oct4 and show a decrease in enhancer RNA, and whose nearest gene shows a decrease in expression, are analysed and this indicates that mRNA expression decrease is a subsequent event to eRNA downregulation. However, around half of the super enhancer elements bound by Oct4 with a decrease in enhancer RNA do not show a decrease in neighbouring gene expression. Is this simply the result of these enhancers regulating more distant targets? If not, how do the authors explain the limited impact of decommissioning these super enhancers?</p><p>Regarding the transient maintenance of <italic>Sox2</italic> following removal of Oct4, this is reminiscent of similar findings relating to the continued binding of Nanog in the absence of Oct4 recently reported (Bates et al. 2021). This paper also described enhancer decommissioning and retained transcription factor binding, as well as very limited analysis of loss of enhancer RNA expression, and should be referenced.</p><p>In figures 4, 5, and 6 a similar analysis of enhancer RNA expression, chromatin accessibility, and <italic>Sox2</italic> binding at enhancers not bound by Oct4 should be performed in order to support that loss of Oct4 is directly responsible for their downregulation, or to indicate that it may be the result of indirect effects.</p><p>Throughout the paper, the number of replicates should be added to figure legends.</p><p>In the discussion, it is stated that Oct4 mainly acts as an activator whereas <italic>Sox2</italic> maintains chromatin accessibility. Regarding Oct4 acting as an activator, this appears to be contradicted by the finding that even within 6 hours of adding doxycycline, equal numbers of genes are up and downregulated (figure 2a); while it appears that Oct4 acts as an activator of eRNAs (figure 4a), it is not clear that it specifically acts as an activator of gene expression more broadly. The implication that <italic>Sox2</italic> maintains chromatin accessibility seems highly speculative. It is possible that many other factors remain bound for some time following loss of Oct4, and any or a cumulative effect of these may result in the maintenance of chromatin accessibility.</p><p>In support of the role for <italic>Sox2</italic> in maintaining open chromatin and allowing Oct4 to bind, Chen et al. 2014 is cited (note, this reference is not found in the reference list at the end of the manuscript). However, reanalysis of these data by Biddle et al. (2019) indicates that the analysis performed by Chen et al. is overly simplified, and in truth the effect of Oct4 and <italic>Sox2</italic> on one-another's binding is likely to vary across different binding sites. As such, the reanalysis does not support the sequential binding put forth by Chen et al.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My suggestion to the authors is to re-interpret their datasets, and also to complete their datasets with Oct4 recovery experiments followed by nascent transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Oct4 differentially regulates chromatin opening and enhancer transcription in pluripotent stem cells&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Mone Zaidi (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor in consultation with the previous reviewers.</p><p>We all agree that the manuscript has been largely improved and is potentially acceptable for publication. However, following your e-mail explaining that some cells tested positive for mycoplasma and that this should not affect the conclusions of your study, we believe that these explanations should be discussed in the main manuscript as well, for clarity and transparency.</p><p>Please add the arguments below, suggested in your correspondence, to the main text:</p><p>1) The ZHBTc4 mESC cells exhibit normal growth patterns and morphology. Figure 1 supplement figure 1a confirms that cell morphology was normal.</p><p>2) Our experiments were all done in relation to the untreated ZHBTc4 cells. Therefore, we do not make skewed comparisons but evaluate the collected results and the resulting conclusions in a consistent manner.</p><p>3) Our results confirm previously published observations with ZHBTc4 mESCs that were mycoplasma negative. For example, the observation that loss of chromatin accessibility is linked to the loss of Oct4 was also observed in two other publications. Namely, Friman et al. 2019 <italic>eLife</italic> and King and Klose 2017 <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>4) Finally, we found that depletion of Oct4 leads to rapid down-regulation of key pluripotency factors. These findings are in line with experiments from Bates et al. 2021 Stem Cell Reports, in which a degron system was utilized to deplete Oct4 protein. We thoroughly compared immediate gene expression changes upon Oct4 depletion observed in our study and in Bates et al. and found similar changes (see response letter, author response figures 1 and 6).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71533.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The implications of reduced (rather than absent) Oct4 protein during most of the timecourse of the experiments should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this needs to be discussed. As mentioned by reviewer 2 it is correct that in our Tet-off system (Niwa et al., 2000) Oct4 is gradually depleted and only fully removed and absent from chromatin after 12-15 hours (h) of DOX treatment. In the entire manuscript we replaced &quot;rapid depletion&quot; by either &quot;gradual depletion&quot; or just &quot;depletion&quot;.</p><p>The gradual depletion provided insights into Oct4’s concentration-dependent role in gene expression regulation. Enhancer and target gene transcription were very sensitive to even small reductions of Oct4 binding, whereas chromatin accessibility was either unaffected (Oct4-insensitive enhancers) or affected later when Oct4 levels decreased considerably (Oct4-sensitive enhancers). During revision we conducted the proposed Oct4 recovery experiments (see Essential revisions point 6) and the results provide strong evidence to support that low Oct4 levels are sufficient to maintain chromatin accessibility at Oct4-sensitive enhancers, in agreement with the alternative model proposed by reviewer 3. Thus, in light of the added recovery experiments and reviewer comments, we reinterpreted some of our results and edited the Discussion section of the manuscript accordingly (see Essential revisions points 6 and 7 for more details). We acknowledge also that it has previously been described that ESCs can be maintained with low levels of Oct4, resulting in altered signalling requirements and gene expression (Karwacki-Neisius et al. 2013; Radzisheuskaya et al. 2013). We cite the literatures mentioned by the reviewer, including also Bates et al. 2021.</p><p>Briefly, in Bates et al. 2021, Oct4 protein was fully depleted within 2 h of IAA addition. Using RNA-seq, the authors showed that full depletion of Oct4 leads to rapid down-regulation of key pluripotency factors, followed by up-regulation of several trophoblast- associated genes (Figure 2B, Bates et al. 2021). Moreover, the authors also showed by RNA-seq that when using conventional tamoxifen-induced CreER-driven genetic ablation of the Oct4 system, there is no influence on gene expression of key pluripotency factors after 24 and 36 h depletion of Oct4 (Figure 2A, Bates et al. 2021), by which time Oct4 expression was nearly completely abolished. In contrast, in our study, we used a Tet-off Oct4 depletion system that leads to an exit of pluripotency when the Oct4 level is reduced by over 50% (Niwa et al. 2000). Importantly, using TT-seq, we found rapid down-regulation of well-known key pluripotency factors (Figure 2H, see also Essential Revisions point 3 for selected pluripotency factors), which is consistent with Bates et al. 2021 (Figure 2B). Thus, although Oct4 was depleted in different ways, both studies support the same conclusion that loss of Oct4 results in rapid down-regulation of pluripotency factors. In our study, we used TT-seq, which is more sensitive than RNA-seq for detection of changes in gene transcription upon perturbation (Schwalb et al. 2016, Michel et al. 2017).</p><p>We went on to further compare gene expression changes observed in Bates et al., 2021 with mRNA synthesis changes observed in our system. In our study, Oct4 was gradually depleted and we identified ~1500 differentially regulated genes and classified them into early and late down- and up-regulated genes based on their kinetics (Figure 2A-D). In addition, we found that super enhancer (SE)-controlled genes were particularly sensitive to Oct4 depletion (Figure 2F-H). To investigate whether similar effects can be observed in the Oct4 protein depletion system from Bates et al., we analyzed the published RNA-seq data. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, similar effects can also be seen in the RNA-seq data taken from Bates et al. 2021: (1) early down-regulated genes showed a stronger (earlier) decrease of mRNA synthesis/gene expression compared to late down-regulated genes in both data sets (A: left, TT-seq data, this study; right, RNA-seq data, Bates et al.), although the differences are diminished after prolonged (24 h) Oct4 protein depletion in Bates et al. data; (2) early and late up-regulated genes also behaved similarly in both data sets (B: left, TT-seq data, this study; right, RNA-seq data, Bates et al.); (3) we also found SE-controlled genes were more sensitive to Oct4 protein depletion in the data taken from Bates et al. (C), consistent with our TT-seq data shown in Figure 2G. Taken together, the overall changes in mRNA synthesis/gene expression and their kinetics are comparable between our gradual Oct4 depletion system and the full Oct4 protein depletion after 2 h published in Bates et al., 2021.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Response kinetics of different types of differentially regulated gene groups in our TT-seq data and RNA-seq data from Bates et al.</title><p>, 2021.

We now provide the proposed control data sets and the corresponding analysis of enhancers not bound by Oct4 (Oct4-unbound transcribed enhancers; see Figure 3A), their eRNA synthesis, accessibility and <italic>Sox2</italic> binding changes. Briefly, we performed differential expression analysis of eRNAs for Oct4-unbound transcribed enhancers (Figure 4—figure supplement2A-E). Based on these results, we also generated a barplot to compare the percentage of differentially regulated eRNAs at each time point for Oct4-bound and -unbound transcribed enhancers, respectively (Figure 4—figure supplement 2F). We found that down-regulation of eRNA synthesis occurred predominately at Oct4-bound transcribed enhancers in comparison to Oct4-unbound transcribed enhancers (Figure 4—figure supplement 2F, left). Although a total of ~400 eRNAs (7.4%) were down-regulated at Oct4-unbound transcribed enhancers, most of the downregulation occurred late, between 12-15 h of Oct4 depletion. A tiny amount of up-regulated eRNAs (&lt;2%) was detected at both Oct4-bound and -unbound transcribed enhancers (Figure 4—figure supplement 2F, right). These data suggest that upon Oct4 depletion, inactivation of enhancers occurred rapidly and predominately at Oct4-bound transcribed sites, although a small fraction of Oct4-unbound transcribed sites was also influenced later, most likely representing secondary effects. This figure is now described in the subsection “Oct4 is often required for enhancer transcription”.</p><p>We also called significantly changed accessible chromatin regions for Oct4-unbound transcribed enhancers (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). After 15 h of DOX treatment only 48 enhancers (0.6%) showed a significant change in chromatin accessibility, indicating that chromatin accessibility remained largely unaltered across the full time course at Oct4-unbound transcribed enhancers. Figure 5—figure supplement 2 is now described in the subsection “Reduced Oct4 binding does not immediately influence chromatin accessibility”.</p><p>Finally, we also investigated <italic>Sox2</italic> occupancy at Oct4-unbound transcribed enhancers. Only 307 (4.3%) of Oct4-unbound transcribed enhancers overlapped with our <italic>Sox2</italic> ChIP-seq peaks (within a 1kb window). For this subgroup, we also found no appreciable change in <italic>Sox2</italic> occupancy across the full time course (Figure 6—figure supplement 3).

Moreover, we have provided early and late down- and up-regulated gene lists as supplementary table (Table S3). In addition, we now also provide the corresponding normalized TT-seq count RPK tables as resource table (Figure 2-source data 1). To further illustrate the down-regulation of pluripotency factors and up-regulation of genes associated with trophectoderm differentiation, we plotted mRNA synthesis changes over time as line plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A–B</xref>):</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>mRNA synthesis changes for pluripotency factors and genes associated with trophectoderm differentiation over time.</title><p>(A) Genes coding for pluripotency factors (B) Genes associated with trophectoderm differentiation.

To explore this further, we first plotted SE nearest gene mRNA synthesis fold changes to investigate whether we could detect small differences in fold changes that may simply not have exceeded our statistical significance level. This analysis also revealed no appreciable changes in SE nearest gene mRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4A</xref>). Next, we analyzed the occupancy of Oct4 and the fold change of eRNA synthesis at these SEs. We found significantly lower occupancy of Oct4 (Figure 4—figure supplement 3, left) and significantly lower decrease of eRNA synthesis (Figure 4—figure supplement 3, right) at these SEs in comparison to the decommissioned SEs for which nearest genes were down-regulated. This suggests that Oct4 occupancy and the degree of eRNA synthesis changes at transcriptionally down-regulated SEs may play a role in transcription. Figure 4—figure supplement 3 is now also discussed in the subsection “Oct4 binds enhancers to activate putative target genes”.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Characterization of SE-gene pairs for which nearest gene transcription remained unchanged.</title><p>(A) Boxplots showing mRNA synthesis fold change for unchanged nearest genes of decommissioned SEs.

Together with our results this suggests that decommissioning of enhancers does not always lead to down-regulation of gene expression. It is known that regulation by enhancers is not limited to the nearest gene and currently it is unclear whether the decommissioned SEs may have regulatory ability beyond the nearest gene. To explore this possibility, we analyzed the decommissioned SEs for which nearest gene transcription was unchanged and calculated their genomic distances to the nearest down-regulated genes detected in TT-seq. This analysis revealed a rather large median distance of 674 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4B</xref>). We think this indicates that the majority of these SEs do not regulate genes beyond the nearest one, although it can’t be excluded that long range enhancer-promoter interactions may exist.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The claim that Sox2 maintains chromatin accessibility requires further experimental support with Sox2 loss of function.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the claim that <italic>Sox2</italic> maintains chromatin accessibility would require further experimental support.

This befits the pioneer role of Oct4 in creating an open chromatin environment to support binding of other pluripotency factors (Friman et al., 2019; King and Klose, 2017). In addition, reduced levels of Oct4 may cooperate with <italic>Sox2</italic> to temporarily retain enhancers accessible. Furthermore, we found enhanced binding of <italic>Sox2</italic> at Oct4-bound enhancers after 3 h of DOX treatment.

E.g., we added the following paragraphs in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript:</p><p>&quot;Here we used Oct4 depletion from mouse ESCs and several genomic approaches to analyze the role of Oct4 in the maintenance of pluripotency over a high-resolution time course. We used a Tet-off system that allows gradual Oct4 depletion (Niwa et al., 2000), within 15h. The gradual depletion provided insights into Oct4’s concentration-dependent role in gene expression regulation. Our data showed that loss of Oct4 from enhancers goes along with a decrease in mRNA synthesis from Oct4 target genes crucial for maintaining pluripotency.</p><p>During Oct4 depletion, enhancer and target gene transcription were very sensitive to even small reductions of Oct4 binding, whereas chromatin accessibility was either unaffected (Oct4-insensitive enhancers) or affected later when Oct4 levels decreased considerably (Oct4-sensitive enhancers). During partial recovery of Oct4, chromatin accessibility and enhancer transcription increased at Oct4-sensitive enhancers, but eRNA synthesis could not be fully reactivated, although chromatin accessibility was largely restored. Together, this indicates that normal ESC levels of Oct4 are required for enhancer transcription whereas low levels of Oct4 are sufficient to retain chromatin accessibility. This is also consistent with a recent study, in which the authors used an Oct4-low expressed protein depletion system in ESCs and observed that loss of chromatin accessibility was quasi-synchronized with Oct4 loss (Friman et al., 2019).&quot;</p><p>&quot;… at enhancers dependent on Oct4 for their accessibility (Oct4-sensitive enhancers) <italic>Sox2</italic> remained transiently bound during the first 6 h of DOX treatment and only decreased when chromatin accessibility also decreased.

We discovered that Oct4 has differential concentration-dependent activities in regulating enhancer transcription and chromatin accessibility in pluripotent stem cells. Normal ESC concentrations of Oct4 are required to maintain the transcription of pluripotency enhancers. In contrast, Oct4 regulates chromatin accessibility very rapidly even at low concentrations, capable of increasing chromatin accessibility within hours of induction.&quot;</p><p>Finally, we have updated the manuscript title from &quot;Oct4 primarily controls enhancer activity rather than accessibility&quot; to &quot;Oct4 differentially regulates chromatin opening and enhancer transcription in pluripotent stem cells&quot; and edited the abstract of the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>To complete experiments (particularly analysis of regions not bound by Oct4, Oct4 recovery experiments and clarification of the role of Sox2), consider alternative explanations and provide a more balanced discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the critical review and the suggestions that helped us to improve the manuscript.

In light of the added recovery experiments and reviewer comments, we reinterpreted some of our results, clarified the role of <italic>Sox2</italic>, and edited the Discussion section of the manuscript accordingly (see Essential revisions points 5 and 7 for more details).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study utilizes transcription regulation to achieve depletion of Oct4; this results in a gradual reduction in Oct4 levels, meaning that Oct4 is still present throughout much of the timecourse. On the other hand, Oct4 is only fully removed and absent from chromatin after 12-15 hours, by which time 1000-1500 genes are shown to be differentially regulated. It has previously been described that ESCs can be maintained with low levels of Oct4, resulting in altered signalling requirements and gene expression (Karwacki-Neisius et al. 2013; Radzisheuskaya et al. 2013). Given that Oct4 protein is present at a reduced level for most of the timecourse, the implications of this altered cell state should be discussed.</p><p>There are several control datasets that should be described in order to determine how directly loss of Oct4 from enhancers affects their activity. For example, in figure 4, changes in eRNA synthesis at Oct4-bound enhancers are analysed, but there is no corresponding analysis of enhancers not bound by Oct4. Do these remain unchanged as would be expected if the removal of Oct4 from enhancer elements is directly responsible for the reduction in eRNA observed? Similarly, changes in chromatin accessibility are analysed at enhancers bound by Oct4, but it is possible that the changes observed in roughly half of these loci is driven by the change in cellular identity rather than by the loss of Oct4; how does the chromatin accessibility of enhancers not bound by Oct4 change, especially those associated with genes that are downregulated during exit from pluripotency?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the critical review and the insightful suggestions that helped us to improve the manuscript.
