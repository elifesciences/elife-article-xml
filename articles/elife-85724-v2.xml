The postponed screenings have led to backlogs that healthcare systems will need to address as operational changes continue with evolving COVID-19 rates. Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), which primarily serve low-income and minority communities, have been particularly impacted by the pandemic. Low-income and minority communities had disproportionately high cancer incidence and mortality prior to the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Du et al., 2011</xref>; and now could have increased disparities due to reduced access to screening because of COVID-19 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Maringe et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The East Boston Neighborhood Health Center (EBNHC) is the largest FQHC in Massachusetts. It was established in 1970 and has approximately 170,000 patient visits annually. Its catchment area includes 270,000 patients. Over 70% of the patient population is Latinx. During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, most non-urgent in-person medical care was postponed, including cervical cancer screening (CCS). A quality improvement (QI) project was initiated at the EBNHC in March 2021 to improve CCS rates. The purpose of the project was to examine the impact of a QI intervention on improving CCS, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of different methods for addressing overdue screening. The multicomponent intervention utilized best practices as recommended by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) Community Preventive Services Task Force community guide, including interventions to increase community demand (client reminders), interventions to increase community access (extended hours), and interventions to increase provider delivery of screening services (provider assessment and feedback) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019</xref>). In a meta-analysis examining interventions to increase CCS among ethnic minority women, the intervention with the strongest effect was increased access, followed by community education, and individual counseling/letters. Combining multiple strategies did not increase CCS for Hispanic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Han et al., 2011</xref>). Taking this data into consideration, the clinical leadership at the EBNHC critically evaluated the operational and financial feasibility of various interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic and the CCS project was designed as a descriptive study. This article describes the project’s background, lessons learned, and new initiatives the EBNHC will use to improve CCS rates in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Setting: Current CCS program at the EBNHC</title><p>CCS is performed by a diverse team of healthcare providers at the EBNHC, including physicians, nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, and physician assistants. These screenings take place within the Adult Medicine (AM), Family Medicine (FM), and Women’s Health departments. Additionally, a smaller number of CCS are conducted in the Pediatrics Department for patients over the age of 21 who still receive care there. CCS can potentially be conducted during all types of visits. To assist in ensuring timely screenings, our electronic medical record (EMR) system, EPIC, utilizes a care gap alert feature. This feature identifies patients who are overdue for CCS based on the health maintenance aspect of their medical records. The 2018 United States Preventative Service Task Force CCS Guidelines are used as a basis for the EPIC care gap frequency. The CCS care gap frequency is manually changed by providers for patients who require increased CCS based on previous abnormal cytology/HPV results/cervical pathology. A CCS care gap alert fires when it is 1 d overdue based on the set frequency and the date of the patient’s last CCS.</p><p>The Quality Department at the EBNHC closely monitors CCS metrics, specifically the percentage of CCS performed, to ensure high-quality care. At present, there are no other routine workflows associated with CCS.</p><p>The data for this project was collected from the EMR reports. The analysis of the data involved descriptive statistics, and no statistical modeling was conducted.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Preparatory work: Demonstrating project need</title><p>An EPIC work-bench report (WBR) was run to identify active EBNHC patients (defined as at least one visit to a primary care department in the past 18 mo) whose health record stated that CCS screening was overdue. This list had over 8000 patients as of January 2021. The provider tasked with examining the EBNHC’s overdue CCS issue reviewed 1600 charts and noted that over 80% were correctly identified as overdue. This data was presented to the EBNHC clinical and administrative leadership in February 2021. A proposal was made to (1) validate the overdue CCS list, (2) create CCS-only clinics, and (3) improve clinical and electronic CCS workflows. This project was approved by the Project Steering Committee March 2021. This article reports efforts on chart validation and CCS-only clinics. A total of 1600 charts were initially reviewed to determine the need for the QI project.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Data validation: Creation of outreach list</title><p>Starting in March 2021, a 21-provider team was assembled to review 6126 charts of patients identified as overdue for CCS using the report generated by EPIC. The team consisted of nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and physicians from AM, FM, and OB/GYN departments. The team was trained on how to review charts to confirm the need for CCS by the project lead during a 1-hr teaching session. One hundred medical record numbers from the overdue CCS list were sent approximately every 2 wk to each provider to review. A new list of patients was sent to the providers once they reviewed the previously given list. This was completed from April 30 to June 29, 2021, until the entirety of the overdue CCS list was reviewed. All providers received overtime pay from their respective departments for the hours used to review these patient records. A messaging pool was created in the EMR for providers to ask gynecologists questions about CCS necessity or frequency during the validation process. Three staff gynecologists volunteered for this task. A validated list was created of patients overdue for CCS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Staff training: Increasing awareness among clinicians</title><p>The importance of the problem, magnitude of the deficit, and goals of the QI project were presented to all staff during quarterly staff meetings by the Chief Medical Officer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Patient services: CCS-only clinics</title><p>To address the backlog of patients overdue for CCS, screening-only clinics were created. To maximize accessibility for patients, two different time blocks were used: regular clinic hours and evenings/weekends.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Regular clinic hours</title><p>From March to April 2021, the OB/GYN department organized five CCS-only clinic sessions during regularly scheduled clinical hours. The OB/Gyn staff (medical assistants and front-desk staff) outreached to patients from the validated list. Because these clinics occurred during regular clinic hours, the normal workflow for patient outreach and scheduling was used and no additional staffing or training was required. The patients outreached for these clinics all had a history of abnormal CCS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Evenings/weekends</title><p>From May to July 2021, eight additional CCS-only clinic sessions were organized outside of regularly scheduled clinical hours (evenings/weekends). To organize and run the evening/weekend CCS-only sessions, an operations team was created. The team consisted of the CCS project lead, the OB/Gyn clinical leader, operations managers from OB/Gyn and FM, and the OB/Gyn clinical supervisor. Weekly meetings were held from April 2 to July 23, 2021. A dedicated outreach team was also created from the OB/Gyn department: an outreach lead (OB/Gyn clinical supervisor), a medical assistant, and two front-desk staff. The outreach team was responsible for calling patients from the validated list to schedule and keep track of outreach outcomes. A smart phrase was created for these outreach calls. Staff also placed CCS clinic reminder calls 1 d before the scheduled CCS-only clinic. If a patient preferred to have her CCS done by her primary care provider, the message created by the new smart phrase was forwarded to the appropriate departmental pool to inform them to call the patient. The IT department created a new resource schedule in the FM department for these clinics. The data management and analysis were done by the outreach and project leads.</p><p>The staffing for the evening/weekend CCS-only clinics was organized by the project lead. Two rotating OB/Gyn front-desk staff were used for front-desk staff. A total of 6 rotating medical assistants and 14 staff providers (NPs, PAs, and MDs) from OB/Gyn, FM, and AM departments were used. Three FM MD residents and two FM NP residents also participated. All clinic staff were paid overtime for the hours spent in the clinic (residents are not clinic staff and did not receive overtime pay). An orientation document regarding the CCS-only clinics was created by the project lead and emailed to participating providers several days before the clinic to review. A smart phrase for a CCS-only EMR note was also created for those providers who wanted to use it.</p><p>The evening/weekend sessions were done at different times to evaluate optimal timing and staffing for possible future permanent CCS clinics. All clinics were held in the FM clinic due to many exam rooms. A total of four Wednesday clinics were held from 5:20 to 8:00 pm; each included 48 appointments. Staff for Wednesday even clinics included six providers, four medical assistants, and one front-desk staff. A total of four Saturday morning clinics were held from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm. Staff included five providers, three medical assistants, and one front-desk staff. The first two Saturday clinics had 72 appointments. The last two Saturday clinics were overbooked with 73 and 79 patients, respectively, based on the number of missed appointments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Patient satisfaction</title><p>The operations team wanted to collect patient satisfaction data on the evening/weekend CCS clinics to improve clinics in the future. The CCS clinics which took place during regular office hours had already been completed, thus no survey data was collected for those sessions. A patient survey was created with leaders of the CCS project operations team, the director of clinical compliance and risk management, and the Crossroads Group survey company. The survey was created in English and Spanish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). For the first two CCS clinics done in evenings/weekends, May 5 and 19, the survey was texted to the patients who attended the clinic by the Crosswords Group. For the remaining CCS clinics, a paper version of the survey was handed out to patients when they were being roomed. Following their visits, patients placed the completed surveys into a marked box, and the surveys were subsequently sent to the Crossroads Group for data analysis.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Patient satifaction survey.</title><p>Patient survey given to patients who attended the cervical cancer screening (CCS) clinics in the evenings/weekends.

Therefore, 118 patients with an overdue CCS were randomly selected for a closer review to evaluate why CCS was not done. Among these 118 patients, 20% did not need a CCS: 14% due to incorrect CCS frequency in the healthcare gap; 3% of patients had CCS done at an outside clinic that was not seen in the patient EBNHC chart; 3% of patients were not part of the EBNHC active patient panel; and 1% of patients were &gt;65 years old or were status post a hysterectomy and did not have CCS health gap turned off. Among those who were due for CCS, several reasons were identified for not completing the screening. In 30% of encounters, the overdue CCS was not noted by the provider, while in 16% of encounters, the overdue CCS was noted but not addressed due to other medical concerns. Patient-related issues were noted in the remaining 54% of cases: not emotionally ready (23%), desired gynecologist (14%), on menses (9%), desired female provider (6%), and physical and cognitive impairments (2%).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>CCS results and rates</title><p>A total of 459 CCSs were done during this project.

To provide a contextual understanding of the CCS rates, we analyzed the annual number of overdue CCSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These numbers represent the number of overdue CCSs by the end of each December. Initially, there was an increase in overdue CCS because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, following the completion of the overdue CCS project in late summer 2021, there was a subsequent decrease in the number of overdue CCS.

For the May 5 and 19 clinics, five surveys were obtained through text messaging for each session. This led to a decision to switch to distributing paper surveys to patients during the clinic for last six evening/weekend sessions. The satisfaction scores were 83% excellent (121/146 surveys) and 17% good (25/146 surveys). Patients largely rated their interactions as excellent with phone attendants (86%, 166/193) and healthcare providers (85%, 162/191), and (77%, 146/190) found the test to be convenient. Nearly all (93%, 168/181) reported that their expectations were met, and 95% stated they were very likely to make another CCS appointment in the future (95%, 134/141). Only 42% (69/166) stated that they would have scheduled a CCS appointment without EBNHC outreach. Note that denominators are different as not every patient who turned in survey answered all the questions of the same questions.</p><p>The high scores from the evening/weekend CCS clinics suggest that the clinic was delivering high-quality care, meeting patient needs, and creating a positive patient experience. These scores also indicated that patients are likely to have trust in the clinic and may be more inclined to recommend it to others. We can also use the scores for marketing future CCS clinics.</p><p>The extent of effort required to achieve the project’s goal of enhancing CCS rates was diverse.

Concurrently, it aimed to assess the effectiveness and long-term viability of different methods for addressing overdue screening. The EBNHC’s ability to increase the proportion of our active patient population up to date with CCS by 4.5% during the COVID-19 pandemic was multifactorial. Validating overdue patient lists removed 15% of patients inaccurately flagged as needing screening, which created an accurate denominator to determine up-to-date status. Creating directed outreach and implementing CCS-only sessions led to the completion of 459 CCS. In addition, return of patients to primary care as preventive services reopened in after widespread COVID-19 vaccination in 2021; increased awareness among PCPs of the importance of CCS due to both direct staff outreach and participation in the chart validation; and support from clinical leadership may have led clinicians to capitalize on opportunities to perform CCS when patients presented for clinical care.</p><p>The CDC Community Preventive Services Task Force Community Guide recommends multicomponent interventions to increase cancer screenings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cancer screening: Multicomponent Interventions Cervical Cancer, 2022</xref> ). The main components of our intervention focused on increasing community demand (client reminders), interventions to increase community access (extended hours), and interventions to increase provider delivery of screening services (provider assessment and feedback). Establishing the intervention had several steps. First, we had to establish buy-in from leadership. Our patient population is &gt;70% Latinx. The Latina population have the highest incidence of new cervical cancer cases and the second (to black women) highest incidence of cervical cancer deaths in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019</xref>). We therefore felt this issue was a priority for our patient population. A single provider’s review of the overdue CCS list showed high rates of overdue screenings, which led to the buy-in from the clinical and academic leaders to proceed with the project. Understanding the scope of the issue and catching up with the CCS rate were important to prevent an increase in cervical precancer and cancer in our community.</p><p>Second, we had to determine which patients needed screening. There was an estimated 15% of the overdue CCS list which was incorrect based on random chart sampling. Our chart review of over 6000 charts created a validated list to use for focused electronic outreach in the future. It also created a greater understanding for providers of how to confirm an overdue CCS and increase CCS during their clinics. Third, we had to raise awareness of the problem and of the goals of the QI project among clinic staff. Fourth, we had to develop efficient processes for completing overdue CCS. The evidence-based components chosen from the Community Guide included interventions to increase community demand (client reminders) and interventions to increase community access (extended hours) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019</xref>). After establishing the validated list and presenting the project at staff meetings (provider assessment and feedback), we provided client reminders (outreach) to patients as part of normal clinic workflows or via a newly created outreach team. To increase access (extended hours), we tried the following: (1) creating new CCS clinics during regular clinic hours in the Gynecology Department; (2) creating new CCS clinics during evening/weekend hours; and (3) scheduling CCS during regular clinics in the Gynecology Department. This included patients’ first scheduled appointments and rescheduled visits following missed appointments for the new CCS clinics or if patients called to schedule CCS after CCS clinics were finished. We also created workflows to communicate with AM and FM departments when patients preferred CCS to be done by the primary care provider.</p><p>We found that CCS-only clinics that focused on patients with prior abnormal results and were performed during regularly scheduled clinical hours were effective. The majority (57%) of patients who received outreach from the Gynecology Department for CCS-only clinics during regular clinic hours had their screenings done. The success of these clinics may have occurred in part because all these patients had a history of abnormal CCS and may therefore have been more knowledgeable regarding the purpose and importance of CCS. These clinics were an effective way both to increase the CCS rate and to have new providers and providers coming back from leave ease into clinical work. Resident clinics were another way to improve CCS rates while teaching pelvic exams and being financially prudent. Surveying patients was a valuable tool for obtaining patient opinions for use in improving CCS clinics and workflow. Importantly, we found that fewer than half of patients would have scheduled CCS without outreach, underscoring the importance of increasing community demand, especially in safety-net settings.</p><p>There were aspects of this project which were less effective. Most surprising was that our attempts to increase access by offering CCS appointments during evenings/weekends were not successful. Evening/weekend appointments had a much lower attendance rate (62%) compared with appointments during normal clinic hours (82%). Not all patients outreached for evening/weekend clinics had a history of abnormal CCS; therefore, some may have been less knowledgeable regarding the importance of screening. Additional reasons for low attendance may have been lack of a direct recommendation for screening from their healthcare provider, fear of pain, and low perceived need especially during a pandemic. Oyegbite et al. showed that a nurse contacting 120 patients overdue for CCS in a small practice in northwest England increased CCS rates versus texting, but the effort required to achieve this increase was unsustainable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Oyegbite et al., 2021</xref>). Another study of 260 patients showed a 8% increase in CCS for pregnant and postpartum patients by introducing a package of CCS information, targeted education, and widening access to screening appointments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Coleridge et al., 2022</xref>). Other research on CCS during the COVID-19 pandemic used different changes in workflow to improve screening rates. Martellucci et al. changed CCS appointment times from flexible scheduling for many patients in one time slot to strict 15 min appointments for one patient only. This led to similar screening rate to pre-COVID and higher provider satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuti Martellucci et al., 2021</xref>). Castanon et al. demonstrated modeling recovery strategies for CCS emphasizing increased access and patient messaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Castanon et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> outlines the practical lessons gleaned from this project, which can offer meaningful guidance to other community health centers.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Lessons learned.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">How many overdue CCSs does your institution have?</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">– Examine details about the numbers: # overdue CCS/provider and # overdue CCS/department to see if education is needed regarding screening guidelines or clinical workflows.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">– Identify high-risk groups to target patient outreach: no CCS for &gt;5 y, history of abnormal CCS, first CCS overdue.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Why is CCS not being done?</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">– Random sampling of overdue list and deep dive into chart and identify why the CCSs were not done and change workflows accordingly.

Optimizing the utilization of the features of an EMR system can reduce the need for work hours needed and improve the efficiency of data management and analysis. Instead of a single provider reviewing the overdue CCS EMR list, having a population health manager or grant-sponsored volunteer do the data management and analysis as a Cervical Cancer Navigator can be more efficient. Care navigation has been shown to increase cancer screening rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Nelson et al., 2020</xref>). We also want to survey patients who would not schedule CCS or missed CCS appointments to create a community-specific Cervical Cancer Screening Campaign, including evaluating the role of social determinants of health. To reduce the number of patients requiring CCS each year, the EBNHC has also recently updated their CCS screening guidelines to every 3 y for 21- to 24-year-olds with cytology only and every 5 y for 25- to 65-year-olds with HPV/cytology co-testing, consistent with the American Cancer Society’s 2020 guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fontham et al., 2020</xref>). This will allow the extension of screening intervals from 3 to 5 y for most patients. Eventual self-screening HPV testing could increase rates while optimizing resource allocation. We are currently not continuing CCS-only clinics due to the limited appointment access in all adult departments stemming from the increased need for in-person visits since the improvement of the COVID-19 pandemic. Restarting these clinics during regular hours in FM, AM, and the OB/GYN departments is a future aim.</p><p>This study has both strengths and limitations. Our experience working from a list of over 7000 patients is larger than similar QI projects reported in the literature. This is also one of the first successful QI projects to our knowledge specifically addressing COVID-related screening deficits in a safety net setting. However, as we describe the experience in one FQHC, our results may not be generalizable to other settings such as rural clinics or those without EMR capabilities. The EBNHC has had a provider who has been able to lead the project from the initial review of the overdue CCS EMR list to organizing the CCS clinic staffing and to create new clinical and electronic workflows to use in the future. Having dedicated staff to manage CCS and cancer screening may not be feasible for many community health centers. We were not able to include the time delay for each overdue CCS or demographic data other than age. For future studies, we would include age, race, education status, insurance status, and marital status. The cost data is proprietary/not shareable, but analysis by clinical leadership indicated the program was not cost-effective/sustainable.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>During the project March–August 2021, the EBNHC performed 459 CCS and increased the proportion of our total patient population who were up to date with screening by 4.5% from its nadir during 2021. The information gathered from our overdue CCS list was utilized to launch a multidisciplinary effort to learn why CCS was not being done and validate our overdue numbers. We have increased the awareness of our overdue CCS issue and regarding the EMR review needed to confirm and overdue CCS in three departments. The screenings done during the CCS project plus increased provider awareness have contributed to our increased CCS rate. We are also in the process of centralizing our CCS workflow to decrease charting errors and make patient outreach more automated and efficient. If CCS-only clinics can be done during regular hours or resident clinics, they have value. The lessons learned from our effort can be used by other community health centers to improve CCS rates and decrease health inequities for high-risk populations in the United States.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing

The decision was reached by consensus. What follows below is the edited compilation of the essential and ancillary points provided by reviewers in their critiques and in their interaction post-review. Please submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter, we also need to see the corresponding revision clearly marked in the text of the manuscript. Some of the reviewers' comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text. Please keep in mind, however, that readers may have the same perspective as the reviewers. Therefore, it is essential that you amend or expand the text to clarify the narrative accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The structure and flow of the manuscript could be further improved with the addition of flowcharts on the study population and the decision-making process to create a &quot;validated&quot; list of overdue patients.</p><p>The presentation of results and recommendations (lessons learned) is a bit confusing relative to the simplicity of data analysis and results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Introduction</p><p>Pages 3-4, lines 79-83.
