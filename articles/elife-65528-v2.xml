immunotherapy is challenged by the scarce cell numbers that can be extracted from blood. Here, we systematically investigate culture parameters for generating pDCs from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Using optimized conditions combined with implementation of HSPC pre-expansion, we generate an average of 465 million HSPC-derived pDCs (HSPC-pDCs) starting from 100,000 cord blood-derived HSPCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such protocol allows HSPC-pDC generation from whole-blood HSPCs, and these cells display a pDC phenotype and function. Using GMP-compliant medium, we observe a remarkable loss of TLR7/9 responses, which is rescued by ascorbic acid supplementation. Ascorbic acid induces transcriptional signatures associated with pDC-specific innate immune pathways, suggesting an undescribed role of ascorbic acid for pDC functionality. This constitutes the first protocol for generating pDCs from whole blood and lays the foundation for investigating HSPC-pDCs for cell-based immunotherapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) represent a rare and unique type of immune cell that plays a central role particularly in the detection and control of viral infections. In addition to conventional dendritic cell (cDC) functions, pDCs are capable of producing high levels of type I interferon (IFN) upon exposure to virus-derived nucleic acids that are recognized by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Swiecki and Colonna, 2015</xref>). Though the signature cytokine secreted by activated pDCs are type I IFNs, pDCs also effectively produce other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, and ligands for CXCR3 (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Beek, 2020</xref>). Consequently, pDCs have emerged as key effectors and regulators within the immune system, and their implication within a number of diseases, as well as their potential clinical application, has become a topic of great interest. Several preclinical studies have confirmed the immunotherapeutic potential of pDCs for the treatment of cancer through a multifaceted stimulation of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aspord, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drobits, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belounis, 2020</xref>). Importantly, two clinical trials have shown that autologous tumor antigen-loaded pDCs induce antitumoral responses and significantly improved clinical outcome for melanoma and prostate cancer patients, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Westdorp, 2019</xref>). In one of these trials, a mixture of pDCs and cDCs was used, and a follow-up comparison of these two cell types suggests that pDCs are superior to cDCs at attracting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, γ/δ T cells, and CD56<sup>+</sup> NK cells to sites of melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Beek, 2020</xref>). Overall, this indicates that pDC-based anticancer immunotherapy could be an alternative or supplement to current cancer immunotherapy. While attempts have been made to translate the use of pDCs into a clinical immunotherapeutic setting, their use has been severely impeded by their rarity within peripheral blood (0.1% ± 0.07% of PBMCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ueda, 2003</xref>). Coupled with their short ex vivo survival, they are very difficult to study and modulate as a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhan, 2016</xref>). To this end, a few efforts have been made to generate pDCs ex vivo by differentiation of CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diaz-Rodriguez, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thordardottir, 2017</xref>). These studies demonstrate that HSPC-derived pDCs (HSPC-pDCs) can be generated from different sources of HSPCs, including cord blood (CB) and mobilized peripheral blood. Although some improvements in different methods of pDC generation have been achieved, adoptive transfer therapy of autologous HSPC-pDCs is still challenging due to low cell yield and the requirement for patients to undergo granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced HSPC mobilization.</p><p>Recently, we reported a novel robust ex vivo setup for generating high numbers of pDCs from HSPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laustsen, 2018</xref>). We identified that a combination of growth factors, cytokines, and small molecules (Flt3-L, TPO, SCF, IL-3, and SR1) supported HSPC expansion and differentiation into immature HSPC-pDCs. Following a 21-day culture period, an average of 35% of the culture was HSPC-pDCs, which could be enriched to near purity using immunomagnetic depletion of non-pDCs. Most importantly, we showed that to generate a mature and functional phenotype, the HSPC-pDCs culture required priming by exposure to type I and II IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laustsen, 2018</xref>).</p><p>To extend on our previous work, we here present a clinical-relevant strategy to increase HSPC expansion and promote the functionality and numbers of generated pDCs under current good manufacturing process (cGMP) standards. HSPC pre-expansion with the pyrimido-indole derivative UM171 combined with low-density (LD) culturing highly promoted expansion of HSPC-pDCs. We demonstrate that commercially available cGMP medium fails to produce HSPC-pDCs with functional capacity to produce type I IFN upon TLR7 and TLR9 activation. Importantly, we identified that the addition of ascorbic acid (AA) upregulated several genes implicated in pDC development and function, and rescued the functionality of pDCs, thereby establishing AA as a key culture medium component for the generation of HSPC-pDCs. Finally, we show that these combined efforts enable the generation of pDCs from naturally circulating HSPCs found within peripheral blood (cHSPC). Collectively, we present a platform that allows cGMP-compliant generation of therapeutically relevant numbers of HSPC-pDCs from HSPCs obtained from standard blood samples without the need for mobilization regiments like G-CSF and plerixafor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Low-density HSPC culture improves expansion and yield of pDCs</title><p>Our previously published protocol for HSPC-to-pDC differentiation made use of a high-density culturing paradigm based on medium change on fixed days using fixed volumes of medium. Prior work has demonstrated that culturing HSPCs ex vivo at LD culture conditions stimulates the transition of HSPCs into the cell cycle, thereby supporting the expansion of HSPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charlesworth, 2018</xref>). Therefore, we compared our standard culture protocol (SCP) to an LD protocol where cells were split more frequently and not allowed to reach a density exceeding 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL at any time point (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a and b</xref> for culturing overview). During the 21-day culture, we observed that the LD protocol led to a higher expansion of HSPCs compared to the standard protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). Starting from 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> HSPCs, we obtained an average number of 1.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> (± 0.7 × 10<sup>9</sup>) total cells compared to 0.055 × 10<sup>9</sup> (± 0.001 × 10<sup>9</sup>) in the standard condition. Next, we isolated HSPC-pDCs using immunomagnetic depletion of non-pDCs. Importantly, we found that the LD culture protocol also highly increased HSPC-pDC numbers. Starting from 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> HSPCs, the average yield of isolated HSPC-pDCs was 201 × 10<sup>6</sup> (± 58.7 × 10<sup>6</sup>) versus 10.4 × 10<sup>6</sup> (± 2.3 × 10<sup>6</sup>) HSPC-pDCs in the standard condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). This is an average yield of 1005 (± 293) HSPC-pDCs per single CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPC, which is an average improvement of 19-fold over the standard condition. The culture density did not affect the viability of the cells during the 21-day culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>), nor did it influence the fraction of HSPC-pDCs among the total cells that were generated at day 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). However, a small decrease in viability of the isolated HSPC-pDCs from the LD culture was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). pDCs are known to secrete very large amounts of type I IFNs in response to agonists directed against TLR7 or TLR9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Swiecki and Colonna, 2015</xref>). Previously, we have shown that isolated HSPC-pDCs require a priming by adding type I and II IFNs to the culture medium to become functionally active and responsive to TLR7 and TLR9 agonists. We therefore next primed the isolated HSPC-pDCs for 3 days and subsequently stimulated the cells with TLR7 and TLR9 agonists. Evaluation of type I IFN responses of HSPC-pDCs generated under LD conditions versus standard conditions showed no difference when stimulated with a TLR7 agonist and a minor improvement for the LD condition when stimulated with a TLR9 agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Phenotypic analysis of pDC surface markers by flow cytometry of the isolated HSPC-pDCs (Lin<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup>CD123<sup>+</sup>CD303<sup>+</sup>) showed no obvious difference between the two culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e–h</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lower cell density increases expansion during plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) differentiation.</title><p>Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were thawed and 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were cultured for 21 days using the standard cultivation protocol (SCP) described previously, or with a low-density (LD) protocol (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a and b</xref> for detailed culturing paradigms), after which HSPC-pDCs were isolated by immunomagnetic negative selection.

As we have previously shown that HSPC-pDCs could be generated using serum-free medium, we rationalized that combining commercially available serum-free medium (SFEM II medium) with our newly defined LD condition would constitute a more streamlined HSPC-pDC production protocol with possible improvements in functionality and yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laustsen, 2018</xref>). Additionally, we wanted to evaluate if the higher expansion rate of HSPCs in LD culture would enable earlier isolation of functional HSPC-pDCs, thereby reducing manufacturing cost and duration of a potential future clinical product. Of note, the high yield obtained with the LD protocol prompted us to reduce the starting cell numbers from 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> HSPCs and still generate sufficient numbers of HSPC-pDCs for subsequent analysis. We then compared SFEM II to the conventional serum-based culture medium (RPMI) at LD conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b</xref> for culture overview). Cells were cultured for 21 days while HSPC-pDCs were isolated by immunomagnetic selection at days 16, 18, and 21. We found that SFEM II significantly promoted the proliferation of HSPCs compared to RPMI with serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Starting from 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> HSPCs, an average of 2.4 × 10<sup>9</sup> (± 0.6 × 10<sup>9</sup>) total cells were generated at day 21 with SFEM II versus 0.7 × 10<sup>9</sup> (± 0.4 × 10<sup>9</sup>) total cells for RPMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The high expansion rate using SFEM II also translated to a significantly higher yield of isolated HSPC-pDCs at all three time points of isolation, with a maximum of 580 × 10<sup>6</sup> HSPC-pDCs (± 123 × 10<sup>6</sup>) HSPC-pDCs isolated after 21 days of culture using SFEM II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Even after 16 days of differentiation, 100 × 10<sup>6</sup> (± 22.2 × 10<sup>6</sup>) HSPC-pDCs could be isolated starting from only 0.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> HSPC. The transition to SFEM II did not affect the proportion of HSPC-pDCs in the cell culture as similar percentages of HSPC-pDCs were observed across all three isolation time points, indicating that pDCs differentiate continuously during the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Importantly, no difference in viability of the isolated HSPC-pDCs was observed at any time point or condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We next performed TLR7 and TLR9 activation assays of the produced HSPC-pDCs, which showed that cells generated using SFEM II displayed a higher capacity to produce type I IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d and e</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that HSPC-pDCs that had been isolated at earlier time points produced significantly more type I IFN upon TLR9 activation, suggesting that there is a balance between proliferation potential and the immunotherapeutic properties of HSPC-pDCs. Phenotypic analysis of the pDC-related surface markers CD123 and CD303 on lin<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup> cells showed no differences across time points and conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d–g</xref>). Taken together, our data show that HSPC expansion and functionality of isolated HSPC-pDC generation were improved using the serum-free medium SFEM II compared to RPMI supplemented with serum.

A fundamental limitation to HSPC ex vivo culturing is the rapid differentiation of stem and progenitor cells, which in turn produces inhibitory feedback signals that limit stem cell self-renewal. Recent publications have found that ex vivo culturing of HSPCs at low densities combined with the small molecules UM171 and SR1 promotes self-renewal of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells and long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charlesworth, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fares, 2014</xref>). Based on this, we set out to test if a pre-expansion HSPC protocol could be implemented prior to pDC differentiation, potentially allowing very limited numbers of CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs to produce high yields of HSPC-pDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). HSPCs were cultured at LD concentrations (0.1–0.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL) for up to 8 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>), during which the cells expanded significantly with an average of 78 (± 14)-fold expansion for the 8-day pre-expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b, c</xref>). Expanded HSPCs were cryopreserved after 4, 6, or 8 days of expansion to enable initiation of parallel pDC differentiation studies. Upon thawing, expanded HSPCs remained viable and positive (&gt;95%) for the HSPC surface marker CD34<sup>+</sup> with no difference compared to HSPCs that had not been expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d–h</xref>). However, surface expression levels (MFI) of CD34 appeared to increase during the first four initial days of expansion, and then decrease again over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1h</xref>). Next, using the established low-density SFEM II culture protocol, parallel pDC differentiations were initiated with equal numbers of HSPC-pDCs isolated after the different pre-expansion durations. We observed that HSPCs that had undergone pre-expansion for 6 and 8 days showed decreased expansion during pDC differentiation, but viabilities throughout differentiation remained high for all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2i–k</xref>). The stagnated growth correlated with increased numbers of adherent cells during later days of pDC differentiation, and these adherent cells displayed a morphology with long protrusions indicative of cDCs or macrophages (data not shown). This indicates that prolonged pre-expansion affects differentiation and the proliferative capacity of hematopoietic progenitors, which in turn may influence pDC differentiation. Accordingly, when initiating HSPC-pDC differentiation from the same starting cell numbers, lower yields of immunomagnetically separated HSPC-pDCs were observed upon prolonged pre-expansion, particularly when combined with 21 days of pDC differentiation (data not shown). A progressive decline in the percentage of HSPC-pDCs of the total cell population was also observed as the cells had been pre-expanded for longer durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Nevertheless, when fold pre-expansion was taken into account, very high numbers of pDCs could be generated with pre-expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). With a 4-day pre-expansion of HSPCs and a 21-day pDCs differentiation, 3.1 × 10<sup>9</sup> (± 1.2 × 10<sup>9</sup>) HSPC-pDCs could be generated versus 0.9 × 10<sup>9</sup> (± 0.3 × 10<sup>9</sup>) HSPC-pDCs when no pre-expansion was applied. Similarly, early pDC isolation at day 16 yielded an average of 4.7 × 10<sup>8</sup> (± 1.1 × 10<sup>8</sup>) HSPC-pDCs when a 4-day pre-expansion was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Next, we set up experiments where we primed the generated HSPC-pDCs and evaluated phenotypic and functional parameters of the cells. Interestingly, we found that the functional capacity of HSPC-pDCs to secrete type I IFN upon activation with TLR7 or TLR9 agonists was highly affected when cells were pre-expanded for a prolonged time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e and f</xref>). This was in particular evident for the TLR9-mediated type I IFN response, which was significantly decreased when applying 6 or 8 days of pre-expansion. Conversely, surface expression of CD123 and CD303 was not affected by culture duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2l–n</xref>). Overall, these data show a trend of reduced functionality with longer time in culture, which might reflect a type of functional exhaustion during prolonged cell culture. Collectively, we here show that prolonged pre-expansion, as well as extended pDC differentiation culture, drastically affects the functionality of generated HSPC-pDCs. Nevertheless, when a limited period of pre-expansion of 4 days is combined with an early isolation of HSPC-pDCs of 16 days, high yields of functional HSPC-pDCs can be generated.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Pre-expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) increases the yield of HSPC-derived plasmacytoid dendritic cells (HSPC-pDCs).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation showing generation of HSPC-pDCs from pre-expanded HSPCs.

As clinical data highlight the promise of pDCs in immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tel, 2013</xref>), and since clinical cell products must be produced under cGMP, we pursued to implement a cGMP-compliant medium to our culture protocol. To that end, we performed pDC differentiation experiments using two commercially available cGMP-compliant serum-free media ‘SCGM’ and ‘DC medium.’ As we had already used a commercially available serum-free medium (SFEM II), we assumed an uncomplicated transition. Interestingly, we found that expansion of cells during pDC differentiation was highly reduced when HSPCs were cultured in cGMP medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). However, cell viabilities remained high throughout the culture period, but the number of HSPC-pDCs that could be isolated from the culture was reduced in accordance with the lower expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b and c</xref>). Viabilities of isolated HSPC-pDCs and their proportion of the total cell population were largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d and e</xref>), leading us to believe that their functionality would remain unaffected. Remarkably, while isolated HSPC-pDCs from all three culture conditions phenotypically expressed the pDC markers CD123 and CD303 to the same extent, cells cultured in the two cGMP-compliant media were found to either completely lack or have drastically reduced capacity to produce type I IFN upon TLR7 or TLR9 agonist activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f and g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Ascorbic acid rescues the function of HSPC-pDCs produced using cGMP media</title><p>Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an essential vitamin in humans known to have pleiotropic functions in cellular biology, including immune cell function and hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manning, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huijskens, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huijskens, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowie and O’Neill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agathocleous, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, AA has been shown to be involved in type I IFN immune responses. Unlike humans, mice can synthesize AA but transgenic mice lacking the capacity to synthesize AA actually show diminished capacity to produce type I IFN upon TLR activation and influenza infection. This indicates that AA may play a role in either TLR activity or pDC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geber et al., 1975</xref>). While no reports provide clear evidence of a role in pDC development of function, one study does find that medium supplement with AA can increase DC yield during ex vivo differentiation from HSPC, but its significance in pDC functionality was not investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thordardottir, 2017</xref>). Given the evidence of AA in hematopoiesis and IFN responses, we hypothesized that adding AA to our culture medium would improve expansion and viability of HSPCs during pDC differentiation. To that end, we explored a culture system focusing on the cGMP-compliant ‘DC medium’ where we investigated the addition of physiological concentration of AA (50 µM) during HSPC-pDC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Verrax and Calderon, 2009</xref>). We found that DC medium supplemented with AA significantly promoted expansion during HSPC-pDC differentiation up to similar level as the SFEM II culture condition (expansion of 33,554-fold [± 11,664] for DC medium+ AA versus 13,456-fold [± 6953] for DC medium alone) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2h–i</xref>). Moreover, addition of AA significantly improved viability of expanding HSPCs during culture, particularly during later stages of culture (day 12+) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2j</xref>). Additionally, we also found the viability of HSPC-pDCs isolated at day 21 to be significantly increased upon AA addition compared to DC medium alone (92.0% ± 3.4% versus 72.8% ± 3.2%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2k</xref>). Accordingly, the yield of HSPC-pDCs was significantly increased upon AA supplementation for HSPC-pDCs isolated at day 21 (1.0 × 10<sup>9</sup> ± 0.4 × 10<sup>9</sup> HSPC-pDCs for DC medium + AA versus 0.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> ± 0.3 × 10<sup>9</sup> for DC medium alone per 0.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs), without affecting the percentage of HSPC-pDCs of the total population of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>). No statistically significant differences were observed in the yield of HSPC-pDCs isolated at day 16 of culture for the different conditions. Next, we stimulated primed and unprimed HSPC-pDCs with synthetic TLR7 and TLR9 agonists and evaluated the type I IFN response. Interestingly, we found that HSPC-pDCs generated from the AA culture consistently elicited a robust type I IFN response in contrast to DC medium alone for cells isolated both on days 16 and 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d and e</xref>). The response was even found to exceed the response of HSPC-pDCs generated using SFEM II medium. As previously observed, HSPC-pDCs isolated at 16 days of culture displayed improved capacity to produce type I IFN upon TLR7 or TLR9 activation compared to cells isolated at day 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d and e</xref>). Moreover, we found that the capacity of HSPC-pDCs to secrete the pro-inflammatory proteins TNF-α and IL-6 upon TLR7 and TLR9 activation was also rescued when AA was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2l and m</xref>). Upon analysis of surface expression of the markers CD123 and CD303, we found that pDCs isolated from AA-supplemented culture at day 16 displayed lower expression levels of CD303. However, no statistical significance was observed in the percentage of cells expressing CD303 between the conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2n–p</xref>). A small distinct population of HSPC-pDCs showing high surface expression of CD123 was observed upon AA supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2q</xref>). This population was also observed for SFEM II culture conditions, albeit not to the same extent and not for all donors analyzed. Previously, we have shown that the pDC marker HLA-DR is highly expressed in HSPC-pDCs upon IFN priming, correlating with the capacity of the cells to activate T cells through antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laustsen, 2018</xref>). We similarly found HLA-DR to be upregulated upon IFN priming in HSPC-pDCs generated from DC medium. However, no statistically significant difference was observed upon AA addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2r and s</xref>). Numerous studies have described that a distinct subset of precursor conventional dendritic cells (pre-DC) exists in peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">See, 2017</xref>). Due to functional and phenotypical similarities with blood pDCs, including surface expression of CD123, CD303, and CD304, and the capacity to produce type I IFN upon TLR7 or TLR9 agonist stimulation, this subpopulation has inadvertently been considered as pDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ito, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">See, 2017</xref>). Thus, we next evaluated if such pre-DCs were present in our HSPC-pDC population. Notably, pre-DCs have been shown to express CD2, CD5, and CD33, and secrete IL-12 upon TLR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">See, 2017</xref>). However, HSPC-pDCs differentiated with or without AA were unable to produce IL-12 upon TLR7 and TLR9 agonist exposure and had no detectable levels of CD2 on the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2t and u</xref>). This supports that cDCs or pre-DCs are not present in the immunomagnetically selected HSPC-pDC population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laustsen, 2018</xref>). Altogether, our results demonstrate that AA is essential for ex vivo differentiation of pDCs from HSPCs when using cGMP-compliant medium by both increasing expansion of HSPCs and improving viability of expanding cells and isolated HSPC-pDCs, as well as functionality of isolated HSPC-pDCs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Ascorbic acid medium supplementation is required for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell-derived plasmacytoid dendritic cell (HSPC-pDC) generation using the current good manufacturing process (cGMP)-compliant DC medium.</title><p>HSPCs were thawed and 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded in SFEM II, the cGMP-compliant medium DC medium (GMP [DC]), or DC medium supplemented with ascorbic acid (GMP [DC] + AA).

In both trials, pDCs were found to induce favorable anti-tumoral responses by effectively promoting anti-tumoral responses while being well-tolerated. Despite the use of leukapheresis to extract pDCs from the blood, the low numbers of peripheral blood pDCs that can be isolated remains a key limiting factor. In contrast, high numbers of pDCs can be generated by differentiation of patient-derived HSPCs isolated either by direct bone marrow aspiration or by blood leukapheresis following administration of mobilizing regiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Croop, 2000</xref>). However, these procedures are invasive, painful, associated with side effects, or require multi-day doses of mobilizing drugs. For research purposes, for example, to investigate HSPC-pDC functions and antigen presentation to autologous memory cells, HSPCs acquired by these procedures are costly and can be a challenge to procure. An alternative source for HSPCs is peripheral whole blood where a limited number of naturally circulating CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs (cHSPCs) can be found. However, the rarity of these cells has so far limited their use for therapeutic purposes, and furthermore, their capacity for self-renewal and differentiation capacity has also been reported to be much lower than other sources of HSPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Bruyn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">da Silva, 2009</xref>). Based on our data, we reasoned that our high-yield differentiation protocol would allow therapeutically relevant numbers of HSPC-pDCs to be generated from cHSPCs. To that end, we obtained buffy coats (from around 450 mL of whole blood) and isolated CD34<sup>+</sup> cHSPCs using CD34 immunomagnetic-positive selection. We obtained an average number of 1.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cHSPCs ( ± 0.6 × 10<sup>6</sup> cHSPCs), corresponding to 2457 cHSPCs (± 1307 cHSPCs) per mL of blood in line with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beyer and Muench, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eidenschink, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Next, we systematically evaluated if a pre-expansion of cHSPCs and subsequent pDC generation would be feasible. We therefore initiated parallel 16-day pDC differentiation cultures of cryopreserved cHSPCs from the same donors that had either not been pre-expanded or pre-expanded for 4 days and subsequently cryopreserved. For a fully cGMP-compliant protocol, pre-expansion was performed using cGMP-compliant SCGM medium and pDC differentiation was performed using cGMP-compliant DC medium + AA. During pre-expansion, cHSPCs expanded 4.6-fold (± 1.5-fold) and retained CD34 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b–j</xref>). During the 16 days of pDC differentiation, we observed a 257-fold (± 91-fold) expansion of total cells for non-pre-expanded cHSPC versus 192-fold (± 126-fold) for cHSPC pre-expanded for 4 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). When starting from 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cHSPCs, the total yield of cHSPC-pDCs following immunomagnetic selection was 3.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cHSPC-pDCs (± 2.9 × 10<sup>6</sup>) without pre-expansion. Using an optimized setup with 4 days of pre-expansion, an average yield of 8.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> cHSPC-pDCs (± 4.5 × 10<sup>6</sup>) was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). For the pre-expanded condition, this corresponds to 80 cHSPC-pDCs generated per single cHSPC. Of the total cell population generated, cHSPC-pDCs accounted for an average of 23% for pre-expanded cHSPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). As expected, the observed pre-expansion, differentiation potential, and yield were less for cHSPCs compared to CB-HSPCs, whereas the frequency of pDCs obtained was similar. Importantly, cHSPC-pDCs were capable of producing type I IFN upon TLR7 or TLR9 stimulation, and the cells displayed a pDC surface phenotype similar to HSPC-pDCs derived from CB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d and e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1k–n</xref>).

We found that differentiating HSPC-pDCs at reduced density and the supplementation of AA to the cGMP medium was key for achieving high and consistent numbers of highly functional HSPC-pDCs. This was underscored by the induction of several pDC signature genes by AA on the transcriptional level. Importantly, we showed that HSPC-pDCs could be generated ex vivo using HSPCs from whole blood. Collectively, our findings lay the foundation for further clinical exploration of pDCs for use as a cellular immunotherapy.</p><p>In the last decade, immunotherapy has emerged as a powerful strategy to treat multiple diseases. As the field has attracted a considerable interest from the pharmaceutical industry, the demand for developing new methods and strategies is increasing. pDCs have received much attention owing to their multifaceted role in the immune system, and therapies that selectively activate pDCs, for example, TLR agonist, have proven to be effective in anti-tumoral therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwahashi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hofmann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dummer, 2008</xref>). However, while the importance of studying and modulating pDCs for therapy has become more evident, the progress has also been hampered by the low number of cells that can be extracted from the blood. This has also limited the use of pDCs for immunotherapy, but importantly, two independent clinical trials using adoptive transfer of autologous pDCs have shown clinical benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Westdorp, 2019</xref>). In one phase I clinical trial, Tel et al. vaccinated stage IV melanoma patients with autologous pDCs loaded with tumor peptides derived from the melanoma-associated antigens, gp100 and tyrosinase. The therapy improved overall survival, with 45% of patients still being alive after 2 years, compared to 10% in the matched control patients treated with conventional chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tel, 2013</xref>). Similarly, Westdorp et al. found in a phase IIa clinical trial that vaccination using cDCs and pDCs in combination, loaded with the tumor-associated antigens NY-ESO-1, MAGE-C2, and MUC1, improved the clinical outcome of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Westdorp, 2019</xref>). In both clinical trials, antigen-loaded pDCs were found to effectively induce B and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell anti-tumor-specific responses in patients, while being well-tolerated and safe (grade 1–2 toxicities) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Westdorp, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The principal drawback, which was also highlighted in these studies, was the maximum feasible dose of only 0.3–3 × 10<sup>6</sup> pDCs per vaccination, and only three vaccinations at biweekly intervals were performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Westdorp, 2019</xref>). In contrast, in clinical trials utilizing monocyte-derived cDCs (moDCs), patients received 4–8 vaccine regiments with biweekly intervals with predefined moDC doses ranging from 10 to 30 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boudewijns, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Okada, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ribas, 2010</xref>). Similarly, the FDA-approved autologous dendritic cell immunotherapy, Provenge (sipuleucel-T), comprises three vaccination doses of a minimum of 50 million dendritic cells each, and some patients have been treated with doses as high as 1.3 billion dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Small, 2000</xref>). Consequently, there is an unmet need for a clinical manufacturing protocol that allows high and robust numbers of pDCs to be generated. We believe that our platform meets this need by allowing the generation of consistent high numbers of autologous HSPC-pDCs that can be used for multiple vaccine regiments and that can be extracted from easily accessible whole blood. We and other groups have previously demonstrated that pDCs can be generated using CB CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs or mobilized peripheral blood CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs (mPB-HSPCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diaz-Rodriguez, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thordardottir, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Demoulin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Olivier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curti, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thordardottir, 2014</xref>). While CB HSPCs possess a great stem cell potential, the major drawback is the need for an HLA match between donor and recipient. Obtaining mPB-HSPCs requires multiple injections of G-CSF usually over four consecutive days, followed by apheresis and large-scale CD34 immunomagnetic selection. Thus, the procedure is time-consuming, costly, requires access to expensive equipment, and is associated with inconvenience to the donor and side effects such as bone pain. For research studies of pDC biology, the same challenges apply. Furthermore, CB or mobilized peripheral blood is not easily available for common research laboratories. Natural pDCs from peripheral blood have been used, but very few numbers can be isolated from a buffy coat, and the cells have a half-life of only about 24 hr when cultured ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grouard, 1997</xref>). We have previously shown that generated HSPC-pDCs show superior survival versus peripheral blood-derived pDCs, indicating that HSPC-pDCs are more suitable to receive modifications, for example, antigen loading and activation, which are required for immunotherapy in a clinical setting. Thordardottir et al. previously reported a yield of 1.6 million HSPC-pDCs starting from 100,000 mPB-HSPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thordardottir, 2017</xref>). Using the same starting cell number and same duration of pDC differentiation, with no pre-expansion included, we generated an average of 306 million HSPC-pDCs amounting to a 191-fold improvement, albeit their starting material was mPB-HSPCs and ours CB-HSPCs. Importantly, we found that isolating pDCs earlier improved their capacity to produce type I IFN upon stimulation with synthetic TLR7 or TLR9 agonists. This indicates that prolonged pDC differentiation leads to a dysfunctional type I IFN response, possibly due to pDC exhaustion, albeit more research needs to be conducted to further characterize this phenotype. Using our shortened 16-day differentiation protocol and no HSPC pre-expansion, we generated up to 152 million HSPC-pDCs from 100,000 CB-HSPCs.</p><p>We believe that our findings can be used for cGMP-compliant manufacturing of clinically relevant numbers of autologous pDCs from a standard unit of whole blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Using our pre-expansion strategy, we were able to generate an average of 8 million HSPC-pDCs starting from 100,000 cHSPCs. With an average number of 1.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cHSPCs in a standard buffy coat from 450 mL of blood, this would allow for an average of 88 million HSPC-pDCs to be generated in a manner that is minimally invasive to the patient. The cHSPC-pDCs can in turn be cryopreserved, allowing repeated vaccine regiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These numbers of generated cells highly exceed the number of natural pDCs that can be obtained from peripheral blood even when using leukapheresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Westdorp, 2019</xref>). An additional advantage of HSPC-pDCs over natural pDCs is that HSPC-pDCs are amenable to genetic modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laustsen, 2018</xref>). This potentially allows CRISPR/Cas gene editing to amplify the response of pDCs or render them resistant to inhibitory tumor signals. However, further preclinical studies are warranted on the potency of the generated HSPC-pDCs to induce anti-tumoral responses before the protocol can be translated and implemented into clinical practice.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration showing the collective procedure of generating circulating CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell-derived plasmacytoid dendritic cells (cHSPC-pDCs) for therapeutic purposes starting from a patient blood sample.</title><p>CD34<sup>+</sup> cHSPCs are initially isolated using immunomagnetic selection. cHSPCs are then pre-expanded at low density using small molecules that promote self-renewal.

One study has previously reported that AA promoted the yield of pDCs differentiated from HSPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thordardottir, 2017</xref>), but the effect of AA on pDC function was not assessed. Our observations indicate a hitherto undescribed key role of AA in pDC biology. Of note, AA is not included in conventional RPMI, but is present within serum, possibly explaining why pDCs generated using RPMI supplemented with fetal calf serum (FCS) displayed functional type I IFN responses. AA is highly unstable with sensitivity to temperature, atmospheric oxygen, light, and pH, which may explain some of the observed variations in the type I IFN responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vojdani, 2000</xref>). Some evidence indicates that AA plays a role in TLR function and innate immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowie and O’Neill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Savini, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter and Kane, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Janovec, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Esashi, 2012</xref>). Gulo-/- mice, which cannot synthesize AA, show increased viral titers in the lung after infection with H3N2 influenza virus. Interestingly, the type I IFN response was found to be severely decreased, while pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1α/β, were increased, suggesting that AA plays a role in TLR function or downstream IFN signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim, 2013</xref>). Accordingly, Gulo-/- mice have been shown to have decreased STAT3 phosphorylation in T cells upon IL-22 stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bae, 2013</xref>). Moreover, AA has been shown to regulate the activity of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine/threonine kinases, of which some, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), regulate TLR7 and TLR9-mediated type I IFN production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Savini, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter and Kane, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Janovec, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Esashi, 2012</xref>). In line with the effect of AA on the TLR pathway, our transcriptome analysis revealed that several genes implicated in TLR7 and TLR9 processing, trafficking, and signaling were significantly upregulated by AA. Thus, the observed transcriptional changes in these innate immune pathways possibly explain the rescue of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory responses we observed upon AA addition.</p><p>AA has been reported to play important roles in hematopoiesis and immune cell production and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manning, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huijskens, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huijskens, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowie and O’Neill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agathocleous, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vojdani, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carr and Maggini, 2017</xref>). Moreover, analyses of HSPCs isolated directly from the bone marrow has shown that they contain very high intracellular levels of AA (14-fold higher than physiological concentrations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agathocleous, 2017</xref>). While AA supplementation increased HSPC-pDC yield in our setup, the overall percentage of HSPC-pDCs of the total cell population did not increase, indicating that AA does not specifically promote pDC differentiation. Nonetheless, we found several pDC signature genes, and genes related to pDC development, to be upregulated by AA. Especially we found TCF4 (E2-2), the key transcriptional regulator of pDC development and function, as well as other downstream E2-2-regulated genes quite relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cisse, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ghosh, 2010</xref>). The importance of E2-2 for pDC functionality has been clearly demonstrated in patients with Pitt–Hopkins syndrome. This disease is due to a monoallelic loss of E2-2, supporting defective pDCs with decreased CD303 (CLEC4C), and CD85g (LILRA4), and diminished capacity to produce type I IFN upon TLR9 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cisse, 2008</xref>). Of other E2-2-regulated genes, SPIB and IRF8 have been shown to control downstream pDC commitment, supporting that AA is a key contributor in pDC development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sasaki, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schotte, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nagasawa, 2008</xref>).</p><p>AA is a potent antioxidant that quenches harmful ROS and serves as a co-factor for many enzymes. Recent studies have shown that growth factors, such as TPO and IL-3, induce the formation of ROS in hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sattler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hensley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carcamo et al., 2002</xref>). ROS are well-known regulators of many biological pathways in cells, including cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sattler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hensley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carcamo et al., 2002</xref>). As TPO and IL-3 are included in our culture conditions, it is possible that ROS builds up during the prolonged culture period of the cells, thus affecting our pDC differentiation by prolonged culture. However, we did not observe any significant effects of AA on genes related to ROS and oxidative stress, suggesting that the phenotype observed is driven mainly by AA’s regulation of pDC-related transcription factors and pro-inflammatory response-related genes. Further research into the exact mechanisms behind AA effects on this phenomenon needs to be conducted.</p><p>Collectively, we here demonstrate a clinically applicable stem cell differentiation procedure, which we believe can both help elucidate unresolved aspects of pDC biology and facilitate translation of a novel pDC-based treatment modality into clinical immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of HSPC-pDCs from CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs</title><p>Depending on optimization regiments, freshly or cryopreserved HSPCs from various sources were differentiated to HSPC-pDCs using different types of medium. For STD and LD/RPMI conditions, HSPCs were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Lonza) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (HyClone), 600 µg/mL L-glutamine (Sigma), 200 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Gibco, Life Technologies). For STD conditions, HSPCs were cultured at a fixed volume during pDC differentiation versus a fixed density of 0.5–5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL for the LD condition. For serum-free (SFEM II) or cGMP serum-free medium (DC medium) conditions, HSPCs were cultured in SFEM II or DC medium at LD (0.5–5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL). For all conditions, medium was supplemented with the cytokines and growth factors Flt3-L (100 ng/mL), SCG (100 ng/mL), TPO (50 ng/mL), and IL-3 (20 ng/mL). In contrast to our previous protocol, we omitted the addition of IL-7 as we showed that this did not positively impact HSPC-pDC generation (PMID 30166549). All cytokines are from PeproTech. In addition, the small molecule inhibitor StemRegenin 1 (SR1, STEMCELL Technologies) was added at a concentration of 1 µM. For serum-free medium conditions, a concentration of 20 µg/mL streptomycin and 20 U/mL penicillin (Gibco, Life Technologies) was added.

The group have found that supplementation of ascorbic acid (AA) to the cGMP medium was key for achieving high and consistent numbers of highly functional HSPC‐pDCs. Tha authors also include downstream effector function analysis, The study will be important for the design of future experiments and thus very impactful.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Ascorbic acid supports ex vivo generation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells from circulating hematopoietic stem cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carlos Isales as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The work has potential but requires essential additional data especially concerning how ascorbic acid affects type 1 IFN production in pDCs and whether it contributes to metabolic fitness of pDCs via ROS removal. As it stands the manuscript lacks crucial explanation for the AA's mechanism of action in pDC cultures.</p><p>In this manuscript Laustsen and colleagues describe an optimized protocol to obtain pDCs for therapeutic purposes. A common problem of cell based therapies is setting the ex vivo conditions optimally to provide the patient-derived cells at high enough numbers for performing adoptive transfers. This is further complicated by prolonged cultures that may lead to reduced functionality of the cells in other words &quot;exhaustion&quot;. The authors nicely build on their previous work to address these common problems for pDC based therapies by carefully adjusting the ex vivo differentiation conditions of HSPCs. They successfully demonstrate that the combination of a low density culture condition, maintained with more frequent cell splitting, and an engineered GMP compliant procedure via addition of ascorbic acid to media elicits consistently high numbers of highly functional pDCs. Strikingly, this method is applicable to HSPCs derived by simple aphaeresis from peripheral blood, which increases the practicality of the method. The authors provide evidence for the reduced functionality of pDCs in standart cGMP media and they managed to solve this problem by adding ascorbic acid into the culture medium. While these findings are extremely relevant to clinical application of pDC-based immunotherapy, one wonders the mechanistic explanation for why and how ascorbic acid exerts such an isolated effect on pDC functionality.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Laustsen et al., describes a method for a robust generation GMP HSPC‐pDCs. The data is highly significant and the study is done in a rigorous way, experiments are validated in several replicates and the manuscript is well written. in addition, the addition of ascorbic acid for the recovery of IFNa response is fascinating. The major weakness is that no downstream analysis was done to understand the impact of the AA, or the effector function of the cells. The authors' claims and conclusions are justified by their data.</p><p>A couple of point added will strengths the manuscript:</p><p>1.

However, this study would be more appropriate to publish a methodology manuscript than a research manuscript as it lacks crucial information on the effects of ascorbic acid on pDCs. Therefore, this study would highly benefit from further elucidating the role of ascorbic acid in pDCs especially via exploring its possible effects on Type 1 IFN production and alleviating the potential harmful effects of ROS. Albeit useful, the presented data don't warrant an impactful publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65528.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript by Laustsen et al., describes a method for a robust generation GMP HSPC‐pDCs.

Of these, many are associated with TLR7 and TLR9 processing, trafficking, and innate immune pathways, including IRF5, IRF7, IRF8, TLR7, TLR9, MyD88, TRAF3, UNC93B1, LAMP5, PACSIN-1, RSAD2, SLC15A4 and SPP1 (Figure 5c), providing a plausible explanation for the restorative function AA has on the IFN production in the generated HSPC-pDCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

What other cytokines are being produced by HSPC‐pDCs, IL-12?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We have now investigated the production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12 by HSPC-pDCs upon TLR7 and TLR9 stimulation (Figure 4—figure supplement 2l-m and t). Interestingly, we find that TNF-α and IL-6 production is also affected negatively if AA is not present, providing further evidence that AA exerts a general effect on the TLR7 and TLR9 pathways.</p><p>For IL-12, no detectable levels were observed as expected since pDCs are known to be incapable of producing IL-12 in response to TLR agonists. A study previously determined that IL-12 production in purified pDCs is derived from contaminating precursor conventional dendritic cells (pre-DCs) (See et al., Science, 2017). The same study showed that pre-DCs express many markers that overlap with pDCs, including CD123, CD303 and CD304, but uniquely express CD2, CD5, and CD33. Related to question 5 below, we therefore also investigated surface levels of CD2 on isolated HSPC-pDCs and confirmed that no pre-DCs are present within the immunomagnetically-selected HSPC-pDC population (Figure 4—figure supplement 2u).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

However, this study would be more appropriate to publish a methodology manuscript than a research manuscript as it lacks crucial information on the effects of ascorbic acid on pDCs. Therefore, this study would highly benefit from further elucidating the role of ascorbic acid in pDCs especially via exploring its possible effects on Type 1 IFN production and alleviating the potential harmful effects of ROS. Albeit useful, the presented data don't warrant an impactful publication in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We highly appreciate that the reviewer finds the study to be of high benefit to the large community within the field of cancer immunology and thank the reviewer for the suggestions. We agree that the study at the time of the initial submission was focused on the methodology and would have benefitted from additional data supporting the role of ascorbic acid in HSPC-pDCs. Consequently, we have now performed RNAseq on HSPC-pDCs generated with and without ascorbic acid. We find that differentially expressed genes are involved in pDC development and function (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1), including several related to TLR7 and TLR9 innate immune responses, explaining the impact of AA on the TLR7 and TLR9 innate immune responses. In contrary, we did not find any differentially expressed genes related to ROS and oxidative stress. With the new experimental additions to the study, we believe we have addressed the reviewer’s comments and hope the study is appropriate for publication.</p></body></sub-article></article>
