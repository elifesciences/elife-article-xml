in cancer cells is implicated in tumor malignancy. Studies on cancer therapy reveal the presence of heterogeneous cells, including breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs), in breast tumors. BCSCs are often characterized by high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, associated with the malignancy of cancers. In this study, we demonstrated the negative regulation of ALDH activity by the major circadian component CLOCK in murine breast cancer 4T1 cells. The expression of CLOCK was repressed in high-ALDH-activity 4T1, and enhancement of CLOCK expression abrogated their stemness properties, such as tumorigenicity and invasive potential. Furthermore, reduced expression of CLOCK in high-ALDH-activity 4T1 was post-transcriptionally regulated by microRNA: miR-182. Knockout of miR-182 restored the expression of CLOCK, resulted in preventing tumor growth. Our findings suggest that increased expression of CLOCK in BCSCs by targeting post-transcriptional regulation overcame stemness-related malignancy and may be a novel strategy for breast cancer treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>cancer stem cells</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd><kwd>microRNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

cancer is the most common cancer in women globally. There are many diagnostic and therapeutic strategies developed for the treatment of breast cancer; however, recurrence and metastasis remain causes of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. These problems are thought to be associated with tumor heterogeneity, as tumors are composed of heterogeneous cells with structural and biochemical differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burrell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 2012</xref>). Some specific tumor cell populations present as cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) have a high malignant potential and resistance to chemotherapy, due to their high differentiation and self-renewal capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonnet and Dick, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meacham and Morrison, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patrawala et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Visvader and Lindeman, 2008</xref>). Therefore, targeting CSCs may improve breast cancer prognosis, but remains challenging due to the malignant properties of CSCs.</p><p>Breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs) were first reported in solid tumors and specific BCSC markers such as cell surface antigens CD44/CD24 have been identified to isolate stem-like cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Hajj et al., 2003</xref>). Aggressive breast tumors like triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are composed of large populations of cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charafe-Jauffret et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ginestier et al., 2007</xref>). Evidence suggests that breast cancer cells exhibiting high ALDH activity are associated with poor prognosis and late-stage tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charafe-Jauffret et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marcato et al., 2011</xref>); ALDH is now also considered as a CSC marker for other types of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pearce et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Our recent study demonstrated that the number of cells with high ALDH activity exhibits circadian oscillation in 4T1 breast cancer tumors implanted in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsunaga et al., 2018</xref>). A time-dependent variation in the number of cells with high ALDH activity cells affected the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. Molecular circadian oscillators consisting clock genes induce time-dependent changes in the chemosensitivity of cancer cells by controlling the expression of cell cycle regulators and apoptotic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horiguchi et al., 2013</xref>). However, we also found that oscillation in the expression of clock genes was suppressed in ALDH-positive CSCs but not in the surrounding cells in the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsunaga et al., 2018</xref>). WNT10a rhythmically secreted from the microenvironment stimulates ALDH-positive CSCs in a time-dependent manner, and this activation of the WNT/β-catenin signaling in CSCs results in a rhythmic expression of ALDH.</p><p>Studies have reported the association of clock gene dysfunction with cancer malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katamune et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katamune et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Masri et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, oncogenic transformation of <italic>Period2</italic> circadian gene-defective cells results in the development of chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katamune et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting the relevance of circadian clock disruption in the maintenance of CSC properties. However, the role of the circadian clock system in the regulation of CSC biology needs to be explored further.</p><p>In this study, we elucidated the role of each circadian clock gene in the maintenance of CSC properties of mouse 4T1 breast cancer cells. Among the clock genes, expression levels of <italic>Clock</italic> mRNA and its protein were downregulated in ALDH-positive 4T1 cells, and transduction of CLOCK-expressing lentivirus into the ALDH-positive 4T1 cells attenuated their malignant potential. Further, we investigated the underlying mechanism of CLOCK downregulation in ALDH-positive 4T1 cells. Our findings present a possible strategy to overcome the malignancy of BCSCs by targeting miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of circadian component CLOCK.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of CLOCK is suppressed in ALDH-positive 4T1 cells</title><p>CSCs are often characterized by high ALDH activity associated with malignancy and is used for identification and isolation of CSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ginestier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma and Allan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nagare et al., 2016</xref>).

Our current study demonstrates a relationship between the malignancy of BCSCs and the expression of CLOCK, a major component of the molecular circadian machinery. Low expression levels of CLOCK were detected in ALDH-positive 4T1 cells, and enhancing CLOCK expression in 4T1 cells attenuated tumor growth and invasive potential. Furthermore, the expression of CLOCK in ALDH-positive 4T1 cells is regulated at the post-transcriptional level and may be a target to attenuate the malignancy of 4T1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagrams indicating the role of CLOCK in the regulation of malignancy of breast cancer stem-like cells.</title><p>mmu-miR-182 post-transcriptionally suppresses the expression of <italic>Clock</italic> in ALDH-positive 4T1 cells, leading to maintenance of their malignancy.

The detoxification capacity of ALDH can protect stem cells against oxidative damage and is an important factor in their longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigarella et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ito et al., 2006</xref>). High ALDH activity also protects cells from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs through the degradation of reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Awad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katamune et al., 2019</xref>). High activity of ALDH correlates with tumor grade, metastasis, and poor prognosis in patient breast tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charafe-Jauffret et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marcato et al., 2011</xref>); consequently, low expression levels of CLOCK in ALDH-positive 4T1 cells likely promote their malignant properties by regulating ALDH activity. C/EBPα was identified as a mediator of CLOCK-induced ALDH suppression. Reports suggest that upregulation of C/EBPα contributes suppression of breast tumors through induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lourenço and Coffer, 2017</xref>). These tumor-suppressive effects may also correlate with repressing the transcription of <italic>Aldh3a1</italic>. However, further investigation is required to evaluate whether this CLOCK-induced ALDH suppression can be generalized to all types of cancer cells because the function of C/EBPα is altered by organs, differentiation state of cells, and transcriptional co-regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lourenço and Coffer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ossipow et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramji and Foka, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The circadian clock genes are ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, generating circadian oscillations of numerous biological processes at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zvonic et al., 2006</xref>). The molecular oscillations underlying the generation of circadian rhythms develop gradually during ontogenesis. Oscillation in the expression of clock genes is not detected in immature cells such as mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yagita et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, the expression of CLOCK is decreased in mouse embryos, and increasing CLOCK expression during development is considered to be important for normal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Umemura et al., 2017</xref>). We previously reported that oscillations of clock genes were dampened in ALDH-positive 4T1 cells compared with those in ALDH-negative cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsunaga et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we also observed a decrease in expression of CLOCK mRNA and protein in ALDH-positive 4T1 cells in vivo and in vitro, with lower expression decreasing E-box-mediated transcriptional activity. Increased CLOCK expression by lentiviral transduction enhanced oscillation of E-box-mediated reporter luciferase ﻿bioluminescence in ALDH-positive 4T1 cells. It is difficult to distinguish the role of CLOCK in the regulation of ALDH expression from its role in the molecular circadian machinery; however, dampened rhythm of clock gene expression in ALDH-positive 4T1 cells may contribute to their stem-like properties. Further studies are required to investigate the relationship between enhanced oscillation of circadian gene expression and attenuation of cancer malignancy.</p><p>The malignancy of CSCs is altered depending on their differential states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bisson and Prowse, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xiong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tampaki et al., 2017</xref>).

In addition to pluripotent marker genes, enhanced expression of CLOCK in 4T1 cells altered the expression of genes to suppress EMT; this may explain the underlying mechanism of attenuation of invasive potential in enhanced CLOCK-expressing 4T1 cells. Cancer cells undergo EMT in response to different environmental conditions, causing a functional and phenotypical transition of polarized epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells. Mesenchymal transcriptional factors such as <italic>Snail1</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> promote CSC-like phenotypes, resulting in resistance to treatment, cancer recurrence, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ren et al., 2016</xref>). Increased levels of <italic>Nanog</italic> can also generate mesenchymal-like cells by repressing the expression of <italic>E-cadherin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Siu et al., 2013</xref>). The prevention of EMT by altered gene expression in enhanced CLOCK-expressing 4T1 cells may contribute to the attenuation of CSC-like properties. 4T1 cells are reported metastasize to lung, liver, brain, and bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pulaski and Ostrand‐Rosenberg, 2000</xref>). 4T1 is lung tropic cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Monteran et al., 2020</xref>); thus, metastatic colonies were detected mainly from lung in this study. Only few tumor colonies were detected except for bone at this stage. To evaluate the effect of CLOCK expression on metastatic capacities to multiple organs, further investigations are also needed to employ several cancer cells.</p><p>Reporter gene analysis revealed that the downregulation of CLOCK in ALDH-positive 4T1 cells is caused by post-transcriptional suppression through binding of miR-182 to the 3’UTR of <italic>Clock</italic> mRNA. miR-182 is associated with organ development, T cell differentiation, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stittrich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2007</xref>), and belongs to a polycistronic miRNA cluster with miR-96 and miR-183 located within a 4-kbp area in the murine genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). The sequence of miR-96 and miR-183 in the cluster was not affected by genomic deletion of miR-182, but their expression levels were compensatory increased in miR-182 KO 4T1 cell #1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Despite an increase in miR-96 and miR-183 levels, the deletion of miR-182 increased the expression of CLOCK and decreased tumor growth. Hence, miR-182 plays a major role in tumor biology and the post-transcriptional regulation of CLOCK. The polycistronic cluster of miR-96/miR-182/miR-183 is highly conserved in sequence and functions between humans and mice, and also the 3’UTR sequence of human <italic>CLOCK</italic> gene around miR-182 binding site is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). High miR-182 levels in human breast tumor tissue correlate with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guttilla and White, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lei et al., 2014</xref>), which suggest clinical importance of miR-182 for cancer patient’s prognosis.</p><p>Patients with early breast cancers are considered to have a good prognosis; however, aggressive breast cancers, such as TNBCs, are more serious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dent et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luo et al., 2013</xref>). BCSCs are possible therapeutic targets for better prognosis, but standard treatments targeting BCSCs are not available. The tumor microenvironment may be responsible for several malignant properties like recurrence, metastasis, and resistance to treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharyya et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meads et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shah et al., 2015</xref>), and studies reveal that these malignant properties are caused at the molecular level, with the interaction between BCSCs and the microenvironment also associated with tumor malignancy. Therefore, efforts to develop novel therapy targeting molecules responsible for the interaction between BCSCs and the microenvironment are underway. However, the complicated molecular interactions make drug development targeting BCSCs difficult; hence, a comprehensive understanding of BCSC biology is crucial for improvements in breast cancer therapy. The present study provides novel insights to attenuate cancer stemness by regulating the expression of circadian clock genes. The amino acid sequence and function of CLOCK are highly conserved among species; thus, similar effects can be expected in human malignant breast cancers. However, both tumor-promotional and tumor-suppressive relevance are existing between CLOCK expression and outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). To assess the true relevance to patient prognosis, evaluation of CLOCK expression levels in CSCs may be needed.</p><p>Existing agents increasing the expression of CLOCK may be ineffective for the treatment of CSCs as they increase the levels of CLOCK protein through transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Solt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sulli et al., 2018</xref>). Antisense oligonucleotides can be a powerful tool for targeting miRNAs, with high affinity to their target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scharner and Aznarez, 2021</xref>). Several issues still exist for the development of these antisense therapeutics because of their pharmacokinetics and stabilities.

Using these technologies, selective targeting of the CLOCK 3’UTR as a novel treatment strategy for malignant breast cancers is needed in order to therapeutically activate the circadian clock genes in

The findings are interesting and the major conclusions are justified by the current work.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. In figure 1, the impact of high ALDH expression on the circadian rhythm needs to be included though has been previously reported.

Also, the post-transcription regulation by miR-182 was also revealed to further discover the upstream regulator of CLOCK and proposed that repression of miR-182 may be a potent avenue for breast cancer therapy. The authors employed 4T1 cell line and murine PDX model to study the impact of CLOCK on the expression of ALDH by measurement of several markers reflecting the stemness and proliferative and metastatic ability of breast cancer cells, thus explained one possible mechanism which associate the disruption of circadian rhythm with the stemness of BCSC. The topic was relative innovative as the field of relationship between circadian rhythm and tumor biology has attracted more intense interest recently. The whole study was logically designed and the amount of work completed by the authors is basically abundant to justify the conclusion. However, if further evaluation on the detailed mechanism of interaction between CLOCK and ALDH be supplemented would be more rigorous. Additionally, only miR-182 was evaluated for its clinical significance, the clinical data about the relationship between expression of CLOCK and ALDH and the outcome of patients is warranted.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1. On the cellular experiment level, the authors firstly transfected 4T1 cell with five candidate circadian gene, among which overexpression of CLOCK has the most prominent impact on decline of ALDH-positive cells. Thus, further studies were launched to examine the effect of CLOCK on ALDH expression level and transcription activity of CLOCK in ALDH-positive cells, explaining the negative regulation between CLOCK and ALDH. Also, CLOCK-transduced 4T1 cells were evaluated for its transcriptional level of 3 stemness-related genes and growth rate and spheroid formation ability was compared with mock-transduced cells, the results all indicate that high expression of CLOCK correlates with enhanced stemness property and proliferation rate of tumor cell. in vitro measurement of tumor cell migration was conducted to mimic and dynamically monitor the metastatic process by 3D cell culture chip and spheroid invasion assay, which are all fresh new measurement method that objectively reflect the decreased invasive potential of CLOCK-transduced cells, the metastatic capacity was quantified by testing the expression level of EMT process related genes. All of the above work is abundant to support the negative regulation of CLOCK on ALDH, along with the biological property of tumor cells.</p><p>2. Additional in vivo experiments were conducted with 4T1 bearing PDX murine model and the CLOCK-expressing group display increased growth rate and more pulmonary metastatic foci.</p><p>3. By comparing the difference in Luciferase mRNA level, the authors proved that the regulation of CLOCK expression is in a post-transcription manner by miRNA binding to 3'UTR of CLOCK gene instead of during the transcription process. Subsequently miRNA microarray analysis was conducted and miR-182 was assessed as the miRNA regulating CLOCK expression. Level of miR-182 is higher in ALDH-positive cells and knockout of which in ALDH-positive cells result in higher clock mRNA level, in vivo experiments also shown decreased malignancy in miR-182 knockout 4T1 cells. All of the above findings indicate the negative role of miR-182 on CLOCK expression and repression of miR-182 show promise for breast cancer treatment.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. The CLOCK expression level displays a negative correlation with ALDH, while the precise mechanism of CLOCK regulating ALDH or the interaction between CLOCK and ALDH are not mentioned.</p><p>2. Insufficient in vive experiment data regarding metastasis in different organs in figure 4 and figure 7, metastatic foci on other organs should be included to enrich the in vivo experiment data.</p><p>3. Clinical relevance of miR-182 was evaluated with data source from public database, however the impact of expression level of CLOCK and ALDH on outcome of patients was not mentioned, this part of data and analysis is important to prove the clinical significance.</p><p>Comments for authors:</p><p>1. The CLOCK expression level displays a negative correlation with ALDH, while the precise mechanism of CLOCK regulating ALDH or the interaction between CLOCK and ALDH are not mentioned. As is referred to in the paper CLOCK functions as transcription factor, figure out the regulation process of CLOCK on the transcription process of downstream structural genes, thus impact on ALDH expression would be more rigorous.</p><p>2. In figure 4 and figure 7, the in vivo study of 4T1 PDX model only contains pulmonary metastasis, bone and liver metastasis also constitute the major role in breast cancer metastasis, so metastatic foci on other organs should be included to enrich the in vivo experiment data.</p><p>3. Clinical relevance of miR-182 was evaluated with data source from public database, however the impact of expression level of CLOCK and ALDH on outcome of patients was not mentioned, this part of data and analysis is important to prove the clinical significance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript investigates functional role of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and Clock protein in breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs). The authors find a possible target: CLOCK, which should be repressed in high-ALDH-activity breast cancer 4T1 cells and abrogated tumor growth and invasive potential. A new microRNA, miR-182, was found for post-transcriptional regulation of CLOCK.</p><p>This study is of interest but it lacks depth so, if the authors are able to provide a more concrete and complete analysis, the paper should be accepted.</p><p>1. How many alleles were shown for the miR-182 CRISPR editing (Fig7), how was this obtained? Were the sequences of the indels in all alleles established? What effort was made to rule out off-target events? (e.g. sequencing of potential off target candidates).</p><p>2. In Page 6 lines 174, the promoter activity of CLOCK::Luc was detected. However, in the Figure 5A the mRNA level of luciferase was detected. It was confused for readers which method was used in Figure 5A?

The statistical description is preliminary. What statistics used was unknown in the Methods. How many replicates were not mentioned in the Figure Legend? Number of animals, animal sex were not mentioned in the Methods and Figure Legend.</p><p>4. Although it is empirically believed that the relevant processing does not affect the expression of internal reference genes such as GAPDH, in order to remind the rigor of the data, the authors should analyze the transcriptome of GAPDH under the conditions in the manuscript.</p><p>5. The results description and Discussion should be written more. ALDH should be more discussed.</p><p>6.

The data quality is high. And the findings are interesting and supporting data are solid.</p><p>Deregulation of the circadian in cancer cells is implicated in tumor malignancy. In this manuscript, Ogino et al. showed that repression of CLOCK regulates cancer-stemness in murine breast cancer cells. Their previous study demonstrated that the cells with high ALDH exhibit circadian oscillation. In this study, they demonstrated that the expression of CLOCK was repressed in high-ALDH cancer cells, and enhancement of CLOCK expression abrogated the stemness properties of cancer cells. Furthermore, miR-182 was identified to control the degradation of CLOCK mRNA. Knockout of miR-182 restored the expression of CLOCK, leading to decreased tumor growth.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Post-transcriptional repression of circadian component CLOCK regulates cancer-stemness in murine breast cancer cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Thus, we conducted further investigation about the suppressing mechanisms of ALDH activity induced by enhanced-CLOCK expression. CLOCK is a major transcriptional activator, so we assumed that there are some transcriptional repressors mediating <italic>Aldh3a1</italic> suppression. Analysis of the promoter region of <italic>Aldh3a1</italic> gene identified CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) as a mediator of CLOCK-induced ALDH suppression. Probably, the attenuation of malignant properties of 4T1 was not fully explained only by C/EBPα; however, this mediator should have important roles for this attenuation. These data were presented as Figure 2—figure supplement 1 of revised manuscript. Descriptions about these data were incorporated into Result and Discussion section as follows:</p><p>Result section (Page5, line132 – 140.)</p><p>“Database analysis of the mouse <italic>Aldh3a1</italic> gene upstream region led to identification of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) as a mediator of CLOCK-controlled expression of ALDH (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A).
