Comparison of sex determination and X-chromosome dosage compensation mechanisms between the closely related nematode species <italic>Caenorhabditis briggsae</italic> (<italic>Cbr</italic>) and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<italic>Cel</italic>) revealed that the genetic regulatory hierarchy controlling both processes is conserved, but the X-chromosome target specificity and mode of binding for the specialized condensin dosage compensation complex (DCC) controlling X expression have diverged. We identified two motifs within <italic>Cbr</italic> DCC recruitment sites that are highly enriched on X: 13 bp MEX and 30 bp MEX II. Mutating either MEX or MEX II in an endogenous recruitment site with multiple copies of one or both motifs reduced binding, but only removing all motifs eliminated binding in vivo. Hence, DCC binding to <italic>Cbr</italic> recruitment sites appears additive. In contrast, DCC binding to <italic>Cel</italic> recruitment sites is synergistic: mutating even one motif in vivo eliminated binding. Although all X-chromosome motifs share the sequence CAGGG, they have otherwise diverged so that a motif from one species cannot function in the other. Functional divergence was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro. A single nucleotide position in <italic>Cbr</italic> MEX can determine whether <italic>Cel</italic> DCC binds. This rapid divergence of DCC target specificity could have been an important factor in establishing reproductive isolation between nematode species and contrasts dramatically with the conservation of target specificity for X-chromosome dosage compensation across <italic>Drosophila</italic> species and for transcription factors controlling developmental processes such as body-plan specification from fruit flies to mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>C. briggsae</italic></kwd><kwd>X-chromosome dosage compensation</kwd><kwd>dna-binding motifs</kwd><kwd>molecular evolution</kwd><kwd>sex determination</kwd><kwd>condensin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Barbara J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM131845</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Barbara J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Regulatory hierarchies controlling sex determination and X-chromosome dosage compensation between closely-related nematode species are conserved, but X-chromosome target specificity for the condensin dosage compensation complex has diverged, thereby contributing to reproductive isolation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Comparative studies have shown that different facets of metazoan development exhibit remarkably different degrees of conservation across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carroll, 2008</xref>). At one extreme, homeobox-containing <italic>Hox</italic> genes and <italic>Wnt</italic>-pathway signaling genes play conserved roles in body plan formation (<italic>Hox</italic>) and cell-fate determination, neural patterning, or organogenesis (<italic>Wnt</italic>) across clades diverged by more than 600 million years (MYR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malicki et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Kumar and Darland, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rim et al., 2022</xref>). Distant orthologous genes within these ancestral pathways can substitute for each other. For example, both the mouse <italic>Small eye</italic> (<italic>Pax-6</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hill et al., 1991</xref>) and the fruit fly <italic>eyeless</italic> (<italic>ey</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Quiring et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halder et al., 1995</xref>) control eye morphogenesis and encode a transcription factor that includes a paired domain and a homeodomain. Ectopic expression of mouse <italic>Pax-6</italic> in different fruit fly imaginal disc primordia can induce morphologically normal ectopic compound eye structures on fruit fly wings, legs, and antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halder et al., 1995</xref>). Hence, at a deep level, eye morphogenesis is under related genetic and molecular control in vertebrates and insects, despite profound differences in eye morphology and mode of development.</p><p>At the other extreme are aspects of development related to sex. For example, chromosomal strategies to determine sexual fate in mice, fruit flies, and nematodes (XY or XO males and XX females or hermaphrodites) and the mechanism needed to compensate for the consequent difference in X-chromosome dose between sexes have diverged greatly. To balance X gene expression between sexes, female mice randomly inactivate one X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Loda et al., 2022</xref>), while male fruit flies double expression of their single X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Samata and Akhtar, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rieder et al., 2019</xref>), and hermaphrodite worms halve expression of both X chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meyer, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meyer, 2022b</xref>).</p><p>The divergence in these pathways is so great that comparisons among animals of the same genus can provide useful evolutionary context for understanding the developmental mechanisms that distinguish the sexes. Therefore, we determined the genetic and molecular specification of sexual fate and X-chromosome dosage compensation in the nematode <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and compared it to the wealth of knowledge amassed about these processes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. These two species have diverged by 15–30 MYR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cutter, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the sex determination and dosage compensation pathways are linked by genes that coordinately control both processes. For example, in XX embryos, the switch gene <italic>sdc-2</italic> sets the sex determination pathway to the hermaphrodite mode and triggers the binding of a DCC onto both X chromosomes to reduce X gene expression by half and thereby match X expression with that from XO males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meyer, 2022a</xref>). The DCC shares subunits with condensin, a protein complex that controls the structure, resolution, and segregation of mitotic and meiotic chromosomes from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yatskevich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meyer, 2022b</xref>).</p><p>We determined the extent to which the sex-specific gene regulatory hierarchy is conserved between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and the extent to which subunits of the <italic>C. briggsae</italic> DCC correspond to those of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> DCC. We also defined the <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory sites that confer X-chromosome specificity and recruit the <italic>C. briggsae</italic> DCC. We found that the DCC itself and the regulatory hierarchy that determines sex and directs the DCC to X have been conserved, but remarkably, both the X-chromosome target specificity of the <italic>C. briggsae</italic> DCC and its mode of binding to X have diverged.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conservation between <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> of the core dosage compensation machinery and genetic hierarchy that regulates dosage compensation</title><p>The pivotal hermaphrodite-specific regulatory protein that coordinately controls both <underline>s</underline>ex determination and <underline>d</underline>osage <underline>c</underline>ompensation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a 350 kDa protein called SDC-2.

The <italic>C. elegans</italic> dosage compensation complex (DCC) includes homologs of all core condensin subunits (MIX-1, DPY-27, DPY-26, DPY-28, and CAPG-1). <italic>C. briggsae</italic> DCC components identified and characterized in this study are shown in color; other orthologs are in gray. DPY-27 and MIX-1 belong to the SMC (<underline>S</underline>tructural <underline>M</underline>aintenance of <underline>C</underline>hromosomes) family of chromosomal ATPases. Each has nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) at its N- and C-termini that are linked by two long coiled-coil domains separated by a hinge domain. Each SMC protein folds back on itself to form a central region of two anti-parallel coiled coils flanked by the NBDs and the hinge. DPY-27 and MIX-1 dimerize through interactions between their hinge domains and their NBD domains. The globular NBDs bind to the three non-SMC condensin DCC subunits (DPY-26, DPY-28, and CAPG-1) (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meyer, 2022a</xref>).

Species that evolved self-fertilization (e.g. <italic>C. briggsae</italic> or <italic>C. elegans</italic>) lost 30% of their DNA content compared to male/female species (e.g. <italic>C. nigoni</italic> or <italic>C. remanei</italic>), with a disproportionate loss of male-biased genes, particularly the <italic>male secreted short</italic> (<italic>mss</italic>) gene family of sperm surface glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yin et al., 2018</xref>). The <italic>mss</italic> genes are necessary for sperm competitiveness in male/female species and are sufficient to enhance it in hermaphroditic species. Thus, sex has a pervasive influence on genome content.</p><p>In contrast to these later stages of sex determination and differentiation, the earlier stages of sex determination and differentiation had not been analyzed in <italic>C. briggsae</italic>. Therefore, we asked whether <italic>xol-1</italic> and <italic>sdc-2</italic> control sexual fate as well as dosage compensation in <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, as they do in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, over the 15–30 MYR that separates them. Our analysis of <italic>Cbr sdc-2</italic> XX mutant phenotypes revealed intersexual tail morphology in the rare animals that survived to the L3/L4 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating a role for <italic>Cbr sdc-2</italic> in sex determination. Sexual transformation to the male fate was unlikely to have resulted from a disruption in dosage compensation since such transformation was never observed in <italic>Cbr dpy-27</italic> XX mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Analysis of sexual phenotypes in double mutant strains confirmed that <italic>Cbr sdc-2</italic> controls sex determination. Specifically, <italic>Cbr xol-1 Cbr sdc-2</italic> double mutant XO animals develop as males, whereas <italic>Cbr dpy-27; Cbr xol-1</italic> double mutant XO animals develop as hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). That is, both <italic>Cbr sdc-2</italic> and <italic>Cbr dpy-27</italic> mutations suppress the XO lethality caused by a <italic>xol-1</italic> mutation, but only <italic>Cbr sdc-</italic>2 mutations also suppress the sexual transformation of XO animals into hermaphrodites. These results show that both <italic>sdc-2</italic> and <italic>dpy-27</italic> function in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> dosage compensation, but only <italic>sdc-2</italic> also functions in sex determination. Thus, the two master regulatory genes that control the earliest stages of both sex determination and X-chromosome dosage compensation, <italic>xol-1</italic> and <italic>sdc-2</italic>, are conserved between <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>DCC recruitment sites isolated from <italic>C. briggsae</italic> X chromosomes fail to bind the <italic>C. elegans</italic> DCC</title><p>Discovery that the dosage compensation machinery and the gene regulatory hierarchy that controls sex determination and dosage compensation are functionally conserved between <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> raised the question of whether the <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory sequences that recruit dosage compensation proteins to X chromosomes are also conserved. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the DCC binds to <underline>r</underline>ecruitment <underline>e</underline>lements on <underline>X</underline> (<italic>rex</italic>) sites and then spreads across X to sequences lacking autonomous recruitment ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Csankovszki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jans et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pferdehirt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albritton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>).

In the merged image, the array would appear yellow and the X chromosome would appear green. Often, an array carries enough copies of a <italic>rex</italic> site that it titrates most of the DCC from X, and only the array itself shows evidence of DCC binding, appearing yellow in the merged image. In that case, the X chromosome is not detectable by DPY-27 antibody staining.

SDC-2 and DPY-27 binding to autosomes was indistinguishable from that of the IgG control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). To determine whether DNA from these peaks acts as autonomous recruitment sites that confer X-chromosome target specificity to the dosage compensation process, we conducted DCC recruitment assays in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Assays were modeled on <italic>rex</italic> assays developed for <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fuda et al., 2022</xref>). Embryos carrying extrachromosomal arrays composed of multiple copies of DNA from a single ChIP-seq peak were stained with DPY-27 antibodies and a FISH probe to the array. DPY-27 localized to 80–90% of extrachromosomal arrays carrying DNA from each of the individual peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2A</xref>). In contrast, extrachromosomal arrays made from three regions of X lacking DCC binding in ChIP-seq experiments showed minimal recruitment (0–6% of nuclei with arrays) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2A</xref>). In strains with arrays comprised of <italic>Cbr</italic> DCC binding sites, the X chromosomes rarely exhibited fluorescent signal, because the arrays titrated the DCC from X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The titration was so effective that brood sizes of array-bearing hermaphrodites were very low, and hermaphrodite strains carrying arrays could not be maintained.

The advantage of this assay is that <italic>Cel</italic> SDC-2 is capable of binding to a single motif on an in vitro template, perhaps because that DNA lacks the competing binding of nucleosomes and general transcription factors that occurs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fuda et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We assayed <italic>Cel</italic> DCC binding to a <italic>Cel rex-39</italic> site with two <italic>Cbr</italic> MEX II motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>) and to the <italic>Cel rex-33</italic> site with the three <italic>Cbr</italic> MEX motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12F</xref>).

The extent of evolutionary changes in dosage compensation mechanisms between species diverged by only 15–30 MYR is in striking contrast to mechanisms that control somatic sex determination and differentiation in the same species. The master regulator of hermaphrodite sexual fate, TRA-1, is conserved between both species, as is its DNA target specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berkseth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zarkower and Hodgkin, 1992</xref>). Moreover, the divergence of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> dosage compensation mechanisms contrasts with the conservation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> dosage compensation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alekseyenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuzu et al., 2016</xref>) and the conservation of mechanisms controlling developmental processes such as body-plan specification and eye morphogenesis from fruit flies to mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malicki et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halder et al., 1995</xref>), which utilize highly conserved transcription factors and <italic>cis</italic>-acting DNA regulatory sequences.</p><p>Central to the dosage compensation machinery of both species is a specialized condensin complex. Here we identified two <italic>C. briggsae</italic> dosage compensation proteins (DPY-27 and MIX-1) that are orthologs of the SMC (structural maintenance of chromosome) subunits of condensin and bind to hermaphrodite X chromosomes. As in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lieb et al., 1998</xref>), mutation of <italic>dpy-27</italic> causes hermaphrodite-specific lethality in <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, and MIX-1 fails to bind X in the absence of DPY-27, consistent with both proteins acting in a complex. We also found that the hermaphrodite-specific <italic>Cbr sdc-2</italic> gene triggers binding of the condensin subunits to X and activates the hermaphrodite mode of sexual differentiation, as in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Mutation of <italic>Cbr sdc-2</italic> causes XX-specific lethality, and rare XX animals that escape lethality develop as masculinized larvae. SDC-2 and condensin subunits are prevented from binding to the single X of males by the action of <italic>xol-1</italic>, the master sex-determination gene that controls both sex determination and dosage compensation and triggers the male fate by repressing <italic>sdc-2</italic> function. Mutation of <italic>xol-1</italic> kills XO animals because the DCC assembles on the single male X, thereby reducing gene expression inappropriately. Mutations in <italic>sdc-2</italic> or <italic>dpy-27</italic> suppress the XO-specific lethality caused by <italic>xol-1</italic> mutations, but only mutations in <italic>sdc-2</italic> permit the rescued animals to develop as males. Just as in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, XO animals rescued by <italic>dpy-27</italic> mutations develop as hermaphrodites, consistent with <italic>dpy-27</italic> controlling only dosage compensation and <italic>sdc-2</italic> controlling both sex determination and dosage compensation. Hence, the two master regulators that control sexual fate and dosage compensation are functionally conserved between the two <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species, as is the condensin dosage compensation machinery.</p><p>In both species, SDC-2 recruits the condensin DCC subunits to X and is the likely protein to interact directly with X DNA. Despite their central roles in dosage compensation, these 350 kDa proteins lack homology to proteins outside of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>, and their only predicted structural feature is a coiled-coil region. Alignment of SDC-2 proteins in five <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species revealed only 23–29% identity and 38–45% similarity across the entire protein, with two regions that show greater conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2A</xref>). One region is N-terminal to the coiled-coil domain and shares 36–45% identity and 57–63% similarity. A second region resides in the C-terminal part of the protein and shows 24–32% identify and 39–51% similarity. Neither region, nor any segment of the protein, has a predicted DNA binding domain. The discovery of any such domain requires ongoing biochemical and structural analysis.</p><p>DCC condensin subunits have variable conservation across species, depending on whether they function only in the DCC or participate in other condensin complexes as well. DPY-27, the only condensin subunit specific to the DCC, has only limited conservation: 34% identity and 56% similarity across the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In contrast, DCC condensin subunit MIX-1, which also participates in the two condensin complexes required for mitotic and meiotic chromosome segregation, shows greater identity and similarity between both species: 55% and 72%, respectively. In comparison, SMC-4, an ortholog of DPY-27 and a conserved SMC chromosomal ATPase that interacts with MIX-1 in the mitotic and meiotic condensin complexes, but not in the DCC condensin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hagstrom et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Csankovszki et al., 2009</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mets and Meyer, 2009</xref>), shares even greater conservation between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, commensurate with its universal role in chromosome segregation: 62% identity and 76% similarity. Participation of MIX-1 and SMC-4 in condensin complexes dedicated to chromosome segregation constrains their divergence, thereby accounting for their higher conservation than DPY-27.</p><p>Although <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> have conserved DCC machinery, the DCC binding sites have diverged, as has their density on X. ChIP-seq analysis of <italic>C. briggsae</italic> SDC-2 and DPY-27 revealed twelve sites of binding on X that were validated by functional analysis in vivo as being strong autonomous recruitment (<italic>rex</italic>) sites. Even though the X chromosome of <italic>C. briggsae</italic> (21.5 Mb) is larger than the X of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (17.7 Mb), it has only one-fourth the number of recruitment sites. The <italic>C. briggsae</italic> sites are sufficiently strong that extrachromosomal arrays carrying multiple copies of a single site can titrate the DCC from X and cause dosage-compensation-defective phenotypes in XX animals, including death, as in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In contrast, extrachromosomal arrays of <italic>C. briggsae rex</italic> sites made in <italic>C. elegans</italic> fail to recruit the <italic>C. elegans</italic> DCC, and <italic>vice versa</italic>, indicating that <italic>rex</italic> sites have diverged between the two species. As a more rigorous test of divergence, individual <italic>C. briggsae rex</italic> sites were inserted in a single copy into <italic>C. elegans</italic> X chromosomes and assayed for <italic>Cel</italic> DCC binding. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> DCC failed to bind to the five <italic>C. briggsae rex</italic> sites inserted into <italic>C. elegans</italic> X chromosomes.</p><p>Not only have the <italic>rex</italic> sites diverged, the mechanism by which the Cbr DCC binds to X motifs differs from that of the <italic>Cel</italic> DCC. We identified two motifs within <italic>C. briggsae rex</italic> sites that are highly enriched on X, the 13 bp MEX motif and the 30 bp MEX II motif. Mutating one copy of either motif in endogenous <italic>rex</italic> sites with multiple motifs reduced binding, but significant binding still occurred at the sites. Binding was eliminated only when all motifs were removed. Hence, DCC binding to motifs in <italic>C. briggsae rex</italic> sites appears additive. In contrast, mutating one motif in <italic>C. elegans rex</italic> sites that have multiple different combinations of motifs reduced binding to nearly the same extent as mutating all motifs, indicating synergy in <italic>C. elegans</italic> DCC binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fuda et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Additional factors, such as yet-unidentified DNA binding proteins might alter the specificity of DCC binding between species as well as aid DCC binding at <italic>Cbr rex</italic> sites. Precedent exists in the homeodomain family of Hox DNA binding proteins that have remarkably similar DNA specificities for DNA binding in vitro but a wide range of specificities in vivo due to interactions with heterologous cofactors required for functional specificities, such as Pbx-Hox complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>The need for synergy in DCC binding to <italic>Cel rex</italic> sites is likely caused by competition between DCC binding and nucleosome formation, since nucleosomes preferentially bind to <italic>rex</italic> sites when DCC binding is precluded by mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fuda et al., 2022</xref>). The status of nucleosomes on <italic>C. briggsae</italic> X chromosomes remains to be determined. Although a single MEX or MEX II motif enables some DCC binding to a <italic>Cbr rex</italic> site, equivalent motifs on X that are not in <italic>rex</italic> sites appear to lack DCC binding. Nucleosome formation may preclude DCC binding at those motifs. The X may have a paucity of DNA-binding proteins that interact with core histones and open compacted chromatin to enable DCC binding.</p><p>Although the X-chromosome motifs of both species share the core consensus sequence CAGGG, the motifs have diverged such that they function in only one species. This functional divergence was demonstrated through DCC binding studies in vivo and in vitro to <italic>C. elegans rex</italic> sites engineered with <italic>C. briggsae</italic> motifs substituted for <italic>C. elegans</italic> motifs. We replaced the two MEX II motifs in the endogenous C. <italic>elegans rex-39</italic> site with <italic>C. briggsae</italic> MEX II motifs and the three MEX motifs in <italic>Cel rex-33</italic> with <italic>Cbr</italic> MEX motifs while maintaining motif spacing appropriate for <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We found negligible <italic>C. elegans</italic> DCC binding in vivo and in vitro. A feature of the in vitro assay is that <italic>Cel</italic> SDC-2 is capable of binding to a single motif on a DNA template, likely because the DNA lacks competing binding of nucleosomes that occurs in vivo. If either <italic>Cbr</italic> MEX II or MEX motif were functional in <italic>C. elegans</italic> we would have detected binding.</p><p>While the MEX II motif has diverged sufficiently that evolutionary tracing is difficult, the divergence of MEX motifs provides important insight into their evolution. A major difference in MEX motifs between the two species is the preference for a guanine instead of a cytosine two nucleotides 5' of the conserved CAGGG sequence. We demonstrated that converting that C to G in the three <italic>Cel</italic> MEX motifs of <italic>Cel rex-33</italic> eliminated DCC binding in vitro. Conversely, replacing the G nucleotide in each <italic>Cbr</italic> MEX motif inserted into <italic>Cel rex-33</italic> with a C nucleotide partially restored <italic>Cel</italic> DCC binding in vivo and in vitro, indicating that the single nucleotide change can be important in the evolutionary divergence of this motif. The evolutionary C-to-G substitution in the <italic>Cbr</italic> MEX motif is sufficient to prevent it from functioning in the closely related <italic>C. elegans</italic> species.</p><p>In contrast to the divergence of X-chromosome target specificity between <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species, X-chromosome target specificity has been conserved among <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. A 21 bp GA-rich sequence motif on X is utilized across <italic>Drosophila</italic> species to recruit the dosage compensation machinery, although it may not be the sole source of X target specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alekseyenko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuzu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ellison and Bachtrog, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alekseyenko et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Conservation of DNA target specificity among species is also a common theme among developmental regulatory proteins that participate in multiple, unrelated developmental processes, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dorsal in the body-plan specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schloop et al., 2020</xref>) or <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> TRA-1 in hermaphrodite sexual differentiation and male neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berkseth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bayer et al., 2020</xref>). Typically, for such multi-purpose proteins, target-site specificity is evolutionarily constrained: protein function is changed far more by changes in the number and location of conserved <italic>cis</italic>-acting target sequences than by changes in the target sequences themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carroll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nitta et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, the divergence in X-chromosome target specificity across the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus is atypical among developmental regulatory complexes with highly diverse target genes and could have been an important factor for establishing reproductive isolation between species. Our finding is reminiscent of the discovery that centromeric sequences and their corresponding centromere-binding proteins have co-evolved rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Malik and Henikoff, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Henikoff et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Talbert and Henikoff, 2022</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see below, the reviewers bring up a number of points to be addressed. The two main points they agreed on concern the lack of information on the evolution of the proteins themselves (SDC-2 and DCC), as well as a lack of broader context (comparison with other comparative work on DCC and more discussion of the impact of the finding for hybrid incompatibilities and speciation). We expect that you will be able to address these and the other points without too much difficulty.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Antibody validation: the authors raised antibodies against Cbr DPY-27 and MIX-1 that they use for immunostaining. Some additional form of validation of the specificity of the antibodies would be necessary, preferably by western blotting to see the correct protein sizes and their depletion in the respective mutants.</p><p>2. Related to the experiments shown in Figures 1 and 2, in which the authors study DCC localization by immunostaining in various mutants, I would recommend the authors be more precise about what is the effect of certain mutations on the &quot;localization&quot; of other DCC components. For example, the authors state that MIX-1 did not localize to X in dpy-27 mutants (line 101), but we don't know whether the lack of signal is due to mislocalization or perhaps MIX-1 is unstable in the absence of DPY-27. Similarly, the explanation of the effects of mutations in xol-1 and SDC-2 could be more precise. The authors use &quot;localization&quot; to describe most of the effects, but in some cases, it seems that the effects of some of the studied mutations are likely to be on expression or stability. If the antibodies raised work well in western blots, it would enable the authors to refine their statements (for SDC-2 they could use their flag-tagged allele). If this is not feasible, the statements in the text should reflect the possible reasons for a lack of signal in the immunostaining.</p><p>3. SDC-2 alignments across various Caenorhabditis sp. in comparison with alignments (or % identity and similarity) of other DCC-related proteins. If SDC-2 is the contact with DNA, it may be expected to vary more than other structural components. The similarity between Cbr and Cel SDC-2 proteins seems intuitively low, which could support this idea, but it would be good to know the average conservation between proteins in these two species, and the specific conservation of other proteins in the DCC machinery.</p><p>4. DCC composition in Cbr: the authors immunoprecipitated DPY-27 and performed mass spectrometry, but they only focus on the fact that they detected MIX-1 peptides. It would be informative to show the complete mass spectrometry results or at least comment on which other subunits are or are not detected. Is SDC-2 detected?</p><p>5. The length of the rex sites used for different experiments is not always obvious, it would be helpful to specify this in the figures and legends. For example, Figure 6, suppl. 1A has no length information on the x-axis.</p><p>6. More detailed information on how rex sites were defined seems to be missing. I could not find specific thresholds or criteria to define a rex site. This is important to note (and possibly discuss further) as for example, the two sites defined as rex-11 and -12 do not have any of the motifs that the authors argue are necessary and sufficient to recruit DCC. Also, there is a site between rex-2 and rex-8 that seems like it could have been called a rex site (from Figure 4A), but it is not. It would also be important to show the binding patterns of SDC-2 and DPY-27 on the autosomes in a supplemental figure. There is no mention in the text or figures of how much binding is observed on the other chromosomes.</p><p>7. The authors study the binding of DCC to rex sites in different manners. One is an array-based assay in which the authors report whether the array carrying combinations of wt or mutant sequence motifs is able to recruit DPY-27 (as a proxy for DCC binding), shown in Figure 8, suppl 1. In this assay, the authors report the % of nuclei that bind DPY-27 or not and show that losing only the MEX II motif or the MEX motifs, leaving the other motifs intact, reduces the % of nuclei with the signal. But this seems like an unintuitive result for this experiment given their claims that binding to these motifs is additive in Cbr. Shouldn't one expect that most arrays would still recruit DCC, but to a reduced level? In particular given that these arrays contain up to hundreds(?) of copies of the binding site, how do the authors rationalize these observations with their other results?</p><p>8. Given that the authors have ChIP-seq data for DCC components in Cel and Cbr, I wonder if they can gain further support for their additive vs. synergistic modes of action by analyzing binding over the whole genome of individual MEX or MEXII motifs.</p><p>9. The effects of the single C-G substitution between sites are relatively weak. I would suggest the authors reflect this better in the text, toning down the emphasis on the single nucleotide change in all sections where this is discussed. It is an interesting observation but although this seems to contribute, is clearly not enough to explain the differences in binding between the two species.</p><p>10. I would recommend the authors discuss the possible implications of the two different modes of binding. This should have an impact on the specificity of DCC recruitment, and if it doesn't, it would be interesting to think about why not. I guess this is related to points 6 and 7 as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In its current form, however, the manuscript fails to highlight the impact of that discovery.</p><p>In the introduction and the conclusion, the authors contrast their findings with the strong conservation of developmental genes (Hox, Wnt, etc.) throughout evolution. This comparison is not really relevant here, and again, the authors should relate more to the work of M. Lynch, H. Malik, S. Henikoff, D. Barbash, etc.</p><p>Along the same line, if the rex sites have evolved so fast, one might expect that the proteins of the DCC have also evolved fast. The conservation between the orthologs between the two nematode species appears quite low (compared to other proteins) but this aspect of the comparison is not well documented.</p><p>On Line #66 for instance, the authors mention that SDC-2 has &quot;no homologs outside nematodes&quot;..it seems it is also poorly conserved within nematodes. In general, it would be important to know the sequence conservation with other nematodes. Although I do not necessarily request a dN/dS analysis on the evolution of these proteins, having at least an idea of their conservation would be informative.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85413.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see below, the reviewers bring up a number of points to be addressed.

For DPY-27, the blot shows DPY-27 bands in wild-type adult XX hermaphrodites (lane 1), in adult XX hermaphrodites encoding a 3xFLAG-tagged version of DPY-27 (lane 2), and in mutant adult XX hermaphrodites carrying the <italic>dpy-27(y436)</italic> allele (lane 3).</p><p>(A) The DPY-27 antibody recognizes the full-length wild-type DPY-27 protein, a 3xFLAGtagged protein expected to be 3 kDa larger than the wild-type protein, and a mutant protein expected to be 20 kDa shorter than the wild-type protein if translation starts at the internal start codon at position 179, just after the <italic>y436</italic> deletion endpoint. Proteins ran somewhat slower on the PAGE-SDS gels than expected for the calculated molecular weights, but the bands correspond to the appropriate relative molecular weights calculated for the three proteins: 179 kDa for the wild-type protein, 182 kDa for the 3xFLAG-tagged protein, 159 kDa for the mutant protein. The <italic>dpy-27(y436)</italic> mutant lane also shows a faint band at the size expected for the wild-type protein, likely because homozygous <italic>dpy-27(y436)</italic> mutant adults were picked from a plate of <italic>dpy-27(y436)</italic>/+ mothers, and contaminating +/+ or +/<italic>y436</italic> larvae or embryos might have adhered to Dpy adults that were picked.</p><p>(B) The MIX-1 western shows a very prominent band of appropriate molecular weight for MIX1 (139 kDa).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

If this is not feasible, the statements in the text should reflect the possible reasons for a lack of signal in the immunostaining.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we included new confocal images to clarify more completely the effect of mutations on DPY-27 and MIX-1 binding in vivo (Figure 1D,F).

SDC-2 alignments across various Caenorhabditis sp. in comparison with alignments (or % identity and similarity) of other DCC-related proteins. If SDC-2 is the contact with DNA, it may be expected to vary more than other structural components. The similarity between Cbr and Cel SDC-2 proteins seems intuitively low, which could support this idea, but it would be good to know the average conservation between proteins in these two species, and the specific conservation of other proteins in the DCC machinery.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we included a new figure that summarizes conservation of SDC-2 (Figure 1-—figure supplement 2A) and DPY-27 (Figure 1-—figure supplement 2B) across the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus.</p><p>For SDC-2, we comment on the degree conservation in both the Results section (page 5, first paragraph) and in the Discussion section (page 19, last paragraph).

A second region resides in the C-terminal part of the protein and shows 24%-32% identify and 39-51% similarity.

DPY-27, the only condensin subunit specific to the DCC, has only limited conservation: 34% identity and 56% similarity across the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). In contrast, DCC condensin subunit MIX-1, which also participates in the two condensin complexes required for mitotic and meiotic chromosome segregation, shows greater identity and similarity between both species: 55% and 72%, respectively. In comparison, SMC-4, an ortholog of DPY-27 and a conserved SMC chromosomal ATPase that interacts with MIX-1 in the mitotic and meiotic condensin complexes, but not in the DCC condensin complex (Hagstrom <italic>et al.,</italic> 2002, Csankovszki <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009 and Mets and Meyer, 2009), shares even greater conservation between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, commensurate with its universal role in chromosome segregation: 62% identity and 76% similarity. Participation of MIX-1 and SMC-4 in condensin complexes dedicated to chromosome segregation constrain their divergence, thereby accounting for their higher conservation than DPY27.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. DCC composition in Cbr: the authors immunoprecipitated DPY-27 and performed mass spectrometry, but they only focus on the fact that they detected MIX-1 peptides. It would be informative to show the complete mass spectrometry results or at least comment on which other subunits are or are not detected. Is SDC-2 detected?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we included an expanded section on the immunoprecipitation analysis using DPY-27 antibodies in the Materials and methods (page 25, last paragraph) and also in the legend to Figure 1--table supplement 1.

Analysis was performed on proteins within the molecular weight range expected for condensin subunits. In addition to MIX-1 peptides, MALDI-TOF analysis revealed peptides from four common high-molecular weight contaminants in immunoprecipitation experiments (Figure 1--table supplement 1): the three vitellogenin yolk proteins VIT-2, VIT4, VIT-5 and CBG14234, an ortholog of VIT-4.

The length of the rex sites used for different experiments is not always obvious, it would be helpful to specify this in the figures and legends. For example, Figure 6, suppl. 1A has no length information on the x-axis.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, the lengths of <italic>rex</italic> sites used for different experiments are explicitly stated in the legends or text for the relevant figures or tables.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. More detailed information on how rex sites were defined seems to be missing. I could not find specific thresholds or criteria to define a rex site. This is important to note (and possibly discuss further) as for example, the two sites defined as rex-11 and -12 do not have any of the motifs that the authors argue are necessary and sufficient to recruit DCC. Also, there is a site between rex-2 and rex-8 that seems like it could have been called a rex site (from Figure 4A), but it is not. It would also be important to show the binding patterns of SDC-2 and DPY-27 on the autosomes in a supplemental figure. There is no mention in the text or figures of how much binding is observed on the other chromosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript clarifies the discovery and analysis of Cbr <italic>rex</italic> sites (page 10).</p><p>&quot;A consistent set of twelve large, overlapping SDC-2 ChIP-seq peaks and DPY-27 ChIP-seq peaks emerged from the studies (Figure 4A), representing less than one-fourth the number of DCC peaks than on the <italic>C. elegans</italic> X chromosome, which is smaller (17.7 Mb for <italic>Cel</italic> vs. 21.5 Mb for <italic>Cbr</italic>). SDC-2 and DPY-27 binding to autosomes was indistinguishable from that of the IgG control (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B). To determine whether DNA from these peaks act as autonomous recruitment sites that confer X-chromosome target specificity to the dosage compensation process, we conducted DCC recruitment assays in vivo (Figure 4B). Assays were modeled on <italic>rex</italic> assays developed for <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Materials and methods and Fuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). Embryos carrying extrachromosomal arrays composed of multiple copies of DNA from a single ChIP-seq peak were stained with DPY-27 antibodies and a FISH probe to the array. DPY-27 localized to 80-90% of extrachromosomal arrays carrying DNA from each of the individual peaks (Figure 4C and 4E and Figure 4—table supplement 1A). In contrast, extrachromosomal arrays made from three regions of X lacking DCC binding in ChIP-seq experiments showed minimal recruitment (0-6% of nuclei with arrays) (Figure 4E and Figure 4—table supplement 1A). In strains with arrays comprised of <italic>Cbr</italic> DCC binding sites, the X chromosomes rarely exhibited fluorescent signal, because the arrays titrated the DCC from X (Figure 4C). The titration was so effective that brood sizes of array-bearing hermaphrodites were very low, and hermaphrodite strains carrying arrays could not be maintained. Thus, the twelve high-occupancy <italic>Cbr</italic> DCC binding sites identified by ChIP-seq were named recruitment elements on X (<italic>rex</italic> sites) (Table 1), like the <italic>C. elegans</italic> DCC binding sites, due to their ability to recruit the DCC when detached from X.&quot;</p><p>Note, in the revised manuscript (Figure 4-—figure supplement 1B), we added the ChIP-seq profiles for both SDC-2 and DPY-27 on chromosome V to emphasize that the autosomal DCC signal is indistinguishable from that of the IgG control on autosomes.</p><p>Regarding the usage of motifs to recruit the DCC to rex sites, we state the following in the legend to Table 1, which lists the motifs in <italic>rex</italic> sites:</p><p>“MEX and MEX II are not likely to be the only DNA sequence features within res sites that contributing to DCC binding, since rex-11 and rex-12 lack these motifs with ln(P) values &lt; – 12.”</p><p>Regarding the small ChIP-seq peak between <italic>rex-2</italic> and <italic>rex-8</italic>, the degree of signal was variable across replicates and was not pursued further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors study the binding of DCC to rex sites in different manners. One is an array-based assay in which the authors report whether the array carrying combinations of wt or mutant sequence motifs is able to recruit DPY-27 (as a proxy for DCC binding), shown in Figure 8, suppl 1. In this assay, the authors report the % of nuclei that bind DPY-27 or not and show that losing only the MEX II motif or the MEX motifs, leaving the other motifs intact, reduces the % of nuclei with the signal. But this seems like an unintuitive result for this experiment given their claims that binding to these motifs is additive in Cbr. Shouldn't one expect that most arrays would still recruit DCC, but to a reduced level? In particular given that these arrays contain up to hundreds(?) of copies of the binding site, how do the authors rationalize these observations with their other results?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have any control or knowledge of the copy number of <italic>rex</italic> sites that get included into extrachromosomal arrays. However, if the amount of DCC in a cell is not limiting, we expect to see a difference in the number of nuclei (arrays) recruiting the DCC if we reduce the number of motifs in a <italic>rex</italic> site compared to the number in wild-type sites. We do not see a contradiction in our array vs. ChIP-seq/ChIP-qPCR experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Given that the authors have ChIP-seq data for DCC components in Cel and Cbr, I wonder if they can gain further support for their additive vs. synergistic modes of action by analyzing binding over the whole genome of individual MEX or MEXII motifs.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 7 of the original manuscript displayed the X vs. autosome binding profile for SDC2 at MEX (Figure 7C) and MEX II (Figure 7D) motifs. Abundant SDC-2 binding was found at MEX and MEX II motifs in <italic>rex</italic> sites, but negligible SDC-2 binding was found at individual MEX or MEX II motifs on X that were not in <italic>rex</italic> sites or at MEX or MEX II motifs on autosomes. Hence, the additive vs. synergistic modes of DCC binding would need to be explored by other means to gain more understanding.</p><p>The Discussion does comment about the difference in binding modes between species (page 21):</p><p>“The need for synergy in DCC binding to <italic>Cel rex</italic> sites is likely caused by competition between DCC binding and nucleosome formation, since nucleosomes preferentially bind to <italic>rex</italic> sites when DCC binding is precluded by mutations (Fuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). The status of nucleosomes on <italic>C. briggsae</italic> X chromosomes remains to be determined. Although a single MEX or MEX II motif enables some DCC binding to a <italic>Cbr rex</italic> site, equivalent motifs on X that are not in <italic>rex</italic> sites appear to lack DCC binding. Nucleosome formation may preclude DCC binding at those motifs. The X may have a paucity of DNA-binding proteins that interact with core histones and open compacted chromatin to enable DCC binding.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The effects of the single C-G substitution between sites are relatively weak. I would suggest the authors reflect this better in the text, toning down the emphasis on the single nucleotide change in all sections where this is discussed. It is an interesting observation but although this seems to contribute, is clearly not enough to explain the differences in binding between the two species.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Results (pages 17-18), we explain that the C4G substitution is important and why:</p><p>&quot;In contrast to the many nucleotide changes that mark the difference between MEX II motifs in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> versus <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the MEX motifs are strikingly similar in nucleotide composition and core CAGGG sequence between species (Figure 6). A significant change between the consensus MEX motifs is the substitution in <italic>Cbr</italic> MEX of a guanine for the cytosine in <italic>Cel</italic> MEX located two nucleotides 5' from the CAGGG core of both motifs (Figure 13A). That C4G transversion was never found in a functional <italic>Cel</italic> MEX motif in vivo or in vitro<italic>.</italic> Morevoer, a C4G change in either the MEX motif of endogenous <italic>Cel rex-1</italic> or in an in vitro <italic>Cel</italic> DNA template reduced binding to the level of of a <italic>rex-1</italic> deletion or negative control lacking a MEX motif (Fuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). Hence, the <italic>Cel</italic> DCC would be unable to bind to any <italic>Cbr</italic> MEX motif with C4G. In principle, that single cytosine-to-guanine transversion could be a critical evolutionary change in MEX motifs that render the motifs incapable of binding the DCC from the other species. To test this hypothesis, we made the C4G transversion in each of the three MEX motifs within the endogenous <italic>Cel rex-33</italic> site (Figure 13B). <italic>Cel</italic> SDC-3 binding in vivo to the C4G-substituted <italic>Cel rex-33</italic> site was reduced to the same level of binding as that at the <italic>Cel rex-33</italic> site with all three <italic>Cel</italic> MEX motifs scrambled, confirming the functional significance of the nucleotide substitution between species (Figure 13B). Our in vitro assay comparing <italic>Cel</italic> SDC-2 binding to the C4G-substituted and the MEX-scrambled <italic>Cel rex-33</italic> DNA templates produced the same negative result (Figure 13C).</p><p>If the evolutionary transversion of that C to G between <italic>Cel</italic> and <italic>Cbr</italic> MEX motifs represents an important step in the divergence of motif function, then making a G-to-C change within the <italic>Cbr</italic> MEX motifs (G7C) inserted into <italic>Cel rex-33</italic> should enhance <italic>Cel</italic> DCC binding. The substitution would not be expected to restore <italic>Cel</italic> DCC binding fully, because other sequences within the <italic>Cbr</italic> motif contribute to a lower match to the <italic>Cel</italic> consensus sequence and hence lower <italic>Cel</italic> binding affinity. However, no other identified single nucleotide substitution within a known <italic>Cbr</italic> MEX motif besides C4G is expected to eliminate <italic>Cel</italic> DCC binding (Fuda <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022). Indeed, the G7C change to <italic>Cbr</italic> MEX within <italic>Cel rex-33</italic> increased the <italic>Cel</italic> SDC-3 binding in vivo by 4.2-fold and increased the specific <italic>Cel</italic> SDC-2 binding in vitro by 4.3-fold. The G7C change increased <italic>Cel</italic> SDC-3 binding in vivo to 18% of its binding at wild-type <italic>Cel rex-33</italic> (Figure 13B) and increased <italic>Cel</italic> SDC-2 binding in vitro to 44% of its the specific binding at the wild-type <italic>Cel rex-33</italic> template (Figure 13C)<italic>.</italic> Hence, the cytosine-toguanine transversion between MEX motifs of <italic>C. elegans</italic> versus <italic>C. briggsae</italic> is important for the functional divergence in motifs.&quot;</p><p>In the Discussion (page 22) we explain the following:</p><p>&quot;A major difference in MEX motifs between the two species is the preference for a guanine instead of a cytosine two nucleotides 5' of the conserved CAGGG sequence. We demonstrated that converting that C to G in the three <italic>Cel</italic> MEX motifs of <italic>Cel rex-33</italic> eliminated DCC binding in vitro. Conversely, replacing the G nucleotide in each <italic>Cbr</italic> MEX motif inserted into <italic>Cel rex-33</italic> with a C nucleotide partially restored <italic>Cel</italic> DCC binding in vivo and in vitro, indicating that the single nucleotide change can be important in the evolutionary divergence of this motif. The evolutionary C-to-G substitution in the <italic>Cbr</italic> MEX motif is sufficient to prevent it from functioning in the closely related <italic>C. elegans</italic> species.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. I would recommend the authors discuss the possible implications of the two different modes of binding.
