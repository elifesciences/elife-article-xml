One possible division of nucleotide sequence is that the predominant selective force on a particular nucleotide can be attributed to just one gene. While this arrangement has been observed in regions in which one gene is structured and the other is disordered, we sought to explore how overlapping genes balance constraints when both protein products are structured over the same sequence. We use a combination of sequence analysis, functional assays, and selection experiments to examine an overlapped region in HIV-1 that encodes helical regions in both Env and Rev. We find that functional segregation occurs even in this overlap, with each protein spacing its functional residues in a manner that allows a mutable non-binding face of one helix to encode important functional residues on a charged face in the other helix. Additionally, our experiments reveal novel and critical functional residues in Env and have implications for the therapeutic targeting of HIV-1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>overlapping genes</kwd><kwd>overprinting</kwd><kwd>Env</kwd><kwd>Rev</kwd><kwd>lentivirus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50AI150476</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frankel</surname><given-names>Alan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AI0605357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Safari</surname><given-names>Maliheh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The HIV proteins Env and Rev encode helices that overlap in the viral genome but alternate in functional importance so that the non-functional surface of one helix encodes the functional surface of the other.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>HIV-1 contains nine genes encoded within a relatively short genome of 10,000 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frankel and Young, 1998</xref>). Eight of these nine genes overlap with another on the DNA level and consequently encode protein products in different reading frames. HIV-1 Env overlaps with Vpu, Rev, and Tat, and some parts of Env overlap with both Rev and Tat. Despite the prevalence of overlapping genes, the evolution and function of overlapping genes remains understudied. However, evidence establishing the importance of overlaps continues to grow: the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has demonstrated the importance of identifying and studying overlapping reading frames, as many immune epitopes targeting canonical and non-canonical overlapping ORFs (open reading frames) have been identified in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nelson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weingarten-Gabbay et al., 2020</xref>;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finkel et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We previously showed that, in the case of the essential regulatory genes <italic>tat</italic> and <italic>rev</italic>, HIV-1 dedicates the nucleotide sequence to one protein or the other so that critical functional residues do not overlap with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandes et al., 2016</xref>). For <italic>tat</italic> and <italic>rev</italic>, this arrangement is possible because both proteins consist of functional motifs spaced by disordered linkers, and thus functional motifs of one protein can be encoded in regions that overlap with disordered linkers in the other. Although the vast majority of overlapped proteins are predicted to be disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rancurel et al., 2009</xref>) and thus have the potential for this arrangement, it is possible that some overlapped regions have more stringent structure and function requirements. Indeed, HIV-1 contains an intriguing overlapping region, between the Rev and Env genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), in which both protein segments are structured and functionally important. This region might represent a viral Achilles’ heel, vulnerable to therapeutic targeting, as the mutational landscape for escape mutations would be constrained by the simultaneous requirements of both proteins.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Organization of Rev NES/Env LLP-2 overlap.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genetic organization of the <italic>rev</italic>/<italic>env</italic> overlap.

A detailed annotation of this overlap depicts the overlap between the quasi-helical NES of Rev with the helical LLP-2 of Env. The ARM (arginine-rich motif, nuclear localization sequence), OD (oligomerization domain), and NES (nuclear export sequence) are other functional domains of Rev that overlap with Env-gp41 (cytoplasmic tail), including the KE (Kennedy epitope) and two lentiviral lytic peptide motifs (LLP-3 in addition to LLP-2).

Notably, Rev contains a quasi-helical nuclear export sequence (NES), that binds to the NES-binding groove of the host nuclear export factor Crm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fornerod et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Booth et al., 2014</xref>). Env is expressed as a polyprotein, composed of the gp120 surface and gp41 transmembrane proteins, which forms a trimeric viral envelope that mediates viral particle binding to cell entry receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Checkley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murphy et al., 2017</xref>). The cytoplasmic tail of gp41 is the most C-terminal portion of Env and is highly variable in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tedbury and Freed, 2015</xref>). In contrast to other retroviruses, lentiviruses such as HIV-1 have an extended cytoplasmic tail containing the Kennedy epitope (KE) followed by three membrane associated lentiviral lytic peptide motifs (LLP-1, LLP-2, and LLP-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Steckbeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). HIV-1 LLP-1, and LLP-2 contain highly conserved arginine and lysine residues that are involved in cation-π interactions and have been suggested to stabilize the cytoplasmic tail α-helical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murphy et al., 2017</xref>). LLPs are amphipathic α helices that embed in the virus membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Steckbeck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murphy et al., 2017</xref>). LLP-2 may be transiently exposed on the virus surface to interact with the gp41 core and regulate virus-cell membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murphy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Piai et al., 2020</xref>). A recent nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy study revealed that LLP-2 forms two amphipathic helices that wrap around the transmembrane domain of Env, arranging a ‘baseplate’ that supports the transmembrane domain and the rest of the Env trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Piai et al., 2020</xref>). Additional evidence suggests that the C-terminal tail makes critical contacts with the matrix protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfadhli et al., 2019</xref>) to facilitate Env incorporation into virions.</p><p>The Rev NES and a portion of the Env LLP-2 are encoded by the same nucleotides in the viral genome, with Env encoded in the +1 reading frame relative to Rev (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As both these domains have important functions in viral replication and are structured, they provide an ideal system to examine how viruses balance the evolution of these two genes with critical, overlapping structured motifs. Here, we perform conservation analyses, functional assays, and selection experiments to examine how the virus balances selection pressures within the Rev-Env overlap. Surprisingly, we find that functional residues are also segregated at the nucleotide level, as for the Rev-Tat overlap. In Rev-Env case, the two-dimensional segregation of nucleotides in the genome is mirrored in the three-dimensional functional surfaces of the proteins such that the nucleotides encoding a functional surface in the helix of one protein encode residues on the non-binding face of the overlapping helix. Furthermore, our analyses reveal three important charged residues on the charged surface of LLP-2 that are required for Env function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conservation of chemical properties in the Rev NES and Env LLP-2</title><p>The Rev NES (residues 75–83) binds to Crm1 using several critical hydrophobic residues and non-canonical prolines that change the helical register and position hydrophobic side chains on one face of the helix to fit within the NES recognition groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Güttler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The Env LLP-2 forms an amphipathic helix of about 33 amino acids long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eisenberg and Wesson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murphy et al., 2017</xref>) that spans residues 767–788 of Env (242–274 of gp41) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Nine of the LLP-2 residues (767–776) overlap with the quasi-helical Rev NES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mutating charged residues within LLP-2 or hydrophobic residues in the Rev NES negatively impacts viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Newman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Güttler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandes et al., 2016</xref>), prompting us to examine in detail the selective forces that guide the evolution of this overlapping region.</p><p>In order to measure the relative conservation of these regions within HIV patient sequences, we first downloaded curated alignments of the Los Alamos Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hiv.lanl.org/">hiv.lanl.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foley, 2013</xref>) and calculated Shannon entropies for each amino acid in both proteins within the NES/LLP-2 overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pan and Deem, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandes et al., 2016</xref>). Sites with low entropy (0=perfect conservation) indicate strong conservation of the amino acid in that particular protein, but it is impossible to determine if the observed conservation is simply driven by codon constraints imposed by the alternative frame. To compare the amino acid conservation of corresponding sites in both proteins, we grouped amino acids that share two nucleotides in the genome and plotted their entropies against one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Notably, the one site that contributes to both functional surfaces (H769 in Env and P76 in Rev) is relatively well conserved in both proteins whereas the one site that contributes to neither interface (L755 in Env and T82 in Rev) is weakly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Unexpectedly, two known essential Crm1-binding residues (L78 and L83) displayed low conservation (high entropy) in the Rev reading frame, but the consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) indicates that chemically conservative isoleucine substitutions are frequently found, thus explaining the high entropy. Moreover, entropy analysis using a reduced amino acid alphabet in which the chemically similar amino acids I/L/V are grouped produced low entropy values for all Crm1-binding residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The use of chemically conservative side chains to form critical contacts drastically increases the number of ‘synonymous’ codons (e.g. the six leucine codons can substitute with the three isoleucine codons with essentially equal fitness) and may reflect the kinds of interaction motifs that are most suited to evolve in constrained overlapping regions. The three charged residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; green dots) in LLP-2 were relatively strongly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) but showed lower conservation (high entropy) than the Rev NES-binding residues, suggesting that Rev may more greatly influence the selection of amino acids in the overlapping region.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Rev nuclear export sequence (NES) and Env LLP-2 conservation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Shannon entropies (low entropy = high conservation) from alignments of patient sequences (see panel B).

We individually randomized each of the LLP-2 residues in the endogenous <italic>env</italic> locus, creating 10 Env libraries that each represent 64 alleles (every possible codon). Next, we infected SupT1 cells at low MOI (multiplicity of infection) with each library individually and measured the change in allele frequencies after approximately six generations of viral spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Additionally, L771, which is surrounded by two positively charged arginines, displays a strong preference against charged residues. The Rev NES fitness landscape is consistent with many mutational studies, showing selection for large hydrophobic side chains (ILV) at each Crm1 contacting residue. The patient isolates do not show such a striking preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), perhaps reflecting constraints imposed by overlapping gene mutational paths (e.g. any transitional mutation from L to V would have to be fit in Rev and also in Env) or the existence of other in vivo pressures not captured in our experiments (e.g. immune or cell-type-specific responses).

We generated two double mutants with D773/R770 or D773/R772 changed to alanine (R1D→AA or R2D→AA) as well as the triple mutant (RRD→AAA) and found that mutation of R770 was particularly detrimental, in combination with D773 which is about one helical turn away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

It is interesting that substitution of both arginine with lysine is insufficient to maintain function or replication, and indeed the (RR→KK) mutant showed the most severe replication defect. It is possible that lysine substitutions might serve as a target for host restriction factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) or introduce ubiquitination sites leading to protein turnover. Regardless of the mechanism, the data suggest that these particular residues are subject to significant evolutionary constraints.

To better understand the extent of this constraint, we replaced residues 767–776 with glycines and serines (10GS) to create a flexible linker. As anticipated, the 10GS variant had no activity in the reporter assay and was unable to replicate even when D773 was reintroduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

The majority of overlaps between opposing critical residues mostly involve mutable wobble bases, with the sole exception being the Env H769/Rev P76 overlap. However, in this case Rev appears to be the major driver of evolution as mutation of P76 results in a severe loss of function whereas H769 appears to play a minor, supporting role in the function of the charged surface of LLP-2.

The high conservation of hydrophobic Crm1 contacts appears to dominate selection for the NES while maintaining sufficient sequence flexibility for LLP-2 to retain its structure. Indeed, the size of the Env cytoplasmic tail varies among different retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tedbury and Freed, 2015</xref>), and the loss of the tail is commonly observed when SIV is propagated in human cells, suggesting that both host and viral determinants influence the function and variability of this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kodama et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shimizu et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shacklett et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We previously found that overlapped genes (<italic>rev</italic> and <italic>tat</italic>) can segregate functionally important residues by having a disordered segment of one protein overlapped with an ordered segment of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandes et al., 2016</xref>). The present study shows that residues can functionally segregate even when both overlapping segments are structured. We probed residues in the Env gp41 LLP-2 that overlap with the Rev NES and compared the limits to which this domain can tolerate mutation to the already well-established mutational limits of Rev (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jayaraman et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that critical residues in both proteins are located on one face of a helix such that they are spaced periodically in alternative reading frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This arrangement is a consequence of the genetic code where the wobble bases of functionally critical codons in one reading frame can be chosen to accommodate critical residues in the alternative frame, while the first two codon bases overlap with more mutation-tolerant residues located on a non-binding surface of the overlapped protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Specifically, the important hydrophobic residues of the Rev NES are oriented on one surface toward the Crm1-binding groove, with consecutive prolines altering the helical register compared to other Crm1 cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Booth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jayaraman et al., 2019</xref>). The non-binding face of the NES helix is highly mutable and capable of sampling nearly every amino acid with roughly equal fitness. These highly mutable residues correspond to nucleotides that encode critical charged residues on the functional surface of gp41 LLP-2 in the alternative frame. Correspondingly, residues on the non-charged face of the LLP-2 helix minimally constrain codon usage of important Rev NES contact residues.</p><p>The striking segregation of function we observe for Env LLP-2/Rev NES is made possible by the atypical proline-rich NES and partially redundant function of the LLP-2 positive charges. This manner of segregation in HIV-1 is not necessarily the case for similarly overlapped regions in other lentiviruses, which appear to have different functional requirements based on their sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The findings are another indication of how efficiently HIV-1 makes use of its limited coding capacity.</p><p>Our results show that Env D773 is under strong selective pressure although the precise function of this residue is not known. In addition to this negative charge, positive charges positioned on the same face of the helix are also important.

The function of these charged residues in viral fusion or assembly remains to be determined.</p><p>We note that even in our model of functional segregation, two sites in Env overlapping portions of the Rev NES (Y768; overlapping Rev L75 and P76, and L771; overlapping Rev L78) do have mild amino acid preferences (Y768 for large hydrophobic/aromatic residues and L771 for non-polar residues). In our model, in which we weigh both the selection and reporter data together, we view these mild constraints as selection against disruptive interactions or sites which contribute (but are not essential to) overall protein stability. However, it is important to note that this assumption is based on data from a single genetic background and in other genomic contexts or selection backgrounds these mild selective pressures may in fact be more stringent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canale et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>HIV-1 has evolved in an elegant manner to balance the functions of overlapped proteins, however the strategy may also expose a weakness whereby immune targeting of the LLP-2 could provide a fruitful therapeutic route. The LLP-2 is transiently surface exposed on the cell membrane during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murphy et al., 2017</xref>), and the cytoplasmic tail can modulate the antigenic properties of Env as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Piai et al., 2020</xref>). Targeting of the LLP-2 surface with combinations of rationally designed immunotherapies may force the virus to mutate in ways that break the segregation between Env and Rev. Although our analysis of other lentiviruses suggests that HIV-1 might evolve other ways to establish Rev function under such pressure, it is likely that escape would still require multiple mutations and may be less likely in combination with other therapies. Deep mutational scanning has proven effective at mapping probable mutational escape pathways from immune pressures such as neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Starr et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greaney et al., 2021</xref>) and the Env cytoplasmic tail has proven to be a viable target in primate animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2020</xref>); for HIV-1 the combined knowledge of both functional constraints in the proteins and coding constraints in the genome may allow targeted immune therapies that drastically limit (or prevent altogether) escape mutations. Indeed, immune targeting of overlapped reading frames in in vivo models has been shown to drive predictable synonymous mutations in the alternative, non-targeted frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hughes et al., 2001</xref>). Similar approaches in this region of dual structure and function may provide a novel way of limiting HIV’s otherwise unpredictable mutational escape patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells</title><p>HEK 293 (obtained from ATCC) and TZM-bL cells (obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program) were maintained in humidified incubators at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM, high glucose (with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum [FBS], and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). SupT1 human T-cell lines (obtained from ATCC) were maintained in RPMI (supplemented with 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 10% heat-inactivated FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

For the Rev reporter assays, 293T cells in a 24-well plate were transfected with 250 ng of pCMV gagPol-RRE and 25 ng of a pcDNA4/TO 2xStrep NL4-3 Rev using PolyJet (SignaGen) reagent. Cells were lysed in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors, 48 hr after transfection, and intracellular p24 levels were measured by ELISA. The assay was performed in biological triplicate. For all mutants, activity was normalized to the unmutated reference activity. Rev expression levels were verified by Western blot using HRP-conjugated anti-StrepTagII antibody (IBA Biosciences) with GAPDH used as a loading control.</p><p>For Env reporter assays, the relative infectivity of Env pseudoviruses of LLP-2 mutants was measured in TZM-bl cells assay. To prepare HIV-1 Env pseudoviruses of LLP-2 mutants, 293T cells were co-transfected with pNL4-3 ΔEnv and an envelope expressing plasmid pcDNA4/TO Env. Pseudovirus containing culture supernatant was harvested 48 hr after transfection and concentrated by PEG purification (the final concentrations for PEG-6000 and NaCl were 8.5% (w/v) and 0.3 M, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kutner et al., 2009</xref>). The infectivity of mutants was determined by infecting TZM-bl cells with p24-normalized pseudoviruses. Forty-eight hours post-infection, luciferase activity of the reporter gene was quantified using Bright-Glo luciferase reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). Experiments were done in biological triplicate and relative infectivity was normalized to the unmutated reference infectivity. The incorporation of Env LLP-2 mutants into the pseudovirus was measured by Western blot using gp120 antibody and p24 as loading control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Viral replication assays</title><p>NL4-3 rev-in-nef proviral constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandes et al., 2016</xref>) were used to introduce mutations in the Rev NES or Env LLP-2 in non-overlapped contexts. For generation of each virus, HEK 293T cells in six-well plates were transfected with 1000 ng of NL4-3 proviral plasmid and complemented with reference Rev or Env using PolyJet (SignaGen) reagent at a 1:3 ratio of the DNA:Polyjet. Viral supernatants were harvested 48 hr after transfection, stored at −80°C, and then virus titer quantified by p24 capsid ELISA. One million SupT1 cells were incubated with 5 ng of p24 virus in 250 µl media containing 1 µg/ml PEI and 8 µg/ml polybrene and centrifuged 1200 <italic>g</italic> for 2 hr at 37°C. Input virus was removed and then washed cells with 250 µl of PBS. Cells were resuspended in 250 µl of media and placed in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Every 48–72 hr for 20 days, 100 µl of virus-containing supernatants were collected for quantification by p24 ELISA and added 100 µl of fresh media to cells. Viral p24 levels below 10 pg/ml are shown as 10 pg/ml in the plots.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Competitive deep mutational scanning analysis</title><p>The Rev NES fitness values were extracted from previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandes et al., 2016</xref>). Env LLP-2 proviral libraries were created as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandes et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, each of the 10 individual residues of Env LLP-2 that overlap with the Rev NES was randomized. For this purpose, this region was amplified using 10 separate pools of 33 nt primers containing NNN in the middle of the primer and using Gibson Assembly Master Mix (NEB) was cloned into pNL4-3 rev-in-nef after digesting by BamHI and XhoI. The proviral library of each residue was generated by scraping together at least 1000 colonies of each primer pool for plasmid purification. High codon diversity of each randomized proviral library (10 total) was confirmed by deep sequencing. Virus generation for each proviral plasmid library was done as described above in 293T cells. Selection assays were performed via spinoculation of one million SupT1 cells as above. The infections were examined by IFA for cellular HIV antigen synthesis and also by quantification of progeny virion release into supernatant using p24 ELISA. Once the infection reference or defective viral pools reach their peak, 150 µL of viral supernatant was collected and centrifuged to remove cells, and then RNA was extracted from virions by ZR-96 Viral RNA extraction kits (Zymo) and eluted in 15 µl water. cDNA was amplified from 5 µL of extracted RNA using the iScript Advanced (BioRad) cDNA synthesis. The selection experiment was performed in biological duplicate for each pool/residue. Samples were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq with PE100 and demultiplexed on instrument. Raw fastqs were aligned to the reference sequence with bowtie2 and the flags <monospace>--fast-local</monospace> <monospace>--rdg 100,3</monospace> <monospace>--rfg 100,3</monospace>. Codon and amino acid counts were generated via the countDMS program available on GitHub. These counts were then log2 normalized by fractions calculated from sequencing the input proviral plasmids to generate experimental fitness scores. The resulting fitness matrices were then processed and plotted using the ComplexHeatmap package in R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Entropy</title><p>Entropy values were calculated using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hiv.lanl.org/">hiv.lanl.gov</ext-link> ‘Entropy One’ tool and the 2018 filtered web alignments (amino acid) for Rev and Env, discounting ambiguous characters.

that encode two different proteins?&quot; To this end, they compare the functional constraints on mutations in HIV Rev and Env, which are encoded in different reading frames from the same region of the viral genome. Interestingly, residues that are functionally constrained in one protein are, for the most part, not as constrained in the other. The elegance of this solution is attractive and will be of interest to the protein evolution and structure communities.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72482.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kirkegaard</surname><given-names>Karla</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00f54p054</institution-id><institution>Stanford University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Hammarskjöld</surname><given-names>Marie-Louise</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.07.15.452440">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.15.452440v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

We have rescaled the data using the heuristic described in Grey et al., 2017 which was used to compare different DMS datasets and provide those factors as part of the supplemental tables and figures in support of Figure 3 (Gray, Hause and Fowler, 2017). While the rescaling model provided in Haddox et al., 2018 is appealing, we found it more difficult to implement and were unsure of the appropriateness of its assumptions in this case where the background genotypes are identical and the genes different (as opposed to DMS of the same gene in different genetic backgrounds) (Haddox <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018). We note that the Grey et al. 2017 metric is described as “roughly equivalent” in Haddox et al., 2018, and specify these caveats in the text.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72482-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
