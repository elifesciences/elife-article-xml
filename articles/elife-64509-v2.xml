It is not known to what extent reinfection by these viruses is due to waning immune memory or antigenic drift of the viruses. Here we address the influence of antigenic drift on immune evasion of seasonal coronaviruses. We provide evidence that at least two of these viruses, OC43 and 229E, are undergoing adaptive evolution in regions of the viral spike protein that are exposed to human humoral immunity. This suggests that reinfection may be due, in part, to positively selected genetic changes in these viruses that enable them to escape recognition by the immune system. It is possible that, as with seasonal influenza, these adaptive changes in antigenic regions of the virus would necessitate continual reformulation of a vaccine made against them.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adaptive evolution</kwd><kwd>seasonal coronavirus</kwd><kwd>oc43</kwd><kwd>229e</kwd><kwd>antigenic evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduation Research Fellowship Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kistler</surname><given-names>Kathryn E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pew Biomedical Scholar</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bedford</surname><given-names>Trevor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1762114</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kistler</surname><given-names>Kathryn E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R35 GM119774-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bedford</surname><given-names>Trevor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phylogenetic and computational methods reveal that at least two seasonal coronaviruses are evolving adaptively in the region of the viral spike protein exposed to the human humoral immune system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s and, in the decades that followed, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) received a considerable amount of attention in the field of infectious disease research. At this time, two species of HCoV, OC43 and 229E, were identified as the causative agents of roughly 15% of common colds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McIntosh, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heikkinen and Järvinen, 2003</xref>). Infections with these viruses were shown to exhibit seasonal patterns, peaking in January to March in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as yearly variation, with the greatest incidence occurring every 2–4 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Monto and Lim, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hamre and Beem, 1972</xref>). Subsequently, two additional seasonal HCoVs, HKU1 and NL63, have entered the human population. These four HCoVs endemic to the human population usually cause mild respiratory infections, but occasionally result in more severe disease in immunocompromised patients or the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2020b</xref>). In the past 20 years, three additional HCoVs (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) have emerged, which cause more severe respiratory illness. At the writing of this paper, amidst the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, no vaccine for any HCoV is currently available, though many candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are in production and clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krammer, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Coronaviruses are named for the ray-like projections of spike protein that decorate their surface. Inside these virions is a positive-sense RNA genome of roughly 30 kB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li, 2016</xref>). This large genome size can accommodate more genetic variation than a smaller genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Woo et al., 2009</xref>). Genome flexibility, coupled with a RNA virus error-prone polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Drake, 1993</xref>) and a high rate of homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pasternak et al., 2006</xref>), creates genetic diversity that is acted upon by evolutionary pressures that select for viral replication. This spawns much of the diversity within and between coronaviruses species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Woo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hon et al., 2008</xref>) and can contribute to the virus’ ability to jump species-barriers, allowing a previously zoonotic CoV to infect and replicate in humans.</p><p>The battle between virus and host results in selective pressure for mutations that alter viral antigens in a way that evades immune recognition. Antigenic evolution, or antigenic drift, leaves a characteristic mark of positively selected epitopes within the viral proteins most exposed to the host immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). For CoVs, this is the spike protein, exposed on the surface of the virion to human humoral immunity. Some human respiratory illnesses caused by RNA viruses, like seasonal influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2004</xref>), evolve antigenically, while others, like measles, do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fulton et al., 2015</xref>). Because of this, seasonal influenza vaccines must be reformulated on a nearly annual basis, while measles vaccines typically provide lifelong protection. Whether HCoVs undergo antigenic drift is relevant not only to understanding HCoV evolution and natural immunity against HCoVs, but also to predicting the duration of a vaccine’s effectiveness.</p><p>Early evidence that closely related HCoVs are antigenically diverse comes from a 1980s human challenge study in which subjects were infected and then reinfected with a variety of 229E-related strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reed, 1984</xref>). All subjects developed symptoms and shed virus upon initial virus inoculation. After about a year, subjects who were re-inoculated with the same strain did not show symptoms or shed virus. However, the majority of subjects who were re-inoculated with a heterologous strain developed symptoms and shed virus. This suggests that immunity mounted against 229E viruses provides protection against some, but not all, other 229E strains. This is a result that would be expected of an antigenically evolving virus.</p><p>More recent studies have identified eight OC43 genotypes and, in East Asian populations, certain genotypes were shown to temporally replace other genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Whether certain genotypes predominate due to antigenic differences that confer a fitness advantage is not known. However, evidence for selection in the spike protein of one of these dominant OC43 genotypes has been provided by <italic>dN/dS</italic>, a standard computational method for detecting positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ren et al., 2015</xref>). This method has also been used to suggest positive selection in the spike protein of 229E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chibo and Birch, 2006</xref>). Additionally, two genetically distinct groupings (each of which include multiple of the aforementioned eight genotypes) of OC43 viruses have been shown to alternate in prevalence within a Japanese community, meaning that the majority of OC43 infections are caused by one group for about 2–4 years at which point the other group begins to account for the bulk of infections. It has been suggested that antigenic differences between these groups contribute to this epidemic switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Komabayashi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>However, a similar surveillance of the NL63 genotypes circulating in Kilifi, Kenya found that NL63 genotypes persist for relatively long periods of time, that people become reinfected by the same genotype, and that reinfections are often enhanced by prior infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kiyuka et al., 2018</xref>). These findings are inconsistent with antigenic evolution in NL63.</p><p>Here we use a variety of computational approaches to detect adaptive evolution in spike and comparator proteins in HCoVs. These methods were designed as improvements to <italic>dN/dS</italic> with the intention of identifying adaptive substitutions within a serially sampled RNA virus population. We focus on the seasonal HCoVs that have been continually circulating in humans: OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63. Our analyses of nonsynonymous divergence, rate of adaptive substitutions, and Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) provide evidence that the spike protein of OC43 and 229E is under positive selection. Though we conduct these analyses on HKU1 and NL63, we do not observe evidence for adaptive evolution in the spike protein of these viruses. For HKU1, there is not enough longitudinal sequencing data available for us to confidently make conclusions as to whether or not this lack of evidence reflects an actual lack of adaptive evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phylogenetic consideration of viral diversity and recombination in OC43 and 229e</title><p>We constructed time-resolved phylogenies of the OC43 and 229E using publicly accessible sequenced isolates.

Additionally, the trees form ladder-like topologies with isolate tips arranged into temporal clusters rather than geographic clusters, indicating a single global population rather than geographically isolated populations of virus. The phylogeny of OC43 bifurcates immediately from the root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), indicating that OC43 consists of multiple, co-evolving lineages. Because of the distinct evolutionary histories, it is appropriate to conduct phylogenetic analyses separately for each lineage.

In the absence of recombination, each tree should show the same evolutionary relationships between viral isolates. A dramatic difference in a given isolate’s position on one tree versus another is strongly indicative of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006</xref>). Comparing the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and spike trees reveals this pattern of recombination in some isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A comparison of the trees of the S1 and S2 sub-domains of spike shows more limited evidence for intragenic recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which is consistent with the fact that the distance between two genetic loci is inversely related to the chance that these loci remain linked during a recombination event. Though intragenic recombination likely does occur occasionally, analyzing genes, rather than isolates, greatly reduces the contribution of recombination to genetic variation in our analyses.</p><p>Thus, in all of our analyses, we use alignments and phylogenies of sequences of single genes (or genomic regions) rather than whole genome sequences of isolates. We designate the lineage of those genes (or genomic regions) based on the gene’s phylogeny. Though most isolates contain all genes from the same lineage, some isolates have, say, a lineage A spike gene and a lineage B RdRp gene. This strategy allows us to consider the evolution of each gene separately and interrogate the selective pressures acting on them.</p><p>It is worth noting that the analyses we use here to detect adaptive evolution canonically presume that selective pressures are acting on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, it is possible that recombination also contributes to the genetic variation that is acted on by immune selection. This would be most likely to occur if two closely related genomes recombine, resulting in the introduction of a small amount of genetic diversity without disrupting crucial functions. Our analyses do not aim to determine the source of genetic variation (i.e. SNPs or recombination), but rather focus on identifying if and how selection acts on this variation.</p><p>Because of its essential role in viral replication and lack of antibody exposure, we expect RdRp to be under purifying selection to maintain its structure and function. If HCoVs evolve antigenically, we expect to see adaptive evolution in spike, and particularly in the S1 domain of spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hofmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hulswit et al., 2019</xref>), due to its exposed location at the virion’s surface and interaction with the host receptor. Mutations that escape from population immunity are beneficial to the virus and so are driven to fixation by positive selection. This results in adaptive evolution of the virus population.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Phylogenetic inference of substitution prevalence within spike</title><p>Using phylogenies constructed from the spike gene, we tallied the number of independent amino acid substitutions at each position within spike. The average number of substitutions per site is higher in S1 than S2 for HCoV lineages in OC43 and 229E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We focus on S1 rather than the receptor-binding domain (RBD) within S1 in our analyses, because it is known that neutralizing antibodies bind to epitopes within the N-terminal domain (NTD) as well as the RBD of S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). A greater occurrence of repeated substitutions is expected if some mutations within S1 confer immune avoidance. Alternatively, these repeated substitutions could be a result of high mutation rate and random genetic drift as has been shown at particular types of sites in SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van Dorp et al., 2020</xref>). However, this latter hypothesis should affect all regions of the genome equally and should not result in a greater number of repeated substitutions in S1 than S2.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>More sites mutate repeatedly within spike S1 versus S2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Number of substitutions observed at each amino acid position in the spike gene throughout the phylogeny.

In influenza H3N2, immune selection causes the genealogy to adopt a ladder-like shape where the rungs are formed by viral diversification and each step is created by the appearance of new, antigenically superior variants that replace previous variants. This ladder-like shape can also be seen in the phylogenies of the OC43 and 229E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

These results suggest strong directional selection in S1, likely driven by pressures to evade the humoral immune system. The difference in TMRCA between S1 and S2 is indicative not only of differing selective pressures acting on these two spike domains, but also of intra-spike recombination. This is because the immune selection imposed on S1 should also propagate neutral hitch-hiker mutations in closely linked regions such as S2. The difference in TMRCA suggests that recombination may uncouple these regions. Recombination can also push TMRCA to higher values, though this should not have a larger impact on RdRp than S1. The contributions of the forces of directional selection and recombination are difficult to parse from the TMRCA results. This emphasizes the importance of using methods, such as the Bhatt method, that are robust to recombination to detect adaptive evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Application of methods for identifying adaptive evolution to HKU1 and NL63</title><p>Because HKU1 was identified in the early 2000s, there are fewer longitudinally sequenced isolates available for this HCoV compared to 229E and OC43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consequently, the phylogenetic reconstructions and divergence analysis of HKU1 have a higher level of uncertainty. To begin with, it is less clear from the phylogenies whether HKU1 represents a single HCoV lineage like 229E or, instead, should be split into multiple lineages like OC43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Because of this, we completed all antigenic analyses for HKU1 twice: once considering all isolates to be members of a single lineage, and again after splitting isolates into two separate lineages. These lineages are arbitrarily labeled ‘A’ and ‘B’ as was done for OC43. When HKU1 is considered to consist of just one lineage, there is no signal of antigenic evolution by divergence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or by the Bhatt method of estimating adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, when HKU1 is assumed to consist of two co-circulating lineages, HKU1 lineage A has a markedly higher rate of adaptive substitutions in S1 than in S2 or RdRp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To demonstrate the importance of having a well-sampled longitudinal series of sequenced isolates for our antigenic analyses, we returned to our simulated OC43 S1 data sets. We mimicked shorter longitudinal series by truncating the data set to only 24, 14, 10, or 7 years of samples and ran the Bhatt analysis on these sequentially shorter time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The rates of adaptation estimated from the truncated data sets can be compared to the ‘true’ rate of adaptation calculated from all simulated data. This simulated data reveals a general trend that less longitudinal data reduces the ability to detect adaptive evolution by skewing the estimated rate away from the ‘truth’ and increasing the uncertainty of the analysis. Given the dearth of longitudinal data for HKU1, we do not feel that it is appropriate to make strong conclusions about adaptive evolution, or lack thereof, in this HCoV.</p><p>Despite being identified at roughly the same time as HKU1, substantially more NL63 isolates have been sequenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) making the phylogenetic reconstruction and evolutionary analyses of this virus correspondingly more reliable.

We additionally confirm that RdRp and S2 do not show signals of adaptive evolution. We observe that S1 accumulates between 0.3 (229E) and 0.5 (OC43) adaptive substitutions per year. We infer that these viruses accumulate adaptive substitutions at roughly half the rate of influenza A/H3N2 and at a similar rate to influenza B viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The most parsimonious explanation for the observation of substantial adaptive evolution in S1 is that antigenic drift is occurring in which mutations that escape from human population immunity are selectively favored in the viral population leading to repeated adaptive changes. However, it is formally possible that the adaptive evolution we detect is a result of selective pressures other than evasion of the adaptive immune system. Showing that this is truly antigenic evolution could involve a serological comparison of isolates that differ at S1 residues under positive selection.</p><p>In seasonal influenza and measles, the rates of adaptive evolution we estimate correlate well with relative rates of antigenic drift reported by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fulton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bedford et al., 2014</xref>). The relative rates of adaptation we calculate also match the relative frequency of vaccine strain updates, as would be expected since vaccines must be updated to match antigenically evolving viruses. Since 2006, the A/H3N2 component of the seasonal influenza vaccine has been updated 10 times (11 different A/H3N2 strains), four different B/Vic strains and four different B/Yam strains have been included in the vaccine, and the measles vaccine strain has not changed (Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System [GISRS], <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/en/">https://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/en/</ext-link>). Using these numbers as guidance, our results suggest that a vaccine against OC43 or 229E might need to be updated as frequently as the B/Vic and B/Yam components of the influenza vaccine are.</p><p>We do not observe evidence of antigenic evolution in NL63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This likely represents a lack of marked adaptive evolution in S1. Our finding fits with a study of NL63 in Kenya, which identified multiple genotypes of NL63 and show that people regularly become reinfected with the same genotype of NL63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kiyuka et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, Kiyuka et al. found that these genotypes circulate locally for a long period of time, suggesting a decent amount of viral diversity and a potential lack of evolution due to immune selection. Though our results cannot explain why OC43 and 229E likely evolve antigenically while NL63 does not, Kiyuka et al. observe that NL63 reinfections are sometimes enhanced by a previous infection and hypothesize that NL63 is actually under purifying selection at epitope sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kiyuka et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Though analysis of all HCoVs would benefit from more sequenced isolates, there is substantially less longitudinal sequencing data available for HKU1.

In this latter study, HCoV infections were identified from longitudinal serum samples by assaying for increases in antibodies against the nucleocapsid (N) protein of representative OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63 viruses. This study concluded that the average time between infections was 1.5–2.5 years, depending on the HCoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edridge et al., 2020</xref>). In comparison, influenza H3N2 reinfects people roughly every 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kucharski et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, frequent reinfection by seasonal HCoVs is likely due to a combination of factors and suggests waning immune memory, and/or incomplete immunity against reinfection, in addition to antigenic drift.</p><p>HCoVs are a diverse grouping split, phylogenetically, into two genera: NL63 and 229E are alphacoronaviruses, while OC43, HKU1, MERS, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 are betacoronaviruses. The method of cell entry does not seem to correlate with genus. Coronaviruses bind to a remarkable range of host-cell receptors including peptidases, cell adhesion molecules, and sugars. Among the seasonal HCoVs, OC43 and HKU1 both bind 9-O-acetylsialic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hulswit et al., 2019</xref>), while 229E binds human aminopeptidase N (hAPN) and NL63 binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2020b</xref>). Despite a relatively large phylogenetic distance and divergent S1 structures, NL63 and SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 bind to the same host receptor using the same virus-binding motifs (VBMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li, 2016</xref>). This VBM is located in the C-terminal domain of S1 (S1-CTD), which fits within the trend of S1-CTD receptor-binding in CoVs that bind protein receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hofmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li, 2016</xref>).

This localization roughly aligns with our observations that the majority of the repeatedly mutated sites occur toward the C-terminal end of 229E S1 and the N-terminal end of OC43 S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Here we have provided support that at least two of the four seasonal HCoVs evolve adaptively in the region of spike that is known to interact with the humoral immune system. These two viruses span both genera of HCoVs, though due to the complexity of HCoV receptor binding and pathology mentioned above, it is not clear whether or not this suggests that other HCoVs, such as SARS-CoV-2, will also evolve adaptively in S1. This is important because, at the time of writing of this manuscript, many SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are in production and most of these exclusively include spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krammer, 2020</xref>). If SARS-CoV-2 evolves adaptively in S1 as the closely related HCoV OC43 does, it is possible that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine would need to be frequently reformulated to match the circulating strains, as is done for seasonal influenza vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All data, source code, and analyses can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/blab/seasonal-cov-adaptive-evolution">https://github.com/blab/seasonal-cov-adaptive-evolution</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kistler, 2021</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:feb61594144d5787d91049172267d925b738079b;origin=https://github.com/blab/seasonal-cov-adaptive-evolution;visit=swh:1:snp:db7c97d981938da69e10585d540a30e869537903;anchor=swh:1:rev:83721cd000f2848d4f77d2a6da8c2d0df8a555a1/">swh:1:rev:83721cd000f2848d4f77d2a6da8c2d0df8a555a1</ext-link>). All phylogenetic trees constructed and analyzed in this manuscript can be viewed interactively at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/seasonal-cov-adaptive-evolution">https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/seasonal-cov-adaptive-evolution</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mattenberger, 2021</xref>.

The total number of observed differences between the isolate and founder nucleotide sequences that result in nonsynonymous (or synonymous) substitutions is divided by the number of possible nucleotide mutations that result in nonsynonymous (or synonymous) substitutions, weighted by kappa, to yield an estimate of divergence. Kappa is the ratio of rates of transitions:transversions and was calculated by averaging values from spike and RdRp trees built by BEAST 2.6.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouckaert et al., 2019</xref>) using the HKY+gamma4 model with two partitions and ‘coalescent constant population’.

For each lineage and each genomic region, we partitioned all available sequences into sliding 3-year windows and only used time points that contained at least three sequences in the analysis. We compared nucleotide sequences at each time point (the ingroup) to the consensus nucleotide sequence at the first time point (the outgroup). Eight estimators (silent fixed, replacement fixed, silent high frequency, replacement high frequency, silent mid-frequency, replacement mid-frequency, silent low frequency, and replacement low-frequency) are calculated by the site-counting method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhatt et al., 2010</xref>). In the site-counting method, each estimator is the product of the fixation or polymorphism score times the silent or replacement score, summed for each site in that frequency class. Fixation and polymorphism scores depend on the number of different nucleotides observed at the site and whether the outgroup base is present in the ingroup. Selectively neutral sites are assumed to contain the classes of silent polymorphisms and replacement polymorphisms occurring at a frequency between 0.15 and 0.75. A class of nonneutral, adaptive sites is then identified as having an excess of replacement fixations or polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhatt et al., 2011</xref>). For each lineage and gene, 100 bootstrap alignments and ancestral sequences were generated and run through the Bhatt method to assess the statistical uncertainty of our estimates of rates of adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhatt et al., 2011</xref>). The rate of adaptation (per codon per year) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is calculated by linear regression of the time series values of adaptive substitutions per codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

The seasonal influenza build was run with 20-year resolution for H3N2, H1N1pdm, Vic, and Yam. The rates of adaptation of different genes was calculated using our implementation of the Bhatt method described above. The receptor-binding domain used for influenza was HA1, for measles was the H protein, and for the HCoVs was S1. The membrane fusion protein used for influenza was HA2, for measles was the F protein, and for the HCoVs was S2.

The OC43 lineage A root sequence was used as a starting point and the simulation was run for 500 generations and 10 simulated sequences were sampled every 50 generations. The spike and RdRp genes were simulated separately. Purifying selection was simulated across both genes. Evolution was simulated in the absence of recombination and with moderate and high levels of recombination during replication. Under each of these recombination paradigms, we simulated evolution in the absence of positive selection within spike and with moderate and high levels of positive selection. Positive selection was simulated through exposure-dependent selection at a subset of spike S1 sites proportional to the number of epitope sites in H3N2 HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luksza and Lässig, 2014</xref>). The simulated selection allows mutations in these ‘epitope’ sites to rise in frequency while also encouraging ‘epitopes’ to change over time (to mimic antigenic novelty). All simulations were run with a nucleotide mutation rate of 1 × 10<sup>−4</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vijgen et al., 2005</xref>).

interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Coronavirus adaptation to immune responses is a very timely and important topic. This paper demonstrates that some of the seasonal coronavirus strains responsible for common colds have undergone substantial recent adaptation in a protein that is likely targeted by the immune system. However, they have not been adapting as quickly as similar proteins in the influenza virus, and at least one seasonal coronavirus strain has undergone very little adaptation in this protein.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Congratulations, we are pleased to inform you that your article, &quot;Evidence for adaptive evolution in the receptor-binding domain of seasonal coronaviruses&quot;, has been accepted for publication in eLife.</p><p>Please take note of the points below and we hope you will continue to support eLife. The main point that all the reviewers agreed on is that it would be helpful to compare your results to those that would be obtained with a standard dN/dS approach.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors use dN/dS-based statistics to show that the S1 domain has been adapting in coronaviruses OC43 and 229E, but not in NL63. For at least OC43 and 229E, this agrees qualitatively with earlier studies.

But perhaps the simulations should be cut or de-emphasized. From my understanding of the Bhatt et al. papers and the authors' code, their selection-detection method is entirely site-based and doesn't use the tree at all, and so should be insensitive to recombination a priori. If this is correct, the simulations are largely unnecessary (but see the next point).</p><p>2) It looks like there is substantial geographic population structure, as well as time-varying geographic biases in sampling.

In my comments below, I offer advice to improve the clarity and presentation of the paper, with a few small requested analyses or need for further explanations.</p><p>1) &quot;We have arbitrarily labeled these lineages 'A' and 'B' (Figure 1).&quot; The figure then shows A/B panels for different hCoV strains, which is a little confusing at first until you orient to the figure presentation.

Presumably this is the codon sub rate per year, which is used elsewhere? Or is this nucleotide? Similarly, units are also needed:…</p><p>– Subsection “Rate of Adaptation in RdRp and subdomains of spike”, for the parenthetical &quot;(or 0.45 adaptive substitutions each year)&quot;. Are the authors converting to nucleotide?</p><p>– Subsection “Phylogenetic Inference”.</p><p>3) In general, I find the references to supplementary figures in the text confusing. For example, I first read the phrase &quot;Figure 1 Supplement 1A&quot; to mean both Figure 1 and Supplement 1A. Writing this as, &quot;Figure 1—figure supplement 1A&quot; will make it more clear that Figure 1 of the main text is not being referenced.</p><p>4) Results, second paragraph – sentences are not well ordered. Should be in order: 1) Though…, 2) Because…, 3) This….</p><p>5) The last two sentences in the second paragraph of the Results seem tacked on and not immediately relevant to recombination. Please move these sentences or include a paragraph break.</p><p>6) Related to the previous comment, the Results section as a whole will benefit from improved organization, specifically by creating subsections. I highly recommend adding these to improve readability.</p><p>7) Comments for Figure 2:</p><p>– Unless it becomes too busy, small indicators (or at least in the legend to avoid figure noise) might be added to emphasize the RBD domain within S1 specifically.</p><p>– I recommend changing the color of the asterisks in panel A to match the lineage A (red) color.</p><p>8) The authors write, &quot;from that lineage's common ancestor.&quot; It would be more precise to say the &quot;from that lineage's <italic>most recent</italic> common ancestor.&quot;</p><p>9) Figure 3, specifically in panel A for RdRp, leaves some ambiguous interpretations: Is the line missing for OC43 lineage B because there is no RdRp data after the early 1990s (seems unlikely?), or because there were no adaptive substitutions, in which case the orange lines should remain steady at 0? This aspect of the figure should be clarified or fixed.</p><p>There is a similar situation for panel C, HKU1 lineage B, in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. In addition, the &quot;C&quot; for that panel is cut off at the bottom, so this figure needs to be slightly reformatted.</p><p>10) In the fifth paragraph of the Results, the authors introduce the H3N2 analysis, but the actual analysis is not really presented or described for another two pages. The H3N2 comparison is definitely not part of Figure 4, which this paragraph is introducing. I think this sentence is likely misplaced? Again, this comment shows that adding subsections to the Results section will be helpful for overall organization.</p><p>11) Results, I would like to see more details about what constitutes an “adaptive substitution” in the Bhatt method, which is not as widely used as dN/dS, within the main text itself. A couple additional sentences briefly and &quot;birds eye view&quot; explaining what constitutes adaptive will help orient readers. The easiest way to this – just move &quot;Briefly,…each of these timepoints.&quot; to the Results section.</p><p>12) Jumping off of the last comment – why wasn't dN/dS done? Given that dN/dS is more commonly applied, I think a comparison of these results to standard dN/dS analysis is merited. In fact, including a dN/dS analysis may bolster the authors' overall conclusions and/or contribute to justifying using the Bhatt method, especially if dN/dS is not sufficient sensitive for this data.</p><p>13) In general, the authors should clarify their use of the terms &quot;positive selection&quot; and &quot;adaptive substitutions.&quot; The former is traditionally associated with interpreting dN/dS, which isn't calculated in the manuscript, and the latter term is more mechanistically-oriented regarding effects of mutations. Therefore, what is meant by &quot;positive selection&quot; in the simulations, and how does this definition/implementation compare to the authors' measurements of &quot;adaptive substitutions&quot;?</p><p>14) Figure 7 and its associated analysis raised some concerns for me. It seems like only simulation 5 replicates were performed for each condition. Is there a reason so few simulations were performed (e.g. too computationally expensive?). Further, mean and CI bars for only 5 replicates in Figure 7 gives the impression that there are more than 5 replicates. A strip plot would be more forthcoming about the analyses conducted here, and some additional explanation about why only 5 replicates were performed per condition would help.</p><p>15) Table 1 and its associated analysis:</p><p>– CI's or some measure of statistical bounds should be included in Table 1.</p><p>– Where is OC43B in the table? Was the analysis not performed on this lineage, and if so why not?</p><p>– The authors motivate this analysis by explaining how TMRCA is meaningful for H3N2. Can the authors perform this analysis for H3N2 proteins as well to provide further context for the HCoV values, just as they did for these analyses associated with Figure 5?</p><p>16) Results, tenth paragraph. To motivate this analysis, the authors may also wish to cite this paper, co-authored by Trevor, that uses a downsampling strategy from empirical to study 2009 H1N1 dynamics, and shows time dependency in evolutionary metrics. https://bedford.io/papers/meyer-time-dependence/</p><p>– In addition, why did the authors use simulated data here?

However, we think the simulated data in Figure 7 provides a useful confirmation of this in addition to providing a framework to test how limited longitudinal sequencing data affects the estimated rate of adaptation (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). In order to provide clarity, we have added Figure 7—figure supplement 2, which shows representative phylogenies for each of the recombination/selection.

This is especially visible when examining sequences from the 2010’s, where isolates from several countries were sequenced. In these years, isolates frequently appear interspersed within the same temporal cluster rather than forming separate geographic clusters. This suggests that HCoVs are rapidly transmitted globally and this geographic mixing justifies analyzing all isolates together as one population, rather conducting separate analyses on geographically-partitioned data. We have added an explanation of this to the Results section, which reads as follows:</p><p>“Additionally, the trees form ladder-like topologies with isolate tips arranged into temporal clusters rather than geographic clusters, indicating a single global population rather than geographically-isolated populations of virus”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why is synonymous divergence also much higher in OC43 S1 than it is in RDRP or S2?</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure why synonymous divergence differs between genes. To address this concern, we have calculated the ratio of nonsynonymous divergence in spike to nonsynonymous divergence in RdRp and compare this to the equivalent ratio of synonymous divergence. We also compute the same ratios for S1 versus S2. We find that the nonsynonymous divergence ratio is higher than the synonymous divergence ratio. This indicates that, while spike synonymous divergence is often higher than RdRp synonymous divergence, this difference is much smaller than the difference in nonsynonymous divergences. We take this to be a convincing result showing that nonsynonymous divergence in spike is indeed higher than nonsynonymous divergence in RdRp (and the same for the comparison of S1 to S2). We have added Figure 3—figure supplement 2 showing these results, and have inserted the following text in the Results section to acknowledge this observation:</p><p>“Though we would expect synonymous divergence to be equivalent in all areas of the genome, this is not born out in our results.

Additionally, people become reinfected by the same genotype and Kiyuka et al. observe that NL63 reinfections are often enhanced by a previous infection. Kiyuka et al. hypothesize that enhanced reinfection signals that NL63 is exploiting an immune response and that epitopes would actually be under purifying selection because of this. Whether or not this hypothesis is correct, their observations of persistent circulation of NL63 genotypes and reinfection by the same genotype fit well with our results showing a lack of adaptive evolution in NL63 S1.</p><p>“Our finding fits with a study of NL63 in Kenya, which identified multiple genotypes of NL63 and show that people regularly become reinfected with the same genotype of NL63 (Kiyuka et al., 2018).
