Roles of Axin1 in skeletal development and in disease occurrence have not been fully defined. Here, we report that Axin1 is essential for lower limb development. Specific deletion of <italic>Axin1</italic> in limb mesenchymal cells leads to fibular hemimelia (FH)-like phenotype, associated with tarsal coalition. Further studies demonstrate that FH disease is associated with additional defects in <italic>Axin1</italic> knockout (KO) mice, including decreased osteoclast formation and defects in angiogenesis. We then provide in vivo evidence showing that Axin1 controls limb development through both canonical β-catenin and BMP signaling pathways. We demonstrate that inhibition of β-catenin or BMP signaling could significantly reverse the FH phenotype in mice. Together, our findings reveal that integration of β-catenin and BMP signaling by Axin1 is required for lower limb development. Defect in Axin1 signaling could lead to the development of FH disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mice</kwd><kwd>rat</kwd><kwd>human</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82030067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Di</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82161160342</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Di</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82172397</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tong</surname><given-names>Liping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81974320</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFB3800800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tong</surname><given-names>Liping</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Di</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021A1515111075</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yi</surname><given-names>Dan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Specific gene knockout and signaling inhibition studies indicate the activation of β-catenin-bone morphogenetic protein signaling contributes to the development of fibular hemimelia disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fibular hemimelia (FH) is a congenital longitudinal limb deficiency characterized by complete or partial absence of the fibular bone. Unilateral fibular deficiency occurs in two-thirds of patients, with the right fibula being more often affected. FH may vary from partial absence of the fibula (10% of cases) with relatively normal-appearing limbs, to absence of the fibula with marked shortening of the femur, curved tibia, bowing of the leg, knee joint and ankle instability, and significant soft tissue deficiency. The major functional deficiency results from limb length discrepancy in patients with unilateral FH or asymmetrical dwarfism in patients with bilateral FH. The foot is generally in an equinovalgus position. As there is limited growing potential within the affected bone, the extent of the deformity tends to increase with growth.</p><p>Occasionally, FH is associated with congenital shortening of the femur. Although it was first described by Gollier in 1698, the etiology of FH remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stanitski and Stanitski, 2003</xref>). The deformity of FH is probably due to disruptions during the critical period of embryonic limb development, between 4th and 7th week of gestation. Vascular dysgenesis, viral infections, trauma, and environmental influences have been suggested as possible causes. Most cases are sporadic. A family history has been reported in a small percentage of cases with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and incomplete penetrance.</p><p>The evolutionary conserved canonical Wnt signaling pathway controls many biological processes during the development and maintains tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>). A key feature of this pathway is the regulation of its downstream effector β-catenin by a cytoplasmic destruction complex. Axin1 is a central scaffold protein of the destruction complex and directly interacts with all other core components in this complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>). It has been reported that Axin1 is the rate-limiting factor regulating β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lee et al., 2003</xref>). However, the in vivo role of Axin1 in the skeletal development and homeostasis has not been fully investigated due to early embryonic lethality (E9.5) of <italic>Axin1</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Zeng et al., 1997</xref>). Genetic evidence from both humans and mice has implicated that Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a crucial role in controlling all major aspects of skeletal development, including craniofacial, limb, and joint formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baron and Kneissel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Regard et al., 2012</xref>). Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling also plays an important role in skeletogenesis during the development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Yoon et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, consistent with what is observed in many tissues and organs, Wnt and BMP signaling pathways have overlapped functions in controlling skeletal development and homeostasis. However, the key question is how the two pathways are integrated in controlling skeletal development and maintaining skeletal homeostasis.</p><p>Here, we show that loss of <italic>Axin1</italic> in mouse limb mesenchymal cells resulted in severe defects in lower limb development, similar to FH disease phenotype. We found that inhibition of β-catenin signaling, either by deletion of one allele of <italic>β-catenin</italic> gene in limb mesenchymal cells or by the treatment with a specific <italic>β-catenin</italic> inhibitor, was able to significantly rescue the defects in FH phenotype observed in <italic>Axin1</italic> knockout (KO) mice. Furthermore, inhibition of BMP signaling also significantly reversed defects in limb development and FH phenotype of <italic>Axin1</italic> mutant mice. Our findings indicate that Axin1/β-catenin/BMP signaling plays a key role in FH development and pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deletion of <italic>Axin1</italic> in <italic>Prrx1</italic>-expressing cells leads to FH-like phenotype</title><p>To determine the role of Axin1 in skeletal development and diseases, we generated <italic>Axin1</italic> conditional KO (cKO) mice by breeding the <italic>Axin1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Xie et al., 2011</xref>) with <italic>Prrx1-Cre</italic> transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Logan et al., 2002</xref>) in which the Cre expression is under the control of the <italic>Prrx1</italic> promoter.

We first determined Axin1 and β-catenin expression in 3-week-old <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and found that Axin1 expression was reduced by 61% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>); in contrast, β-catenin expression increased 2.8-fold in joint tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). We examined skeletal development in E13.5 and E16.5 embryos and postnatal day 7 (P7) mice by Alizarin red/Alcian blue staining. The one notable defect is the presence of various fibular deficiencies in the <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO embryos and postnatal mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). The fibulae of <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice did not mineralize even at P7. Histological analysis using limb tissues dissected from <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice showed partially developed fibular tissues with poorly developed growth plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). The number of chondrocytes was significantly reduced and the structure of growth plate was disorganized in <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). In addition to fibular defects, the lengths of femorae and tibiae were significantly reduced in <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1 fig2sdata2 fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 1–3</xref>). High bone mass phenotype was observed in all long bones, including femorae, tibiae, and fibulae in <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). To date, we have analyzed 52 <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice and all of them have a fibular deficiency phenotype. Radiographic analysis of 4- and 8-week-old mice showed that some of <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice were completely or almost completely absence of fibulae (&gt;50% loss of fibulae, 27/52) where only a distal, vestigial fragment was present. The other <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice had partial absence of the fibulae (30–50% loss of fibulae, 23/52) in which the proximal portions of the fibulae were absent while distal portions were present but could not support the ankle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). The mild fibular defects were observed in few of <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice (2/52), in which the fibulae were absent less than 30% of their normal length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). These results demonstrate that Axin1 plays an essential role in fibular development. In addition, all femorae of <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice were shorter and wider than those of their Cre<sup>-</sup> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H, I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Different from human FH disease, <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice always displayed fibular defects in both sides of lower limb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). It is also interesting to note that the bowed tibiae were observed in <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). These skeletal defects observed in <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice have been reported to be the key features of FH disease in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achterman and Kalamchi, 1979</xref>).

Our present study clearly demonstrated that Axin1 plays a key role in lower limb development and FH pathogenesis through regulation of both β-catenin and BMP signaling. FH is a birth defect where part of or entire fibulae are missing, as well as associated with limb length discrepancy and foot and knee deformities. FH is a rare genetic disorder, occurring in about 1 in 40,000 live births. In the present studies, we found that the FH phenotype was observed in <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO (<italic>Axin1<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Prrx1-Cre</italic>) mice, but not in <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice targeting in other cell populations, such as <italic>Sox9</italic>-expressing cells (<italic>Axin1<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Sox9-CreER</italic>), <italic>Col2a1</italic>-expressing cells (<italic>Axin1<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Col2a1-Cre</italic>), and <italic>Sp7</italic>-expressing cells (<italic>Axin1<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Sp7-Cre</italic>), suggesting that specific deficiency of <italic>Axin1</italic> in <italic>Prrx1</italic>-expressing cell population is responsible for the FH development. In addition, we also found that β-catenin or BMP inhibitor can only rescue the FH phenotype during E9.5-E12.5 developmental stages. These findings suggest that FH disease may be caused by specific upregulation of β-catenin or BMP signaling in limb mesenchymal cells during early stage of skeletal development.</p><p>The major defect observed in <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice is the presence of various fibular deficiencies. Some of <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice show complete or almost complete absence of fibula. The other <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice had partial absence of fibulae. As we described above, the partial or total absence of fibulae are the key feature of FH. The <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice also exhibit tarsal coalition.</p><p>As Axin1 is a key negative regulator of canonical Wnt pathway and β-catenin is a major downstream mediator of Wnt signaling, we determined genetic interactions between Axin1 and β-catenin during lower limb development. Indeed, the defects in <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice are significantly rescued by the deletion of one allele of the <italic>β-catenin</italic> gene, <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>. Furthermore, we found that β-catenin inhibitor iCRT14 significantly reversed the FH phenotype in <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice. These results strongly suggest that Axin1 controls lower limb development through canonical β-catenin pathway.</p><p>BMP signaling may be a downstream signaling pathway of Wnt/Axin1 signaling during limb development. In this study we found upregulation of BMP signaling in <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice. More importantly, we found that inhibition of BMP signaling efficiently rescued the FH phenotype observed in <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice. These results indicate that BMP signaling pathway is another key downstream effector of Wnt/Axin1 signaling during limb development. Therefore, it is clear that Axin1 controls lower limb development through both canonical β-catenin and BMP signaling pathways. It is known that the Wnt and BMP signaling pathways coordinately govern many developmental processes. However, the mechanisms by which these two pathways are integrated each other during skeletal development remain elusive. We found that pSmad5 stability is significantly prolonged in <italic>Axin1</italic>-deficient cells. And we demonstrated that increased pSmad5 stability in <italic>Axin1</italic>-deficient cells is independent from β-catenin activity. Next, we found that Wnt indeed regulates Smad5 phosphorylation in C3H10T1/2 cells, in consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fuentealba et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, we demonstrate that this regulation is independent from β-catenin signaling. In addition, we confirmed that Axin1 directly interacts with Smad5 in C3H10T1/2 cells. Taken together, we conclude that Axin1 is not only a key negative regulator of β-catenin, but also simultaneously a critical negative regulator of Smad5.</p><p>Here, we propose a mechanism by which integration between Wnt and BMP signaling pathways by Axin1 controls limb development and homeostasis. In the absence of Wnt stimulation, β-catenin and Smad5 are degraded by the same destruction complex through interaction with Axin1. In the presence of Wnt ligands or loss of Axin1, both β-catenin and Smad5 degradation is inhibited, resulting in activation of β-catenin and Smad5 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). It is well established that LRP6 recruits the active destruction complex to form the signaling complex with Wnt stimulation, which results in inactivation of the destruction complex, leading to β-catenin stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). However, how Wnt ligands increase the stability of pSmad5 though Axin1 complex remains unknown. It has been reported that Wnt inhibits GSK-3β activity and prolongs the duration of BMP/pSmad1, leading to increased stability of Smad1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fuentealba et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>It is worth mentioning that BMP signaling is downstream of β-catenin signaling during lower limb development, although we did find that Axin1 could directly interact with Smad5. This is because β-catenin inhibition could efficiently rescue FH phenotype in <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice and the presence of BMP signaling could not compensate the inhibition of β-catenin signaling, if we assume that BMP signaling is independent from β-catenin signaling. If Axin1 could regulate lower limb development through interacting with BMP signaling molecules completely independent from β-catenin signaling, inhibition of β-catenin signaling should not rescue the FH phenotype observed in <italic>Axin1</italic> cKO mice.</p><p>It has been suggested that FH occurrence is caused by genetic and environmental factors. At early pregnancy, the patients are exposed to harmful environments, such as radiation, toxic chemicals, virus infections, and specific drugs, which further leads to the transient upregulation of β-catenin-BMP signaling in limb mesenchymal cells. We still do not know which environmental factor(s) contribute(s) to the occurrence of FH disease. As a genetic factor, the epigenetic regulation of β-catenin-BMP signaling molecules in FH pathogenesis has not been explored. To fully understand the FH disease, further investigations need to be conducted.</p><p>In summary, in the present studies, we demonstrated that Axin1 is a key regulator of lower limb development. Therefore, we hypothesize that transient inhibition of Axin1 signaling or transient activation of β-catenin or BMP signaling during early skeletal development may be the cause of the FH disease. Our study could have significant impacts on the diagnosis and treatment of the FH disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Conditional Axin1 loss-of-function mutant mice were generated by intercrossing double heterozygous for a floxed <italic>Axin1</italic> allele and the <italic>Prrx1-Cre</italic> transgenic allele (<italic>Axin1<sup>flox/wt</sup>;Prrx1-Cre<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Logan et al., 2002</xref>) with homozygous floxed <italic>Axin1</italic> (<italic>Axin<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>) mice.

signaling pathway which is essential for lower limb development. The data clearly demonstrates that inhibition of β-catenin and BMP signaling genetically and pharmacologically could largely reverse fibular hemimelia phenotype in mice. In general, the manuscript is clear, well-written, and concise and the study is well-structured and various techniques have been used to validate the data. It presents as a thorough study highlighting the importance of Axin1/ β-catenin/BMP signaling in FH development.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80013.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00za53h95</institution-id><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.07.04.498726">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.04.498726v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Could deletion of both alleles of β-catenin in mesenchymal cells completely reduce the bone mass observed in Axin1Prx1 KO mice given deletion of one allele of β-catenin could only partially rescue this phenotype?
