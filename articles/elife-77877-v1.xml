Among them, the kinesin-4 family is a unique motor that inhibits microtubule dynamics. Although mutations of kinesin-4 cause several diseases, its molecular mechanism is unclear because of the difficulty of visualizing the high-resolution structure of kinesin-4 working at the microtubule plus-end. Here, we report that KLP-12, a <italic>C. elegans</italic> kinesin-4 ortholog of KIF21A and KIF21B, is essential for proper length control of <italic>C. elegans</italic> axons, and its motor domain represses microtubule polymerization in vitro. The crystal structure of the KLP-12 motor domain complexed with tubulin, which represents the high-resolution structural snapshot of the inhibition state of microtubule-end dynamics, revealed the bending effect of KLP-12 for tubulin. Comparison with the KIF5B-tubulin and KIF2C-tubulin complexes, which represent the elongation and shrinking forms of microtubule ends, respectively, showed the curvature of tubulin introduced by KLP-12 is in between them. Taken together, KLP-12 controls the proper length of axons by modulating the curvature of the microtubule ends to inhibit the microtubule dynamics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>From meter-long structures that allow nerve cells to stretch across a body to miniscule ‘hairs’ required for lung cells to clear mucus, many life processes rely on cells sporting projections which have the right size for their role. Networks of hollow filaments known as microtubules shape these structures and ensure that they have the appropriate dimensions. Controlling the length of microtubules is therefore essential for organisms, yet how this process takes place is still not fully elucidated.</p><p>Previous research has shown that microtubules continue to grow when their end is straight but stop when it is curved. A family of molecular motors known as kinesin-4 participate in this process, but the exact mechanisms at play remain unclear.</p><p>To investigate, Tuguchi, Nakano, Imasaki et al. focused on the KLP-12 protein, a kinesin-4 equivalent which helps to controls the length of microtubules in the tiny worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. They performed genetic manipulations and imaged the interactions between KLP-12 and the growing end of a microtubule using X-ray crystallography. This revealed that KLP-12 controls the length of neurons by inhibiting microtubule growth. It does so by modulating the curvature of the growing end of the filament to suppress its extension. A ‘snapshot’ of KLP-12 binding to a microtubule at the resolution of the atom revealed exactly how the protein helps to bend the end of the filament to prevent it from growing further.</p><p>These results will help to understand how nerve cells are shaped. This may also provide insights into the molecular mechanisms for various neurodegenerative disorders caused by problems with the human equivalents of KLP-12, potentially leading to new therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) are microtubule-based molecular motors driven by the energy of ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirokawa et al., 2009a</xref>). Most KIFs move along microtubules to transport various cargos, including membranous organelles, protein complexes, and mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guedes-Dias and Holzbaur, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirokawa et al., 2009b</xref>). In addition to transporting cargos, some kinesins possess the ability to regulate microtubule dynamics, such as elongation (polymerization), catastrophe or shrinkage (depolymerization), in diverse ways. Kinesin-1, the founding member of the KIFs, changes the conformation of unstable GDP microtubules into a conformation resembling the GTP microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Muto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shima et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, kinesin-13 destabilizes both the plus and minus ends of microtubules to induce catastrophe or depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ogawa et al., 2004</xref>). Kinesin-8 moves processively toward the microtubule plus-end, where it depolymerizes microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gupta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niwa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Varga et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Kinesin-4, another family of kinesins, is known to inhibit microtubule dynamics and is classified into three subfamilies: the KIF4 subfamily, the KIF7 subfamily, and the KIF21 subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yue et al., 2018</xref>). The KIF21 subfamily has attracted considerable attention because its genetic alterations are linked with several diseases. Point mutations of KIF21A cause congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscle type 1 (CFEOM1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamada et al., 2003</xref>). Polymorphisms in the KIF21B gene are associated with several inflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis or Crohn’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrett et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goris et al., 2010</xref>). Increased expression of KIF21B is also linked to the progression of neurodegenerative disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kreft et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Kif21b</italic> knockout mice were reported to exhibit behavioral changes involving impaired learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muhia et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanisms of how kinesin-4 affects microtubule dynamics have been studied for more than a dozen years, demonstrating the main contribution of their motor domains to microtubule dynamics inhibition. Xklp1/KIF4, a fast processive motor, was first reported to reduce both microtubule growth and the catastrophe rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bieling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bringmann et al., 2004</xref>). Its motor domain is able to bind not only to the microtubule lattices for microtubule-based motility but also to the curved tubulin dimers for inhibition of microtubule dynamics. Nonmotile KIF7 was reported to reduce the microtubule growth rate but enhance catastrophe to organize the tips of ciliary microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yue et al., 2018</xref>). The processive motor KIF21A/B reduces microtubule growth and catastrophes similar to Xklp1/KIF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Riel et al., 2017</xref>). These studies suggest that the motor domains of kinesin-4 family proteins play a crucial role in reducing the growth rate of microtubules. In other words, minor alterations in kinesin-4 motor domains affect their conserved functions to suppress microtubule dynamics by displaying strikingly distinct motility characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Riel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The other domains of kinesin-4 are also known to be involved in microtubule dynamics inhibition by regulating or supporting motor domain functions. The coiled-coil region of KIF21A in which CFEOM1-associated mutations are localized operates as an autoinhibitory domain by interaction with the motor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bianchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>). The dominant character of CFEOM1 syndrome is thus connected to the increased activity of the mutant KIF21A kinesin caused by the loss of autoinhibition. The WD40 domain of KIF21B holds on to the growing microtubule tip and induces its pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Riel et al., 2017</xref>), which is required for the sustained action of the motor domain on the microtubule plus-end to inhibit microtubule dynamics.</p><p>We previously reported the first crystal structure of the KIF4 motor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2013</xref>) and showed molecular mechanisms of ATP-induced motion; however, because of the lack of functional and structural information on kinesin-4 on the microtubule plus-end, the mechanism by which kinesin-4 motors inhibit microtubule dynamics is still obscure. Here, we investigated the functional and structural analyses of microtubule dynamics inhibition by kinesin-4 KLP-12, a <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)</italic> ortholog of KIF21A and KIF21B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Genetic analyses and in vitro TIRF (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscopy) assays showed that KLP-12 regulates axonal length through inhibiting microtubule dynamics at its plus-end, similar to KIF21A and KIF21B. The crystal structure of KLP-12 complexed with curved α-, β- tubulin dimers suggested the structural model of microtubule dynamics inhibition by the kinesin-4 motor domain; kinesin-4 precisely controls the curvature of tubulin dimers at the plus-end, which is larger than that decorated by plus-end stabilizing kinesin-1 and smaller than that decorated by destabilizing kinesin-13. This precise control was achieved by the specific interactions on the microtubule interfaces conserved among kinesin-4 motors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>KLP-12 is an ortholog of KIF21A and KIF21B that regulates axonal length.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic presentation of the domain organization of the KIF21 subfamily: <italic>C. elegans</italic> KLP-12, human KIF21A, and KIF21B consist of a motor domain (MD; magenta), neck linker (blue), coiled-coil domains (CC; black), and WD40 domain (WD40; gray).

We used two independent deletion mutant alleles of <italic>klp-12</italic>, <italic>klp-12(tm10890</italic>) and <italic>klp-12(tm5176</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>klp-12(tm10890</italic>) was considered to be a null allele because the mutation induces deletion of exon 4–6, resulting in a frameshift. <italic>klp-12(tm5176</italic>) had a deletion mutation in exons encoding the tail domain. We observed the development of two mechanosensory neurons, anterior lateral mechanosensory (ALM) and posterior lateral mechanosensory (PLM) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) because the tiling between PLM and ALM neurons are strictly regulated by microtubule regulating factors, such as kinesin-13. Previous studies have shown worm mutants with more stable microtubules have defects in tiling between PLM and ALM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Puri et al., 2021</xref>). In wild-type animals, the axonal tip of PLM neurons does not reach the cell body of ALM without overlapping with each other (wild-type in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallegos and Bargmann, 2004</xref>).

We also investigated the effect of overexpression of wild-type KLP-12 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons. Compared to the wild type, the PLM axon overexpressing KLP-12 became strikingly shorter and thinner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). Together with these results, the appropriate activity of KLP-12 is necessary to achieve proper length control of axons, suggesting that the function of KIF21/KLP-12 family proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is evolutionarily conserved.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>KLP-12 is a plus-end directed motor that represses microtubule polymerization</title><p>Mammalian orthologs of KLP-12, KIF21A, and KIF21B, regulate the axon length by inhibiting the microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Riel et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, KLP-12 may also inhibit the microtubule polymerization to restrict the length of axons. To directly visualize the KLP-12 function on the microtubules, we performed the in vitro TIRF assays. Since the neck-coiled-coil sequence of KLP-12 is not sufficient to form a stable dimer to display the processive motility in vitro, we intended to introduce the leucine zipper (LZ) of GCN4 and GFP right after KLP-12 (1-393) for dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tomishige et al., 2002</xref>), which is a similar technique used in the previous kinesin-4 family motor study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>: KLP-12–LZ–GFP).

KLP-12–LZ–GFP represented a concentration dependent decrease of the microtubule growth rate at its plus-end. In the absence of the KLP-12–LZ–GFP, the microtubule grew at the rate of 1.19±0.35 µm/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Increasing amounts of KLP-12–LZ–GFP inhibited the microtubule growth rate, with mean rates of 1.00 µm/min at concentrations of 30 nM and 0.77 µm/min at 300 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). On the other hand, microtubule depolymerization rate was not affected by KLP-12–LZ–GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). The frequencies of microtubule catastrophe events and rescue events were slightly reduced in the presence of KLP-12–LZ–GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G1</xref>).

To achieve these dual functions, kinesin-4 must bind to the microtubule lattice and the microtubule end to catalyze ATP. We thus next focused on the monomeric motor domain of the KLP-12 (KLP-12(M)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), investigating its ATPase activity in the presence of microtubules or tubulin heterodimers. We used GTP- and GDP- tubulin heterodimers to investigate the biochemical properties of KLP-12 at the plus-end of microtubules since the plus-end of microtubules is curved due to the lack of lateral interactions between protofilaments, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Steady-state ATPase kinetics of KLP-12(M) were examined in the presence of taxol-stabilized microtubules (=microtubule lattice), GTP-tubulins (mimic of the growing microtubule end), and GDP-tubulins (mimic of the shrinking microtubule end) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Switch II (L11-α4-L12-α5-L13) and α6-neck-linker of KIF7 are the most structurally different components from KLP-12 due to the decoupling of switch II conformational change from ATP hydrolysis cycle in KIF7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>).

The corresponding residue of KIF7 is Lys150 similarly acts as asparagine, albeit Leu139 in KIF5B, did not form interaction, therefore Asp140 and Lys281 did not contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The interaction within KLP-12 around Asn151 slightly rearranges the composition of α5 to generate intermolecular interaction between Glu410 of β-tubulin instead of intramolecular interaction with Glu172 of KLP-12. This interacting strategy is basically conserved in KIF2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>In addition to this interaction, KIF2C has another intermolecular contact, which KLP-12 and KIF5B do not have. Arg420 in β5a of KIF2C forms an ionic interaction with Asp414 and Glu417 at the N-terminal side of H12 of β-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This conformation of Arg420 is supported by Leu422 through hydrophobic contact with the side chain stem of Arg420. KLP-12 has His171 instead of Leu422 of KIF2C, showing the repulsive force keeping Arg169, which corresponds to residue Arg420 of KIF2C, away from the acidic residues on H12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). KIF5B has Ser154 in the Arg420 position of KIF2C, resulting in no interaction with H12 of β-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These different types of interactions through H12 result in different rotation angles of β-tubulin.</p><p>In summary, Arg311 and Arg317 of KLP-12 bridge to Glu410 of β-tubulin produces a clockwise rotation of β-tubulin around the motor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). KIF5B does not make an equivalent interaction, so the net result is that KLP-12 bends tubulin by 4.6 degrees more than KIF5B. This configuration is possibly conserved in kinesin-4 subfamily, including KIF4 and KIF7, as expected from the amino acid sequence conservations. KIF2C generated further rotation of β-tubulin, resulting in tubulin’s highest curvature destabilizing the microtubule end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Distinct curvature of tubulin-dimer induced by different kinesin motor domains</title><p>As described above, the different types of kinesin motor domains arrange the different kinesin–tubulin interfaces to produce the distinct curvature of tubulin-dimer. To elucidate how kinesin-4 family KLP-12 affects the overall conformation of the tubulin dimer, kinesin–tubulin complex structures were superimposed on α-tubulin and compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). As a result, obvious differences in β-tubulin positions or rotations were observed among the three kinesins. The tubulin dimer with KIF5B, which generates a growing plus-end, forms the straightest conformation. The tubulin dimer with KIF2C, which is a plus-end destabilizing kinesin, forms the most curved conformation, 6.4 degrees larger than that of KIF5B. Intriguingly, KLP-12 induces intermediate curvature of the tubulin dimer, with the α- and β-tubulin angles being 4.6 degrees more curved than KIF5B. This precise control of tubulin curvature by KLP-12 is achieved by counter-clockwise rotation of α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and clockwise rotation of β-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) around KLP-12, seen from the left side of the protofilament.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Microtubule plus-end control mechanism by kinesin-4.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Superimposition of KLP-12, KIF5B, and KIF2C complexes at α-tubulin.

Biophysical analyses elucidated the plus-end directed motility of KLP-12 and the inhibitory effect of growing microtubules by KLP-12. Biochemical analyses also showed that KLP-12 is similarly active on both the microtubule lattice and the growing microtubule plus-end. Structural studies demonstrated kinesin-4-specific residues at the microtubule-binding interface of KLP-12, adequately increasing the curvature of tubulin-dimers. It might enable the precise curvature of microtubule plus-ends to inhibit microtubule dynamics.</p><p>We analyzed two alleles of <italic>klp-12</italic> mutants. Previous studies have shown that the tiling between the PLM axon and ALM cell body is misregulated in <italic>klp-7</italic> mutant worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Puri et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>klp-7</italic> is a worm orthologue of KIF2C that has microtubule depolymerizing activity. <italic>klp-7</italic> mutant worms have more stable microtubules and show a larger overlap between PLM axon and ALM cell body. We find similar tiling defects in <italic>klp-12</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), but the phenotype is weaker than <italic>klp-7</italic>. This could be explained by the activity of KLP-12 in vitro that KLP-12 does not depolymerize microtubules, instead, inhibits the polymerization, unlike KLP-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Another interesting point is the difference between <italic>klp-12</italic> mutant alleles. A comparison of the null allele <italic>klp-12(tm10890</italic>) and <italic>klp-12(tm5176</italic>), which has a deletion mutation in the tail-encoding exons, shows milder defects in tiling between ALM and PLM. This would be because <italic>klp-12(tm5176</italic>) is a hypomorphic allele that expresses tail-deleted KLP-12 protein. It is consistent with the previous study showing that full activation of KIF21A, an orthologue of KLP-12, requires binding the tail domain with a cell cortex protein KANK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>). We need to test the expression of KLP-12 to verify this hypothesis.</p><p>We should note here the phenotypic difference between the motor and tail defects; the motor defect made the axon wavy and thinly, whereas the tail defect did not change the thickness of axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). There are two possibilities: (I) motor function will be required for proper axon development, or (II) the tail domain without the motor will disable proper axon development. Future studies are required to elucidate this mechanism.</p><p>Steady state ATPase assays of the KLP-12 motor domain in the presence of microtubules or GTP-tubulin dimers elucidated the ATPase activities with comparable affinities to microtubules and GTP-tubulin dimers. Although kinesin-13 expresses stronger binding of GDP-tubulin dimers over microtubules, other kinesin motors bind strongly to microtubules over tubulin dimers, including Xklp1 or KIF19A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bringmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, preferential binding to the growing plus-end of microtubules is one of the important features of KLP-12. However, since ATP hydrolysis detaches KLP-12 from the microtubule ends, the tail domain should be required to tether itself to microtubules to continuously stabilize the plus ends.</p><p>Regarding the ATPase rate, a discrepancy was observed between the single-molecule motility assay and the kinetic study. In the motility assay, the average rate was measured only for motors actively attached to microtubules among the KLP-12 present in the solution. In the kinetics assay, on the other hand, the average speed of all motors on the solution per unit time is calculated. In the former assay, we can detect kinesin-1 movement from 1 nM in solution, whereas KLP-12 movement only from 100 nM or more in the solution. In the latter assay, <italic>K<sub>M, microtubules</sub></italic> of kinesin-1 is only ten times lower than KLP-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). This difference would be responsible for the discrepancy in the ATPase rate. Considering that SEC and crystallographic analysis show that KLP-12 used in this study is at least structurally uniform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), a discrepancy in the ATPase rate may not reflect a difference in microtubule affinity or degradation of motors. Instead, it may come from unknown factors, such as a mixture of motors with an extremely slow or zero ATPase rate.</p><p>From the crystal structural analysis, we identified the specific interactions of KLP-12 for α- and β-tubulins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The contributing residues are mostly conserved among KIF4 and KIF21 subfamilies, suggesting the conserved structural mechanisms. KLP-12 interacts with α-tubulin through the triangle contacts at the N-terminal side of H12 and H4, and β-tubulin at the mid-portion of H12. Kinesin-1 makes single contact with α-tubulin at the N-terminal side of α-tubulin H12 but no contact with β-tubulin. Kinesin-13 binds to α-tubulin at the C-terminal side of H12 through the KVD finger and to β-tubulin at the N-terminal side of H12, in addition to the mid-portion contact. These interactions are summarized in the schematic illustrations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>.</p><p>Kinesin-1 cannot bend the protofilament and allows microtubules to polymerize, whereas kinesin-13 strongly bends the protofilament to depolymerize microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ogawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shima et al., 2018</xref>). KLP-12 expresses the mild effect of protofilament bending, enabling the inhibition of both the polymerization and depolymerization of the microtubules. As summarized previously, changes in the curvature of the peeled plus-ends of microtubules are fundamental to microtubule dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brouhard and Rice, 2014</xref>); less curved plus-end polymerizes the microtubule, more curved plus-end shortens the microtubule, and middle curved plus-end stabilizes the microtubule. In addition to the reported structures of KIF5B with tubulin and KIF2C with tubulin representing polymerizing and depolymerizing plus-end of a microtubule, KLP-12 complexed with tubulin structure filled the missing piece of the structural information of stabilizing plus-end of a microtubule. The other domains, including the tail, would further intricately arrange the bending effects of motor domains.</p><p>In summary, our study provides important structural clues regarding a novel molecular mechanism by which kinesin-4 inhibits microtubule dynamics. This structural model is consistent with the previously reported effects of microtubule elongation or destabilization by the motor domains of various kinesin superfamily proteins.</p></sec><sec

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Robert A Cross (Reviewer #1); Jing Xu (Reviewer #2); Khanh Huy Bui (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that this is a robust and thorough study that warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic> once it has been revised with additional analyses and textual changes. While additional analyses from the in vitro assays constitute the major revision necessary for publication, please go through the reviewer comments carefully and revise and expand the text as necessary. There are multiple areas where additional details or discussion can benefit the paper and other areas where claims should be tempered based on the data presented.</p><p>Specifically, all three reviewers noted that they would like to see additional analyses of KLP-12 in the in vitro TIRF studies. First, does KLP-12 accumulate at the plus ends of the microtubules, either in the TIRF assay with taxol-stabilized microtubules, or in the dynamics assay? It is also important to show the localization of KLP-12 in Figure 2E. If the concentration is too high, the authors should drop the concentration as suggested by Reviewer 3. Second, there are many other parameters that the authors can quantify in their dynamic microtubule assay. Please refer to the comments from all three reviewers to bolster this section. Based on the n reported in the figure legend, the authors should be able to review their data and provide additional analyses and details that would strengthen the paper greatly without performing additional experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a comprehensive effort to find out how members of the kinesin-4 family are able to stabilise microtubule tips so as to suppress both growth and shrinkage. Using crystallography of soluble tubulin in complex with KLP-12, a kinesin-4 from <italic>C. elegans</italic>, electron microscopy, and biochemistry, together with cell biological characterisation of mutants in cultured neurons, the authors argue that kinesin-4 motors exert their effects by stabilising tubulin in a bent conformation that is too straight to depolymerise readily and too bent to insert stably into the lattice.</p><p>The work is interesting but I do have some comments, mostly about the clarity of presentation and argument.</p><p>1. It is proposed that all kinesins-4 make the same interface with tubulin, yet some are motile and others are not. This profound difference is mentioned but little discussed, the focus is all on the ability of kinesins-4 to stably curve tubulin. Yet the ability to bind reversibly to the unbent GDP lattice is also central to (motile) function.</p><p>2. Processive KIF12 LZ dimers move at a kinesin-1-like rate of 800 nm per sec. Assuming one ATP is consumed per step, this implies an ATPase of ~50 per sec per head (50 * 2 * 8nm per sec). The reported maximum monomer rate of 0.16 s<sup>-1</sup> is wildly inconsistent with the dimer walking rate. This is not discussed. The observed 1000x activation is consistent with previous work on kinesin-1.</p><p>3. Does GFP-KLP12 LZ enrich at plus ends? I was hoping to see data from the GFP KIF12 LZ construct in TIRF assays. The walking action of KLP12 could be very important to deliver it to microtubule tips because the KLP12 motor domains prefer free tubulin, which will ordinarily be present at a much greater concentration than that in the splayed protofilaments at the microtubule tips.</p><p>4. GTP tubulin was used in the ATPase assays, but not GDP tubulin. It would be helpful to know if GDP tubulin activates KIF12.</p><p>5. The core of the paper is the new crystal structure with GMPCPP tubulin whose assembly is blocked by DARPIN. As the authors discuss, the new tubulin-KIF12 structure is very similar to the 4HNA (KIF5B.ADP.ALF4) structure. The rms deviation is similar to that between KIF4 and KIF12. The interface with tubulin is very similar. Yet KIF5B is activated by microtubules and not free tubulin, whereas KIF-12 prefers free tubulin. This seems like a problem for the authors' argument – since the data say that despite the kinesin-4 family-specific features of the interface, the KIF-12-tubulin structure is overall very similar indeed to the KIF5B-tubulin structure?</p><p>6. The comparison of the KLP12 interface to KIF5B and KIF2C is helpful, but hard to follow. The ms lacks a clear summary statement of what are the conserved, kinesin-4 family-specific features of the interface. The claim is that KLP12 bends tubulin slightly more than KIF5B, by rotating α-tubulin by 4 degrees, with E420 of α-tubulin as the fulcrum, via the formation of a family-specific salt bridge at K269-E155. In β-tubulin, R311 and R317 bridge to E410, also producing a rotation. KIF5B does not make an equivalent interaction. The net result is that KLP12 bends tubulin by 3 degrees more than KIF5B. Please clarify that this is compatible with the earlier-discussed high similarity of the current structure to 4HNA. Please clarify that the 3 kinesins all rotate tubulin in the same plane. Relatedly it might be helpful to provide a morph animation of tubulin in the three complexes.</p><p>7.

We performed the TIRF assay and observed the behavior of KLP-12 on the taxol-stabilized and dynamic microtubules. In our observation, we have not seen KLP-12 accumulating at the tip of microtubules.

We performed additional experiments and added new data showing the microtubule dynamics (Figure 2E-I). The microtubule growth rate was reduced in the presence of KLP-12, whereas the microtubule depolymerization rate was not affected (Figures 2F and 2H). The frequency of catastrophe events was slightly reduced with KLP-12 (Figure 2I). This is similar to the previous results of KIF21A- or KIF5-bound microtubules, thus, this property is conserved in a broad range of kinesins. The frequency of rescue events was reduced as well (Figure 2G). It rises two possibilities; one is that KLP-12 suppresses microtubule polymerization, and another is the indirect effect induced by the reduction of MT catastrophe events. We have included these in the result section (page 9, line 202-204; Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a comprehensive effort to find out how members of the kinesin-4 family are able to stabilise microtubule tips so as to suppress both growth and shrinkage.

We have compared our KLP-12 structure with other reported kinesin-4 structures (revised Figure 4). In summary, KLP-12 (KIF21 subfamily) and KIF4 (KIF4 subfamily) take very similar structures, and critical residues for microtubule-end binding are highly conserved between them. These residues are partially conserved in KIF7, albeit switch II conformation of KIF7 is different from KIF4 and KIF21 due to the decoupling of switch II from switch I (nucleotide-binding pocket). It results in loss of motility in KIF7 and the behavior of the stay in the plus-end of the microtubule to inhibit dynamics (Jiang et al., Dev. Cell 2019). We have included these in the result section (pages 13-14, lines 321-344; Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

At 50 nM, KIF1A(1-393)::mSca (KIF1A motor domain fused with mScarlet) fully decorates microtubules. In contrast, the binding of KLP-12-LZ-GFP (KLP-12(1-393)LZ::GFP in the figure) sparsely binds to microtubules. This property is similar to KIF21A/B (Vaart et al., Dev Cell, 2013; van Riel et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2017).

We inserted 50 µm scale bars into figures 1D and 1F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1G: Please indicate the sample size, what the horizontal bars in the graph are, what statistical analysis was used, and what the associated P-value is.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included sample size, P value, and statistical method in the figure legend.

Could the authors explain in more detail what mutations were made and why, as well as their predicted effects on the protein structure/function?</p></disp-quote><p>The mutant is following; tm10890 is a mutant that induces deletion of the motor domain. Because the mutation causes frameshift, tm10890 should be a null allele. A mutant tm5176 induces deletion of WD repeats. As tm5176 deletes the C-terminal region, the mutant should express deletion mutant. We described these explanations in the legend for Figure 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, is there a way to verify that the mutant proteins are indeed expressed in truncated form or completely missing?</p></disp-quote><p>We need some antibodies to determine whether these mutants are totally null or a truncated form of the mutant protein is expressed. Because the focus of this study is the structure of KLP-12, we would like to reserve this point as a discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Microtubule dynamics are generally assessed using four parameters: growth rate, depolymerization rate, catastrophe frequency and rescue frequency. What is the effect of KLP-12-LZ-GFP on the parameters that were not measured?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for pointing out the important issue. We found growth rate is the most affected parameter. Depolymerization rate was not significantly affected and the frequency of MT catastrophe events was slightly reduced (Figure 2H). This is similar to the result of KIF21A- or KIF5-bound microtubules. Thus, the property is conserved in a broad range of kinesins. Frequency of rescue events was reduced as well (Figure 2H). One possibility is that KLP-12 suppresses microtubule polymerization. Another possibility is the indirect effect induced by reduced MT catastrophe events. We have included these in the result section and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, since KLP-12 decreases growth rate, does it also decrease the length of microtubules?</p></disp-quote><p>We think it is difficult to quantitatively compare the length of microtubules in vitro because of the following reasons; (1) the length of GMPCPP seeds varies (2) the length of polymerized microtubules strongly depends on the duration of polymerization and (3) the length of microtubules polymerized from seeds is not constant because of dynamic instability. We think the growth rate is a better parameter that is not affected by these variations (Figure 2F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What is the behaviour of KLP-12-LZ-GFP on dynamic microtubules? In figure 2B, which was done on taxol-stabilized microtubules, the motors seem to fall off the microtubule at the end. Alternatively, could the authors discuss how they think the motor decreases growth rate by walking along a microtubule and falling off it at the end?</p></disp-quote><p>We added the motility of KLP-12-LZ-GFP on dynamic microtubules. We found KLP-12-LZ-GFP does not stay at the tip of microtubules and falls off at the end.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2 E only shows 1 concentration, can the author show more than 1 concentration?</p></disp-quote><p>We showed two concentrations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I wonder whether there is any mutation which is mentioned in the literature that can be mapped onto the motor domain?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not know of any other mutation so far.</p></body></sub-article></article>
