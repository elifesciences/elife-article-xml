cells competent for tumorigenesis receive the same oncogenic stimuli. These observations suggest an active selection process for tumor-initiating cells. Here, we use quantitative mRNA- and miR-Seq to determine the impact of <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> on the transcriptome of keratinocytes. We discover that <italic>microRNA-203</italic> is downregulated by <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>. Using a knockout mouse model, we demonstrate that loss of <italic>microRNA-203</italic> promotes selection and expansion of tumor-initiating cells. Conversely, restoration of <italic>microRNA-203</italic> using an inducible model potently inhibits proliferation of these cells. We comprehensively identify <italic>microRNA-203</italic> targets required for <italic>Hras</italic>-initiated tumorigenesis. These targets include critical regulators of the <italic>Ras</italic> pathway and essential genes required for cell division. This study establishes a role for the loss of <italic>microRNA-203</italic> in promoting selection and expansion of <italic>Hras</italic> mutated cells and identifies a mechanism through which <italic>microRNA-203</italic> antagonizes <italic>Hras</italic>-mediated tumorigenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07004.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07004.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07004.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA mutations occur and accumulate during an individual's lifetime. Often these changes are harmless. But some mutations—called driver mutations—can trigger the formation of tumors. This is often because these mutations allow the cells to grow faster than normal cells. Mutations in genes in the <italic>Ras</italic> gene family are among the most common driver mutations found in human cancers. These common mutations lead to the uncontrolled activation of genes that are normally tightly controlled, which in turn allows the cells to divide more and live for longer: these are two key features of cancer cells.</p><p>So, how are <italic>Ras</italic> genes and the genes that they control regulated to prevent such dangerous over activation? One mechanism rests on binding sites in their messenger RNA sequence that are recognized by smaller RNA molecules called microRNAs. RNA molecules are created when genes are transcribed. Some RNAs, called messenger RNAs, are then decoded to create proteins. Many other RNAs, including microRNAs, do not code for proteins, but instead bind to many messenger RNA targets, and repress their ability to be decoded into proteins. Three genes, called <italic>Hras</italic>, <italic>Kras</italic>, and <italic>Nras</italic>, are regulated in this way by numerous microRNAs, which together act to dampen the normal activities of these genes.</p><p>Riemondy et al. investigate how a cancer-promoting mutation in the <italic>Hras</italic> gene affects the activities of microRNAs in mouse skin cells in culture. By measuring RNA levels, the experiments reveal that skin cells carrying this mutation produce significantly lower levels of what is normally the most highly produced microRNA in the skin. This microRNA, called <italic>microRNA-203</italic>, acts to limit the proliferation of skin cells when these cells are dividing rapidly. When the gene encoding <italic>microRNA-203</italic> was deleted in mice, the skin cells proliferated more. These mice also developed more skin tumors than normal mice when they were exposed to cancer-causing chemicals. When the gene for <italic>microRNA-203</italic> was added into skin cells carrying the <italic>Hras</italic> mutation and then activated, the cells both divided less and, as a results, grew less. This indicates that <italic>microRNA-203</italic> could prevent cancerous cells from expanding in number, a key event in the initiation of tumors.</p><p>Riemondy et al. also used a variety of approaches to identify the molecules targeted by <italic>microRNA-203</italic> in the skin, and reveal that it targets multiple signaling pathways, including components of the Ras pathway, to suppress cell proliferation. Together, these findings highlight <italic>microRNA-203</italic> as a potential source of new treatments to prevent or slow tumor growth in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07004.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07004.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>tumor suppressor</kwd><kwd>Hras</kwd><kwd>skin cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR059697</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riemondy</surname><given-names>Kent</given-names></name><name><surname>Yi</surname><given-names>Rui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society (ACS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>124718-RSG-13-197-01-DDC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yi</surname><given-names>Rui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR066703</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yi</surname><given-names>Rui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA052607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torchia</surname><given-names>Enrique C</given-names></name><name><surname>Roop</surname><given-names>Dennis R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30AR057212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riemondy</surname><given-names>Kent</given-names></name><name><surname>Roop</surname><given-names>Dennis R</given-names></name><name><surname>Yi</surname><given-names>Rui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibition of <italic>microRNA-203</italic> by oncogenic <italic>HRas</italic> mutations promotes skin cancer initiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent efforts in comprehensively sequencing human cancer genomes have confirmed ∼140 protein-coding genes that, when mutated, can drive tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vogelstein et al., 2013</xref>). When genome sequencing data were utilized to construct the history of cancer cells in breast cancer, it was revealed that a considerable amount of ‘molecular time’ exists between the common ancestors that harbor the great majority of driver mutations and the phenotypically identified cancer cells that compose the bulk of the tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</xref>). In support of these observations, lineage tracing experiments conducted in genetically engineered mouse models revealed that only a few clones give rise to tumors whereas a vast majority of mutated cells are unable to sustain tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Driessens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schepers et al., 2012</xref>). These results suggest that even after the acquisition of key driver mutations in the nascent cancer cells, these cells must still undergo continuous evolution and likely clonal selection before developing into clinically apparent tumors. To begin to understand the molecular basis underlying such selection, we examined papilloma formation driven by oncogenic <italic>Hras</italic> in the skin, a well-characterized model where <italic>Hras</italic> has been shown to initiate the formation of tumors that clonally evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Driessens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck and Blanpain, 2013</xref>). Oncogenic <italic>Ras</italic> mutations are some of the most frequently detected driver mutations in human cancer. Among the three <italic>Ras</italic> genes (<italic>H</italic>-, <italic>K</italic>-, and <italic>N-ras</italic>), <italic>Hras</italic> is commonly mutated in tumors originated from stratified epithelial tissues including squamous cell carcinoma in the skin, head, and neck cancer as well as bladder cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bos, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agrawal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stransky et al., 2011</xref>). Experimental and genomic sequencing studies have revealed that the vast majority of <italic>Ras</italic> mutations are missense, point mutations at amino acid residues glycine 12 (G12), glycine 13 (G13), or glutamine 61 (Q61) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bos, 1989</xref>). Structural and biochemical studies have further confirmed that all of these mutations generally interfere with the GTP binding pocket and compromise the GTPase activity of <italic>Ras</italic> proteins. In turn, these mutations lead to uncontrolled activation of downstream effectors including Raf/MEK/ERK and PI(3)K pathways, resulting in sustained cell survival and proliferation observed in human cancers. Because of the prominent role of <italic>Ras</italic> mutations in human cancer, extensive efforts have been devoted to uncover and subsequently target downstream pathways that are regulated by <italic>Ras</italic> mutations. However, the immediate impact of <italic>Ras</italic> mutations on the transcriptome, in particular, with regards to microRNAs (miRNAs) remains unclear.</p><p>miRNAs are a class of small, noncoding RNA species that are involved in virtually all biological processes examined in mammals including mouse and human. These regulatory RNA molecules function by repressing the protein producing ability of mRNA targets through destabilization of mRNAs and inhibition of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartel, 2009</xref>). miRNAs typically target a large number of mRNAs in a dosage- and cell context-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mukherji et al., 2011</xref>). As prominent proto-oncogenes, <italic>Ras</italic> mutations have long been recognized to interact with the miRNA pathway. Indeed, <italic>Hras</italic>, <italic>Kras</italic>, and <italic>Nras</italic> all harbor multiple binding sites for the <italic>let-7</italic> miRNA, a founding member of miRNAs, in their 3′UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnson et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, impaired miRNA biogenesis in the form of <italic>Dicer1</italic> disruption has been shown to be a tumor-suppressing mechanism for the development of <italic>Kras</italic>-induced lung cancer in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kumar et al., 2007</xref>). A number of individual miRNAs were also found to function as modifiers for <italic>Ras</italic>-induced tumorigenesis that include <italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>-29,</italic> and <italic>miR-17∼92</italic> as tumor-promoting miRNAs and <italic>miR-34, -15/16</italic>, and <italic>miR-143/145</italic> as tumor-suppressing miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kasinski and Slack, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iorio and Croce, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mendell and Olson, 2012</xref>). Collectively, these seminal studies demonstrate unequivocally that the miRNA pathway and individual miRNAs play important roles in <italic>Ras</italic>-induced tumorigenesis. However, it is unclear how <italic>Ras</italic> mutations, usually the tumor-initiating drivers, directly alter the landscape of miRNA expression during tumorigenesis. Importantly, it is also unknown whether the changes in miRNA expression play a role in the selection of oncogenic <italic>Ras</italic>-transformed cells during tumor initiation. Finally, the lack of a comprehensive survey of high-confidence miRNA targets that may play a role downstream of <italic>Ras</italic> mutations hinders our mechanistic understanding and limits the potential to develop miRNA-based therapeutics.</p><p>In this study, we utilized our recently improved quantitative miR-Seq techniques to examine the impact of an oncogenic <italic>Hras</italic> mutation (<italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup><italic>)</italic> on both mRNA and miRNA expression. We discovered that <italic>miR-203</italic>, the most highly expressed miRNA in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jackson et al., 2013</xref>), is downregulated by <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>. Using both knockout (KO) and inducible models, we provide evidence for an important role of <italic>miR-203</italic> in restricting expansion of oncogenic <italic>Hras</italic>-transformed cells in vitro and in vivo. We comprehensively surveyed skin-specific targets of <italic>miR-203</italic> and identified a number of novel targets that have important implications for <italic>Hras</italic>-mediated tumorigenesis. Our results suggest that <italic>miR-203</italic> plays a tumor-suppressing role in inhibiting selection and expansion of tumor-initiating cells early in tumor development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> profoundly deregulates the mRNA and miRNA transcriptome in the skin</title><p>Oncogenic mutation of the <italic>Hras</italic> gene is one of the initiating drivers in the development of benign papillomas and malignant squamous cell carcinomas in murine skin chemical carcinogenesis. However, the molecular consequences defining the cellular changes that accompany expansion of oncogenic <italic>Hras</italic>-transformed keratinocytes to initiate papillomas remain elusive. We first investigated the consequences of <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> activation on the mRNA transcriptome using a modified form of PolyA+ RNA-Seq, known as 3P-Seq, or 3seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Compared to traditional RNA-Seq, 3Seq allows both quantification of mRNA transcripts and detection of changes in alternative 3′ UTR formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). To examine the immediate impact of <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> on primary skin cells, we used primary keratinocytes isolated from newborn skin and performed 3Seq after <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> transduction. We did not observe widespread shortening or alternative formation of 3′UTRs, which are often ascribed to oncogenic transformation when comparing tumor cell lines to normal cells (data not shown). This is similar to our previous observation that alternative 3′UTR usage is infrequent within the skin lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Over 1100 transcripts were differently expressed (two-fold change and FDR &lt;0.05) in keratinocytes expressing <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>, compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Gene ontology functional analysis revealed profound deregulation in three core processes by <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>: activation of cellular migration, upregulation of pro-angiogenic pathways, and suppression of the terminal differentiation program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). All of these three processes are identified as hallmarks of human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). The observed widespread changes in the transcriptome also endorse the driver role of <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> in skin tumorigenesis. Importantly, transcripts upregulated by <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> in our primary keratinocytes strongly and significantly overlapped with the putative cancer stem cell signatures obtained from murine squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schober and Fuchs, 2011</xref>). In addition, transcripts upregulated by <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> significantly overlapped with transcripts known to be targets of the <italic>c-Fos</italic> transcription factor in a genetic model of SCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durchdewald et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, known core components of the <italic>Hras</italic> signaling pathway were also among the differentially detected genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bild et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Secondly, <italic>miR-21</italic> was strongly induced becoming the most highly expressed miRNA, consistent with its direct activation by oncogenic <italic>Ras</italic> reported in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Talotta et al., 2009</xref>). The upregulation of <italic>miR-21</italic> is also consistent with its well-appreciated oncogenic function in skin cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darido et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>miR-146</italic> was also induced by <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>. However, this miRNA is expressed 2-orders of magnitude lower than miR-21, suggesting that its upregulation may have limited contribution to <italic>Hras</italic>-initiated tumorigenesis at this early stage.</p><p>We further measured mature <italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>miR-203</italic>, and <italic>miR-205</italic> RNAs by qPCR. In support of the quantitative performance of our miR-Seq, the differential expression of all three miRNAs measured by qPCR was nearly identical to the quantification by our miR-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). To initially probe the mechanism through which <italic>HRAS</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> suppresses <italic>miR-203</italic> expression, we examined the level of <italic>miR-203</italic> primary transcripts. We previously characterized the transcribed genomic region of <italic>miR-203</italic> including the promoter region and transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jackson et al., 2013</xref>). Because the primary transcript <italic>of miR-203</italic> harbors a polyadenylation [Poly(A)] signal and generates a Poly(A) tail, we directly quantified the abundance of the primary transcripts by counting the 3′end reads of the primary miRNA obtained by 3seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This result was further confirmed by qPCR measurement specific to the <italic>pri-miR-203</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The degree of downregulation for both mature and primary <italic>miR-203</italic> transcripts was similar as judged by these two independent assays. Collectively, we conclude that the repression of <italic>miR-203</italic> by <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> is most likely mediated by suppressing the production of primary <italic>miR-203</italic> transcripts at an early stage of oncogenic cellular transformation.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07004.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>miR-203</italic> is strongly suppressed in mouse and human SCCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) qPCR and small-RNA-Seq independently validate downregulation of miR-203 and upregulation of miR-21 driven by oncogenic <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> (n = 3 biological rep. qPCR, n = 2 small-RNA-Seq, mean ± SEM displayed, *p &lt; 0.05, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test two-sided).

We first examined <italic>miR-203</italic> expression in benign papillomas. Consistent with our in vitro results, <italic>miR-203</italic> expression was absent from epithelial compartments adjacent to tumor stroma, the region where putative cancer stem cells reside. Although we also observed moderately expressed <italic>miR-203</italic> in tumor regions with evidence of cellular differentiation (keratin pearls and large differentiated morphology), the levels of <italic>miR-203</italic> was considerably lower in these regions compared to the suprabasal cells of adjacent normal skin, where <italic>miR-203</italic> is normally expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

In these human skin SCC samples, <italic>miR-203</italic> was already downregulated at the onset of tumorigenesis and progressively lost during the course of tumor progression, similar to the pattern observed in the mouse models. In the poorly differentiated SCC samples, the <italic>miR-203</italic> signal was completely absent, yet readily detectable in surrounding hyperplastic or normal epidermal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–O</xref>). In addition, we mined publically available data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and detected a significant reduction in <italic>miR-203</italic> and an elevation of <italic>miR-21</italic> in head and neck SCC samples compared to patient-matched normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>). Altogether, these results corroborate our observations in mouse models and validate the strong correlation between the loss of <italic>miR-203</italic> and the development of skin cancer at multiple stages of tumorigenesis.

Because <italic>miR-203</italic> begins to be expressed by E13 when the epidermis begins to stratify, we examined the proliferation rate and thickness of embryonic skin from E16 to P4. At E16, we observed a mild increase in cell proliferation in the KO, as measured by BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Although the difference in BrdU incorporation did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.07), the thickness of the KO epidermis was significantly increased, compared to WT littermates (p = 0.03). Interestingly, the increase in epidermal thickness was most prominent at early stages (E16 and E17) and waned as skin development progressed (P4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

GO-analysis demonstrated that genes involved in regulation of mitotic cell cycle, DNA synthesis, and metabolism were prominently downregulated upon <italic>miR-203</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). <italic>miR-203</italic> upregulation in both epidermal and hair follicle progenitors resulted in strong suppression of transcripts harboring perfect seed matches to <italic>miR-203</italic> in their 3′UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among them, transcripts containing the 8-mer matches were strongly suppressed, compared to transcripts without a <italic>miR-203</italic> seed match (p = 1.5 × 10<sup>−23</sup> for epidermis and 2.6 × 10<sup>−25</sup> for hair follicle, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast to <italic>miR-203</italic> overexpression, deletion of <italic>miR-203</italic> did not perturb transcript levels genome-wide as strongly as observed under the induced conditions and offered little insight into miR-203's function based upon GO analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). However, despite the relatively mild changes in the transcript levels in the KO skin and primary keratinocytes, transcripts that contain 8-mer 3′UTR matches were still more significantly upregulated than transcripts without any <italic>miR-203</italic> seed matches (p &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Lastly, a ranked sum analysis that ranked genes based on expression changes correlated with the levels of <italic>miR-203</italic> showed that genes with the 8-mer or 7-mer seed ranked significantly higher than those transcripts without seed matches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>By demanding all potential targets be upregulated in all the <italic>miR-203</italic> KO samples and downregulated in all the <italic>miR-203</italic>-induced samples, we identified 294 transcripts as our candidates for <italic>miR-203</italic> targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Among the top 20 most differentially expressed transcripts when <italic>miR-203</italic> was deleted or induced, 15 of them contain at least one 7-mer or 8-mer match in their 3′UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>). In support of this approach, an unbiased de novo motif search using the 3′UTRs of these 294 transcripts revealed that the most enriched motif (ACAUUUCA, p = 1 × 10<sup>−13</sup>) perfectly matched to nucleotide position 2–9 of <italic>miR-203</italic>, the 8-mer seed sequences of <italic>miR-203</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Additional statistical analysis of the number of genes containing perfect 3′UTR matches to the 7-mer or 8-mer seed among these candidates revealed significant enrichment over the background distribution among mRNAs expressed in the skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Therefore, we selected genes containing 7-mer or 8-mer seed matched 3′UTR sites as <italic>miR-203</italic> target candidates and obtained a collection of 100 potential <italic>miR-203</italic> targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>We then applied HITS-CLIP to interrogate the direct interaction between <italic>miR-203</italic> and its mRNA targets. We generated four <italic>Ago2</italic> HITS-CLIP libraries from primary WT keratinocytes, which abundantly express <italic>miR-203</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). <italic>Ago2</italic>-RNA complexes were isolated from a region extending from approximately 110 kd–130 kd as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Sequencing libraries from <italic>Ago2</italic> HITS-CLIP samples were generated and analyzed using previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore et al., 2014</xref>). The HITS-CLIP faithfully captured miRNA species expressed in keratinocytes, including <italic>miR-203</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B,E</xref>). Overall our HITS-CLIP reads and clusters alignment were similar to previous published results with a significant portion aligned to 3′UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>). To further validate our approach, we analyzed the positional enrichment of miRNA seed sequences within the 3′UTR HITS-CLIP clusters and detected strong enrichment over dinucleotide shuffled cluster sequences or randomly distributed 3′UTR regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Additionally, de novo motif searching for 8mer motifs identified the seed sequences of miRNAs that are highly expressed in keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The motif corresponding to <italic>miR-203</italic> detected by the HITS-CLIP was also ACAUUUCA (p = 1 × 10<sup>−19</sup>), identical to the motif detected by our transcriptome analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). A total of 113 mRNAs were detected to have <italic>miR-203</italic> seed containing <italic>Ago2</italic> binding sites. We next examined the ranked sum expression of these targets and determined that transcripts with <italic>Ago2</italic> HITS-CLIP <italic>miR-203</italic> binding sites were ranked significantly higher compared to non-targeted mRNAs, indicating that many of these targets are functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Overall, <italic>miR-203</italic> targets identified in the meta-analysis were enriched in the upregulated transcripts in <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>-transformed keratinocytes, compared to non-targeted transcripts, consistent with the downregulation of <italic>miR-203</italic> in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Among these targets, we were intrigued by the observation that multiple regulators of the <italic>Ras</italic> signaling pathway and critical factors for DNA replication and cell cycle progression were among our high confidence targets and additionally were among the most upregulated <italic>miR-203</italic> targets in <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>-transformed keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Taken together, these results validate <italic>Hbegf</italic> and <italic>Pola1</italic> as direct targets of <italic>miR-203</italic>. We hereby propose a model in which <italic>miR-203</italic> restricts selection and expansion of <italic>Hras</italic>-mutated cells by repressing multiple targets, a subset of which are involved in the <italic>Ras</italic> signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Identification and experimental validation of driver gene mutations have been instrumental for our understanding of cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vogelstein et al., 2013</xref>). Although it is clear that not all cells harboring driver gene mutations develop into tumors, the mechanism of clonal selection within cells that have acquired driver gene mutations remains poorly understood. In this study, we used an oncogenic <italic>Hras</italic>-induced tumor model to determine the molecular consequences of this oncogenic driver mutation and to study the selection process. We quantitatively measured the impact of oncogenic <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> on the landscape of mRNA and miRNA expression. Whereas our mRNA-Seq data confirmed the profound ability of <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> in promoting cellular transformation, our miR-Seq data revealed new insights into the dynamic changes in highly expressed miRNAs caused by <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In particular, the downregulation of <italic>miR-203</italic>, one of the most highly expressed miRNAs in the skin, likely occurs at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). By examining tumor samples obtained from both mouse and human at multiple stages, we showed that the downregulation of <italic>miR-203</italic> is associated with tumor initiation and progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–P</xref>). To determine the role of <italic>miR-203</italic> in this process, we generated a KO mouse model. Initial insights into the function of <italic>miR-203</italic> came from the analysis of <italic>miR-203</italic> null epidermis during skin development. Whereas we and others have shown the potent inhibition of epidermal proliferation by <italic>miR-203</italic> with gain-of-function approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lena et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jackson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benaich et al., 2014</xref>), it is unknown how the loss of <italic>miR-203</italic> affects the skin and mouse development in general. By analyzing the KO mouse, we revealed an early, albeit mild, hyperproliferative phenotype in the embryonic but not postnatal skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–I</xref>). However, when we subjected <italic>miR-203</italic> WT and null cells obtained from postnatal skin for their colony-forming ability, we observed an increased ability of the <italic>miR-203</italic> null cells to give rise to colony-forming cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J,K</xref>). This observation was indicative of a role for <italic>miR-203</italic> in restricting the expansion of highly proliferative cells. Of note, we did not observe any defects in the formation of the differentiated layers of the skin in the <italic>miR-203</italic> KO mice. This suggests that the primary function of <italic>miR-203</italic> is to restrict cell proliferation but not to promote epidermal differentiation per se. When we examined the role of <italic>miR-203</italic> during DMBA/TPA-mediated chemical carcinogenesis, we observed strong increase in the number of papillomas formed in the KO skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). In vitro colony formation assays with serial passages further illustrated the enhanced ability for selecting tumor-initiating cells with <italic>miR-203</italic> KO cells when subjected to <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, due to tumor resistance of our C57BL/6 strain, we were unable to determine if the loss of <italic>miR-203</italic> also promotes malignant transition. Of note, a recent study showed interesting results that restoration of <italic>miR-203</italic> suppresses human SCC metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benaich et al., 2014</xref>). Collectively, our results provide experimental evidence for an important role of <italic>miR-203</italic> in suppressing clonal selection and expansion of <italic>Hras</italic>-mutated nascent cancer cells.</p><p>A major challenge in understanding miRNA functions is to identify their high-confidence targets globally. To this end, we employed two independent approaches: transcriptome analysis with our KO and inducible models and direct miRNA target capture by <italic>Ago2</italic> HITS-CLIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Importantly, with our expansive data set, we confirmed that <italic>miR-203</italic> utilizes the 5′ seed sequences to target perfectly matched sequences located on the 3′UTRs of its target genes. Consistent with recent genome-wide studies for the impact of miRNA on mRNA levels and translation efficiency in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eichhorn et al., 2014</xref>), we found no evidence for global changes of translational efficiency in the absence of <italic>miR-203</italic>, one of the most highly expressed miRNAs in the skin. However, we also noted that <italic>Trp63</italic>, a well-established <italic>miR-203</italic> target, showed little change at the mRNA levels under all conditions (not shown). Our analysis with differential gene expression did not identify <italic>Trp63</italic> as a <italic>miR-203</italic> target. In contrast, the recognition of the 3′UTR site of <italic>Trp63</italic> by <italic>miR-203</italic> was robustly detected by the HITS-CLIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, it is likely that our identification of <italic>miR-203</italic> targets based on the transcriptome analysis alone was conservative. More studies will be required to further integrate direct miRNA target capture with transcriptome analysis for miRNA target identification. Nevertheless, we still observed strong enrichment of <italic>miR-203</italic> targets in genes required for cell proliferation. These high-confidence targets illustrate the broad targeting of cell proliferation by <italic>miR-203</italic> and suggest mechanisms by which loss of <italic>miR-203</italic> can facilitate the expansion of oncogenic <italic>Hras</italic>-transformed cells. These new insights point to the potential of utilizing <italic>miR-203</italic> to simultaneously target multiple effectors required for cell division in human cancers. We also note that <italic>miR-203</italic> is known to antagonize human papillomaviruses (HPV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Melar-New and Laimins, 2010</xref>). Our identification of <italic>Pola1</italic>, a critical cellular gene required for HPV genome replication, as a target of <italic>miR-203</italic> may provide a potential mechanism for miR-203-mediated antagonism against HPV infection. Finally, the relatively mild requirement for <italic>miR-203</italic> in slowly proliferating cells suggests that a reduction or increase in the level of <italic>miR-203</italic> may be well tolerated by most normal cells. This unexpected discovery could be further explored to determine <italic>miR-203</italic>'s therapeutic potential in treating certain types of epithelial cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>3seq library construction</title><p>3′seq libraries were constructed using methods described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).

Clusters were next annotated to gene features in a hierarchical manner in which clusters were annotated to protein coding RefSeq 3′ UTRs (with 5 kbp extension allowed), RefSeq CDS regions, RefSeq 5′ UTRs, Ensemble ncRNA regions, and RefSeq intron regions. Clusters not found in these regions were annotated as intergenic clusters. For predicting miRNA target sites, 3′UTR cluster sequences were searched for 6mer seed-sequence matches for miRNA species that accounted for 90% of miRNAs expressed in epidermis based on small-RNA sequencing.

Negative control data sets were constructed to analyze the enrichment of genes containing <italic>miR-203</italic> seed matches with the following criteria, randomly selected genes from the list of detected transcripts in the meta-analysis, or genes that have a positive correlation to <italic>miR-203</italic> expression (downregulated in <italic>miR-203</italic> knockout data sets and upregulated in <italic>miR-203</italic> overexpression data sets).</p><p>In order to compare gain-of-function and loss-of-function data sets in aggregate, a ranked correlation to <italic>miR-203</italic> metric was calculated. Transcripts were assigned a rank in each knockout data set with the most upregulated gene given a rank of 1. Transcripts were next assigned a rank in each overexpression data set with the most downregulated gene given a rank of 1. The ranked values from each of the 5 data sets were then summed and ranked with the transcript most upregulated upon <italic>miR-203</italic> ablation and downregulated upon overexpression being assigned a value of 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Hierarchical clustering, GO-term analysis, GSEA, 3′UTR motif-searching</title><p>Normalized transcript abundances (expressed as Reads Per Million) were used for mean-centered unsupervised hierarchical clustering using Cluster 3.0 software. For 3seq data, only transcripts with at least twofold change were selected and for miRNA data, only miRNAs with at least an expression level of 1000 RPM and at least a twofold change were selected for visualization in JavaTree View. GO-term enrichment analysis was performed by DAVID using Gene-IDs as input, with analysis being performed using GO biological processes data sets. GSEA analysis was performed using ranked expression values for the displayed data set, and genesets were selected from the referenced publications. De novo motif searching was performed using the HOMER package to search for 7 or 8mer motifs in RefSeq 3′UTR sequences for selected genesets. For genes with multiple 3′UTR isoforms, the longest 3′UTR was selected for motif searching. miRNA seed-sequence searches in <italic>Ago2</italic>-HITS-CLIP clusters were performed with a Python script using regular expressions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data</title><p>Head and Neck SCC miRNA-Seq data were obtained from the TCGA <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/">https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/</ext-link> (Download date 10/23/2014).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Chi Dang, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor has compiled the following critique and list of specific comments to help you prepare a revised submission:</p><p>The manuscript by Riemondy et al. describes an analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression in mouse keratinocytes transformed by <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> expression. They report the repression of <italic>miR-203</italic> by oncogenic H-Ras in squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, purporting that the stem cell pool is affected. This work emanates from previous work connecting <italic>miR-203</italic> to skin stem cell biology. Through loss and gain-of-function studies, the authors document the tumor suppressive role of <italic>miR-203</italic>, however, the mechanistic basis for the growth inhibitory role of <italic>miR-203</italic> is less well established in this study. The authors performed a large number of transcriptome-wide analyses on <italic>miR-203</italic>-deficient and overexpressing cells (RNA-seq, microarray, ribosome profiling, CLIP-seq) in an attempt to identify the mechanisms underlying the phenotypic effects they observed. Unfortunately, these studies were not highly informative, especially in the case of <italic>miR-203</italic>-/- cells, where only very minor gene expression changes were observed. Two targets of <italic>miR-203</italic> were documented and their loss of function diminishes cell viability, but whether this is H-Ras specific is not established. That is, whether knockdown of <italic>Pola1</italic> affect non-transformed cells was not specifically addressed, since the authors suggest that <italic>Pola1</italic> is involved in the 'Ras signaling pathway.' The mechanism by which activated H-Ras silence <italic>miR-203</italic> expression was also not addressed. Notwithstanding these concerns, the work appears quite extensive and thorough and therefore could be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The strength of the paper is the novel demonstration, through genetic deletion studies, that <italic>miR-203</italic> functions as a bona fide tumor suppressor in vivo. These findings are nicely correlated with in vitro data, establishing the ability of <italic>miR-203</italic> to modulate <italic>Hras</italic>-mediated transformation.</p><p>1) The authors should simplify their presentation of the genomic data and be more strategic about which datasets they include in a revised manuscript, including only those datasets and bioinformatic analyses that offer clear mechanistic insight.</p><p>2) More mice should be analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-G</xref>, especially at the E16 time-point when only 2 embryos were examined. The trend towards increased BrdU/EdU incorporation may then become significant, which would be an important finding since this is the only potential phenotype in the intact knockout animals. With the currently presented data, it is an overstatement to claim that “<italic>miR-203</italic> functions as a gatekeeper to limit cell division when the proliferation rate is high during early embryonic skin development…”</p><p>3) Where are the data that show that “genes involved in regulation of mitotic cell cycle, DNA synthesis, and metabolism were prominently downregulated upon <italic>miR-203</italic> induction” (the subsection “Comprehensive identification of <italic>miR-203</italic> targets reveals regulation of the Ras signaling pathway”, second paragraph)? Was an unbiased method such as GSEA or gene ontology employed?</p><p>4) Based on the data presented in this manuscript, it is an overstatement to claim that “<italic>miR-203</italic> directly targets the Ras-mediated signaling pathway” (end of the subsection “Comprehensive identification of <italic>miR-203</italic> targets reveals regulation of the Ras signaling pathway”). At best, a few targets that contribute to multiple pro-proliferative pathways were identified. It is plausible that <italic>miR-203</italic> exerts its effects via the coordinated, although minor, downregulation of a broad set of targets, some of which include members of the Ras pathway.</p><p>5) shRNA knockdown experiments with putative targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F-G</xref>) should be performed in <italic>Hras</italic>-transformed <italic>miR-203</italic> +/+ and -/- cells to see if these targets are relevant to transformation in these settings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07004.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors should simplify their presentation of the genomic data and be more strategic about which datasets they include in a revised manuscript, including only those datasets and bioinformatic analyses that offer clear mechanistic insight.</italic></p><p>We thank you for the suggestion. We have now revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, in which we used an extensive set of genomic analyses to interrogate the impact of <italic>miR-203</italic> on the transcriptome and identify high-confidence <italic>miR-203</italic> targets. Specifically, we moved <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, E, F, I</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1 fig6s2 fig6s3 fig6s4">Figure 6–figure supplements 1 and 4</xref>. These data were utilized to synthesize our conclusion. By relocating them to figure supplements, we simplified our main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to present the results of our transcriptome analysis and HITS-CLIP analysis for identifying <italic>miR-203</italic> targets. In addition, we added another <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6–figure supplement 3</xref> to document the strong overlap between <italic>Ago2</italic> footprint and miRNA seed matches and list all detected miRNA seed matches detected in our experiments. These data further validated our HITS-CLIP study and provided additional data for readers, who may be interested in miRNA targets in keratinocytes.</p><p><italic>2) More mice should be analyzed in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3E-G</italic></xref><italic>, especially at the E16 time-point when only 2 embryos were examined. The trend towards increased BrdU/EdU incorporation may then become significant, which would be an important finding since this is the only potential phenotype in the intact knockout animals. With the currently presented data, it is an overstatement to claim that</italic> “<italic>miR-203 functions as a gatekeeper to limit cell division when the proliferation rate is high during early embryonic skin development…</italic>” <italic>(the subsection “Genetic deletion of miR-203 impacts early epidermal development in mouse”, second paragraph)</italic>.</p><p>During our revision, we have set up more than 6 breeding pairs in an effort to produce <italic>miR-203</italic> KO embryos. In total, we have generated one pair of E16 WT and KO embryos, and one pair of E17 WT and KO embryos because of the small litter size and our heterozygous to heterozygous breeding strategy, which has 25% chance to produce KO. Nevertheless, we incorporated these new embryonic data to our existing data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>. We now have three pairs of E16 embryos and four pairs of E17 pairs. The p-value for the E16, BrdU/EdU incorporation study is 0.07 and the p-value for the E17, BrdU/EdU incorporation study is 0.13. In addition, the p-value for the E16 epidermal thickness study is 0.03 and the p-value for the E17, epidermal thickness study is 0.01. The new data are consistent with our original observations, that is <italic>miR-203</italic> KO epidermis are more proliferative than the WT counterparts. Together, these data further strengthened our original observations.</p><p>We also revised our statement to “<italic>miR-203</italic> limits cell division when the proliferation rate is high during early embryonic skin development”, to more accurately reflect the observed defects.</p><p><italic>3) Where are the data that show that</italic> “<italic>genes involved in regulation of mitotic cell cycle, DNA synthesis, and metabolism were prominently downregulated upon miR-203 induction</italic>” <italic>(the subsection “Comprehensive identification of miR-203 targets reveals regulation of the Ras signaling pathway”, second paragraph)? Was an unbiased method such as GSEA or gene ontology employed?</italic></p><p>These statements were based on unbiased gene ontology analyses, which were presented in the panel of “<italic>miR-203</italic> inducible analysis” in “<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 6–source data 1</xref>_GO analysis.” However, we didn’t link this source in our original manuscript and we apologize for the negligence. In the revised manuscript (the subsection “Comprehensive identification of <italic>miR-203</italic> targets reveals regulation of the Ras signaling pathway”, third paragraph), we stated “GO-analysis demonstrated that genes involved in regulation of mitotic cell cycle, DNA synthesis and metabolism were prominently downregulated upon <italic>miR-203</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 6–source data 1</xref>).”</p><p><italic>4) Based on the data presented in this manuscript, it is an overstatement to claim that</italic> “<italic>miR-203 directly targets the Ras-mediated signaling pathway</italic>” <italic>(end of the subsection “Comprehensive identification of miR-203 targets reveals regulation of the Ras signaling pathway”).

It is plausible that miR-203 exerts its effects via the coordinated, although minor, downregulation of a broad set of targets, some of which include members of the Ras pathway</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ assessment. Based on our data and the reviewers’ suggestion, we revised our conclusion (in the subsection “Comprehensive identification of <italic>miR-203</italic> targets reveals regulation of the Ras signaling pathway”) to “This collection of <italic>miR-203</italic> targets suggests that <italic>miR-203</italic> targets multiple pathways, including several components of the Ras signaling pathway, to suppress cell proliferation.”</p><p><italic>5) shRNA knockdown experiments with putative targets (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7F-G</italic></xref><italic>) should be performed in Hras-transformed miR-203 +/+ and -/- cells to see if these targets are relevant to transformation in these settings</italic>.</p><p>We carried out the shRNA knockdown experiments for both <italic>Pola1</italic> and <italic>Hbegf</italic> in <italic>HRas</italic>-transformed miR-203 WT and KO keratinocytes as suggested by the reviewers. In both cases, we observed strong reduction in colony forming capacity of these transformed cells, similar to our original observations with non-transformed keratinocytes. Collectively, these data further support the requirement of <italic>Pola1</italic> and <italic>Hbegf</italic> in cell proliferation/survival of both <italic>HRas</italic> transformed and non-transformed cells.
