Using participant-specific behavioral modeling with univariate and multivariate fMRI approaches, we investigated the neural correlates of decision-making for self and other in two independent tasks, including intertemporal and risky choice. Modeling subjective valuation indicated that participants distinguished between themselves and others with dissimilar preferences. Activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was consistently modulated by relative subjective value. Multi-voxel pattern analysis indicated that activity in the dmPFC uniquely encoded relative subjective value and generalized across self and other and across both tasks. Furthermore, agent cross-decoding accuracy between self and other in the dmPFC was related to self-reported social attitudes. These findings indicate that the dmPFC emerges as a medial prefrontal node that utilizes a task-invariant mechanism for computing relative subjective value for self and other.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuroeconomics</kwd><kwd>subjective value</kwd><kwd>intertemporal choice</kwd><kwd>risky choice</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>dmPFC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PGSD3-471313-2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piva</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex encodes relative subjective value in a common neural code across decision-making for self and other and across tasks with divergent cognitive requirements.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Decision-making on behalf of other individuals is ubiquitous in daily life, from parents making decisions about the wellbeing of their children to financial advisors making economic decisions to maximize returns for their clients. A vital parameter in making decisions is the separation of the subjective value between the chosen and unchosen options, defined here as relative subjective value. When the values of two options are similarly preferred, relative subjective value is low, while relative subjective value is high when the values of two options are dissimilarly preferred. We encounter such considerations when we make decisions on behalf of others, much like we do when we make decisions for ourselves. It is therefore crucial to understand how such decisions are formulated in the brain when we make decisions for ourselves or for those around us.</p><p>Most previous studies have focused on subjective value in self-referenced decisions. These studies have identified neural correlates in the medial prefrontal cortex, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kable and Glimcher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McClure et al., 2004</xref>) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), which is anatomically proximal or overlapping with multiple subregions including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kolling et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kolling et al., 2012</xref>). Other studies regarding self-referenced decision-making have focused instead on other decision-related processes, such as conflict, with most indicating the importance of the dmPFC and dACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Botvinick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Botvinick et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Braver et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Venkatraman et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Venkatraman et al., 2009b</xref>), and affect regulation, which is thought to be one of many roles ascribed to the vmPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delgado et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these studies indicate clearly delineated functions of medial prefrontal subregions in value-based decision-making in self-referenced decisions.</p><p>On the other hand, existing studies of decision-making for others have reported divergent results. Early work using an intertemporal choice paradigm did not detect subjective value representation in the brain during decision-making for others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albrecht et al., 2011</xref>). However, later work using a similar paradigm with behavioral modeling of subjective value determined a gradient from ventral to dorsal medial prefrontal cortex such that value for whoever a participant was making decisions at a given time was represented ventrally, while value for whoever a participant was not making decisions was represented dorsally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nicolle et al., 2012</xref>). Still other studies using a prosocial learning framework have reported a categorically different ventral to dorsal gradient in the medial prefrontal cortex in which value for self is represented ventrally, while value for other is represented dorsally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sul et al., 2015</xref>). This gradient was modulated by the social attitudes of participants, such that more prosocial individuals tended to display value representations for others more ventrally in the medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sul et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, a study implementing a computational model for describing altruistic choice based on a drift diffusion framework indicated that both self and other contributions to value calculation occur in the vmPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hutcherson et al., 2015</xref>). Other studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) have also found evidence for shared neural signals of value across self and other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jenkins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Janowski et al., 2013</xref>). Some studies have also used repetition suppression to show the impact of judging and learning about others’ preferences on activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and ultimately on one’s own preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garvert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harris et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, a recent study has suggested that the anterior dmPFC is involved in calculating normative value during social influence in decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apps and Ramnani, 2017</xref>). Together, the results of these studies seem to uniformly indicate the importance of various subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex in computing subjective value across both self and other. However, how individual subregions within the medial prefrontal cortex accomplish this calculation is still an area of active speculation, perhaps because most previous studies have relied on a single task and a single analytical method. To date, studies of value-based decision-making across self and other using multiple distinct experimental tasks and analytical techniques remain sparse.</p><p>To identify which brain areas amongst these medial prefrontal subregions compute relative subjective value from the perspective of self and other in a manner that is both invariant to different task demands as well as analytic approaches, we determined its neural correlates using fMRI in conjunction with both univariate and multivariate analytic techniques in a single unified study. To pinpoint task-invariant responses, we examined neural representations of relative subjective value for self and other under two independent sets of experiments, using either intertemporal or risky choice paradigms. Additionally, we varied the similarity of the other individual for whom the participant made choices. Finally, we examined whether the vmPFC and dmPFC, when analyzed using either univariate general linear model (GLM) or multivariate multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques, represent relative subjective value across self and other in both behavioral tasks regardless of the similarity of the other individual for whom participants made choices.</p><p>The ‘common-currency’ hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Levy and Glimcher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartra et al., 2013</xref>), a core theory in economics, could be useful in guiding expected results related to self and other representation of subjective value in our study. Although this theory has only recently been proposed in relation to decision-making studies exploring how people make decisions for other individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ruff and Fehr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zaki et al., 2014</xref>), explicit tests of whether the brain represents subjective value in an overlapping neural code for self and other and across different behavioral demands are currently absent from the literature. Whereas previous studies used only a single analytic technique and a single behavioral paradigm to explore social decision-making, we aimed to utilize a unique combination of analyses and experimental tasks to explicitly test for the first time whether value representation in any neural region is shared when people make decisions for themselves and others across varying behavioral contexts.</p><p>Our results indicated that relative subjective value signals were present in both the dmPFC and vmPFC across self and other as well as in both behavioral paradigms, such that dmPFC activity negatively and vmPFC activity positively correlated with relative subjective value, respectively. Crucially, our results indicated that activity in the dmPFC, but not other medial prefrontal regions tested, was able to detectably encode relative subjective value, and this neural code retained information across self and other and displayed cross-task decodability. Together, these results present the first evidence for an overlapping neural code in the medial prefrontal cortex for self and other individuals that is remarkably consistent even across fundamentally different behavioral paradigms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Two independent fMRI sessions were included, one in which participants performed an intertemporal choice task (<italic>N</italic> = 20) and one in which participants performed a risky choice task (<italic>N</italic> = 21). The intertemporal choice task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) involved participants making choices between lower amounts of money sooner or higher amounts of money later both for themselves (‘Self’ trials) and for another participant in the study (‘Other’ trials). Participants’ baseline intertemporal choice preferences were assessed in a preliminary behavioral session outside the scanner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). The calculated discounting preferences were then used to pair high-discounting participants with low-discounting participants, and vice versa. Just prior to the fMRI session, participants learned about the person for whom they would be making choices in a separate learning task that involved guessing what the other person would choose before receiving feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Minimum criterion to be included in the study was an accuracy of 80% (mean accuracy 89.3%, s.e.m. = 1.0%). For the intertemporal choice task, trial sets were designed individually for each participant via simulation to ensure that relative subjective value was uncorrelated between Self and Other trials. This was confirmed following completion of the study (for Self trials, mean correlation <italic>r</italic> = 0.19, s.e.m. = 0.10, <italic>z</italic> = 1.57, p=0.117, for Other trials, mean correlation <italic>r</italic> = 0.15, s.e.m. = 0.10, <italic>z</italic> = 1.08, p=0.279, Spearman correlation and Wilcoxon signed rank test). For the risky choice task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), participants made choices between lower amounts of money with higher probabilities or higher amounts of money with lower probabilities for themselves and for another participant in the study. However, while participants were told that they were making choices for another individual, the other participant in the risky choice task was fictional and based on the participants’ own risk preferences as determined by a preliminary choice task completed online. Participants learned about the risk preferences of the fictional other participant in a learning task prior to scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>), with criterion again set at 80% (mean accuracy 87.6%, s.e.m. = 1.2%).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44939.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Participants differentiate between similar and dissimilar others in the intertemporal and risky choice tasks.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>,<bold>d</bold>) Intertemporal (top) and risky (bottom) choice task design.

Partially diverging from the results of the intertemporal paradigm, the model with one value for <italic>α</italic> and one value for <italic>β</italic> across self and other fit best (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>; mean BIC 101.2, s.e.m. = 4.3) with no differences observed between <italic>α</italic> values for self and other in the model with two parameters for <italic>α</italic> and one <italic>β</italic> parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>; risk seeking <italic>z</italic> = 1.48, p=0.139, risk averse <italic>z</italic> = 1.00, p=0.328, Wilcoxon signed rank test). This indicated that participants viewed the other individual as someone with similar preferences. Together, these results indicated that participants considered similar or dissimilar preferences when making decisions for others. Furthermore, the fact that models with one <italic>β</italic> parameter across Self and Other trials performed better than models with two separate <italic>β</italic> parameters for Self and Other trials in both tasks indicated that choice stochasticity did not substantially differ when participants made choices for self or other.</p><p>We next aimed to determine whether the subjective value of each option on a given trial calculated using the best fitting models for each paradigm accounted for choice behavior. To demonstrate that participants were taking subjective value into account when making choices, we calculated the proportion of trials in which participants chose the option with the higher subjective value, monetary value, or either lower delay for the intertemporal choice task or higher probability for the risky choice task. As anticipated, participants made choices according to subjective value significantly more than either monetary value or delay alone for both Self and Other trials in the intertemporal choice task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>; compared to Self monetary, <italic>z</italic> = 3.72, p&lt;0.001, Self delay, <italic>z</italic> = 3.92, p&lt;0.001, Other monetary, <italic>z</italic> = 3.85, p&lt;0.001, Other delay, <italic>z</italic> = 4.01, p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Similarly, participants made choices according to subjective value significantly more than either monetary value or probability of reward for both Self and Other trials in the risky choice task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>; compared to Self monetary, <italic>z</italic> = 3.91, p&lt;0.001, Self probability, <italic>z</italic> = 4.01, p&lt;0.001, Other monetary, <italic>z</italic> = 4.01, p&lt;0.001, Other probability, <italic>z</italic> = 4.01, p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test).</p><p>Finally, we examined response times in relation to the subjective value associated with each trial as well as whether participants were making decisions for themselves or another individual. For the subjective value analysis, we first calculated the relative subjective value of each trial by subtracting the value of the unchosen option from the value of the chosen option. We then median split trials into high and low relative subjective value. Response times were slower for trials with lower relative subjective value than trials with higher relative subjective value for both the intertemporal and risky choice paradigms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>; intertemporal <italic>z</italic> = 3.10, p=0.002, risk <italic>z</italic> = 2.38, p=0.017, Wilcoxon signed rank test). However, no differences in response times were observed between Self trials and Other trials in either paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>; intertemporal <italic>z</italic> = 1.01, p=0.313, risk <italic>z</italic> = 1.20, p=0.231, Wilcoxon signed rank test). It is important to note that each trial included a mandatory waiting period of 5 s before participants were allowed to indicate their choice. While this may have diluted modulation of response times by task parameters, we still observed that response times were detectably modulated by subjective value.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Decision-making for dissimilar but not similar others activates the ‘social’ brain</title><p>We first aimed to identify the neural correlates of decision-making from the perspective of self relative to other by performing a simple contrast of Other over Self trials, and vice versa.

For participants who completed both the intertemporal and risky choice tasks, agent cross-decoding accuracy was averaged across both sessions for initial analyses. In hypothesizing the direction of such a correlation, there are two distinct possibilities. The first is that cross-decoding accuracy may negatively correlate with antisocial attitudes, indicating that high cross-decoding accuracy, and thus similar value coding across self and other, is associated with prosocial attitudes. Alternatively, cross-decoding accuracy may positively correlate with antisocial attitudes, indicating that low cross-decoding accuracy, and thus more differentiated value coding across self and other, is associated with prosocial attitudes. The latter possibility emphasizes that an ability to differentiate value coding across self and other is critical for expressing preference toward another individual’s benefit, akin to the importance of mentalizing about others’ preferences.</p><p>There was no correlation observed between agent cross-decoding accuracy in the vmPFC and our antisocial personality measure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = −0.08, p=0.895, Spearman correlation). By contrast, there was a positive correlation observed in the dmPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = 0.40, p=0.025, Spearman correlation; p&lt;0.05 confirmed via permutation test), indicating that participants with greater agent cross-decoding in the dmPFC had higher measures of antisocial attitudes. To confirm this relationship, we examined the correlation between social attitude scores and the individual accuracy when training on Self trials and testing on Other trials, and vice versa, in the vmPFC and dmPFC. Again, no correlation was observed in the vmPFC for either analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>; train Self test Other <italic>r</italic> = 0.03, p=0.880, train Other test Self <italic>r</italic> = −0.08, p=0.653, Spearman correlation). Examination of the dmPFC yielded either a significant or strong trend toward a positive correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>; train Self test Other <italic>r</italic> = 0.453, p=0.011, train Other test Self <italic>r</italic> = 0.341, p=0.061, Spearman correlation), confirming the cross-decoding relationship observed in the dmPFC but not in the vmPFC. We further performed this analysis separately on data from the intertemporal and risky choice tasks. As in other analyses, no correlation was observed in the vmPFC for either paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a</xref>; intertemporal <italic>r</italic> = −0.147, p=0.537, risk <italic>r</italic> = −0.040, p=0.862, Spearman correlation). However, even with diminished statistical power from reduced sample size, we still observed a trend toward a positive correlation in both tasks in the dmPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2b</xref>; intertemporal <italic>r</italic> = 0.415, p=0.070, risk <italic>r</italic> = 0.423, p=0.056, Spearman correlation). These results indicate that the observed relationship was not driven by the similarity or dissimilarity of the other participant or by specific task demands. As mentioned above, since agent cross-decoding is primarily a measure of how similar value coding is for Self and Other trials in the dmPFC, these results indicate that participants who report more antisocial attitudes tend to have value coding that is less differentiated when making decisions for themselves as opposed to other individuals in our experimental paradigms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>While making decisions for others is vital in daily life, previous studies examining the neural correlates of subjective value during decision-making for others have yielded mixed and sometimes conflicting results. These divergent findings could be the result of utilizing tasks with different associated cognitive demands and behavioral models. To address this issue, we utilized two paradigms, intertemporal and risky choice, as well as two different variations of other, those that had similar versus dissimilar preferences to each participant. When using relative subjective value, defined as the subjective value of the chosen minus unchosen option, as a behavioral regressor, both univariate and multivariate analytic techniques yielded remarkably consistent results across decision-making for self and other as well as across intertemporal and risky choice paradigms. In all univariate cases, the vmPFC positively correlated with relative subjective value, while the dmPFC negatively correlated with relative subjective value. When taking a multivariate approach, the dmPFC, but not other medial prefrontal areas, contained detectable information concerning the relative subjective value of each trial. These results were consistent across self and other, and the code for relative subjective value retained information across self and other as well as across behavioral paradigms. Finally, a relationship between self-reported social attitudes and agent cross-decoding accuracy was observed. These results are particularly novel in that they for the first time demonstrate the ability of a brain region to compute subjective value across decision-making for self and other using a neural code that retains information across social referenced frames. Furthermore, our results extend the idea of a shared representation for value in the medial prefrontal cortex by indicating that this code in the dmPFC is generalizable across qualitatively different behavioral paradigms that divergently conceptualize subjective value.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The similarity of subjective value representation across self and other</title><p>Our results are distinguished from many of those reported in previous studies by the level of similarity in subjective value coding across decision-making for self and other. There exists evidence for varying gradients in the medial prefrontal cortex, typically extending from ventral to more dorsal areas. Traditional thinking has implicated the vmPFC in self-referenced subjective valuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kable and Glimcher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McClure et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behrens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boorman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Knutson et al., 2005</xref>), while the more dorsal areas of medial prefrontal cortex, typically referred to as the dmPFC – a functionally defined region that is overlapping with or proximal to anatomically defined areas such as the pre-SMA and dACC – are implicated more in social cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behrens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frith and Frith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hampton et al., 2008</xref>). Corresponding to these findings, a recent approach using a prosocial learning framework has indicated a ventral to dorsal gradient in medial prefrontal cortex, with self value represented ventrally and other value represented dorsally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sul et al., 2015</xref>). In our study, a cluster located in the anterior dmPFC was observed in a value-agnostic contrast of Other over Self trials in the intertemporal choice paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and a cluster located more dorsally, anatomically proximal to the dACC and pre-SMA, was observed to more strongly signal other-referenced relative subjective value, although this effect was limited to the intertemporal choice paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, determining the functional specificity of the dorsal regions of medial prefrontal cortex in social cognition continues to be an active area of research. For example, a study using a reinforcement-learning task for self, other, or no one did not find evidence for any dorsal region of the medial prefrontal cortex in other-referenced choice, but instead found that the subgenual ACC corresponded to prediction errors specifically during learning for others and that the size of this effect was related to self-reported empathy scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lockwood et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, the rostral ACC has been implicated in belief-based prediction errors during a competitive task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the ACC gyrus subregion has been found across multiple studies to be vital in social cognition, signaling other-related information and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apps et al., 2016</xref>). In monkey studies utilizing single-unit recordings, the functionally defined dmPFC has been repeatedly implicated in social reward signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haroush and Williams, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noritake et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, a region located within the dmPFC, particularly proximal to the dACC, signaled relative subjective value not only during Other trials, but also during Self trials, and it did so consistently across univariate and multivariate analyses as well as across tasks requiring different cognitive demands.</p><p>Notably, these results are in imperfect correspondence to an earlier paper which reported the vmPFC to be important in online subjective valuation and the dmPFC to be important in offline subjective valuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nicolle et al., 2012</xref>). While our paradigm is similar to the one used in this previous study, it is important to note that our univariate analyses were structured differently. When our analyses were structured as closely as possible to those detailed in the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nicolle et al., 2012</xref>), we were able to demonstrate a cluster in the posterior dmPFC that represented offline subjective value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), roughly corresponding to previously reported findings. Additionally, while we were not able to definitively demonstrate encoding for offline relative subjective value in the dmPFC at the multivariate level, we did detect trends toward significant encoding of offline relative subjective value for both Self and Other trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; Self trials offline p=0.107, Other trials offline p=0.057, permutation test), lending support for conducting future research to more conclusively examine offline subjective value coding in the dmPFC at the multivariate level. Thus, while more research is, nevertheless, needed to fully consolidate earlier findings that indicate potential functional gradients in the medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nicolle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sul et al., 2015</xref>), the current results reinforce the general notion that the dmPFC partakes in social cognition through distinct value-related computations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Activity patterns in the vmPFC and their role in signaling relative subjective value</title><p>Our results indicated that vmPFC activity corresponded more to relative subjective value than to the absolute value of the chosen option.

However, many other studies have indicated that activity in the medial prefrontal cortex corresponds more specifically to differences in subjective value between options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nicolle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boorman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">FitzGerald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grabenhorst and Rolls, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hare et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tremblay and Schultz, 1999</xref>), consistent with our observed results.</p><p>Perhaps, more striking was the inability of classifiers trained using vmPFC activity to pass the decoding criterion of neural representation for relative subjective value when applying multivariate analysis techniques. Our results indicated that while the vmPFC signaled relative subjective value when voxels were treated as a homogenous group, the pattern of voxel activity within this region did not contain enough information to exceed an empirically derived null distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Indeed, multivariate approaches in conjunction with decision-making paradigms have not been used frequently. One previous study using MVPA in the frontal cortex to study the representation of value across reward categories found evidence for both category-dependent and category-independent value coding in varying subregions of the vmPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McNamee et al., 2013</xref>). More recently, representational similarity analysis (RSA), another multivariate analysis technique, was used to demonstrate that the vmPFC contained information regarding value univariately and information regarding category multivariately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), largely consistent with our results. Together, these findings indicate the importance of comparing univariate and multivariate activation patterns in decision-making paradigms to continue to explore the way by which the vmPFC and other frequently studied areas represent the neural correlates of value.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The role of the dmPFC in computing relative subjective value</title><p>The role of the dmPFC and more specifically the anatomically proximal dACC subregion in value-based decision-making has been a point of contention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ebitz and Hayden, 2016</xref>).

First, the dmPFC was the only of several medial prefrontal ROIs to decode relative subjective value, underscoring its importance in decision-making. Furthermore, our findings have essential implications for the common-currency hypothesis, which postulates that the brain continuously calculates value across varying categories and contexts to facilitate value comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Levy and Glimcher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartra et al., 2013</xref>). This hypothesis has mainly been attributed to vmPFC activity, as studies have shown overlapping value representation between categories in the vmPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">FitzGerald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Izuma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chib et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levy and Glimcher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sescousse et al., 2015</xref>) as well as the ability of vmPFC activity patterns to generalize information regarding value across categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McNamee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gross et al., 2014</xref>). Our vmPFC findings partially correspond to the previous literature, as our univariate analyses indicated an overlap not only between Self and Other trials, but also across tasks that involve different cognitive demands. However, our findings regarding the dmPFC extend the common-currency hypothesis to include other brain regions. Not only was there overlap in activity in the dmPFC related to relative subjective value across Self and Other trials and across behavioral paradigms, but our results also demonstrated that the neural code in the dmPFC that represents relative subjective value was able to retain information across both self and other, across univariate and multivariate levels of representation, and even across behavioral paradigms. These findings extend the reach of the common-currency hypothesis to include the dmPFC and its potential role in value comparison, using a code that computes subjective value information across agent and context differences.</p><p>Interestingly, the correlation that we observed with self-reported social attitudes indicated that this ability of the dmPFC to retain value information in its neural code across Self and Other trials may not be associated with prosocial attitudes, as one might expect. Instead, the opposite appears to be true, as increased agent cross-decoding accuracy was positively correlated with antisocial attitudes in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This indicates that a neural code in the dmPFC that is more separable when making decisions for self versus other is associated with prosocial traits. While our sample size limited our ability to conclusively demonstrate this relationship, our findings raise the intriguing possibility that a neural code that makes individual-specific predications about self and other, perhaps by treating another individual as an independent agent, may underlie cognitive processes that result from an interactive process between prosocial preference and mentalizing about others.</p><p>That said, the tasks that we employed in our current study could not conclusively determine whether activity in the dmPFC signals subjective value or the expected value of control, nor were they designed to do so. When relative subjective value is low and dmPFC activity is heightened, this could have to do either with the intrinsic comparison of the value of the two options or with the amount of control necessary to make an accurate decision based on a given set of preferences. The fact that our dmPFC results could not be explained by response times suggests that our observed effects were not driven solely by trial difficulty. Yet, we do not believe that this finding is enough to invalidate the expected value of control hypothesis, especially when considering that the delay period of 5 s associated with each trial could decrease the extent of response time modulation by trial parameters. As such, the primary limitation of our study is that we are unable to conclusively differentiate between these opposing viewpoints.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both the vmPFC and dmPFC are components of broader networks that compute reward-related information across social and non-social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fareri and Delgado, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). Our study indicates that the code for relative subjective value in the dmPFC is robustly generalizable across various cognitive demands and social contexts in a way that is demonstrably related to social attitudes. This is in line with the common-currency hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Levy and Glimcher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartra et al., 2013</xref>) and other proposed theories suggesting how information may be retained across self and other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang, 2013</xref>). Our findings additionally argue for uniquely robust representation of relative subjective value in the dmPFC compared to other medial prefrontal regions. Together, these findings present the dmPFC as a nexus in computing variables relating to value-based decision-making, regardless of analytic technique used and across divergent tasks and social reference frames.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty participants provided written informed consent to take part in a study that took place over one to three sessions. The first session consisted only of a behavioral study using the intertemporal choice paradigm, while the second and third sessions consisted of an fMRI study using the intertemporal choice paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) and risky choice paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), respectively. Prior to the third session, participants completed a behavioral task online to gauge their self-referenced risk preferences. Nine of the 30 participants only attended the first session, 11 attended only the first and second sessions, and 10 attended all three sessions. Thirteen additional participants provided written informed consent and attended only the third session. All 30 initial participants were included in the analysis of preliminary intertemporal choice behavioral data from the first session (19 female, mean age 28.8, s.d. = 7.8). A total of 20 participants were included in behavioral and neural analyses of intertemporal choice acquired during the first fMRI session (15 female, mean age 29.1, s.d. = 8.7). Additionally, a total of 21 participants were included in behavioral and neural analyses of risk acquired during the second fMRI session (13 female, mean age 31.3, s.d. = 7.7). We based our individual sample sizes for both the intertemporal and risky choice tasks on previously published fMRI studies that utilized univariate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apps and Ramnani, 2017</xref>) or multivariate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McNamee et al., 2013</xref>) analytical methods to explore the representation of subjective value. For the intertemporal choice dataset, one participant was excluded from further analyses due to excessive movement. For the risky choice dataset, one participant was excluded from further analyses due to excessive movement, and one participant was excluded from further analyses for failing to meet accuracy criterion in the task for learning the preferences of the other individual. All participants were between 18 and 55 years of age. Sex differences were not examined in this study due to a lack of the statistical power necessary to do so. The study was approved by the Yale School of Medicine Human Investigation Committee (HIC #0910005795). All participants gave their informed consent prior to the experimental session and were paid for their participation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Stimuli and participant payment</title><p>All experiments were programmed in Matlab 2014a (MathWorks) using Psychtoolbox (version 3.0.12). For preliminary behavioral sessions and learning sessions, the task was presented on a computer monitor in a private behavioral testing room. Participants indicated their choices through button presses to a keyboard. For the preliminary intertemporal choice task, participants indicated their choice by releasing or continuing to hold a key. For the learning sessions, participants indicated their choice by pressing either a left or right key. For fMRI sessions, the task was projected to a screen at the back of the scanner, with a mirror used to allow participants to see the screen. Participants indicated their choices through left or right button presses to an MRI-safe button box in their right hand. Randomly selected trials for the purpose of payment were determined by rolling dice at the end of each experimental session.

In each trial, participants were required to choose between a delayed amount option in comparison to a common baseline offer of $10 immediately. Delays ranged from 1 to 180 days, while delayed amount options involved various amounts greater than $10 up to a maximum of $40. Participants made choices both for themselves (‘Self’ trials) and for another participant in the study (‘Other’ trials). For this behavioral session, participants were given no additional information about this other individual. One trial at random was selected from each of the participant’s own Self trials and another participant’s Other trials to contribute to the participant’s payment. Trial types with every possible combination of delay and amount for both Self and Other constituted 84 trials, and every trial was repeated four times for a total of 336 trials. Task timing included a 1 s start screen, a 2 s presentation of the delayed option, a 2 s delay period, a 2 s choice period, and a 1 s confirmed choice period, followed by a 1–3 s inter-trial interval. Task completion lasted approximately 60 min. Participants were paid a baseline amount of $10, plus added funds depending on their choice during one randomly determined Self trial as well as another participant’s choice during one randomly determined Other trial.

For this session, participants were matched with another individual with differing preferences, such that high-discounters were paired with low-discounters, and vice versa, so that self and other were dissimilar with respect to discounting preferences. Trial types were generated from a set of simulations and were unique to each individual participant. These trials were selected such that on at least 50% of trials each participant would prefer a different option than the individual whose preferences they were learning, as determined by each participant’s preferences calculated from their choices in the preliminary behavioral session. For this task, participants had to indicate which of two options they thought the other individual in the study would choose. They were then shown the choice that the other individual would make on that particular trial and thus had the opportunity to iteratively learn the other individual’s preferences.

These calculations were completed based on each participant’s behavior during the preliminary behavioral session. Similar to the learning task, each trial involved an option of a smaller amount of money sooner or a larger amount of money later.

First, we calculated the subjective value of the chosen option minus the subjective value of the unchosen option and noted this measure as relative subjective value. Next, we determined the subjective value of the chosen option alone. Thus, for further analyses, we conceptualized subjective value as either the relative subjective value – the signed difference between the chosen and unchosen options – or the absolute subjective value of the chosen option. For certain analyses, these values were used to separate trial types into high and low-value trials. This was accomplished by performing a median split, such that the half of trials with a low subjective value measure were considered ‘low-value’ trials, whereas the half of trials with a high subjective value measure were considered ‘high-value’ trials. To facilitate this categorization from continuous subjective value variables, trials were individually planned by design for each participant to maximize the intended separation of relative subjective value between high and low-value trials. While the actual distributions were not strictly bimodal as was initially intended due to changes in participant preferences between the preliminary and fMRI sessions, the mean and median of high-value versus low-value trials were still clearly separated by a minimum difference of 400%.

Online versus offline subjective value measures were uncoupled in the intertemporal choice paradigm by ensuring that the simulated trial set for each participant lead to uncorrelated subjective value measures across self and other.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Definition of regions of interest (ROIs)</title><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>Spherical ROIs</title><p>Spherical ROIs were produced for the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clithero and Rangel, 2014</xref>) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Venkatraman et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Venkatraman et al., 2009b</xref>) using peak coordinates from previous studies and placed along the midline for MVPA analyses. One intermediate ROI (imPFC) was also placed along the medial prefrontal cortex between the vmPFC and dmPFC. A control ROI was placed in right somatosensory cortex (S1). Spherical ROIs were grown from a central coordinate to either 5 mm in diameter to extract effect sizes from univariate analyses or 8 mm in diameter for use in multivariate analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>Anatomical ROI</title><p>A bilateral anatomical ROI for the dmPFC was extracted from studies of macaque and human anatomical connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neubert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mars et al., 2016</xref>).

Regressors of interest were convolved with a gamma function. In all GLM analyses, the 5 s delay period before participants were instructed to indicate their decision was modeled. Six motion regressors were included in every model. Nuisance regressors were included for error trials and task block structure. All regressor values were mean-corrected and standard deviation-normalized prior to GLM analyses. Results for each participant were combined across eight runs using a fixed effects model. FSL’s mixed effects Flame 1 and 2 model was used to create group averages, which were cluster corrected at a cluster-defining threshold of p&lt;0.001 uncorrected to satisfy p&lt;0.05 family-wise error (FWE).

Analyses were also replicated using an anatomically defined ROI for the dmPFC. Individual beta weights for each 5 s decision-making period were obtained using AFNI’s <italic>3dDeconvolve</italic> and <italic>3dREMLfit</italic>. Patterns were mean-centered prior to performing pattern classification. Classification was performed using the <italic>glmnet</italic> model in the <italic>caret</italic> package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kuhn, 2016</xref>) for each of the ROIs within each participant. This algorithm fits a generalized linear model under penalized maximum likelihood and contains two tuning parameters, alpha and lambda. The parameter alpha can be set between 0 (‘ridge’), in which the elastic-net penalty shrinks the coefficients of correlated predictors toward each other, and 1 (‘lasso’), in which the lasso tends to pick one of them and discard the others. The parameter lambda then controls the strength of the penalty. In our study, the parameter alpha was set outright to 0, and the model was optimized within each participant by allowing lambda to vary over a grid of 100. Nevertheless, we repeated all analyses with the parameter alpha set to 1, and adjustment of this parameter did not affect the qualitative pattern of results. To ensure that classifiers were never trained and tested on data from the same scanning run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mumford et al., 2014</xref>), trials were split into four blocks. Classifiers were trained on data from three of these blocks and tested on the remaining block. All possible combinations of blocks were evaluated and averaged. The <italic>downsampling</italic> function in <italic>caret</italic> was used to correct for any situations in which labels were unbalanced. This procedure was used for all analyses, even those that involved training and testing classifiers on separate trials or datasets. Classification accuracy for the optimal model was obtained for each participant and then all participants were averaged to get the mean group accuracy for each ROI.</p><p>Significance was determined using an empirical null distribution for each ROI created by combining permutation and bootstrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee and McCarthy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stelzer et al., 2013</xref>). For each ROI for each participant, training labels were permuted 100 times to create 100 datasets in which the label and the data were dissociated. Classification was then run as described above for each of these 100 permuted data sets to create 100 null accuracies for each participant. A group level null distribution for each ROI was then created by randomly sampling a null accuracy for each participant and averaging those accuracies across all participants 10,000 times. The true average group accuracy was then compared to the empirical null distribution for that ROI to determine the p-value for that accuracy. This procedure is critical for accurate determination of significance, as assumptions of a chance level of 50% are not valid in small sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Combrisson and Jerbi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Golland and Fischl, 2003</xref>).

Classifier cross-decoding accuracy was evaluated by averaging classifier accuracy when training on Self trials and testing on Other trials, and vice versa. For participants who completed both the intertemporal and risky choice tasks, agent cross-decoding accuracy was averaged across both sessions. For self-reported data, a principal component analysis was performed on scores from all five questionnaires administered. The first principal component score for each participant was calculated and used as a measure of social attitudes. Correlation between relative subjective value agent cross-decoding accuracy and self-reported social attitudes was evaluated by Spearman’s rank correlation to a threshold of p&lt;0.05. Significance was confirmed via a permutation test in which corresponding axis labels were shuffled 10,000 times to create a null distribution. This analysis was then completed after decomposing agent cross-decoding into training on Self trials and testing on Other trials, and vice versa. Finally, this analysis was completed separately for the intertemporal and risky choice paradigms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Data visualization and determination of cluster locations</title><p>Statistical maps were visualized using FSL’s FSLview.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex computes task-invariant relative subjective value for self and other&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examines common representations of subjective value in vmPFC and dmPFC, for two types of decision-making tasks (intertemporal and risky choices), and for decisions made with either the self or another individual. The emphasis is on regions such as the dmPFC that share a representation of relative subjective value across all combinations of conditions. This is an important goal, and the results support the notion that dmPFC activity encodes relative subjective value, regardless of whether the decision is made for oneself or another, and across decision task types.</p><p>Overall, there was a lot of enthusiasm for this paper. However, the reviewers also raised a number of major and minor concerns which need to be addressed. These condensed points are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All analyses are based on &quot;relative subjective value&quot; (RSV, |value left option – value right option|), defined as the absolute difference between the two choice options, rather than &quot;relative chosen value&quot;, defined as the signed difference between the value of the chosen minus unchosen option (chosen value – unchosen value). Because the RSV signal is closely related to conflict or choice difficulty, there is a concern is that this signal might not identify brain areas involved in valuation per se, but more likely to identify areas involved in conflict or response selection, which are more likely to be shared across choice types even if the underlying valuation mechanism is different. Whereas chosen value – unchosen value is to some degree also correlated with choice difficulty, it is currently a reasonably well-established analysis, and it is the analysis of choice in most of the papers cited by the authors. The reviewers agreed that it would be important to reanalyze the data focusing on chosen value – unchosen value instead of RSV. In addition, the authors could focus on value sum (chosen + unchosen value), which is less related to conflict and difficulty. If those analyses failed to replicate previous studies, this could be still really interesting, and the authors may want to consider carefully why they do or do not replicate other previously reported effects.</p><p>2) Empirically determined chance null performance for all decoding analyses in which the classifier is trained and tested on the same trial types is systematically above 50%, indicating that the classifier is biased. This may be related to the fact that cross-validation was performed agnostic to run structure, or because of a potential non-independence in optimizing the lambda parameter. It would be important to reanalyze the data using a leave one run out cross-validation approach. If the median split is applied within each run, potential differences in mean value across runs should not affect classifier performance.</p><p>3) Please explore and report the behavioral data more thoroughly. For instance, it would be important to include plots depicting the relationship between value and choices for both self and others, indicating that value is indeed driving choices. Second, response times could be analyzed more comprehensively and displayed in appropriate graphs. For instance, were there differences in overall RT when deciding for self and others?</p><p>4) There are a number of issues with the correlation analysis of decoding accuracy and social attitudes that should be addressed. First, please compute these correlations without duplicating data points from the 10 subjects who participated in both sessions (for instance by averaging decoding accuracy in these subjects across both tasks). Second, please report how antisocial attitudes are related to behavioral performance, as one might expect that participants with more antisocial attitudes also show reduced correspondence between their decisions for the other person and the other person's preferences, or are less accurate when learning the other's preferences. Third, the authors use the &quot;normalized&quot; decoding accuracy, subtracting accuracy for self from accuracy for other. It might be interesting to know what is driving the effect, if they did not subtract one from the other.</p><p>5) It is possible that choice stochasticity differs between self and other trials. It would therefore be important to also test models that include separate beta parameters for self and other trials.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44939.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All analyses are based on &quot;relative subjective value&quot; (RSV, |value left option – value right option|), defined as the absolute difference between the two choice options, rather than &quot;relative chosen value&quot;, defined as the signed difference between the value of the chosen minus unchosen option (chosen value – unchosen value).

We agree that we conceptualized subjective value in a slightly different way than is common among previous papers in this field. To address this discrepancy, we have entirely replaced our original definition of relative subjective value to now mean “chosen value – unchosen value” throughout the whole paper, as requested. We have made this new definition clear in the Introduction, Results, and Materials and methods sections. We have applied the necessary changes to all relevant GLM and MVPA approaches. Importantly, all major findings hold following these changes. We believe that our paper now better corresponds to previous literature and examines a measure more commonly associated with subjective value, both of which represent major improvements to our manuscript.</p><p>We chose the “chosen value – unchosen value” option as opposed to the “chosen value + unchosen value” option provided by the reviewers for two main reasons. The first is that, to our knowledge, “chosen value – unchosen value” is a much more prevalent measure to use among other similar studies (for a comparable example, see Nicolle et al., 2012). Thus, our results are more comparable with the bulk of previous findings with this measure. Second, while “chosen value + unchosen value” is not directly related to the choices that participants make on any given trial, “chosen value – unchosen value” is intrinsically impacted by the choices that participants make. Therefore, if one wanted to examine measures most related to value-based choice behavior, “chosen value – unchosen value” might represent a better option. Furthermore, this logic also applies to our “value of the chosen option” analyses, which are also more intrinsically related to choice behavior than those associated with the “chosen value + unchosen value” measure.</p><p>Nicolle, A. <italic>et al.</italic> An agent independent axis for executed and modeled choice in medial prefrontal cortex. <italic>Neuron</italic> <bold>75</bold>, 1114-1121, doi:10.1016/j.neuron.2012.07.023 (2012).</p><p>Please note however that we refer to the “chosen value – unchosen value” measure as “relative subjective value” in the updated manuscript. We believe that this is still a fair label for what we are reporting, as unlike the “chosen value + unchosen value” or “value of the chosen option” measures, the subjective value on each trial using this measure is subtractively normalized by whichever option the participant did not choose. Thus, although we have modified and clarified our definition of “relative subjective value” to be more robust and better correspond with previous literature, we refer to it using similar terminology as in the original manuscript (with clear indications that this is now defined as “chosen – unchosen value”).</p><p>Please see modified Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6; Figure 3—figure supplements 1-2, Figure 4—figure supplements 1-3, and Figure 6—figure supplements 1-2; Figure 3—source data 1, Figure 4—source data 1-2, and Figure 5—source data 1; and associated text for more detail on updated results using this new relative subjective value definition.</p><p>“A vital parameter in making decisions is the separation of the subjective value between the chosen and unchosen options, defined here as relative subjective value.”</p><p>“In order to determine the effect of subjective value on prefrontal activity, we calculated relative subjective value, defined as the subjective value of the chosen option minus the subjective value of the unchosen option.”</p><p>“We conceptualized subjective value using two different approaches for neural analyses. First, we calculated the subjective value of the chosen option minus the subjective value of the unchosen option and noted this measure as relative subjective value. Next, we determined the subjective value of the chosen option alone. Thus, for further analyses, we conceptualized subjective value as either the relative subjective value – the signed difference between the chosen and unchosen options – or the absolute subjective value of the chosen option.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Empirically determined chance null performance for all decoding analyses in which the classifier is trained and tested on the same trial types is systematically above 50%, indicating that the classifier is biased. This may be related to the fact that cross-validation was performed agnostic to run structure, or because of a potential non-independence in optimizing the λ parameter. It would be important to reanalyze the data using a leave one run out cross-validation approach. If the median split is applied within each run, potential differences in mean value across runs should not affect classifier performance.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comments on this import methodological concern. We have now used the suggested leave one run out cross-validation approach in all relevant analyses, even those in which the null distribution means were already 50% in the original manuscript. We instantiated this by splitting the data up into four separate blocks. Classifiers were then trained on data from three of the four blocks and tested on data from the remaining block for all possible combinations. This was done both within Self and Other trials, across Self and Other trials, and even across the two distinct tasks. Thus, classifiers were never simultaneously trained and tested on trials from the same scanning run. We utilized tools in the <italic>caret</italic> package in R to deal with any imbalances in data sets. Specifically, we used the <italic>downsampling</italic> command to ensure that datasets were balanced. We thoroughly describe our new analytic approach in the Materials and methods section. Please note that we have also increased the size of our generated spherical ROIs from 5 to 8 mm. We found that these larger ROIs provided more stable decoding accuracies and are more in line with the size of ROIs typically used in MVPA approaches. Furthermore, we have simplified the intermediate ROIs placed between the vmPFC and dmPFC to one ROI that we now refer to as the intermediate medial prefrontal cortex (imPFC). We hope that this change streamlines our paper and provides fewer unnecessary comparisons that may confuse readers.</p><p>Following instantiation of our updated MVPA approach, the null distributions for all analyses are now centered closely on 50%, fully removing the mentioned bias. Please note that because we managed to fully remove the bias with this cross-validation approach, we continue to optimize the lambda parameter as in the original manuscript, as this is exceedingly common in instantiating the <italic>glmnet</italic> model that we used for these analyses.</p><p>Please see modified Figures 4, 5, and 6; Figure 4—figure supplements 1-3 and Figure 6—figure supplements 1-2; Figure 4—source data 1-2 and Figure 5—source data 1; and associated text for more detail on updated results:</p><p>“To ensure that classifiers were never trained and tested on data from the same scanning run<sup>71</sup>, trials were split into four blocks. Classifiers were trained on data from three of these blocks and tested on the remaining block. All possible combinations of blocks were evaluated and averaged. The <italic>downsampling</italic> function in <italic>caret</italic> was used to correct for any situations in which labels were unbalanced. This procedure was used for all analyses, even those that involved training and testing classifiers on separate trials or datasets.”</p><p>“Cross-validation ensured that classifiers were never trained and tested on data from the same run.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please explore and report the behavioral data more thoroughly. For instance, it would be important to include plots depicting the relationship between value and choices for both self and others, indicating that value is indeed driving choices. Second, response times could be analyzed more comprehensively and displayed in appropriate graphs. For instance, were there differences in overall RT when deciding for self and others?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the opportunity to report the findings of our behavioral analyses more fully. First, we have now reported behavioral findings from the preliminary intertemporal choice task that we used to asses participants’ baseline preferences for self and other as well as the learning tasks for the intertemporal choice and risky choice tasks in which participants learned about the other person for whom they would be making choices (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). These findings include example discounting curves from the preliminary intertemporal choice data for two participants as well as group-averaged learning curves from the intertemporal and risky choice learning tasks.</p><p>Second, we have now demonstrated that subjective value explains participant decisions better than monetary value or delay alone in the intertemporal choice task for Self and Other trials (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A; versus Self monetary, <italic>z</italic> = 3.72, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, vs Self delay, <italic>z</italic> = 3.92, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, vs Other monetary, <italic>z</italic> = 3.85, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, vs Other delay, <italic>z</italic> = 4.01, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Furthermore, we have also now demonstrated that subjective value explains participant decisions better than monetary value or probability of receiving reward alone in the risky choice task for Self and Other trials (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B; vs Self monetary, <italic>z</italic> = 3.91, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, vs Self probability, <italic>z</italic> = 4.01, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, vs Other monetary, <italic>z</italic> = 4.01, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, vs Other probability, <italic>z</italic> = 4.01, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Together, these results indicate that participants’ choices were guided by subjective value and not necessarily by solely the monetary value or the delay to or probability of receiving a certain reward:</p><p>“We next aimed to determine whether the subjective value of each option on a given trial calculated using the best fitting models for each paradigm accounted for choice behavior. To demonstrate that participants were taking subjective value into account when making choices, we calculated the proportion of trials in which participants chose the option with the higher subjective value, monetary value, or either lower delay for the intertemporal choice task or higher probability for the risky choice task. As anticipated, participants made choices according to subjective value significantly more than either monetary value or delay alone for both Self and Other trials in the intertemporal choice task (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A; compared to Self monetary, <italic>z</italic> = 3.72, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Self delay, <italic>z</italic> = 3.92, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Other monetary, <italic>z</italic> = 3.85, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Other delay, <italic>z</italic> = 4.01, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Similarly, participants made choices according to subjective value significantly more than either monetary value or probability of reward for both Self and Other trials in the risky choice task (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B; compared to Self monetary, <italic>z</italic> = 3.91, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Self probability, <italic>z</italic> = 4.01, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Other monetary, <italic>z</italic> = 4.01, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Other probability, <italic>z</italic> = 4.01, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test).”</p><p>Finally, we examined response times in relation to two variables: low versus high-relative subjective value trials (using the new chosen – unchosen definition), as well as Self versus Other trials. For both the intertemporal and risky choice tasks, response time was higher for low-relative subjective value trials, indicating that the relative value of the two presented options did impact response time behavior (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A; intertemporal <italic>z</italic> = 3.10, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002, risk <italic>z</italic> = 2.38, <italic>P</italic> = 0.017, Wilcoxon signed rank test). However, no difference was observed between Self and Other trials (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B; intertemporal <italic>z</italic> = 1.01, <italic>P</italic> = 0.313, risk <italic>z</italic> = 1.20, <italic>P</italic> = 0.231, Wilcoxon signed rank test):</p><p>“Finally, we examined response times in relation to the subjective value associated with each trial as well as whether participants were making decisions for themselves or another individual. For the subjective value analysis, we first calculated the relative subjective value of each trial by subtracting the value of the unchosen option from the value of the chosen option. We then median split trials into high and low relative subjective value. Response times were slower for trials with lower relative subjective value than trials with higher relative subjective value for both the intertemporal and risky choice paradigms (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A; intertemporal <italic>z</italic> = 3.10, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002, risk <italic>z</italic> = 2.38, <italic>P</italic> = 0.017, Wilcoxon signed rank test). However, no differences in response times were observed between Self trials and Other trials in either paradigm (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B; intertemporal <italic>z</italic> = 1.01, <italic>P</italic> = 0.313, risk <italic>z</italic> = 1.20, <italic>P</italic> = 0.231, Wilcoxon signed rank test).”</p><p>We believe that these additional analyses represent a much more thorough examination of our behavioral dataset and greatly improve our manuscript compared to the initial version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are a number of issues with the correlation analysis of decoding accuracy and social attitudes that should be addressed. First, please compute these correlations without duplicating data points from the 10 subjects who participated in both sessions (for instance by averaging decoding accuracy in these subjects across both tasks). Second, please report how antisocial attitudes are related to behavioral performance, as one might expect that participants with more antisocial attitudes also show reduced correspondence between their decisions for the other person and the other person's preferences, or are less accurate when learning the other's preferences. Third, the authors use the &quot;normalized&quot; decoding accuracy, subtracting accuracy for self from accuracy for other. It might be interesting to know what is driving the effect, if they did not subtract one from the other.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these comments and entirely agree with these concerns. We now calculate all correlations without duplicating data points from the 10 participants who completed both sessions by averaging decoding accuracy in these participants across both tasks, as suggested by reviewers. The one exception to this is for the behavioral accuracy analyses detailed below. We determined accuracy in these analyses by calculating the deviation of each participant’s best-fitting parameter from the actual parameter of the other participant. Because these parameters were of at least an order of magnitude different across tasks, we decided to evaluate correlations separately across tasks in this case.</p><p>Importantly, the results that we reported in our original manuscript did not remain significant after using our new definition of relative subjective value (chosen – unchosen value) along with our new cross-validation approach to MVPA as well as with the suggestion to average participants who attended both sessions. While the correlation was still in the negative direction, the effect was far below significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = -0.112, <italic>P</italic> = 0.547, Spearman correlation).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Correlation between dmPFC accuracy in Other trials minus Self trials and self-reported social attitudes principal component score.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44939-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>As the reviewers also suggested, we examined dmPFC decoding accuracy during Other trials without normalizing to Self trials. Again, no correlation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = 0.095, <italic>P</italic> = 0.612, Spearman correlation).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Correlation between dmPFC accuracy in Other trials and self-reported social attitudes principal component score.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44939-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Next, we looked at the relationship between social attitudes and how accurate participants were at estimating the preferences of the other participant for whom they were making choices. As mentioned above, we quantified this as the deviation of each participant’s best-fitting parameter from the actual parameter of the other participant. Again, no correlation was observed for the intertemporal choice task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = -0.146, <italic>P</italic> = 0.538, Spearman correlation) or for the risky choice task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = -0.171, <italic>P</italic> = 0.456, Spearman correlation). Noise in both the behavioral choice data as well as in measures of social attitudes could contribute to our inability to determine a clear correlation between these variables. Furthermore, it need not be a distinct signature of prosocial attitudes to faithfully replicate another individual’s preferences. For example, in the intertemporal choice task, a very patient individual paired with a very impatient individual may act to make more patient choices for the other person as a way of shielding this other person from what the more patient individual perceives as a suboptimal decision.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Correlation between correspondence of choice behavior with partner preferences and self-reported social attitudes principal component score for the intertemporal choice task.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44939-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Correlation between correspondence of choice behavior with partner preferences and self-reported social attitudes principal component score for the risky choice task.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44939-resp-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Finally, we performed an analysis that was suggested by reviewer #1 in their individual comments. This suggestion was to evaluate a potential correlation between social attitudes and the cross-decoding accuracy when training on Self trials and testing on Other trials. We found the prospect of this analysis intriguing but first performed it with one modification. Cross-decoding accuracy, rather than being a measure of accurate neural representation of value per se, is more a measure of how distinct two models are from one another. Two very similar coding schemes would likely lead to high cross-decoding accuracy, while two more dissimilar schemes would likely lead to lower cross-decoding accuracy. Therefore, the accuracy when training on Other trials and testing on Self trials could be just as important for this analysis.</p><p>Following reviewer #1’s valuable insight, we thus calculated the cross-decoding accuracy for all participants, averaging accuracy when training on Self trials and testing on Other trials, and vice versa. This analysis yielded a significant positive correlation for agent cross-decoding accuracy in the dmPFC and antisocial attitudes (Figure 6C; <italic>r</italic>= 0.40, <italic>P</italic> = 0.025, Spearman correlation; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 confirmed via permutation test). Importantly, such a correlation was not observed in the vmPFC (Figure 6B; <italic>r</italic>= -0.08, <italic>P</italic> = 0.895, Spearman correlation). At first, these results seem counterintuitive. How could higher cross-decoding accuracy be associated with higher antisocial attitudes, as is suggested by the positive direction of the correlation? As we mentioned previously, it is important to consider that cross-decoding accuracy is not so much a measure of how well one’s dmPFC represents subjective value, but instead how similar the code for subjective value is across self and other agents in our study. Cross-decoding accuracy is therefore likely more of a measure of how generalizable classifiers are across agents. If a classifier is not able to generalize well across multiple datasets, these datasets probably utilize differentiated coding for subjective value. When these results are approached from this perspective, they start to become more interpretable and even intuitive. Participants who are more prosocial display dmPFC subjective value classifiers that can be more differentiated between self and other, demonstrating a more distinct code when making choices for other as opposed to self. Conversely, participants who are more antisocial display dmPFC subjective value classifiers that are less able to differentiate, indicating a more similar code for self and other value-based decision-making. It therefore seems that the significant cross-decoding that we observe in our study might not be a measure of prosocial empathy, as one might expect, but instead a potential measure of antisocial apathy in which participants make decisions for themselves and others using an indistinct neural code that does not distinguish other from self.</p><p>To ensure that this correlation was not simply observed by chance, we decided to also examine correlations between social attitudes and cross-decoding accuracy separately for training on Self trials and testing on Other trials, and vice versa. Results for the vmPFC remained negative (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A; train Self test Other <italic>r</italic> = 0.03, <italic>P</italic> = 0.880, train Other test Self <italic>r</italic> = -0.08, <italic>P</italic> = 0.653, Spearman correlation). However, the correlation between social attitudes and agent cross-decoding accuracy in the dmPFC remained remarkably intact in the same direction, with a significant relationship observed for training on Self and testing on Other (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B left; <italic>r</italic> = 0.453, <italic>P</italic> = 0.011) and a strong trend observed for training on Other and testing on Self (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B right; <italic>r</italic> = 0.341, <italic>P</italic> = 0.061). These results indicate that the correlation we now report is robust.</p><p>Finally, reviewer #1 also noted that they wanted to see the correlations individually for the intertemporal and risky choice tasks. When we performed this analysis separately for each task, we still observed no correlation in the vmPFC (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A; intertemporal <italic>r</italic> = -0.147, <italic>P</italic> = 0.537, risk <italic>r</italic> = -0.040, <italic>P</italic> = 0.862, Spearman correlation). However, even with diminished statistical power from reduced sample size, we still observed a trend toward a positive correlation in both tasks in the dmPFC (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B; intertemporal <italic>r</italic> = 0.415, <italic>P</italic> = 0.070, risk <italic>r</italic> = 0.423, <italic>P</italic> = 0.056, Spearman correlation). These results indicate that the observed relationship was not necessarily driven by the similarity or dissimilarity of the other participant or by specific task demands.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the opportunity to revisit these analyses. We feel that these updated results are more nuanced and greatly add to our manuscript. These results are further discussed in the manuscript in the sections copied below:</p><p>“To determine the relationship between this measure and agent cross-decoding of relative subjective value across Self and Other trials, we averaged encoding of value when training on Self trials and testing on Other trials, and vice versa, in either the vmPFC or dmPFC. […] As mentioned above, since agent cross-decoding is primarily a measure of how similar value coding is for Self and Other trials in the dmPFC, these results indicate that participants who report more antisocial attitudes tend to have value coding that is less differentiated when making decisions for themselves as opposed to other individuals in our experimental paradigms.”</p><p>“Interestingly, the correlation that we observe with self-reported social attitudes indicates that this ability of the dmPFC to retain value information in its neural code across Self and Other trials may not be associated with prosocial attitudes, as one might expect. Instead, the opposite appears to be true, as increased agent cross-decoding accuracy is positively correlated with antisocial attitudes in our study (Figure 6). This indicates that a neural code in the dmPFC that is more separable when making decisions for self versus other is associated with prosocial traits. While our sample size limits our ability to conclusively demonstrate this relationship, our findings raise the intriguing possibility that a neural code that makes individual-specific predications about self and other, perhaps by treating another individual as an independent agent, may underlie cognitive processes that result from an interactive process between prosocial preference and mentalizing about others.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is possible that choice stochasticity differs between self and other trials. It would therefore be important to also test models that include separate beta parameters for self and other trials.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the opportunity to explore our modeling more thoroughly. We have now included models that have two beta parameters, one for Self trials and one for Other trials, in our model testing. In both the intertemporal and risky choice tasks, models with one beta parameter for Self and Other trials fit best according to BIC (Figure 1B, E). We therefore continued to calculate the subjective value of each option using the same modeling that we used in the original manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
