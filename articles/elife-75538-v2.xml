growth is mainly dependent on the contribution of cytoplasmic contents from the interconnected sister cells, nurse cells. We have previously shown that cytoplasmic dynein is required for <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte growth and assumed that it simply transports cargoes along microtubule tracks from nurse cells to the oocyte. Here, we report that instead of transporting individual cargoes along stationary microtubules into the oocyte, cortical dynein actively moves microtubules within nurse cells and from nurse cells to the oocyte via the cytoplasmic bridges, the ring canals. This robust microtubule movement is sufficient to drag even inert cytoplasmic particles through the ring canals to the oocyte. Furthermore, replacing dynein with a minus-end directed plant kinesin linked to the actin cortex is sufficient for transporting organelles and cytoplasm to the oocyte and driving its growth. These experiments show that cortical dynein performs bulk cytoplasmic transport by gliding microtubules along the cell cortex and through the ring canals to the oocyte. We propose that the dynein-driven microtubule flow could serve as a novel mode of fast cytoplasmic transport.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>oocyte</kwd><kwd>nurse cells</kwd><kwd>cytoplasmic transport</kwd><kwd>ring canals</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM131752</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gelfand</surname><given-names>Vladimir I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cortical dynein performs bulk cytoplasmic transport by gliding microtubules along the cell cortex and through the ring canals to the oocyte.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microtubules perform many key cellular functions, such as cell division, migration, polarization/compartmentation, and intracellular long-range cargo transport. Cytoplasmic dynein (referred simply as dynein hereafter) is the major minus-end directed microtubule motor, and involved in numerous microtubule-based functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>). In interphase cells, dynein is the main motor responsible for transporting various cargoes towards the microtubule minus-ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>). In dividing cells, dynein functions at kinetochores, spindle poles, and at the cell cortex. Particularly, cortical dynein pulls astral microtubules and is therefore required for positioning the mitotic spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vaughan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karki and Holzbaur, 1999</xref>).</p><p>The core dynein complex contains two copies of heavy chain (DHC), intermediate chain (DIC), intermediate light chain (DLIC) and three different dynein light chains (Roadblock, LC8/Cut up and Tctex/Dlc90F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canty and Yildiz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Dynein heavy chain contains a ring of six AAA+ domains, and ATP hydrolysis-induced conformational change results in dynein walking towards the minus-ends of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cianfrocco et al., 2015</xref>). The activity of dynein is regulated by the dynactin complex including the largest subunit p150<sup>Glued</sup>/DCTN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>), and the Lis1-NudE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>), as well as several activating adaptors, such as BICD2/BICDL1, Spindly, and HOOK1/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canty and Yildiz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Olenick and Holzbaur, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dynein activity is required for <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A cartoon illustration of cytoplasmic dynein and its regulators.

First, it is required for germline cell division and oocyte specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McGrail and Hays, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 1999</xref>). During mid-oogenesis, dynein is required for transport of mRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) and organelles from nurse cells to the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mische et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nicolas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lu et al., 2021</xref>). Within the oocyte, dynein transports and anchors the anterior and dorsal determinants that are critical for axis determination for future embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Januschke et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duncan and Warrior, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trovisco, 2016</xref>). During vitellogenesis, dynein in the oocyte regulates endocytic uptake and maturation of yolk proteins from the neighboring somatic follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte undergoes dramatic cell growth and polarization during oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastock and St Johnston, 2008</xref>). Remarkably, the oocyte remains transcriptionally quiescent during most of the oogenesis. For its dramatic growth, the oocyte relies on its interconnected sister cells, nurse cells, for providing mRNAs, proteins, and organelles through intercellular cytoplasmic bridges called ring canals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastock and St Johnston, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mahajan-Miklos and Cooley, 1994</xref>). Previously, we showed that dynein heavy chain drives oocyte growth by supplying components to the growing oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lu et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we study the mechanism of dynein-driven transport of cargoes from nurse cells to the oocyte. We find that microtubules, which had previously been considered as static tracks for dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mische et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nicolas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lu et al., 2021</xref>), are robustly moved by dynein within the nurse cell cytoplasm, and more remarkably, from the nurse cell to the oocyte. We further demonstrate that this dynein-powered microtubule gliding creates cytoplasmic advection carrying cargoes in bulk to the oocyte, including neutral particles that do not interact with motors. Furthermore, we show that a chimeric gliding-only minus-end motor anchored to the cortex is sufficient to support transport of cargoes to the oocyte, and therefore to drive the oocyte growth. Finally, we describe here a novel mechanism for dynein-driven cytoplasmic transport: cortically anchored dynein drives microtubule gliding, and microtubules in turn move cytoplasmic contents in nurse cells and through the ring canals, driving oocyte growth. This provides a fast and efficient mode of bulk transport of a wide variety of components supplied by nurse cells to the oocyte.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynein is required for oocyte growth</title><p>The growing <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte is transcriptionally silent and mostly relies on its interconnected sister nurse cells for mRNAs, proteins, and organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastock and St Johnston, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mahajan-Miklos and Cooley, 1994</xref>). Dynein, the main minus-end directed microtubule motor in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, has been implicated in nurse cell-to-oocyte transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mische et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nicolas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated the roles of the dynein complex and its regulators in oocyte growth by taking advantage of a germline-specific Gal4, maternal α tubulin-Gal4<sup>[V37]</sup>, that is expressed in germline cells after the completion of cell division and oocyte specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sanghavi et al., 2016</xref>). This approach bypasses the requirement for dynein in the germarium. Knockdown of dynein by expressing either RNAi against dynein components (DHC, DLIC, Lis1) or a dominant negative construct of p150<sup>Glued</sup>/DCTN1 (<italic>p150<sup>Glued</sup>∆C</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mische et al., 2007</xref>) driven by this Gal4 line allowed for normal cell division and oocyte specification but caused complete arrest of oocyte growth (hereafter referred as the ‘small oocyte’ phenotype) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D’’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In spite of the growth inhibition caused by dynein knockdown, we found that the oocyte marker, Orb (oo18 RNA-binding protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lantz et al., 1994</xref>) is properly concentrated in the early oocytes, emphasizing that our approach does not interfere with germline cell division or oocyte specification. However, Orb is clearly dispersed from the small oocytes at later stages (stages 8–9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C&quot;, D&quot;, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), implying defects of nurse cell-to-oocyte transport. These data demonstrate that dynein core components and regulators are indeed essential for oocyte growth, likely via transporting cargoes into the oocyte.</p><p>As dynein activity relies on various cargo activating adaptors, we knocked down the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologs of three main dynein cargo-specific adaptors, BicD, Spindly, and Hook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Olenick and Holzbaur, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2018</xref>) by RNAi in the germ line. Among the three adaptors, knockdown of BicD inhibits the oocyte growth, while <italic>Spindly-RNAi</italic> and <italic>hook-RNAi</italic> do not cause obvious oocyte growth defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>This lack of oocyte growth phenotype in <italic>Spindly-RNAi</italic> and <italic>hook-RNAi</italic> animals is not due to low efficiency of the RNAi lines themselves, as knockdown of Spindly and Hook using these RNAi lines display typical loss-of-function mutant phenotypes of these adaptors. Maternal knockdown of Spindly (<italic>mat αtub<sup>[V37]</sup>&gt; Spindly-RNAi</italic>) caused all embryos to fail to hatch (N &gt; 200) and zygotic knockdown using a strong ubiquitous Gal4 (<italic>Actin5C-Gal4</italic>) led to 0% eclosion rate from <italic>Spindly-RNAi</italic> pupae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemente et al., 2018</xref>).

We examined whether the microtubule movement in the ring canals and associated oocyte growth during mid-oogenesis is a result of an early slow form of nurse cell dumping. We first measured the nurse cell size between stage 8 to stage 10 and found that nurse cells still undergo dramatic growth during this phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This nurse cell growth from stage 8 to stage 10 is quite distinct from the dumping phase, when nurse cells squeeze their cytoplasm to the oocyte and thus quickly shrink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gutzeit, 1986</xref>).</p><p>Second, nurse cell dumping requires the activity of non-muscle myosin-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wheatley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jordan and Karess, 1997</xref>). We tested whether myosin-II is required for stage 9 microtubule movement and overall oocyte growth. We used a RNAi line against the myosin-II heavy chain Zipper (<italic>zip-RNAi</italic>) to knockdown myosin-II activity, and an antibody recognizing phosphorylated myosin-II light chain (p-MLC, Ser19) as a readout of myosin-II activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jordan and Karess, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). We found that that myosin-II activity is dramatically diminished in <italic>zip-RNAi</italic> egg chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–2C</xref>’), suggesting that the <italic>zip-RNAi</italic> does inhibit myosin-II efficiently. However, <italic>zip-RNAi</italic> shows no defects in oocyte growth or Orb concentration from early to mid-oogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D–2G</xref>). Additionally, we induced germline clones of a loss-of-function allele of <italic>zip</italic> (<italic>zip<sup>2</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Halsell et al., 2000</xref>), and found that the majority of <italic>zip<sup>2</sup></italic> mutant egg chambers with proper oocyte specification can develop to mid-oogenesis without obvious delay in oocyte growth (25 out of 28 egg chambers; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H–2K</xref>). This is consistent with previous reports showing that the myosin-II light chain <italic>spaghetti squash</italic> (<italic>sqh</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wheatley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jordan and Karess, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doerflinger et al., 2022</xref>) and the ‘dumpless’ mutants, such as chickadee, E2F, and RAP150B, develop normally to stages 9~10 without major oocyte growth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooley et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Myster et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Imran Alsous et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Dynein is known to glide microtubules in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lu and Gelfand, 2017</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether dynein is the motor that moves microtubules in nurse cells. Knockdown of dynein using the <italic>Dhc64C-RNAi</italic> line results in a complete inhibition of microtubule movement within the nurse cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, B'</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video5">Figure 2—video 5</xref>). The microtubules in <italic>dynein-RNAi</italic> nurse cells are noticeably less curved than the control ones, implying no motors applying forces to them. More importantly, the motility of microtubules in the nurse cell-oocyte ring canals are dramatically reduced in <italic>dynein-RNAi</italic> (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video6">Figure 2—video 6</xref>). In contrast, we found that the microtubule movement through the ring canal is not affected by myosin-II inhibition (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video6">Figure 2—video 6</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the microtubule movement through the nurse cell-oocyte ring canals is not a part of myosin-II-driven nurse cell dumping; instead, it represents a novel mode of dynein gliding microtubules in nurse cells and through ring canals to the oocyte.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Microtubule flow carries cargoes to the oocyte</title><p>In addition to microtubule motility, we also observed synchronized movement of cargoes through nurse cell-oocyte ring canals in stage 9 egg chambers, at a rate similar to microtubule movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video7 fig2video8">Figure 2—videos 7; 8</xref>), indicating that microtubule-driven cytoplasmic advection occurs in the ring canals.

This further suggests that mitochondria, Golgi units and probably other classes of cargoes could be carried through ring canals in bulk by microtubules gliding towards the oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the motors attached to the cargoes walk on these moving microtubules and thus co-transport cargoes with microtubules through the ring canal. Thus, we decided to examine whether neutral particles that normally are not transported by motors along microtubules can be carried to the oocyte. We used Genetically Encoded Multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which self-assemble into ~40 nm fluorescent spheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delarue et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2<italic>R</italic> + cells, GEMs form bright compact particles and display mostly Brownian motion, which is very distinct from typical movements of endogenous motor-driven organelles, such as lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, when we expressed GEMs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg chambers, we found that they move within nurse cells in a fast linear manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–D’</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">Figure 3—video 3</xref>). More importantly, GEMs move through the nurse cell-oocyte ring canals (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video4">Figure 3—video 4</xref>) and concentrate in the oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>).

In <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, dynein plays an essential role in nurse cell-to-oocyte transport of mRNAs and organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mische et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nicolas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lu et al., 2021</xref>). This was logically attributed to the conventional mode of dynein-driven transport: the motor attached to the cargo moves on microtubule tracks located inside ring canals and carries cargoes to the oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we reveal a novel mechanism of bulk cargo transport by cytoplasmic dynein. First, we show that dynein core components and its regulatory cofactors are required for <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). By imaging microtubules in live ovaries, we demonstrate that microtubules are actively moved by dynein from nurse cells to the growing oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, we use an artificial cargo that does not bind motors and show that direct dynein-cargo interaction is not necessary for the cargo movement in nurse cells or its transporting to the oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), supporting a ‘go-with-the-flow’ mechanism driving cytoplasm transfer from nurse cells to the oocyte. To distinguish cytoplasmic advection from conventional cargo transport, we build a chimeric gliding-only motor by anchoring a minus-end-directed plant kinesin, Kin14VIb, to the cortex, and find that this chimeric cortically localized motor is sufficient to drive organelle transport and oocyte growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Lastly, we identify that the C-terminus of Dlic is sufficient to target the dynein complex to the nurse cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, we propose a novel mechanism of dynein for bulk cargo transport: cortically anchored dynein glides microtubules in the nurse cells; in turn these gliding microtubules move cytoplasmic contents within the nurse cells and from the nurse cells to the oocyte through the ring canals to the growing oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A novel phase of nurse cell-to-oocyte transport</title><p>Previously, nurse cell-to-oocyte transport has been divided into two phases: the early slow selective phase and the late fast non-selective phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mahajan-Miklos and Cooley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buszczak and Cooley, 2000</xref>). The early phase is characterized by dynein-driven cargo transport along microtubules to the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mische et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nicolas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lu et al., 2021</xref>).

This occurs between the two previously described phases, slow selective transport, and fast nurse dumping. As microtubules can drag adjacent contents in the viscous cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lu et al., 2018</xref>), we believe that this transport is non-selective. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the neutral particles (GEMs) are moved in the nurse cells and concentrated in the oocyte by dynein. Furthermore, we have found that a chimeric gliding-only motor unrelated to dynein that cannot directly transport cargoes along microtubules, plant kinesin-14, is able to rescue mitochondria transport from the nurse cells to the oocyte (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). As we use the motor domain of a moss kinesin-14 that has no known homology with the motor proteins that interact the mitochondrial adaptor protein Milton (e.g. KHC and Myosin 10 A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glater et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2008</xref>), we conclude that the advection created by microtubule movement in the ring canals is not cargo-specific, and it is different from the early selective transport phase.</p><p>During the dumping phase, nurse cells ‘squeeze’ all the cytoplasmic contents to the oocyte, which is caused by non-muscle myosin-II contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gutzeit, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jordan and Karess, 1997</xref>), and associated with fast cytoplasmic streaming occurring in the oocyte mixing the dumped contents with the ooplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mahajan-Miklos and Cooley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gutzeit and Koppa, 1982</xref>). We reason that the dynein-driven microtubule flow we observed is distinct from nurse cell dumping: (1) it occurs prior to nurse cell dumping and ooplasmic streaming (stages 8~9 versus stages 10B-11); (2) the nurse cell size grows drastically during microtubule flow stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), instead of fast shrinking associated with nurse cell dumping; (3) it requires cytoplasmic dynein, instead of myosin-II activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video6 fig2video9">Figure 2—videos 6; 9</xref>); (4) the ‘dumpless’ mutants develop normally without major oocyte growth defects to stages 9~10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wheatley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jordan and Karess, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doerflinger et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooley et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Myster et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Imran Alsous et al., 2021</xref>), which is noticeably different from the small oocyte phenotype we observed in dynein knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The dynein-driven microtubule flow occurs concurrently with the most rapid oocyte growth at stage 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). During stage 9, the oocyte size can increase up to 10 X within 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–1C</xref>). To achieve such a rapid growth, each of the four nurse cell-oocyte ring canals with a diameter of ~6.5 µm is estimated to have a flow of ~150 nm/s throughout the whole time. This is consistent with our experimental measurements of the velocities of both microtubules and small spherical particles in bright-filed images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Noticeably, mitochondria move at a slightly lower velocity compared to microtubules and small spherical particles, which is expected for organelles and large particles that are moved by viscous drag created by microtubule gliding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p>Microtubule movement in the nurse cells can be detected as early as in stage 6 egg chambers; however, the fast microtubule movement through the nurse cell-oocyte ring canals only starts in late stage 8 egg chambers, and becomes robust in stage 9 egg chambers. The stage-specific microtubule passage through the ring canals could be controlled by microtubule organization within the ring canals. In early oogenesis (stages 1–6), microtubules are nucleated from the oocyte and grow into the nurse cells with their plus-ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Theurkauf, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nashchekin et al., 2021</xref>). Even at stages 7–8, the microtubules within the ring canals still contain more plus-ends in the nurse cells and more minus-ends in the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lu et al., 2021</xref>). This particular microtubule orientation allows efficient dynein-dependent conventional cargo transport to the oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), but restricts dynein-dependent microtubule movement from nurse cells to the oocyte. Hence, these microtubules in the ring canals could basically function as a plug, and as a result microtubule flow through the ring canals is not often seen at these stages (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>). Massive microtubule reorganization occurs during mid-oogenesis (stages 7–8) and creates an anterior-posterior microtubule gradient in the oocyte with more microtubules minus-ends anchored at the anterior and lateral cortex at stages 8-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Theurkauf, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nashchekin et al., 2016</xref>). This microtubule reorganization in the oocyte could potentially disassemble the original ‘wrong’ orientated microtubules in the nurse cell-oocyte ring canals, which facilitates the dynein-driven microtubule flow to the oocyte (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>To summarize, the dynein-microtubule driven bulk cargo flow from nurse cells to the oocyte presents a novel phase between early selective transport and late non-selective dumping, which is essential for <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte growth. The stage-specific microtubule flow through the ring canals suggests that the complete small oocyte phenotype we observed in the dynein mutants are probably caused by the combination of lack of directed transport along microtubules at early stages and absence of microtubule-driven cytoplasmic advection to the oocyte at stage 9.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Dynein anchorage at the cell cortex</title><p>In this study, we found that cortical dynein glides microtubules to create local cytoplasmic advection and move cargoes to the growing oocyte. Furthermore, we found that the C-terminus of dynein light intermediate chain (DlicCT) targets the dynein complex to the nurse cell cortex. DlicCT contains the effector-binding domain that interacts with multiple dynein activating adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, our lab reported that Spindly, a dynein activating adaptor that interacts with DlicCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2018</xref>) and recruits dynein to the kinetochore in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemente et al., 2018</xref>), anchors dynein to cortical actin in axons, thus pushing microtubules of the wrong polarity out of the axons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Del Castillo et al., 2020</xref>). However, knockdown of Spindly does not disrupt dynein-dependent oocyte growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, it indicates that the ovary uses a different specific mechanism for dynein cortical targeting. We showed that cortically recruited BicD is able to rescue the oocyte growth arrest caused by <italic>BicD-RNAi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>), implying that BicD could contribute to the linkage between dynein and the cortex. Other studies also have suggested that the dynactin complex and Lis1 are involved in dynein cortical anchorage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moore et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Okumura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Swan et al., 1999</xref>). Nevertheless, DlicCT cortical localization is unaffected after inhibition of BicD, dynactin/p150, and Lis1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating Dlic uses a novel mechanism of anchoring dynein to the cortex in nurse cells. Intriguingly, Dlic interacts with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Par-3 homolog, Bazooka (Baz), and PIP5Kinase Skittles (SKTL) in the ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jouette et al., 2019</xref>), while Baz and SKTL are known to localize at the nurse cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jouette et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doerflinger et al., 2010</xref>). In vertebrates, dynein light intermediate chain 2 interacts with Par-3, 14-3-3 ε and ζ to anchor the dynein complex at the cortex for regulating mitotic spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mahale et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, NuMA and its <italic>Drosophila</italic> homology Mud link the dynein complex to the cortex via the interaction with membrane localized Gαi, for pulling mitotic spindle poles in dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kotak and Gönczy, 2013</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that NuMA has a Hook domain and a CC1-Box-like motif, both of which interact with the effector-binding domain of DLIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Renna et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, Baz/Par-3, SKTL, 14-3-3 ε and ζ, and NuMA/Mud are all potential linkers of Dlic to the cell cortex. However, loss of SKTL and Mud, mutants of 14-3-3 ε and ζ, or displacement of Baz from the cortex does not result in apparent oocyte growth defects, distinct from the dynein mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jouette et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doerflinger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yu et al., 2006</xref>). It is possible that these linkers are genetically redundant with each other to ensure the correct cortical localization of the dynein complex. Thus, disruption of one of the linkers does not cause the dynein complex to fall off from the cortex. Alternatively, Dlic is localized to the cortex independently of Par-3/Baz, SKTL, 14-3-3, and NuMA/Mud, by a new mechanism that awaits further studies.</p><p>Furthermore, we consistently observe cytoplasmic advection from the nurse cells to the oocyte in stage 9 egg chambers, suggesting a direction-controlling mechanism underlying the persistent oocyte growth. We speculate that the flow directionality could be attributed to different levels of dynein gliding activity. The dynein complex is strongly localized to the nurse cell cortex, but to a much lesser extent to the oocyte cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with the dynein localization, microtubules are more cortically localized in the nurse cells than in the oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This differences in dynein localization and microtubule organization may result in a higher dynein-driven microtubule gliding activity in the nurse cells, and therefore creates the directional flow through the ring canals to the growing oocyte.</p><p>In addition, this directionality could be controlled by the gatekeeper protein Short stop (Shot). Recently, we demonstrated that Shot is asymmetrically localized at actin fibers of ring canals on the nurse cell side and controls the cargo transport direction between nurse cells and the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lu et al., 2021</xref>). Given the nature of Shot’s actin-microtubule crosslinking activity, it could serve as an organizer of microtubules along the actin filaments of the ring canals on the nurse cell side and facilitate their transport toward the oocyte.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The ‘go-with-the-flow’ mechanism of cytoplasmic transport</title><p>Here we report that the minus-end directed motor, cytoplasmic dynein, glides microtubules, and microtubules in turn drag the surrounding highly viscous cytoplasm and transfer cytoplasmic contents from nurse cells to the oocyte. To our knowledge, this is the first report of microtubule gliding by cortical dynein driving cargo movement in interphase cells (the ‘go-with-the-flow’ mechanism).</p><p>Previously, we have demonstrated a similar mechanism for another major microtubule motor, conventional kinesin (kinesin-1). We have shown that kinesin-1 can slide microtubules against each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barlan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Del Castillo et al., 2015</xref>), and this microtubule sliding drives ooplasmic streaming, bulk circulation of the entire cytoplasm in late-stage oocytes that is essential for localization of the posterior determinant, <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lu et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, both major microtubule motors, plus-end directed kinesin-1 and minus-end directed dynein, in addition to the canonical mode of cargo transport along microtubules, can drive bulk transport of viscous cytoplasm. Yet kinesin-1 and dynein drive bulk movement in different manners: kinesin-1 drives microtubule sliding against each other, while dynein glides microtubules along the cortex; and for different purposes: kinesin-1 powers intracellular circulation, whereas dynein propels intercellular transport.</p><p>This ‘go-with-the-flow’ mechanism is highly efficient for bulk cargo delivery, especially in large cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldstein and van de Meent, 2015</xref>), such as the oocyte. The dynein-driven cytoplasmic advection allows the oocyte to acquire cytoplasmic materials for its rapid growth. Interestingly, the ring canals have been observed in female germline cells of vertebrate organisms (e.g. human, rabbit, rat, hamster, mouse, chicken, and frog) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haglund et al., 2011</xref>). Particularly, it has been shown that cytoplasmic contents such as mitochondria and Golgi material are transferred to the mouse oocyte from interconnected cyst cells in a microtubule-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lei and Spradling, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Niu and Spradling, 2021</xref>) . As dynein is highly conserved across species, it is important to have further studies to examine whether it plays a similar role in germline cytoplasmic transfer in higher organisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains</title><p>Fly stocks and crosses were maintained on standard cornmeal food (Nutri-Fly Bloomington Formulation, Genesee, Cat #: 66–121) supplemented with dry active yeast at room temperature (~24–25°C).

The authors demonstrate that the minus-end directed microtubule motor, dynein, generates cortical flow by gliding microtubules along the cell cortex. This action is distinct from dynein's cargo transport functions, as the authors replace dynein with a minus-end directed kinesin linked to the cortex and observe the same phenomenon. This flow is capable of propelling cargoes through the ring canals into the growing oocyte via a bulk cytoplasmic transport mechanism, highlighting a novel mode of fast cytoplasmic transport.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors all agreed that this is a robust, innovative and thorough study that warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic> once it has been revised with additional analyses and textual changes. While these are the major revisions required for publication, please address the comments on textual edits (e.g. introducing and using the terms advection or streaming for consistency within the field), as well as the comments on additional citations and discussion points raised by each reviewer.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Can the authors determine at which stage dynein-driven microtubule flow begins (stage 9 or earlier?) and whether this correlates with an increase in oocyte growth rate? Please see Reviewer 1's comments for additional details.</p><p>2) Can the authors analyze their current data sets to provide velocities for the movement of mitochondria (or Golgi since they appear to move at similar rates), GEMs, and microtubules? Please see Reviewer 1 and 3's comments for additional details.</p><p>3) All three reviewers noted that the last section about how Dlic is anchored to the cell cortex isn't well incorporated into the paper. The authors may want to consider how to best wrap up this section, perhaps by expanding upon this section with additional discussion about the possible linkers by citing different papers and listing the most likely candidates. Although additional experiments are not necessary for publication, we wanted to highlight this concern for the authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While one can always think of new experiments that might strengthen the paper (like acute pharmacological depolymerization of microtubules), my focus is on the rigor of some of the analysis and claims.</p><p>Throughout the paper the claim is made that this movement of microtubules and associated cytoplasm is robust in stage 9 and maybe 8 but no data are presented regarding this timing.

It's a low note to end on after a really nice paper. Maybe it could be combined with the observation that BicD is the only dynein adaptor that has (any) phenotype, which is important and gets a bit lost? Along these lines, are BicD, Spindly, and Hook all equally well expressed in oocytes?

Please include thoughts on this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As shown by the authors, the chimeric Kinesin motor is able to restore oocyte growth and Orb localization in Dlic depleted egg chambers. Given this result, it would be interesting to determine to what extent specific cargoes can be correctly localized in this background. For cargoes such as bicoid, nanos and oskar mRNA, their localization is thought to involve both specific motor-based transport and diffusion/entrapment mechanisms. In this chimeric Kinesin background, only diffusion/entrapment mechanisms would be active. Thus, this tool might be able to provide some answers to long-standing questions in the field.</p><p>The last part of the paper that attempts to identify how Dlic is anchored at the cell cortex appears somewhat disconnected from the rest. I appreciate the effort that the authors have made to show that the anchor is not BicD or Lis1. However, as a consequence, the paper has a rather abrupt ending. In addition, related to this point, the authors suggest that a potential anchor might be Bazooka. However, Doerflinger et al., 2010 (Development) characterized a mutant in Baz that no longer localizes to the cortex. This mutant is not associated with an oocyte growth defect, suggesting that Bazooka might not be the linker.</p><p>Related to this point, I wondered why the authors did not consider the possibility that Shot might be the possible linker. In their previous manuscript, they show that depletion of Shot is also associated with a similar oocyte growth defect. Given the known cortical localization of Shot and its role as an actin-microtubule crosslinker, it might make sense to consider Shot as the potential linker.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75538.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Can the authors determine at which stage dynein-driven microtubule flow begins (stage 9 or earlier?) and whether this correlates with an increase in oocyte growth rate?

We also provided further discussion on the initiation of microtubule flow from the nurse cells to the oocyte (see Discussion p.18, lines 371-386) as well as updating Figure 2 -Video 2 (comparing microtubules in the ring canals at stage 7 versus stage 9) to support our Discussion section. Furthermore, we quantified the oocyte sizes from stage 4 to stage 10A and we plotted these results either as average oocyte size for each stage (Figure 2I) and the range of oocyte sizes for each stage (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-1C). These data clearly show that the stage 9 oocyte has the highest growth rate, which is in an agreement of timing of the microtubule-driven flow to the oocyte (See Results p.9, lines 177-179).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Can the authors analyze their current data sets to provide velocities for the movement of mitochondria (or Golgi since they appear to move at similar rates), GEMs, and microtubules?

We also have added the velocity calculation based on oocyte size measurement in stage 9, which is consistent with our experimental data (see Discussion pp.17-18, lines 358-367) (please see more details in Response to Reviewer #1 Point #1, p.4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) All three reviewers noted that the last section about how Dlic is anchored to the cell cortex isn't well incorporated into the paper.

Although additional experiments are not necessary for publication, we wanted to highlight this concern for the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with this comment. To better wrap up the whole story, we made following changes on the Dlic section:</p><p>1) We have now included the Dlic NT and CT data into the main figure 5 (as Reviewer #3 suggested) and included more data showing that DlicNT or DlicCT truncations alone do not rescue <italic>Dlic-RNAi</italic> (Figure 5C; Results p.13, lines 259-263).</p><p>2) We tested the role of the actin-microtubule crosslinker Shot in DlicCT localization as suggested by Reviewer #2, and we found that DlicCT cortical localization is independent of Shot (see Results p.14, lines 283-288; Figure 5—figure supplement 1E).</p><p>3) In the results part, we modified the Dlic conclusion to better end this part of the results and leave an open question on how Dlic gets recruited to the cortex (see Results p.14, lines 289-297).</p><p>4) In the discussion, we added several other potential linkers, including PIP5Kinase Skittles, 14-3-3 epsilon and zeta, and NuMA/Mud, in addition to Baz/Par-3. We also addressed the lack of oocyte defects in single mutants (as Reviewer #2 pointed out) and discussed the possibility of genetic redundancy of these proteins to anchor dynein to the cortex (see Discussion p.20, lines 412-428).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>While one can always think of new experiments that might strengthen the paper (like acute pharmacological depolymerization of microtubules), my focus is on the rigor of some of the analysis and claims.</p><p>Throughout the paper the claim is made that this movement of microtubules and associated cytoplasm is robust in stage 9 and maybe 8 but no data are presented regarding this timing.

If so, one would expect to see a correlation with oocyte growth rates that is consistent with these the two phases. Does that exist? (Could be roughly calculated from classical data.)</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the information on the onset of microtubule movement within nurse cells (starting stage 6) and microtubule movement through nurse cell-oocyte ring canals (late stage 8-stage 9) (see Results p.7, lines 124-128 and Discussion p.18, lines 368-371). The initiation of the microtubule flow through the ring canal may be triggered by microtubule reorganization occurred in stage 7-8 oocytes as we see very different microtubule patterns in the ring canals connecting the nurse cells and the oocyte in stage 7 and in stage 9 (now we added the new data to Figure 2 -Video 2) (see Discussion p.18, lines 371-386) (more details in Response to Reviewer #1 Point #5, p.8).</p><p>We also quantified the oocyte sizes from stage 4 to stage 10A, and these data are included in Figure 2I (average size ± 95% confidence intervals for each stage) and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-1C (individual data points for stage 9, and the ratio of max/min and 95 percentile/5% percentile for each stage). Stage 9 clearly has the highest growth rate, consistent with the timing of onset of microtubule-driven cytoplasmic advection to the oocyte.</p><p>As the Reviewer suggested, we roughly calculated the flow velocity at stage 9. During stage 9, the oocyte grows up to 10X in size within 6 hours<sup>1</sup> (Figure 2-—figure supplement 1B-1C)<sup>1</sup>. We took the smallest oocyte size of stage 9 as the beginning size (~1400 µm<sup>2</sup>) and the largest oocyte size of stage 9 as the ending size (~14000 µm<sup>2)</sup>. To achieve such a rapid growth, each of the four ring canals connecting nurse cells to the oocyte with a diameter of ~ 6.5 µm is estimated to have a consistent flow of ~150 nm/sec throughout the whole time. This is consistent with our experimental results of the velocity of both microtubules and small spherical particles in bright-filed images (Figure 2H).</p><p>We did a similar calculation for stage 7 egg chamber and found out that to achieve the stage 7 oocyte growth (6 hours<sup>1</sup> with 4 ring canals of ~5.5 µm diameter), the flow is estimated to be around 1 nm/sec. Again, this is consistent with the results that we don’t have seen apparent flow at stage 7.</p><p>Regarding the slow selective transport phase, we do believe that it does exist for following reasons:</p><p>(1) At early stages, microtubules are nucleating from the oocyte (-) to the nurse cells (+) and forms an almost “static” microtubule plug in the nurse cell-oocyte ring canals (see the last part of the newly updated Figure 2 -Video 2). It is very unlikely that such microtubule organization can support the massive flow of cytoplasm through the ring canals.</p><p>(2) AT early stages, microtubules in the nurse cell-oocyte ring canals have ~90% plus-ends towards the nurse cells, which is consistent with the cargo transport directionality driven by dynein (~90% towards the oocyte; ~10% towards the nurse cells), but is inconsistent with the direction of microtubule gliding driven by cortically-attached dynein. This 10% cargoes going towards the nurse cells indeed argues against the possibility of flow at these stages.</p><p>(3) Our gliding-only motor chimeric motor (F-Tractin-Kin14) does not fully rescue the oocyte growth; instead, the oocyte size is ~30% of the wildtype. This leads us to believe that the slow selective transport indeed contributes to the oocyte growth (see Discussion p.19, lines 389-393).</p><p>(4) Starting stage 7 to early stage 8, the microtubule system in the oocyte undergoes dramatic reorganization in order to build an anterior-posterior microtubule gradient and thus to achieve proper body axis determination. We think that it is not the best option to use fast cytoplasmic advection non-selectively carrying all cytoplasmic contents to the oocyte during the microtubule reorganization phase. This is supported by the fact that in the stage 9 oocyte partially rescued by gliding-only F-Tractin-Kin14VIb, the axis determination is disrupted (see more details in the Response to Reviewer #2 point #1, pp.12-13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Transport of objects by cytoplasmic flow is called advection. Likewise, cytoplasmic streaming is a common term for this process. It's very odd that these terms are not introduced and/or used. It's not a new concept, just new and important in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is absolutely correct. Cytoplasmic movement is not new concept and has been studied for decades. We have replaced the term of “cytoplasmic flow” with “cytoplasmic advection” throughout the manuscript. We did not use the term of “cytoplasmic streaming”, because this is commonly referring to the bulk cytoplasmic rotation in the oocyte in stage 10B-11 (AKA ooplasmic streaming). We decided to keep the word “microtubule flow” because it describes microtubule synchronized movement, which is the cause of the cytoplasmic advection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Movement of mitochondria, cytoplasm, GEMs, and microtubules is variously describe as synchronized, moving together, etc. These terms seem unclear and potentially misleading. Of course, they are during the same stage and most almost certainly causally linked. Can you report movement rates? It looks like you should be able to measure them in your kymographs.

As Reviewer #1 predicted, the large elongated mitochondria display a slightly slower velocity compared to microtubules, while the small particles seem to have a similar speed as microtubules (see Discussion pp.17-18, lines 362-367).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The last section about Dlic isn't well incorporated into the paper.

Briefly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, the microtubules in the ring canals at early stages (stage 6-7) form a microtubule “plug” with the directionality that does not favor microtubule flow from the nurse cells to the oocyte. During the major microtubule reorganization at stage 7~8, the microtubule plug is “dissolved”, which allows moving microtubules in nurse cells to go through the ring canals to the oocyte at stage 9.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-75538-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>As shown by the authors, the chimeric Kinesin motor is able to restore oocyte growth and Orb localization in Dlic depleted egg chambers.

In Figure 4 -Video 1 and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref> of a stage 9 egg chamber (based on follicle cells and migrating border cells), oocyte nucleus is clearly mispositioned. This could be either because that individual motor-driven cargo transport is not rescued, or the anterior-posterior microtubule gradient is not properly established. As Reviewer #2 suggested, we stained the samples with Staufen, as a proxy of the posterior determinant <italic>osk</italic> mRNA, whose localization is known to be dependent on kinesin-1 in the oocyte. We found that Staufen was concentrated in the oocyte, which is probably carried via the cytoplasmic advection from the nurse cells to the oocyte. However, Staufen fails to localize to the posterior pole in the oocyte with the presence of endogenous kinesin-1. This lack of posterior accumulation of Staufen made us speculate that the partially rescued oocytes do not form the correct anterior-posterior microtubule gradient. The defect in microtubule reorganization could be due to the odd oocyte shape in early oogenesis (see Figure 4J, compared to Figure 4H). In Kin14 rescued samples, we very consistently observed the elongated oocyte shape, compared to more spherical-shaped oocyte in control. This abnormal shape would interfere proper signaling between oocyte and the follicle cells (for example, the posterior polar cells), and therefore disrupt the polarization events during mid-oogenesis.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-75538-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The last part of the paper that attempts to identify how Dlic is anchored at the cell cortex appears somewhat disconnected from the rest.
