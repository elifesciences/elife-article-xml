In 2020, prospective and retrospective surveillance detected a <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> outbreak with 253 isolates collected from 82 patients in 26 wards of a hospital. Its origin was dated to the late 1990s, just after the facility opened, and patient-to-patient and environment-to-patient cases of transmission were inferred. Over time, two epidemic subclones evolved in separate hosts and hospital areas, including newly opened wards, and hospital-wide sampling confirmed reservoirs persisted in the plumbing. Pathoadaptive mutations in genes associated with virulence, cell wall biogenesis, and antibiotic resistance were identified. While the latter correlated with the acquisition of phenotypic resistances to first (cephalosporin), second (carbapenems), and third (colistin) lines of treatment, maximum parsimony suggested that a truncation in a lipopolysaccharide component coincided with the emergence of a subclone prevalent in long-term infections. Since initial identification, extensive infection control efforts guided by routine, near real-time surveillance have proved successful at slowing transmission.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many bacteria thrive in moist hospital environments, such as sinks, drains and medical equipment, and pose a significant infection risk. For example, the bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> can cause severe infections in patients with burns, wounds or weakened immune systems. This species can further develop resistance to many antibiotics, making infections more difficult to treat and control.</p><p>Hospitals use infection prevention programs to detect and limit bacterial spread. But identifying how and where the bacteria persist remains a challenge. To reveal hidden outbreaks and identify environmental sources, scientists have started using genome sequencing – the process of reading a bacterium’s complete genetic code – to monitor how hospital infections begin and propagate.</p><p>To underscore the value of this method, Stribling et al. investigated a decades-long <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> outbreak in a hospital in the United States, despite ongoing infection control efforts. By sequencing the genomes of more than 250 bacterial samples collected over ten years, the team traced the outbreak’s origin to the late 1990s, soon after the hospital opened.</p><p>The same strain spread across multiple wards and evolved into two related subgroups. Genetic and environmental analyses revealed that contaminated sink drains acted as long-term reservoirs, repeatedly infecting patients even years apart. The bacteria gradually became resistant to several major antibiotics. Guided by these genomic insights, targeted infection control actions – such as sink decontamination and routine genomic monitoring –finally reduced new infections and helped contain the outbreak.</p><p>The findings of Stribling et al. demonstrate how routine genome sequencing can uncover hidden infection routes and guide more effective hospital control measures. Public health systems could use similar approaches to detect outbreaks earlier and prevent prolonged hospital contamination. Before this can become routine, hospitals will need access to affordable sequencing technologies, trained personnel and real-time data sharing. In the long run, such integrated genomic surveillance could protect patients and reduce the global burden of antibiotic-resistant infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nosocomial outbreak</kwd><kwd><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic></kwd><kwd>ESKAPE</kwd><kwd>antibiotic resistance</kwd><kwd>microbial genomics</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04vrzee53</institution-id><institution>United States Army Medical Command</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bennett</surname><given-names>Jason W</given-names></name><name><surname>Mc Gann</surname><given-names>Patrick T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Defense Medical Research and Development Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bennett</surname><given-names>Jason W</given-names></name><name><surname>Mc Gann</surname><given-names>Patrick T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division - The Global Emerging Infections Surveillance program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ProMIS P0098_22_WR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bennett</surname><given-names>Jason W</given-names></name><name><surname>Mc Gann</surname><given-names>Patrick T</given-names></name><name><surname>Lebreton</surname><given-names>Francois</given-names></name><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Melissa J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Routine genomic surveillance uncovered a decades-long multidrug-resistant <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> outbreak sustained by patient reservoirs and hospital plumbing, enabling targeted infection control measures that ultimately curtailed transmission.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is a versatile, opportunistic human pathogen causing a wide range of infections of both community and hospital origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerr and Snelling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">September et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rodríguez-Rojas et al., 2012</xref>). In the clinic, patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), severe burns, or neutropenia are of highest risk, and cases are associated with high morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rodríguez-Rojas et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the management of these infections is increasingly difficult due to the global emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, especially carbapenem-resistant <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (CRPA), which now account for 16–30% of cases in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">World Health Organization, 2017</xref>). In response, global and national agencies have categorized CRPA as a ‘critical’ pathogen posing a serious threat to public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">World Health Organization, 2017</xref>).</p><p>While high-risk MDR lineages, exemplified by the most globally prevalent sequence type (ST) 235, are enriched in isolates carrying acquired carbapenemases and/or extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Del Barrio-Tofiño et al., 2020</xref>), the hallmark of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lies in its remarkable propensity for developing resistances through chromosomal mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blair et al., 2015</xref>). Within the hundreds of intrinsic genes comprising this mutational resistome, several harbor well-characterized modifications that are the most common cause of resistance for nearly all classes of drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blair et al., 2015</xref>). These include gain-of-function mutations in gyrase subunits GyrAB (fluoroquinolones), penicillin-binding protein PBP3 (cephalosporins), various Mex efflux systems (multiple antimicrobials), as well as inactivation of the porin OprD (carbapenems) or the sensor component of the PhoPQ system, the latter associated with resistance to last-line polymyxin antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruchmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Being capable of both acute and chronic infection, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> possesses a large arsenal of virulence factors such as a type 4 pili (T4P), O-antigens and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), extracellular enzymes, exotoxins (e.g. ExoS/U), a flagellum and five types of secretion systems (TSSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jurado-Martín et al., 2021</xref>). These are generally part of complex regulatory pathways in which two-component systems (TCSs) often play a major role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jurado-Martín et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Juan et al., 2017</xref>). The ability of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to form biofilm is a key aspect of its persistence in patients with chronic infections, as well as in environmental niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thi et al., 2020</xref>). In the hospital, biofilms are often found in water-related environments, and eradication is particularly difficult due to increased disinfectant resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerr and Snelling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith and Hunter, 2008</xref>). This, in turn, poses a challenge for infection prevention and control (IPAC) as illustrated by the increasing reports of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> outbreaks and hospital-acquired infections (HAI) linked to contaminated sinks, drains, or taps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Naze et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Quick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sukhum et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parcell et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, routine genome-based surveillance of MDR clinical isolates across the US Military Health System (MHS) identified an epidemic cluster of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in a single hospital in 2020. Retrospective analysis of isolates from the preceding 10 years, together with Bayesian phylogenetics, revealed a protracted outbreak clone with cases from all hospital floors and an origin dated to the late 1990s.

However, two resources rarely available in other settings were key to this investigation: a genome repository of isolates from the preceding decade and the ability to conduct prospective environmental sampling. The former was integral to date the presumed origin of the outbreak to the late 1990s, soon after the hospital opened, and to trace the evolution and separate spread of two subclones throughout floors and wards. The latter revealed that, more than 20 years later, reservoirs of both subclones persist in sink drains from patient rooms throughout the facility. This supports previous evidence implicating these sites as major reservoirs for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerr and Snelling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kotay et al., 2017</xref>). Decontamination of drains can be extremely challenging due to the limited penetration of disinfectants, the lack of access (e.g. to perform scrubbing), recolonization (e.g. disposal of contaminated patient specimens), or retrograde growth from p-traps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerr and Snelling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith and Hunter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kotay et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, sinks with shallow basins and gooseneck faucets directing water straight into the drain, similar to those in Facility A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), have been linked to increased backsplash onto nearby surfaces and medical equipment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hota et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Besides environmental contamination, reservoirs within patients likely contributed to the spread and longevity of the outbreak. In particular, long-term infections, documented for a significant fraction of patients, provided a recurring source of the epidemic clone. It is noteworthy that 5 of the 6 patients with long-term (&gt;1 year) infections (and 9 out of 11 if reduced to 6 months) were carriers of subclone SC2. Compared to SC1, all but one SC2 isolates carried a truncated WbpX glycosyltransferase, an essential component of the common polysaccharide antigen (CPA) biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lam et al., 2011</xref>). While this mutation could result in increased immune evasion, the rough LPS phenotype recurrently observed in vivo (in particular in CF patients) usually results from a functional CPA but the lack of O-specific antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jurado-Martín et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). In further evidence for a progression toward a host-adapted lifestyle, a convergence of mutations in genes involved in alginate production, quorum-sensing deficiency, loss of motility, and decreased protease secretion, all phenotypes associated with chronic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marvig et al., 2015</xref>), was observed throughout the 10 years of sampling.</p><p>Considering its role in long-term infections and the distinctive association with patients and sinks in the Tower Building of Facility A, the origin and emergence of subclone SC2 is of particular importance. Although obfuscated by the limited sampling, a plausible scenario (supported by BEAST2 inferences) would be that a patient with an initial infection acquired during a stay in the Main Building before the SC1-2 split (ca. 2004) proceeded to shed the epidemic strain in the newly opened (2012) Tower Building during successive visits. Importantly, the Main and Tower Buildings of Facility A have distinct plumbing systems, providing the necessary ecological separation (minus inter-hospital patient transfers) for the further spread and divergence of the two sub-clones. Patient 27 is just such an example, but the lack of early sampling (2000–2010) and incomplete collection thereafter precludes a definitive answer. Indeed, other scenarios cannot be discounted, with a recent study showing sinks in a newly built ICU were already contaminated with an outbreak clone of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> before the arrival of the first patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sukhum et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>One of the most notable features of this outbreak was the evolution of antibiotic resistance over time, with the emergence of resistance to first (cephalosporin), second (carbapenems), and third (colistin) line treatments. The potent R504C substitution in PBP3 was selected in each subclone, and in addition to facilitating cephalosporin resistance, has also been linked to ceftazidime/avibactam resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">López-Causapé et al., 2017</xref>). While no patient prescription data is available from Facility A, it can be speculated that the high prevalence of cephalosporin resistance in early outbreak isolates led to increased carbapenem use, which in turn selected for the many independently evolved OprD mutants, one of the most common mechanisms for carbapenem resistance in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jurado-Martín et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, albeit limited to a single patient, the emergence of colistin resistance, through a well-characterized mechanism, is a reminder that the threat of extensively drug-resistant <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is only a prescription and a few mutations away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chambers and Sauer, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Some limitations were noted for this study and complicated the genomic inferences. First, although the criteria remained the same, the partial and inconsistent sampling of clinical <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates prevented from capturing the exact magnitude of the outbreak through the years, and sampling bias cannot be ruled out. Second, detailed epidemiological data for the patients (date of admission(s), bed location, reason for sampling, medications prescribed, etc.) were unavailable. As a result, possible patient overlaps were only inferred from the location and culture date of the isolates, and many were likely not detected. Third, fixed thresholds (i.e. genetic relatedness, time between isolates collection, and shared hospital location) were applied to predict a possible origin of infection. Acknowledging the other limitations, these were designed to predict the most likely cases of direct patient-to-patient transmission, when an overlap was identified, or environment-to-patient transmission, when a patient overlap was ruled out. Because of conservative criteria, the origins of most cases remained undetermined, and an alternative to fixed threshold, using TransPhylo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Didelot et al., 2021</xref>), is being explored in a follow-up study. This approach uses a probabilistic model to predict whom infected whom in outbreak scenarios and reconstruct transmission trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Didelot et al., 2021</xref>). Fitting our dataset, TransPhylo was recently extended to allow the use of multiple genomes per host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carson et al., 2024</xref>) and to incorporate epidemiological data into the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carson et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p>The data generated during this study has resulted in various ongoing interventions (e.g. closing sinks, replacing tubing, using foaming detergents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 2020</xref>) at Facility A. Sampling and sequencing, in near real-time, of all <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> clinical isolates (and not just MDR) also commenced in 2021. Notably, as of May 2025, no new ST-621 patient cases have been reported in over 15 months, and the unbiased contemporary data using all <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> from patients at this facility confirms the spread has slowed, with just four cases identified in 2022–2024. Similar to Facility A, the roll-out of routine WGS surveillance in the clinic has the potential to improve patient care and prevent some of the estimated 136 million hospital-associated drug-resistant infections per year globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balasubramanian et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data collection and antibiotic susceptibility testing</title><p>As mandated by the US National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (CARB), the MRSN collects and analyzes clinically relevant MDR organisms across the US MHS and around the world in collaboration with the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) Branch. All isolates received by the MRSN underwent WGS (single colony from a pure culture), and criteria for isolate collection were as follows. Between 2011 and 2020, all MDR isolates (resistance to ≥3 antibiotic families) were requested from all US facilities, but compliance varied between years and facilities.

To create violin plots, the complete all-vs-all dataset was limited, based on five sets of criteria, to pairs of isolates that (1) originated from different patients; (2) originated from different patients, and were collected in the same month; (3) originated from different patients and were collected in the same ward; (4) originated from different patients, were collected in the same month, and the same ward; or (5) originated from within the same patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>Primary isolates were designated as originating from a patient-to-patient transmission if they were part of a pair from different patients, were collected in the same ward, were separated by ≤10 SNPs (to account for the observed within-host variability, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), and were collected ≤31 days apart (as a proxy for a possible patient overlap). Primary isolates were conservatively designated as environmental if they were part of a pair from different patients, were collected in the same ward, were collected &gt;365 days apart (as a proxy for unlikely patient overlap), and were separated by a number of SNPs ≤3x the number of years they were separated to account for the 2.987E-7 substitutions/site/year from the BEAST analysis. This conservative threshold was chosen to favor high specificity as this inference relied solely on clinical isolates (i.e. the identical environmental strain in the patient-environment-patient chain was not sampled). For these clinical isolates to have acquired no/very little mutation in that much time, no/low replication is expected and, although unsampled, we propose this most likely happened on hospital surfaces.</p><p>In each of these cases, direct transmission or transmission mediated by a healthcare worker was not distinguished as no sampling was available from the later.

The authors identified and analysed 254 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ST 621 isolates collected from a facility from 2011 to 2020. The authors described the relatedness of the isolates across different locations, specimen types (sources), and sampling years. Two concurrently emerged subclones were identified from the 254 isolates. The authors predicted that the most recent common ancestor for the isolates can be dated back to approximately 1999 after the opening of the main building of the facility in 1996. Then the authors grouped the 254 isolates into two categories: (1) patient-to-patient; or (2) environment-to-patient using SNP thresholds and known epidemiological links. Finally, the authors described the changes of resistance gene profiles, virulence genes, cell wall biogenesis and signaling pathway genes of the isolates over the sampling years.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The major strength of this study is the utilisation of genomic data to comprehensively describe the characteristics of a long-term <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ST 621 outbreak in a facility. This fills the data gap of a clone that could be clinically important but easily missed from microbiology data alone.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>As the authors highlighted in the Discussion section, a limitation of this study is that there is potential sampling bias due to partial sampling of clinical <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates. However, the work is still important to showcase the potential benefits of applying genomic sequencing techniques to support infection prevention controls in hospital settings. The limitation on potential sampling bias could inspire further work to explore an optimal clinical isolate sampling framework for genomic analyses to support outbreak investigation. The other limitation that the authors have highlighted in the Discussion session is the lack of epidemiology data to support the interpretation of the inferred patient-to-patient and environment-to-patient transmissions, which emphasised the importance of metadata to complement genomic data analysis in outbreak investigation for future studies.</p><p>Impact of the work:</p><p>First, the work adds to the growing evidence implicating sinks as long-term reservoirs for important MDR pathogens, with direct infection control implications. Moreover, the work could potentially motivate investments in generating and integrating genomic data into routine surveillance. The comprehensive descriptions of the <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ST 621 clones outbreak is a great example to demonstrate how genomic data can provide additional information about long-term outbreaks that otherwise could not be detected using microbiology data alone. Moreover, identifying the changes in resistance genes and virulence genes over time would not be possible without genomic data. Finally, this work provided additional evidence for the existence of long-term persistence of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ST 621 clones, which likely occur in other similar settings.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The paper would be further strengthened from an additional timeline indicating when routine surveillance was introduced and examples of actions or changes guided by the surveillance data that resulted in decrease in ST 621 transmission.

describing outbreaks of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ST 621 in a facility in the US using genomic data. The authors identified and analysed 254 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ST 621 isolates collected from a facility from 2011 to 2020. The authors described the relatedness of the isolates across different locations, specimen types (sources), and sampling years. Two concurrently emerged subclones were identified from the 254 isolates. The authors predicted that the most recent common ancestor for the isolates can be dated back to approximately 1999 after the opening of the main building of the facility in 1996. Then the authors grouped the 254 isolates into two categories: (1) patient-to-patient; or (2) environment-to-patient using SNP thresholds and known epidemiological links.

For instance, the definition given in the manuscript for patient-to-patient transmission could not rule out the possibility of the existence of a shared contaminated environment. Equally, as patients were not routinely swabbed, unobserved carriers of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ST 621 could not be identified and the possibility of misclassifying the environment-to-patient transmissions could not be ruled out. Moreover, reporting of changes in rates of resistance to imipenem and cefepime could be improved by showing the exact p-values (perhaps with three decimal places) rather than dichotomising the value at 0.05. By doing so, readers could interpret the strength of the evidence of changes.</p><p>Impact of the work:</p><p>First, the work adds to the growing evidence implicating sinks as long-term reservoirs for important MDR pathogens, with direct infection control implications.

A main goal of this study was to show that integrating routine wgs in the clinic was a game changer for infection control efforts. We appreciate this aspect was highlighted as a strength by this reviewer. While some of the weaknesses identified are inherent to the data (or lack thereof) available for this study, we have revised the manuscript to include a detailed discussion on limitations (sampling, thresholds of genetic relatedness, definition and categories etc.) that could influence the genomic inferences. We also provided exact p-values for the changes in rates of resistance, as requested. Finally, we have positively answered all the specific recommendations suggested by the reviewer and modified the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present a report of a large <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> hospital outbreak affecting more than 80 patients with first sampling dates in 2011 that stretched over more than 10 years and was only identified through genomic surveillance in 2020.

We agree that the lack of patient epi data (e.g. date of admission and discharge) and the inconsistent sampling through the years are limitations of this study.

We agree with the reviewer that fixed thresholds and definitions are imperfect to classify the origin of an infection. The design of this study (e.g. inconsistent sampling through time) was not conducive to provide a comprehensive/quantitative measurement of transmission routes. Thus, we decided to apply conservative thresholds of genetic relatedness and strict conditions (e.g. time between isolate collection, shared hospital location etc.) to favor specificity as our goal was simply to establish that cases of environmentto-patient transmission did happen. In the absence of a truth set, we have not performed sensitivity analysis, but we are conducting a follow-up study to compare inferences from MCMC models to our original fixed-thresholds predictions. This limitation is now discussed in the revised manuscript. Finally, we have positively answered all the specific recommendations suggested by the reviewer and modified the manuscript accordingly including the addition of Figure S3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The definitions used on lines 391-396 are necessarily somewhat arbitrary, but it would be helpful to have a little bit more justification for the choices made, particularly for the definition of environmental involving the &quot;3x the number of years they were separated&quot;. It seems a little hard to square this with the more relaxed 10 SNP cutoff for a patient-to-patient designation. Are there reasons for thinking SNP differences associated with environmental transmission should be smaller than for patient-to-patient, or is the aim here just to set the bar higher for assuming an environmental source? Because these definitions are quite arbitrary, there could also be some value in exploring the sensitivity of the results to these assumptions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We agree with the reviewers that SNP thresholds, albeit necessarily, are arbitrary and that more discussion/justification was needed to put the genomic inferences in context. We have revised the manuscript to indicate that: 1/ the 10 SNP cutoff for a patient-to-patient designation was set to account for the known evolution rate of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (inferred by BEAST at 2.987E-7 subs/site/year in this study and similar to previous estimates PMID: 24039595) and the observed within host variability (now displayed in revised Fig. 1E). We note that this SNP distance was not sufficient and that an epi link (patients on the same ward at the same time) needed to be established. 2/ the environment-to-patient definition was indeed set to be most conservative (nearly identical isolates in two patients from the same ward with no known temporal overlap for &gt; 365 days). This was indeed done to favor high specificity as this inference relied solely on clinical isolates (i.e. the identical environmental strain in the patientenvironment-patient chain was not sampled). For these clinical isolates to have acquired no/very little mutation in that much time, no/low replication is expected and, although unsampled, we propose this most likely happened on hospital surfaces.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the term &quot;core genome&quot; should be familiar to most readers, &quot;shell genome&quot; and &quot;cloud genome&quot; are less widely known, and an explanation of what these terms mean here would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have revised the manuscript to define the core, shell, and cloud genomes as genes sets found in ≥ 99%, ≥ 95% and ≥ 15% of isolates, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the first paragraph of the discussion, it could be added that in many cases for clinically important Gram negatives short read sequencing alone will fail to detect transmission events as outbreaks can be driven by plasmid spread with only very limited clonal spread (see, for example, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00879-y">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00879-y</ext-link>)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We agree this is an important/emerging aspect of surveillance. However, the goal of this discussion point was to explain why such a large outbreak was missed prior to implementing WGS (short read) surveillance. We feel that discussing “plasmid outbreaks” (which is not at play here, and relatively rare in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> compared to the Enterobacteriaceae) and the need for long read will distract from the narrative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>line 599 What does &quot;Mock&quot; mean here?

Neither Figure 1D nor Table S1 allows for differentiating between clinical and screening samples. Most isolates were cultured from clinical materials, and there is no information about the patients' length of stay and their respective sampling dates. Is there any possibility of finding out whether the samples were collected for clinical or screening purposes? Would it be possible to include the patients' admission data to determine whether the strains were imported into the hospital or related to a previous stay, e.g. among known carriers? Also, the issue of sampling dates vs. patient stay on the ward should be addressed, as there may be an overlap in patients' stay on the ward but no overlap in terms of sampling dates or even missing samples (missing links).</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript to address this important point: (i) 16 isolates were from surveillance swabs and are labelled “Surveillance” in Table S1. The remaining 237 were clinical isolates; (ii) unfortunately, because the sampling was done under a public health surveillance framework, we do not have access to historical patient data (admission/discharge date, wards, rooms, etc.) and we can not calculate length of stay or better identify patient overlap. These limitations are now acknowledged in the discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In order to evaluate the extent of the outbreak, more epidemiological data would be useful What is the size of the hospital, what is the average patient turnover, and what is the average length of stay in ICU and non-ICU? Is there any specialization besides the military label?</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript to indicate that facility A is 425-bed medical center and is the only Level 1 trauma center in the Military Health System. Unfortunately, the data to calculate length of stay, throughout the years, in ICU and non-ICU, was not available to us. This limitation is now also acknowledged in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Perhaps the authors could attempwt to discuss the extent to which large outbreaks like these may be considered as part of unavoidable evolutionary processes within the hospital microbiome as opposed to accumulation and transmission of potentially harmful genes/clones, and differentiate between the putative community spread without any epidemiological links on the one hand, and hospital outbreaks that could be targeted by local infection prevention activities on the other hand.,</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the suggestion that this large outbreak “may be considered as part of unavoidable evolutionary processes within the hospital microbiome” and should be opposed to “transmission of potentially harmful genes/clones”. As a matter of fact, our data showed that infection control staff at Facility A responded with multiple interventions, including closing sinks, replacing tubing, and using foaming detergents. This resulted in slowing the spread of the ST621 outbreak with just 3 cases identified in 2022, 0 cases in 2023 and 1 case in 2024. This is now discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 5, lines 88-92 lines 101-104. It seems as if the outbreak was identified only by the means of genomic surveillance. This raises questions as to the rationale for sampling and sequencing, especially prior to 2020. Considering 11 cases per year between 2011 and 2016, one could assume such an outbreak would have been noticed without sequencing data.</p></disp-quote><p>The MRSN was created in 2010, in response to the outbreak of MDR Acinetobacter baumannii in US military personnel returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Between 2011 and 2017, the MRSN collected MDR isolates (mandate for all MDR ESKAPE but compliance varied between years and facilities) from across the Military Health System and, for select isolates (e.g. high-risk isolates carrying ESBLs or carbapenemases) performed molecular typing by PFGE. In 2017 the MRSN started to perform whole genome sequencing of its entire repository. In 2020, a routine prospective sequencing service was started and first detected the ST621 outbreak. A retrospective analysis of historical isolate genomes (2011-2019) identified additional cases. The first paragraph of the discussion lists possible factors to explain why the ST621 escaped detection by traditional approaches. We believe 11 cases per year is not a strong signal when stratified by month, wards, or both, especially for a clone lacking a carbapenemase and without a remarkable antibiotic susceptibility profile.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did the infection control personnel suspect transmission? If yes, was the sampling and submission of samples to the MRSN adapted based on the epidemiologic findings?</p></disp-quote><p>The ST621 outbreak was unsuspected before the initial genomic detection in 2020. Until that point, MDR isolates only (Magiorakos et al PMID: 21793988) were collected but compliance was variable through time. Quickly thereafter (starting in 2021), complete sampling of all clinical <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (MDR or not) from Facility A was started. The manuscript was revised to clarify those details of the sampling strategy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there any information about how many environmental sites were sampled without evidence of ST621 / screening samples were cultured without evidence of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>?</p></disp-quote><p>For patient isolates, only 16 isolates were from surveillance swabs. The remaining 237 were clinical isolates. No denominator data was available to calculate <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and ST-621 positivity rate in surveillance swabs throughout the time period. For environmental isolates, a total of 159 swabs were taken from 55 distinct locations in 8 wards/units including the ER. This data is now included in the revised manuscript. However, a complete analysis of these swabs (positivity rate for ESKAPE pathogens, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, per ward/floor/room, per swab type (sink drain, bed rail etc.) etc.) is beyond the scope of this study and is being performed as a follow up investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 5 lines 89 and 39 Figure S1B. Please describe how the allelic distance for the cluster threshold was selected.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in the legend of Figure S1B, no thresholds were applied. All ST621 isolates ever sequenced by the MRSN were included. All except 3 isolates shared between 023 cgMLST allelic differences. The remaining 3 were distant by 88-89 allelic differences. The text was revised to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 5 lines 99-100. Could the authors please provide some distribution measures (e.g. IQR).</p></disp-quote><p>Done as requested.

In the text it is stated that isolates were collected in 27 wards, the figure 1C depicts 26 wards and n/a.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for spotting this inconsistency. This has been fixed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 6 lines 117-118. Samples collected in the emergency room would imply samples collected on admission, already addressed previously. Did the authors investigate a potential import into the hospital from community reservoirs or were all these isolates collected among patients who had been previously admitted to the hospital and/or tested positive for the outbreak strain?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that samples collected in the ER imply samples collected on admission. Of the 29 ER isolates only 9 (31%) were primary isolates (first detection in a new patient) which suggests a majority were from returning patients at Facility A. Because the sampling was done under a public health surveillance framework, we do not have access to historical patient data (admission/discharge date, wards, rooms, etc.) to investigate/confirm that these 9 patients had previous visits at Facility A. This point is now discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 6 line 128. This could also represent increased selective pressure. However, according to Table S1, the 28 isolates collected in 2011 (the number does not match with Figure 1D) were from many different wards, thus indicating earlier spread throughout the hospital.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree. Please note that table S1 lists all isolates for 2011 whereas Figure 1D focuses on primary (first isolate from each patients) only.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 7 line 133. Both Figure 2 and the discussion section, page 13 line 296 suggest the year 2005 instead of 2004?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this typographical error.

We have revised Figure 1E accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 7, lines 146-147 Could the authors attempt explaining the upper part of the bimodal peaks?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an all-vs-all SNP analysis for all inter-patient isolates. For each isolates all distances to other isolates are reported, not only the smallest. The upper peaks represent comparisons to isolates from a different outbreak subclone (SC1 vs SC2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 7, line 150 This is a very small number considering the extent of the outbreak and suggests a large number of missing links. Or does this rather imply continuous import and evolution over time that does not necessarily represent transmission within the hospital?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe all cases were due to transmission happening within the hospital. Based on conservative thresholds (genetic relatedness and epi link, or lack thereof) the precise origin from another patient (n=10) or a contaminated surface (n=12) can be inferred. For the remaining 60 patients, with the available sampling, the conditions we chose are not met and we simply do not conclude whether a direct patient-to-patient or an environmental origin was more likely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 8 line 155.

Please specify.</p></disp-quote><p>The temporal overlap was investigated from sampling dates, as dates of patient admission/discharged were not available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 8, line 157: What does primary/serial isolate mean - first and follow-up samples of ST621 per patient?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes.

Serial isolates designate follow-up samples of ST621.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 8 line 165: Table S3 and Figure 3 only refer to environmental samples from three wards.

We have revised the text and the caption of the figure to clarify that only isolates from one patient developed colistin resistance.

Specifically, we have added column E labeled “Counts independent mutations per locus (excluding SYN)”. A total of 205 rows (in this table each row is a variant) have a value ≥ 2 and these represent 64 genes (upon deduplication of locus tags).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 13, lines 280-281: Where is the information on chronic infection presented?

I understand that some of the data are described in more detail in Lebreton et al but I did not find the specific criteria for the collection of the isolates and I imagine that these might differ if different facilities. Would it be possible to comment on that and add a short paragraph in the Methods section?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. This lack of clarity was also raised by other reviewers, and we have revised the manuscript to indicate that: 1/MDR isolates only (Magiorakos et al PMID: 21793988) were collected from 2011-2020 with the same criteria for all facilities although compliance was variable through time and between facilities; and 2/ starting in 2021 all <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates, irrespective of their susceptibility profile, were collected from Facility A</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data comes from a US Military hospital. Is this related to the US Veterans Affairs Healthcare system? Is there more detailed information about the demographics of the patient population?</p></disp-quote><p>Facility A is part of the Military Health System (MHS) which provides care for active service members and their families. This is distinct from the US Veterans Affairs Healthcare system. Only limited patient data was accessible to us as this study was done as part of our public health surveillance activities. Patient age (avg. 57.2 +/- 21.0) and gender (ratio male/female 1.7) are provided in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 384ff: The origin of infection was inferred based on the SNP threshold and epidemiological links. However, recombination events can complicate the interpretation of SNP data. Have the authors attempted to account for this?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We agree that recombination events can complicate the interpretation of SNP data. We used Gubbins v2.3.1 to filter out recombination from the core SNP alignment, as indicated in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors' definition of environment-to-patient transmission seems conservative (nearly identical strain and no known temporal overlap for &gt; 365 days). Have the authors changed the threshold, performed sensitivity analyses, and tested how this would affect their results?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, acknowledging that fixed thresholds have limitations in their ability to accurately predict the origin of infections, we took a conservative approach to favor specificity as our goal was simply to establish that cases of environment-to-patient transmission did happen. In the absence of a truth set, we have not performed sensitivity analysis, but we are conducting a follow-up study to compare inferences from MCMC models to our original predictions. This limitation is now discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors don't seem to incorporate the role of healthcare workers in the transmission process. Could they comment on this? I am assuming that environment-to-patient transmission could either be directly from the environment to the patient or via a healthcare worker. I think it's fine to make simplifying assumptions here but it would be great if this was explicitly described.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have not sampled the hands of healthcare workers in this study. As a result, the reviewer is correct to say that we made the simplifying assumption that healthcare workers would be possible intermediates in either environment-topatient or patient-to-patient transmissions, as previously described by others (PMID: 8452949). This limitation is now discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 5, line 100: What does &quot;all vs all&quot; mean? Based on the supplement, I assume it's the pairwise distance and then averaged across all of those. It would improve the readability of the manuscript if the authors could briefly define this term and then maybe refer to Table S1.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have created Fig.S2 and revised the manuscript to state that ST-621 isolates from facility A belonged to the same outbreak clone with a distance (averaged all vs all pairwise comparison) of just 38 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and an IQR of 19 (Fig. S2, Table S1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1D: It would be interesting to see additional figures in the supplement on the percentage of sequenced isolates per year and whether it varies across the different sources/sites. Is there any information on which isolates were chosen for sequencing?</p></disp-quote><p>Lack of clarity in the sampling/sequencing scheme was raised by multiple reviewers and we have provided a thorough response to earlier comments. We also have revised the material and methods section accordingly. Finally, we have created Fig. S3 to show the percentage of sequenced isolates per year across different sources/sites, as suggested by the reviewer. No noticeable patterns were observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems like only a subset of all clinical isolates were sequenced. Would it be possible that SC2 was present already earlier but not picked up until a certain date?</p></disp-quote><p>Although all isolates received by the MRSN were sequenced, compliance varied through time so it is true that not all clinical isolates were sequenced between 2011-2019. As such, we fully agree with this hypothesis and discuss this possibility as BEAST analysis placed the origin of SC2 in 2004 while the first detection of an SC2 isolate was in December 2012. This limitation is now discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the authors elaborate on whether the isolates resulted from single-colony picks? Is it possible that the different absence of a subclone is due to the fact that they picked only a colony?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the isolates resulted from single-colony picks except when the presence of different colony morphologies was noted. In the latter, representative isolates for each colony morphologies were processed. We have revised the methods to make that clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: It is difficult to see which nodes belong to which patient due to the small font size. I wonder if it was possible to color the nodes for each patient, to make it more readable.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried coloring the nodes but with &gt; 60 distinct patients/colors we decided it did not improve clarity. We have revised figure 2 to increase the font size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 7-8, lines 154-155: Did the authors check whether there were isolates of the same strain (that were found in the environment) present in other patients elsewhere in the ward?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. In rare cases, we observed virtually genetically identical isolates from two patients collected in different wards. Because we only have access to clinical isolate data (collected from patient X in ward Y) and do not have access to patient data (admission/discharge date, wards, rooms, etc.), we do not know but cannot exclude that patients overlap in a room prior to the sampling of their <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates. We designed our fixed thresholds to be conservative. As a result, in this analysis, these cases are labelled as “undetermined”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 8: Do the authors have any information on antibiotic use during this timeframe? From the discussion, it seems like there is no patient-level prescription data. Is there any data on overall trends? How were trends in antibiotic use correlated with trends in antibiotic resistance?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, patient-level prescription data (or any other data not linked to the bacterial specimens) was not accessible to us as this study was done as part of our public health surveillance activities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To infer the origin of infection, the authors used a static method with fixed thresholds and definitions. This study does not provide any uncertainty with their estimates. Maybe the authors could add a sentence in the discussion section that MCMC methods to infer transmission trees incorporating WGS could provide these estimates. These methods have not been applied to PA a lot but two examples where MCMC methods have been used without WGS (though the definition of environmental contamination may differ between these studies and this study).</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13756-022-01095-x">https://doi.org/10.1186/s13756-022-01095-x</ext-link></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006697">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006697</ext-link></p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this great suggestion.

While our paper shows a particular example of protracted <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> outbreak, the roll-out of routine WGS surveillance in the clinic will help prevent hospital-associated drug-resistant infections for more than this species.
