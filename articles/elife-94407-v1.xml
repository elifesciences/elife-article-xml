While the factors that control the chromatin association of MYC proteins are well understood, much less is known about how interacting proteins mediate MYC’s effects on transcription. Here, we show that TFIIIC, an architectural protein complex that controls the three-dimensional chromatin organisation at its target sites, binds directly to the amino-terminal transcriptional regulatory domain of MYCN. Surprisingly, TFIIIC has no discernible role in MYCN-dependent gene expression and transcription elongation. Instead, MYCN and TFIIIC preferentially bind to promoters with paused RNAPII and globally limit the accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNAPII at promoters. Consistent with its ubiquitous role in transcription, MYCN broadly participates in hubs of active promoters. Depletion of TFIIIC further increases MYCN localisation to these hubs. This increase correlates with a failure of the nuclear exosome and BRCA1, both of which are involved in nascent RNA degradation, to localise to active promoters. Our data suggest that MYCN and TFIIIC exert an censoring function in early transcription that limits promoter accumulation of inactive RNAPII and facilitates promoter-proximal degradation of nascent RNA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MYCN</kwd><kwd>TFIIIC</kwd><kwd>neuroblastoma</kwd><kwd>promoter hub</kwd><kwd>nuclear exosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005972</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Krebshilfe</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>70113303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Büchel</surname><given-names>Gabriele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005972</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Krebshilfe</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>70113870</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eilers</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INST 93/1023-1-FUGG and EI222/21-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eilers</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001445</institution-id><institution>Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation for Childhood Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Crazy 8 Initiative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eilers</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Büchel</surname><given-names>Gabriele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008672</institution-id><institution>Wilhelm Sander-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023.002.1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herold</surname><given-names>Steffi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/V029975/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leen</surname><given-names>Eoin</given-names></name><name><surname>Bayliss</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MYCN and TFIIIC exert a censoring function during early transcription, limiting the accumulation of inactive RNAPII at the promoter and facilitating promoter-proximal degradation of nascent RNA.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The MYC family of proto-oncogenes is at the epicentre of cellular regulatory networks that govern cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kress et al., 2015</xref>). The three MYC paralogs (MYC, MYCN, and MYCL) are central players in normal development and tissue homeostasis, and when dysregulated, fuel many of the processes that are hallmarks of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dhanasekaran et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanahan, 2022</xref>). Among them, MYCN has attracted attention for its causal role in the development of neuroblastoma and other childhood tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rickman et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Both MYC and MYCN bind to virtually all active promotors and profoundly alter the dynamics of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription, with an increase in pause release and elongation being most apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herold et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Walz et al., 2014</xref>). One consequence of these changes are alterations in expression of a broad range of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dhanasekaran et al., 2023</xref>). Unrelated to those changes in gene expression, MYC and MYCN also control RNAPII function to limit the accumulation of R-loops, to facilitate promoter-proximal double-strand break repair and to coordinate transcription elongation with DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Papadopoulos et al., 2023</xref>). Which of these effects are critical for the oncogenic functions of MYC is an open question and consequently the partner proteins via which MYC proteins alter RNAPII dynamics are under intense investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baluapuri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baluapuri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Büchel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heidelberger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kalkat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lourenco et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oksuz et al., 2023</xref>).

MYC-dependent effects on RNAPII elongation involves the transfer of elongation factors SPT5 and PAF1c from MYC onto RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baluapuri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Endres et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jaenicke et al., 2016</xref>). Both MYC and MYCN also interact with and activate topoisomerases I and II, suggesting that MYC/N-dependent pause release also involves the relieve of torsional stress that builds up during early transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, both MYC and MYCN form prominent complexes with TFIIIC and mapping experiments for MYCN show that the amino-terminal transcriptional regulatory domain is required for the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Büchel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heidelberger et al., 2018</xref>). TFIIIC was first identified as a general transcription factor for RNAPIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Orioli et al., 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, TFIIIC also binds to thousands of genomic sites that are not shared with RNAPIII and are called <underline>e</underline>xtra <underline>T</underline>FIII<underline>C</underline> (ETC) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noma et al., 2006</xref>). Many ETC sites localise to RNAPII-transcribed promoters and such sites are often juxtaposed to MYCN binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Büchel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moqtaderi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oler et al., 2010</xref>). TFIIIC is an architectural protein that can affect the three-dimensional chromatin organisation at its binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Van Bortle and Corces, 2013</xref>). Functionally, TFIIIC can act as insulator that blocks the spread of chromatin states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Raab et al., 2012</xref>), affect cohesin loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Büchel et al., 2017</xref>), and bind at the borders of <underline>t</underline>opologically <underline>a</underline>ssociating <underline>d</underline>omains (TADs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Van Bortle et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, TFIIIC compartmentalises RNAPII promoters and gene expression. Specifically, the effects of TFIIIC on the expression of E2F-dependent and neuronal genes correlate with its effects on the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. In the case of neuronal genes, TFIIIC prevents the localisation of activity-dependent genes to sites of active transcription before stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crepaldi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferrari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Policarpi et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, TFIIIC together with the <underline>a</underline>ctivity-<underline>d</underline>ependent <underline>n</underline>euro<underline>p</underline>rotector homeobox protein controls the three-dimensional architecture of cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferrari et al., 2020</xref>). Our previous experiments had suggested that TFIIIC may have a role in MYCN-dependent control of RNAPII function and we here show that MYCN and TFIIIC together have an unexpected censoring function that excludes non-functional RNAPII from hubs of active promoters.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TFIIIC interacts directly with the amino-terminus of MYCN</title><p>TFIIIC is present in MYCN immunoprecipitates and the amino-terminal region of recombinant MYCN binds to TFIIIC in pull-down experiments performed with cell lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Büchel et al., 2017</xref>). To test whether MYCN and TFIIIC interact directly, we expressed the six subunits of TFIIIC together with a FLAG-tagged MYCN construct comprising amino acids 2–137 using a recombinant baculovirus to infect insect cells. Performing pull-down experiments with cell lysates and immobilised FLAG-tagged MYCN, we recovered all six subunits of the TFIIIC complex in the eluate along with the FLAG-tagged MYCN construct, demonstrating that TFIIIC can bind to the amino-terminal region of MYCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). TFIIIC is composed of two subcomplexes, designated TauA (τA) and TauB (τB), each comprising three of the six subunits. We first attempted co-expression of FLAG-MYCN with individual subcomplexes, but the τB complex was too unstable to be isolated, and so we focused on the stable τA complex. To test whether MYCN binds directly to τA, we purified MYCN and the τA complex separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) and then mixed the purified preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). In gel filtration experiments, the isolated MYCN protein eluted with a molecular weight of around 50 kDa, whereas a fraction of MYCN eluted with a much larger molecular weight together with the τA complex when both were mixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Native mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tamara et al., 2022</xref>) showed the molecular weight of this complex to be 204.7 kDa, very close to the sum of the molecular weights of a 1:1:1:1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). We concluded that the MYCN amino-terminal region and the τA subcomplex of TFIIIC form a stable complex with each other in solution.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TFIIIC directly interacts with MYCN.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblots showing levels of FLAG-tagged MYCN (amino acids [aa] 2–137) and the six subunits of the TFIIIC complex after a pull-down assay using anti-FLAG affinity columns.

To test whether TFIIIC is required for the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells, we individually depleted three of its subunits, TFIIIC2, TFIIIC3, and TFIIIC5, by stable expression of doxycycline (Dox)-inducible shRNAs. Controls confirmed that each shRNA efficiently depleted its target protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To test both for a general requirement of each subunit in neuroblastoma cell proliferation and for MYCN-specific effects, we expressed each shRNA in SH-EP-MYCN-ER cell. SH-EP cells express endogenous MYC and are engineered to stably express an MYCN-ER chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herold et al., 2019</xref>). Activation of the MYCN-ER by addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) suppresses the expression of endogenous MYC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), in effect causing a switch from MYC to MYCN expression. Under control conditions, depletion of TFIIIC2 or TFIIIC3 attenuated proliferation, whereas depletion of the small TFIIIC5 subunit had little effect. Addition of 4-OHT had little effect by itself, but greatly enhanced the inhibitory effect of depletion of each subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that TFIIIC has both general and MYCN-specific roles in neuroblastoma cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TFIIIC limits promoter binding of non-phosphorylated RNAPII in MYCN-expressing cells</title><p>The proximity of TFIIIC binding sites to MYCN binding sites at many promoters transcribed by RNAPII prompted us to explore the role of TFIIIC in MYCN-driven transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Büchel et al., 2017</xref>). Using an antibody that detects total RNAPII, we had previously shown that activation of MYCN in SH-EP-MYCN-ER cells impacts RNAPII in two ways: First, MYCN promotes pause release and MYCN’s effect on elongation correlates with its effects on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herold et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rahl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Walz et al., 2014</xref>). At the same time, activation of MYCN uniformly reduces RNAPII occupancy at all active promoters; this correlates with a reduced accumulation of promoter-proximal R-loops, suggesting that MYCN limits the accumulation of RNAPII at promoters that is impaired in productive elongation and/or splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herold et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Previous experiments using antibodies directed against total RNAPII had yielded results that varied among different antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Büchel et al., 2017</xref> and RV, unpublished). To directly compare the effects of MYCN and TFIIIC on promoter-bound RNAPII with those on elongating RNAPII in a side-by-side manner, we conducted parallel ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses using antibodies that specifically recognise non-phosphorylated and Ser2-phosphorylated (pSer2) RNAPII, respectively. Visual inspection of multiple individual genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and global analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) showed that activation of MYCN caused a global decrease in promoter association of non-phosphorylated RNAPII. A control ChIP-seq experiment established that addition of 4-OHT had no such effect in SH-EP cells that do not express an MYCN-ER chimera, demonstrating that the reduction is due to activation of MYCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). At the same time, MYCN promoted an increase in transcription elongation as best documented by pSer2-RNAPII occupancy at the transcription end site (TES) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). This increase was most pronounced on MYCN-activated genes. Comparison with RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data showed that it correlated closely with MYCN-dependent changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Depletion of TFIIIC5 abrogated the MYCN-dependent decrease in chromatin association of non-phosphorylated RNAPII but had no effect on MYCN-dependent changes in transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). In many experimental systems, MYC and MYCN effects on elongation parallel closely with the corresponding changes in gene expression. Consistent with these observations, RNA-seq showed that neither depletion of TFIIIC3 nor of TFIIIC5 had significant effects on either basal gene expression or MYCN-dependent changes in steady-state mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Finally, we aimed to understand whether the localisation of TFIIIC and MYCN at promoters is linked to the dynamics of RNAPII at promoters and performed ChIP-seq of TFIIIC5 in SH-EP-MYCN-ER cells in the presence of 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (DRB), which stabilises paused RNAPII and prevents pause release of RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mancebo et al., 1997</xref>). Inspection of individual genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and average density plots of all active promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) showed that activation of MYCN globally enhanced TFIIIC5 association with regions surrounding active transcription start sites, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Büchel et al., 2017</xref>). Addition of DRB increased TFIIIC5 association with active promoters and the combination of MYCN activation and DRB had a strong additive effect, arguing that MYCN preferentially recruits TFIIIC5 to promoters with paused RNAPII.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>MYCN and TFIIIC antagonise accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (RNAPII).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Browser tracks for non-phosphorylated RNAPII (top) and RNAPII pSer2 (bottom) ChIP-Rx at the indicated gene loci.

Remarkably, our analysis revealed that 1277 out of the 4591 MYCN anchors (28%) were positioned on RNAPII promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, 864 out of the 4591 MYCN interactions (19%) exhibited connections between promoters and either exonic or intronic sequences, consistent with previous observations showing that MYCN binding sites are often located within transcribed regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Büchel et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, MYCN interactions were observed between promoters and SINE repetitive elements (647/4591; 14%) including interactions with tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These connections are likely shared with TFIIIC (see below). We also observed interactions between promoters or gene bodies and enhancers, accounting for 453 out of the 4591 interactions (10%).</p><p>We used the RNAPII and published MYCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herold et al., 2019</xref>) ChIP-seq data as well as sequencing datasets of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Büchel et al., 2017</xref>) and nascent (4sU-labelled) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Papadopoulos et al., 2022</xref>) RNA to identify the specific properties of promoters within three-dimensional MYCN interactions. This showed that significantly more MYCN and RNAPII bound to promoters that participated in such interactions and that these promoters were more active than MYCN-bound promoters without such interactions, although the latter difference was small <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We next used the binary interactions as a starting point to reconstruct interaction networks. This showed that MYCN participated in three-dimensional promoter hubs of different sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), with the largest connecting up to 34 promoters and 10 enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This number of promoters is consistent with published estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Palacio and Taatjes, 2022</xref>). Functional annotation of the promoters that are contained in these large hubs showed that they are highly enriched in genes encoding ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis genes transcribed by RNAPII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

In these experiments, thousands of pairs of TFIIIC binding sites yielded a robust signal, demonstrating that they are in close spatial proximity with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Specifically, these analyses identified a total of 3499 binary non-contiguous interactions for TFIIIC. Comparison to RNAPII ChIP-seq data showed that 31% of these interactions connected a promoter or the gene body of an RNAPII-transcribed gene to a SINE repetitive element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, 1107 out of 4591 MYCN interactions shared one (1075) or both (32) anchors with TFIIIC-containing interactions arguing that both proteins participate in common hubs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This is consistent with our previous data, which showed that many promoters contain a TFIIIC-bound site close to an MYCN-bound E-box element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Büchel et al., 2017</xref>). A significant percentage of the interactions that are shared between MYCN and TFIIIC contained an E-box in one anchor and A- or B-boxes, which are bound by TFIIIC, in the other anchor sequence, arguing that MYCN and TFIIIC can participate in the same interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Most interactions that are shared by MYCN and TFIIIC connected promoters to other promoters, to gene bodies or to SINE elements. Conversely, TFIIIC5 anchors without overlapping MYCN loops (‘TFIIIC5 only’) did not show an enrichment for promoter interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We concluded that both MYCN and TFIIIC5 are present in promoter hubs.

We have previously shown that MYCN can recruit the nuclear exosome to its target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Papadopoulos et al., 2022</xref>). MYCN can also recruit BRCA1, which in turn stimulates binding of the mRNA decapping enzyme DCP1 that initiates RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herold et al., 2019</xref>). No significant effects were observed in the proximity between RNAPII with the XRN2 exonuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, CUT&amp;RUN experiments using antibodies-directed EXOSC5, a core structural subunit of the exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kilchert et al., 2016</xref>), showed that depletion of TFIIIC5 strongly decreased the association of EXOSC5 with regions around the TSS, both in control and in MYCN-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To test whether MYCN-dependent recruitment of BRCA1 depends on TFIIIC, we performed ChIP experiments at multiple MYCN-bound promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Consistent with our previous observations, only low amount of BRCA1 were found at core promoter in SH-EP cells and that induction of MYCN recruited BRCA1 to all tested promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herold et al., 2019</xref>). Depletion of TFIIIC5 had variable effects on the presence of BRCA1 by itself, but abrogated BRCA1 recruitment by MYCN at all promoters tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>), demonstrating that TFIIIC5 is required for MYCN-dependent recruitment of BRCA1 to multiple target sites. Collectively, the data show that TFIIIC is required for the association of the nuclear exosome and of BRCA1 with active promoters and that these effects are enhanced in cells expressing MYCN, arguing that they can account for the enhanced dependence of MYCN-expressing cells on TFIIIC.

Most MYC/N binding sites on chromatin do not appear to be functional with respect to gene expression and transcriptional elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kress et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sabò et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Walz et al., 2014</xref>). This raises the possibility that such binding sites are indeed non-functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pellanda et al., 2021</xref>). Alternatively, MYCN has functions in transcription that go beyond gene regulation. In support of the later model, we and others have uncovered critical roles of MYC and MYCN in maintaining the genomic stability of tumour cells, e.g., by coordinating transcription with DNA replication and by enabling promoter-proximal double-strand break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baluapuri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Papadopoulos et al., 2023</xref>). This raises the question of which direct interaction partners of MYC and MYCN mediate these effects and what the underlying mechanisms are. Here, we show that TFIIIC binds directly to the amino-terminus of MYCN, and that a MYCN/TFIIIC complex globally limits the accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNAPII at promoters.</p><p>Several mechanisms can account for these observations: First, the amino-terminus of MYC proteins is a transcription-activating domain that can interact with cyclin T1 and CDK8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eberhardy and Farnham, 2002</xref>) and potentially other co-activators, hence TFIIIC may block MYCN interaction with co-activators that recruit RNAPII to promoters. Since MYCN/TFIIIC also restricts RNAPII accumulation at promoters that are not activated by MYCN, this is unlikely to be the sole mode of action. Second, MYCN and TFIIIC binding sites are often downstream of the transcription start sites and the three-dimensional structures formed by MYCN and TFIIIC may sterically restrict elongation and favour termination of non-phosphorylated RNAPII. Third, TFIIIC is an architectural protein complex and re-localisation of promoters may be central to the mechanism of MYCN/TFIIIC action. Active promoters coalesce at a discrete number of sites in the eucaryotic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lim and Levine, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Palacio and Taatjes, 2022</xref>). Many of the factors involved in basal transcription undergo liquid-liquid phase separation, arguing that transcription initiation takes place in condensate-like structures established by transcriptional regulatory domains and by RNAPII itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hnisz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lewis et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lu et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with their ubiquitous role in transcription, MYC proteins form condensates by themselves and enter condensates formed by the RNAPII-associated mediator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boija et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Solvie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). As described in the Introduction, TFIIIC can restrict the localisation of genes to sites of active transcription. We show here that MYCN/TFIIIC complexes, in contrast to MYCN, are not part of hubs of active promoters, leading us to propose that TFIIIC antagonises MYCN participation in promoter hubs and limits the accumulation of paused or stalled RNAPII at promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Since TFIIIC competes with the Aurora-A kinase for binding of MYCN and Aurora-A in turn promotes elongation by RNAPII, we propose that the competition between both complexes enables transcriptional elongation on promoters that are activated by MYCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Büchel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roeschert et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>As described above, depletion of TFIIIC has no discernible role in elongation and changes in polyA+ mRNA levels, raising the question of what the function of the association might be. The fate of nascent RNA is controlled by several interrelated processes leading to splicing and polyadenylation of the full-length transcript on the one hand, and mis-splicing, premature termination and RNA degradation on the other and MYCN has been implicated in both processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Noe Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Papadopoulos et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schmid and Jensen, 2019</xref>). Depletion of TFIIIC strongly decreased the association of the nuclear exosome, an RNA exonuclease complex that degrades multiple forms of aberrant nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schmid and Jensen, 2019</xref>), and of BRCA1, which in turn recruits the mRNA decapping enzyme DCP1 at promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herold et al., 2019</xref>). The association of both the exosome and BRCA1 with promoters were enhanced in MYCN-expressing cells, arguing that they are likely to reflect –– at least in part – the activity of the TFIIIC/MYCN complex. At the same time, TFIIIC3 depletion caused splicing errors, which occurred predominantly in downstream exons and were independent of MYCN, arguing that the effect on splicing may reflect an activity of TFIIIC that is independent of its function at promoters. We propose that the TFIIIC/MYCN complex formation exerts a censoring and quality control function for RNAPII at promoters that have not received a full complement of activating signals and hypothesise that this contributes to focus the transcription machinery and metabolic resources on the genes that drive the growth of MYCN-driven tumours.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Materials used in the study (genetically modified strains, cell lines, reagents, and software) are summarised in the Key resources table in the appendix.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Cell line derived from human neuroblastoma (SH-EP; CVCL_RR78) was verified by STR profiling and grown in RPMI-1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Libraries were subjected to cluster generation and base calling for 150 cycles paired end on Illumina NextSeq 500 platform.</p><p>spLHiChIP and pLHiChIP were based on pLHi-C, ChIP-Rx, and the original HiChIP protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mumbach et al., 2016</xref>). spLHiChIP and pLHiChIP benefit from the same modules of pLHi-C fixation, digestion, ligation, chromatin fragmentation, and library preparation. The difference consists in the ChIP module, which follows the exact same steps from IP of target protein to de-crosslinked overnight stated in the ChIP workflow. The ChIP module allocated between the chromatin fragmentation and library preparation in pLHi-C workflow defines the spLHiChIP and pLHiChIP workflows. spLHiChIP differs from pLHiChIP by adding murine NHO2A cells as an exogenous control (spike-in) at a 1:20 cell ratio during nuclei isolation. This allows normalisation by murine paired end valid tags in a similar fashion as murine reads for ChIP-Rx. 10×10<sup>6</sup> cells per condition were fixed with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) for 10 min at RT. Reaction was stopped by adding 125 mM glycine for 15 min at RT. Cells were harvested with ice-cold PBS supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). Nuclei isolation was performed by adding buffer I (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 1× protease inhibitors; Sigma-Aldrich) coupled with Douncer homogenisation. The resulting solution was centrifuged (2500 × <italic>g</italic>, 5 min, 4°C), the nuclei pellet was washed with 1× NEBuffer 3.1 (NEB) and incubated in buffer IIa (0.2% SDS, 1× NEBuffer 3.1; NEB) for 10 min at 50°C. Buffer IIb (2% Triton X-100, 1.5× NEBuffer 3.1, 1× protease inhibitors;) was added to a final volume of 943 µl. Sample was incubated for 15 min at 37°C. 850 U DpnII (NEB) and 35 µl rSAP (NEB) were added and sample was incubated for at least 8 hr at 37°C. Modified DNA oligos, 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GATCCCCAAATCT</named-content>-3’ and 5’-GATCAGAT[BtndT]TGGG-3’ with 5’ end phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), were annealed (81 µl of each Oligo 100 µM, 1× T4 ligase buffer; NEB) at 98°C for 5 min, followed by 20 min at RT. After digestion, sample was washed with 1× T4 ligase buffer (NEB) (2500 × <italic>g</italic>, 5 min, 4°C). Nuclei pellet was resuspended in buffer IIIa (0.3% SDS, 1× T4 ligase buffer) and incubated for 15 min at 60°C. Buffer IIIb (3% Triton X-100, 1× T4 ligase buffer, 1× protease inhibitors; NEB, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final volume of 1 ml and sample was incubated for 15 min at 37°C. The nuclei pellet was resuspended in buffer IV (160 µl annealed oligos, 1.2× T4 ligase buffer, 6000 U T4 ligase, 1× protease inhibitors; NEB) to a final volume of 800 µl after washing it with 1× T4 ligase buffer (NEB) (2500 × <italic>g</italic>, 5 min, 4°C). Sample was incubated overnight at 16°C. Nuclei pellet was isolated by centrifugation (2500 × <italic>g</italic>, 5 min, 4°C) and mixed with buffer V (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1× protease inhibitors). Chromatin fragmentation was performed using the Covaris Focused Ultrasonicator M220 for 30 min/ml lysate. For each IP reaction, 100 μl Dynabeads Protein A and Protein G (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were pre-incubated overnight with rotation in the presence of 5 mg/ml BSA and 10 μg antibody (MYCN [B8.4.B]: sc-53993, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_831602">AB_831602</ext-link>; TFIIIC5: A301-242A, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_890669">AB_890669</ext-link>). Chromatin was added to the beads, and IP was performed for a minimum of 6 hr at 4°C with rotation. Beads were washed three times each with washing buffer I (20 mM Tris pH 8.1, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), washing buffer II (20 mM Tris pH 8.1, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), washing buffer III (10 mM Tris pH 8.1, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, including a 5 min incubation with rotation) and TE buffer. Chromatin was eluted twice by incubating with 200 µl elution buffer (100 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1% SDS in TE) for 15 min with rotation. Input samples and eluted samples were de-crosslinked overnight. Protein and RNA were digested with proteinase K and RNase A, respectively. DNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by an ethanol precipitation. DNA library preparation was done using the NEBnext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Quality of the library was assessed on the Fragment Analyzer (Agilent) using the NGS Fragment High Sensitivity Analysis Kit (1–6000 bp; Agilent). Finally, libraries were subjected to cluster generation and base calling on Illumina NextSeq 500 platform.</p><p>RNA-seq was performed by extracting RNA with RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. On-column DNase I digestion was performed followed by mRNA isolation with the NEBNext Poly (A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Kit (NEB). Library preparation was done with the Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep for Illumina following the manufacturer’s manual. Libraries were size selected using SPRIselect Beads (Beckman Coulter) after amplification with nine PCR cycles. Library quantification and size determination was performed with the Fragment Analyzer (Agilent) using the NGS Fragment High Sensitivity Analysis Kit (1–6000 bp; Agilent). Libraries were subjected to cluster generation and base calling for 100 cycles paired end on Illumina NextSeq 2000 platform.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Bioinformatics analysis and statistics</title><p>All libraries were subjected to NextSeq 500 or NextSeq 2000 (Illumina) sequencing following the manufacturer’s guidelines. Base call data was converted and demultiplex to FASTQ files by bcl2fastq Conversion Software v1.1.0 (Illumina). Quality control of each dataset was done using FastQC tool.</p><p>ChIP-seq and CUT&amp;RUN sequencing reads were aligned to human (hg19/GRCh37 assembly) using Bowtie2 v2.3.5.1. with default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). Normalisation by aligned read number was performed on the input and on all correspondent IP samples.</p><p>For each sample, the number of spike-in normalised reads was calculated by dividing the number of reads mapping exclusively to hg19 by the number of reads mapping exclusively to mm10 and multiplying this number with the smallest number of reads mapping to mm10 of all samples. After normalisation, files were converted to bedGraph with ‘bedtools genomecov’ v2.26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). These files were used to plot genome browser track examples via the package plotgardener v1.012 in R v4.1.1.</p><p>MACS2 v2.1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) was used for peak calling with the following ChIP-seq datasets and parameters, with inputs serving as control: MYCN (GSM3044606, GSM3044608; dup = 5, q=1 × 10<sup>–3</sup>), TFIIIC5 in SH-EP-MYCN-ER (this work; dup = 5, q=10<sup>–3</sup>), and RAD21 (this work; dup = 5, p=10<sup>–2</sup>). H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac peaks were called with SICER v1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), using input as control and the parameters: redundancy threshold = 1, window size = 200 bp, fragment size = 75 bp, effective genome fraction = 0.74, gap size = 600, FDR = 0.001. Peak calling results were refined and confirmed by visual inspection.</p><p>RNA-seq reads were aligned to human (hg19/GRCh37 assembly) using STAR aligner v2.7.9a with the default parameters and gene quantification (--quantMode GeneCounts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). The output table with the gene counts was loaded into R v4.1.1. and processed with DESeq2 package accordingly to their manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Genes with or more than 15 counts in at least three samples or more were selected, and all samples were normalised by size factors. The fold average for three independent biological replicates was calculated on treatment to control as shown in the correspondent figure and legend. The result was averaged in 100 or 150 bins for a total of 14,085 genes and displayed as dot plot. Alternative splicing events were identified using rMATS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shen et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>pLHi-C, pLHiChIP, and spLHiChIP sequencing reads were processed in two steps. In the first step they were all processed in the same way, HiC-Pro v 2.11.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Servant et al., 2015</xref>) trims the reads for the linker sequence, aligns it to hg19, and filters it by DpnII restriction fragments of the same genome assembly. The default parameters were used for the alignment steps, except for the length of the seed (-L) parameter that was set to 25 for the global options and 15 for the local one, and mismatch (-N) that was set to 1. Read trimming was performed by inserting combinations of the linker sequence (<named-content content-type="sequence">GATCAGATTTGGGGATC</named-content>, <named-content content-type="sequence">GATCCCCAAATCTGATC</named-content>) in the ligation site parameter. Reads considered as duplicates were accepted and multi-mapped reads were only removed for pLHiChIP and spLHiChIP. Quality control for all steps until all valid pairs (<underline>p</underline>aired <underline>e</underline>nd <underline>t</underline>ags [PETs]) output was also performed through HiC-Pro. We compared HiC-Pro’s standard quality controls example (IMR90 replicate 1 sample; GSM862724), according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Servant et al., 2015</xref>, to the base of our methods variation, pLHi-C.</p><p>In the second step, spLHiChIP samples undergo the same workflow described for the first step replacing hg19 for mm10 assembly. PETs from mm10 were removed from hg19 PETs and a spike-in normalisation was applied to hg19 PETs in the same way explained for ChIP-Rx hg19 aligned reads. DNA loop calling was performed on spLHiChIP and pLHiChIP PETs using hichipper v0.7.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lareau and Aryee, 2018</xref>). ChIP-seq peak calling sites were used as pre-determined peaks. All the default parameters with a loop maximum distance (--max-dist) of 5,000,000 were used for all proteins. We compared the DNA loops calling quality control for Oct4 HiChIP (GSM2238510) from the original method description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mumbach et al., 2016</xref>) to our method variation for MYCN and TFIIIC5. An extra quality control to show enrichment and specificity was performed by plotting MYCN pLHiChIP, its input pLHi-C, and its ChIP-seq with pLHiChIP and pLHi-C normalised to the same number of PETs. DNA loops calling results were refined and confirmed by visual inspection. The mango output files from the loop calling were then loaded in R, filtered by a q-value equal or smaller than 0.01, and used in all further plots and analyses. All examples showing DNA loops, ChIP-seq, and annotation tracks in different genomic regions/locus were plotted using plotgardener package in R environment.</p><p>The different genome functional annotations were retrieved from UCSC table browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Karolchik et al., 2004</xref>). Promoters, gene bodies, and TES come from Reference Sequence (RefSeq) collection of genes for hg19 assembly and were adapted via R language. For RNAPII targets, promoters were defined as TSS ± 0.5 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Büchel et al., 2017</xref>), gene bodies as the sum of exons and introns, TES as TES ± 0.3 kb. Enhancers were defined as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Walz et al., 2014</xref>: H3K3me1 and H3K27ac overlapping sites without H3K4me3. Overlapping and discontinuous regions were obtained by using peak calling outputs as inputs in intersectBed (BEDTools) with standard parameters.</p><p>Overlapping between different pLHiChIP was calculated by ‘bedtools pairtopair’ function (BEDTools) using the options to prevent self-hits and ignore strands. The type of overlap was set to report when both anchors of the different pLHiChIP overlap (-type either). This provided outputs of loops with and without overlapping that could be used for other analyses. For discrimination between the different types of overlaps, the type both was removed from the type either and the two types were then reported. Overlaps were called joint sites and adapted as Venn diagrams by centring the coordinates and numbers to MYCN anchors or MYCN-TFIIIC5 anchors. TADs overlap corresponds to common sites in at least eight out of nine cell lines reported in (GSE35156) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The GenomicInteractions v1.28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harmston et al., 2015</xref>) package in R language was used to calculate and report the overlaps between the different pLHiChIP anchors and their functional annotations. Overlaps on different functional annotations were reported in the following order of priority: enhancer, promoter, TES, gene body, tRNA, rRNA, miRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, SINE, LINE, LTR, and satellite. The bar graphs reporting the functional annotation of each anchor are proportional to the total number of loops of each pLHiChIP, numbers were rounded and plotted by GenomicInteractions and ggplot2 v3.3.5 packages in R environment.</p><p>Motif analysis was performed by using the FIMO algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grant et al., 2011</xref>) of the MEME Suite software toolkit v5.3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>). The function getfasta (BEDTools) extracted the hg19 FASTA sequence from each pLHiChIP anchor to be used independently as input for motif search. The background model was generated by the function fasta-get-markov (MEME Suite) using hg19 FASTA with standard parameters. Pre-defined motifs for MYCN (E-box) (MA0104.4: JASPAR 2018 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sandelin et al., 2004</xref>), B-box, and A-box were scanned using the options ‘<monospace>--thresh</monospace> 1.0 <monospace>--text</monospace>’ with the default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pavesi et al., 1994</xref>). Resulting hits were then filtered by p-value ≤ 1 × 10<sup>–4</sup>. In R environment, duplicated hits of the same motif in the same anchor were filtered by the one with the lowest p-value. Different motifs in the same anchor window were reported according to the decreasing priority: E-box, B-box, and A-box. The overlap between anchors and motifs was computed by GenomicInteractions package and the corresponding heatmap was plotted in R.</p><p>To visualise the influence of the MYCN interaction on gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), MYCN-bound genes (as defined by MACS2 on MYCN ChIP-seq data, above) were subdivided into genes that are bound by MYCN without loops (‘no MYCN loops’) and genes bound by MYCN forming loops (above, ‘MYCN loops’). For both classes, RNA-seq reads between TSS and TSS+2 kb were counted using ‘bedtools intersect’ on spike-normalised ChIP-seq data for RNAPII (A10), MYCN (GSM3044606), TFIIIC5; processed transcript data were obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Büchel et al., 2017</xref> (RNA-seq, GSE111905; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Büchel et al., 2017</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Papadopoulos et al., 2022</xref> (4sU-sequencing, GSE164569; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Papadopoulos et al., 2022</xref>), respectively. Plots were generated with ‘boxplot’ and statistical significance calculated using Student’s t-test (unpaired, two-sided, unequal variance), both in R v3.6.3.</p><p>Over-representation analysis for Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) were calculated by clusterProfiler package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wu et al., 2021</xref>) in R environment. Different functional classes of loops were retrieved from the overlaps and discontinuous loops by the GenomicInteractions package. Gene names were converted to HGNC symbol name using AnnotationDbi package and sorted by the number of PETs. Duplicated gene names were merged and the median of their number of PETs was used. A hypergeometric test was calculated on the sorted list for MSigDB collections H (hallmark gene sets) or C5 (ontology gene sets) using a 0.05 q-value threshold.</p><p>MYCN spLHiChIP-treated sample was normalised by its control counterpart in each biological replicate before plotted as graph bar in R environment. The ratio of TFIIIC5 binding (ChIP-Rx) per number of interaction (spLHiChIP) was calculated in R environment v4.1.1. The number of ChIP-Rx reads was calculated to TSS ± 2 kb for all genes using bedtools intersect (BEDtools) with default parameters. The number of spLHiChIP interactions was calculated for the same region. The ratio was calculated on reads to number of interactions per each sample and plotted as bar graph.</p><p>Networks were reconstituted by using the R package igraph v1.2.11 and Cytoscape v3.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brockmann et al., 2013</xref>). The different classes of loops were retrieved via the GenomicInteractions package and converted to the simple interaction file format and to a node table. These files were used in Cytoscape for visualisation, using the Edge-weighted Spring-Embedded Layout based on the number of PETs for each loop. The resulting MYCN network reports the nodes as functional annotations, as explained before. In parallel, the sif file was used as input for the igraph package. This package was used to define the membership of each anchor to the different clusters and to quantify the number of nodes per cluster. The statistical significance comparing the number of nodes per cluster between two groups were calculated via Wilcoxon rank sum test.</p><p>Density plots for the different regions were performed using ngs.plot v2.41.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shen et al., 2014b</xref>). Default parameters were used for samples normalised by reads number. For spike-in normalised samples, we used a custom variation of ngs.plot that allows the spike-in normalisation by skipping the internal normalisation step. All densities plots and metaplots were based on gene expression for SH-EP-MYCN-ER cells ± MYCN induction (4-OHT treatment) – evaluated by RNA-seq (GSE111905; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herold et al., 2019</xref>). Based on this, all expressed gene sets consist of 14,704 genes, down- and up-regulated gene sets are represented by 613 and 921 genes, respectively. MYCN down- and up-regulated genes are defined by negative and positive fold change upon ±4-OHT treatment of genes with q-values less than 0.05 and expression filter by counts per million. In R v4.1.1, Wilcoxon rank sum test (unpaired, two-sided) was used to compare the different conditions on the plotted region per ChIP.</p><p>PLA’s p-values were calculated by comparing the signal of the pool of the cells in all replicates using Wilcoxon rank sum test (unpaired, two-sided) in R v4.1.1.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>founder and shareholder of Tucana Biosciences</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-94407-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="scode1"><label>Source code 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of ChIP sequencing data.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-94407-code1-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="scode2"><label>Source code 2.</label><caption><title>Analysis of HiC and HiChIP data.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-94407-code2-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The following published datasets were used: MYCN ChIP-seq and RNA-seq: GSE111905; 4sU-seq: GSE164569.

They confirm that TFIIIC co-purifies with MYCN, dependent on its amino terminus, as shown in previous work. The authors also find that TFIIIC and MYCN are both found in promoter hubs and suggest that TFIIIC inhibits MYCN association with these hubs.

This is because, while the authors refer to the earlier paper frequently, they do not directly discuss the re-interpretation of the elongation conclusion of the earlier paper. It seems likely that a reader of the present paper will find this issue confusing when trying to reconcile the results of the two papers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94407.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This manuscript reports several interesting observations that invite follow-up. The notion that hubs, and perhaps condensates that may (or may not embrace them) are functionally and physiologically important is an open issue at this time. The authors note that TFIIIC helps to prune extraneous connections from hubs, but do not comment that the connections that are maintained are also reinforced. At the same time only modest changes in gene expression associated with expanded or decreased connections and changes in bound proteins. One interesting possibility might be that standard methods for assessing expression miss changes global or background transcription. It seems that the TFIIIC-MYCN-ER connection has features that would help to suppress such background. The results invite a more global consideration of TFIIIC than as primarily RNAPIII/small RNA transcription factor and of MYCN as an E-box dependent transcription factor. The results use sate of the art methods to develop interesting new ideas that have the potential to instruct further studies that may reveal new mechanisms of action for TFIIIC and MYCN.</p><p>The work is however subject to a couple of caveats. First, the authors should be more cautious when drawing firm conclusions about the dynamics and kinetics of transcription from the static snapshots obtained from most genomic methods. For example, please take a look at Figure 1F of &quot;Transcription elongation defects link oncogenicSF3B1 mutations to targetable alterations in chromatin landscape&quot; by Buddu et al, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2024.02.032">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2024.02.032</ext-link>. Here, an increase in RNAPSer2P is seen in gene bodies and a bit at the TES- superficially inviting the conclusion that expression is increased (a similar erroneous conclusion has been claimed in other genomic studies), but the increase is in fact, not due to increased transcription, rather to impaired elongation-this conclusion required performing TT-Seq which allowed inferences to be made about elongation rates. Acknowledging this qualification would help advise the reader.</p><p>The authors also need to discuss directly what differences between the MYC predominant SH-EP cells and the MYCN-predominant SH-EP-MYCNER+tamoxifen are qualitative versus quantitative. MYCNER indeed associates much more with chromatin than did MYC, but there seems to be a lot more MYCER than there was MYC prior to the addition of tamoxifen. The true control for this would be to prepare SH-EP-MYCER cells expressed from the same promoter as was MYCNER. Some discussion of qualitative versus quantitative differences should be acknowledged.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Use of a variety of methods to assess the genomic response to increased MYCN in the presence or absence of TFIIIC. Clearly establishes in vitro and in vivo the TFIIIC-MYCN complex</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Dynamic inferences are made without kinetic experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94407.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Vidal et al. investigated how TFIIIC may mediate MYCN effects on transcription. The work builds upon previous reports from the same group where they describe MYCN interactors in neuroblastoma cells (Buchel et al, 2017), which include TFIIIC, and their different roles in MYCN-dependent control of RNA polymerase II function (Herold et al, 2019) (Roeschert et al, 2021) (Papadopoulus et al, 2022). Using baculovirus expression systems, they confirm that MYCN-TFIIIC interaction is direct, and likely relevant for neuroblastoma cell proliferation. However, transcriptomics analyses led them to conclude that TFIIC is largely dispensable for MYCN-dependent gene expression. Instead, they propose that TFIIC limits MYCN-mediated promoter-promoter 3D chromatin contacts, which would in turn facilitate the recruitment of the nascent RNA degradation machinery and restrict the accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II at promoters. How this mechanism may impact on MYCN-driven neuroblastoma cell biology remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study presents a nice variety of genomic datasets addressing the specific role of TFIIIC in MYCN-dependent functions. In particular, the technically challenging HiChIP sequencing experiments performed under various conditions provide very useful information about the interplay between MYCN and TFIIIC in the regulation of 3D chromatin contacts. The authors show that MYCN and TFIIIC participate both in unique and overlapping long-range chromatin contacts and that the expression of each of these proteins limits the function of the other. Together, their results suggest a dynamic and interconnected relationship between MYCN and TFIIIC in regulating 3D chromatin contacts.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Mechanistic questions regarding the specific role of TFIIIC in regulating MYCN function remain unsolved. Why is it important to restrict MYCN association to promoter hubs? Do the authors find any TFIIIC-dependent phenotype that is restricted or particularly enhanced at these locations? Both the effects on the accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNA pol II and the recruitment of the nascent RNA degradation machinery seem to be global.</p><p>(2) Two specific points regarding RNA pol II ChIPseq results remain unclear:</p><p>-It is unfortunate that although both RNAPII (N20) and RNAPII (A10) antibodies were raised against the N-teminal domain, they give different results according to the authors. Caution should be taken, as it may imply that some previous results could be explained by epitope masking.</p><p>-I am sorry if I missed something crucial, but to my understanding, the disparities regarding the ChIPseq results obtained using the 8WG16 antibody are not fully resolved. In Figure S7C from their previous publication (Buchel et al, 2017) the authors concluded that &quot;Intriguingly, ChIP sequencing showed that activation of N-MYC had no significant effect on chromatin association of hypo-phosphorylated Pol II&quot;. Is this not a similar experiment, using the same antibody and experimental conditions as in Figure 2 from the current manuscript? They now conclude that &quot;activation of MYCN caused a global decrease in promoter association of non-phosphorylated RNAPII&quot;.</p><p>(3) Conducting ChIP-qPCR experiments for all nascent RNA degradation factors to be compared would have enabled a more direct and comprehensive comparison.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id

the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) In Figure 1, the authors show that TF3C binds to the amino terminus of MYCN (Myc box I region), as shown previously. The data in Figure 1 B-D support, but do not rigorously confirm a 'direct' interaction because it has not been ruled out that accessory proteins mediating the association may be present in the mixture.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1B-D we have purified MYCN and the TFIIIC/TauA complex separately and then mixed the purified preparations, demonstrating that the purified proteins interact. We have additionally performed mass spectrometry, which shows that the TauA/MYCN complex is formed without further accessory proteins, as the molecular weight would be higher. Based on the Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gels, there is no plausible contaminating band in the purified complex that could be mediating the interaction between MYCN and TauA, either in the purified complex (Figure 1C), or in the purified protein used to reconstitute the complex (Figure S1A &amp; S1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors indicate in Figure 2 that TF3C has essentially no effect on MYCNdependent gene expression and/or transcription elongation. Yet a previous study (PMID: 29262328) associated with several of the same authors concluded that TF3C positively affects transcription elongation. The authors make no attempt to reconcile these disparate results and need to clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the data in this manuscript do not support the role on transcription elongation.

From this data, however, the reader can't tell how much of the phospho-Ser2- pol2 is centered on the TSS. The authors should include overall plots over TSS and TES, and also perhaps the gene-body to allow a better comparison for TSS and TES plotted for both antibodies over the collected gene sets.</p></disp-quote><p>We focused on the TSS for unphosphorylated RNAPII and the TES for pSer2-RNAPII, as these are the regions with specific enrichment of the respective antibodies. As requested for comparison, we now include metagenes showing TSS, gene-body, and TES for both antibodies as new Figure S2A and B. Additionally, we included density plots for unphosphorylated RNAPII at the TES as well as for pSer2-RNAPII at the TSS as a Figure for the Reviewers (Figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors see more TF3C at promoters in cells with MYCN (Figure 2F). What are the levels of TF3C in the absence and presence of MYCN?</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in the immunoblot in Figure S1E, TF3C5 levels do not change upon induction of MYCN. We therefore think that MYCN helps to recruit TFIIIC5 to RNAPII promoter sites. This is also in accordance to what we previously reported 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The finding that TF3C is increased at TSS (Figure 2F) doesn't necessarily indicate that (1) MYCN is recruiting TF3C there, and (2) that this is due to the phosphorylation status of pol2. It could mean many other things. The logic of conflating these 3 points based on the data shown is questionable.</p></disp-quote><p>We showed previously that knock-down of MYCN affects TFIIIC5 binding, showing that MYCN is required for binding of TFIIIC5 at promoter sites 1.</p><p>Additionally, we included data with DRB treated cells (Figure 2F), which prevents RNAPII loading by preventing downstream de novo elongation. Those data show that TFIIIC5 binding at the TSS is massively increased upon induction of MYCN and additionally upon treatment with DRB. Conversely, we observed that the major effect of TFIIIC knock-down was at the nonphosphorylated RNAPII at the TSS on MYCN induction (Figure 2B). Therefore, we would argue that our assumption fits well to the data presented in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 3A doesn't add much to the paper, as it is overplotted and no relationship is clear, except that Pol2 and MYCN occupy many of the same sites. Perhaps a less complex or different type of plot would allow the interactions to be better visible.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the comment and since in another comment we were asked to show the same window for all shown Hi-ChIP data plots, we changed Figure 3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) That depletion of TF3C leads to increased promoter hubs may or may not have anything to do with its association with MYCN (Figure 4E). This could be a direct consequence of its known structural function in cohesin complexes, and the MYCN changes as a secondary consequence of this (also see point 4, above).</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Büchel et al. (2017) 1 MYCN is needed to recruit RAD21 and depletion of RAD21 has no impact on the recruitment of MYCN. Since RAD21 is part of the cohesin complex we would exclude that the MYCN changes are a secondary consequence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Depletion of TF3C5 results in a loss of EXOSC5 (exosome) at TSS in the presence and absence of MYCN (Figure 5B). As TF3C5 is a cohesin, could this simply be a consequence of genomic structure changes?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the discovered changes in EXOSC5 can be due to depletion of TFIIIC5. TFIIIC has been shown to recruit cohesin 1 and condensin complexes 2, as well as inducing chromatin architectural changes 3. However, MYCN is needed to recruit TFIIIC and depletion of TFIIIC had no impact on MYCN recruitment 1. Furthermore, MYCN has been shown to recruit exosome 4. Therefore, we would argue that either MYCN can directly play a role or thru chromatin architectural changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) The authors suggest that RNA dynamics are affected by changes in exosome function (RNA degradation, etc). What effect, if any does TF3C depletion have on the overall gene expression profile?</p></disp-quote><p>We show in the manuscript that TFIIIC depletion in unperturbed cells has no effect on the global gene expression profile in the time frame analyzed (Figure 2E and S2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) Dynamic inferences are made without kinetic experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that we did not collect kinetic data to study the dynamics of RNA polymerase we would argue that the integration of our different data sets make it possible to draw conclusions about dynamic interferences. The transcription cycle and its sequential steps have been well described. In this sense, we use the non-phosphorylated RNAPII data that is situated between RNAPII recruitment and initiation and RNAPII-pSer2 that shows pause-release to elongation to draw conclusions on the dynamic. Likewise, we also made use of our previous published datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) A number of changes are reported in hub size, expression, etc. upon treatment with tamoxifen to activate MCN-ER. But MYC is already present in the SHEP cells, so why doesn't MYC support these same phenomena? It would seem that either the ability to cooperate with TFIIIC to clear non-productive polymerase complexes from promoters is particular to MYCN, or else it reflects a quantitative increase in total MYC proteins due to the entry of MYCN-ER into the nucleus with tamoxifen. The authors should address or discuss this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>It could be that protein levels are the limiting factor between MYC and MYCN observed effects in this system. This interpretation would be in accordance with the results of Lorenzin et al. 5, which reported that different levels of MYC had different targets based on the affinity to Eboxes and protein level. A similar profile of MYC levels compared to function was also reported regarding SPT5 6. Those high protein levels mimic what is found in certain tumors in contrast to physiological levels. In this sense, the observed differences can also be between physiological and oncological levels of MYC proteins.</p><p>On the other hand, it has been described both a core MYC- and an isoform specific-signature of target genes. MYCN is described to be involved in gene expression during the S-phase of the cell cycle 7. This suggests that there are differences between MYC and MYCN other than gene sets. The interaction with TFIIIC appears to be one of these differences. We have found multiple TFIIIC subunits as part of the MYCN interactome, but the interaction of TFIIIC with MYC is weaker and we are uncertain how relevant it is 7,8. We show here that depletion of different subunits of the TFIIIC complex show a MYCN-dependent growth defect (Figure 1 E). Similarly, nuclear exosome is a MYCN-specific dependence 4, and we show here that MYCNdependent recruitment of the exosome requires TFIIIC5. We take this as an indication that there is an intrinsic difference between MYC and MYCN and that MYCN engages TFIIIC for this pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Reciprocal to TFIIIC recruitment to MYCN- rRNA, and other RNAPIII genes. Does this happen targets would be MYCN association with tRNA genes, 5S, and if so, is this association TFIIIC dependent? What happens to the expression of these genes?</p></disp-quote><p>We did observe MYCN in interactions involving tRNA and other RNAPIII sites, such as SINE elements and tRNAs (Figure 4B, 4D, S3F, and S4B). There was no relevant number of 5S rRNA involved in interactions – either because the difficulty to properly map these repetitive regions or due to biology. In any case, none of those regions appeared to be specifically dependent on TFIIIC as the overall number of interactions increased in TFIIIC depletion regardless of the genomic annotation (Figure S4B). Regarding the expression of RNAPIII genes, we are constrained by technical limitations of poly(A) enrichment RNA-seq to globally analyze it in an unbiased way. However, we addressed this point for tRNAs expression in an earlier work 1 and found that tRNA levels do not change upon TFIIIC depletion. We think this is because tRNAs are stable transcripts and RNAPIII recycling can occur in a TFIIICindependent manner 9. Conversely, we reported no significant expression changes in RNAPII genes upon TFIIIC depletion in this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors show that TFIIIC depletion does not alter the RNA-expression profile; how do they account for this? Can they comment on &quot;background&quot; transcription that it would seem should be suppressed by TFIIIC-dependent removal of various hypofunctional polymerases?</p></disp-quote><p>Since TFIIIC is important for the removal of non-functional RNAPII we would not expect changes to the gene expression profile upon depletion of TFIIIC in the time frame analyzed. Monitoring the elongating form of RNAPII by measuring pSer2 indeed shows us that transcription elongation is not affected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Global changes in expression are difficult to assess with DESEQ2. This hypernormalizing algorithm is not really suited to distinguish differential, but universal upregulation from some targets being truly upregulated while others are downregulated. The authors should comment.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors acknowledge that DESEQ2 relies on the conjecture that genewise estimates of dispersion are generally unchanged among samples. We address this comment in two different ways. We include those in the Figure for the Reviewers (Figure 2). The first was to sequence samples deeper to avoid any bias created by random effect of lower coverage, the range of total reads increased from 6.8-9.3 to 16.5-20.7 million reads. The second was to compare the fold average bin dot plot for RNA-seq of SH-EP-MYCN-ER showing mRNA expression normalized by control per bin using the DESEQ2 (Figure 2A) normalization to TMM in edgeR (Figure 2B) and to quantile normalization (Figure 2C). No major differences were found from the original data or using the different methods, but we updated the Figure 2E in the manuscript to include the deeper sequencing dataset, we also adjusted it to show -/+ MYCN and transformed to log2 to make it more intuitive. Overall, it enhances our original understanding that gene expression remains largely unaffected by TFIIIC5 knockdown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) On page 7, the authors claim that MYCN-ER increased Ser-2 can reflect MYCN-stimulated transcription elongation. In fact, without kinetic studies, this is not fully supported. Accumulation of Ser-2 RNAPII along a gene can reflect increased initiation of full-speed RNAPs or a pile-up of RNAPs slowing down. This should be resolved or qualified.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that we did not collect kinetic data to study the dynamics of RNA polymerase we would argue that the integration of our different data sets make it possible to draw conclusions about dynamic interferences. We showed on the one side that pSer-2 accumulates on the TES and on the other side the induction of MYCN-ER up-regulates gene expression which proves productive transcription elongation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) pLHiChIP needs to be better described, the Mumbach reference is not sufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reformulated the pLHiChIP in the method section and hope that this will provide now a better description of the method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Can the authors recheck all the labels in Figure 2D-I believe there is an error involving + or - MYCN.</p></disp-quote><p>We carefully rechecked all the labels in Figure 2 and it was correct as it was. We understand the confusion that may have created comparing Figure 2D and Figure 2E. To avoid confusion, we updated Figure 2E to show the same direction of Figure 2D. We also log2 transformed the y-axis of Figure 2E to foster a more intuitive reading.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Why are there different scales for the regions of chromosome 17 shown in Figures 3 and 4? It would be easier to compare if the examples were all shown at the same scale (about 2 MB is shown in another Figure).</p></disp-quote><p>We now show the same region of chromosome 17 in Figure 3 and 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) The connection between the three major findings presented in this study regarding the role of TFIIIC in the regulation of MYCN function remains unclear. Specifically, how the TFIIICdependent restriction of MYCN localization to promoter hubs enhances the association of factors involved in nascent RNA degradation to prevent the accumulation of inactive RNA polymerase II at promoters is not apparent. As they are currently presented, these findings appear as independent observations. Cross-comparison of the different datasets obtained may provide some insight into addressing this question.</p></disp-quote><p>We previously observed that TFIIIC does not affect MYCN recruitment, while MYCN affects TFIIIC binding 1. Moreover, our group reported that MYCN recruits exosome 4 and BRCA1 to promoter-proximal regions 10 to clear out non-functional RNAPII. We are currently reporting that MYCN-TFIIIC complexes exclude non-functional RNAPII. However, MYCN-active promoter hubs have more RNAPII and more transcription than MYCN-active promoter outside hubs. Furthermore, TFIIIC binding occurs upstream of BRCA1 and exosome recruitments as depletion of TFIIIC leads to recruitment decrease of both factors. Therefore, we argue that TFIIIC is required for the proper function of those MYCN-active promoter hubs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Another concern involves the disparities in RNA polymerase II ChIP-seq results between this study and earlier ones conducted by the same group. In Figure 2, the authors demonstrate that activation of MYCN results in a reduction of non-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II across all expressed genes. This discovery contradicts prior findings obtained using the same methodology, where it was concluded that the expression of MYCN had no significant effect on the chromatin association of hypo-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (Buchel et al, 2017). In this regard, the choice of the 8WG16 antibody raises concern, as fluctuations in the signal may be attributed to changes in the phosphorylation levels of the Cterminal domain. It remains unclear why the authors decided against using antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, which are unaffected by phosphorylation and consistently demonstrated a significant signal reduction upon MYCN activation in their previous studies (Buchel et al, 2017) (Herold et al, 2019). Similarly, the authors previously proposed that depletion of TFIIIC5 abrogates the MYCN-dependent increase of Ser2phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (Buchel et al, 2017), whereas they now show that it has no obvious impact. These aspects need clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>We politely disagree that our discoveries are contradicting each other. Comparing our new results to the data published previously we can summarize that the data sets in the two studies show three key results: First, the traveling ratio of RNAPII changes upon induction of MYCN. Second, RNAPII decreases at the transcription start side and third, it increases towards the end side.</p><p>We agree that in the previous study we linked the traveling ratio directly to elongation. However performing ChIP-seq with different RNAPII antibodies showed us that for example RNAPII (N20), which is unfortunately discontinued, gives different results compared to RNAPII (A10). Combining our new results using the RNAPII (8WG16) antibody shows that the traveling ratio is not only reflecting transcription elongation but also includes that the RNAPII is kicked-off chromatin at the start side.</p><p>In the previous study we only performed manual ChIP experiments for RNAPII (8WG16) and pSer2. Now we did a global analysis which is more meaningful and is also reflected in the RNA sequencing data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Finally, the varied techniques employed to explore the role of TFIIIC in MYCNdependent recruitment of nascent RNA degradation factors make it challenging to draw definitive conclusions about which factor is affected and which one is not. While conducting ChIPseq experiments for all factors may be beyond the scope of this manuscript, incorporating proximity ligation assays (PLA) or ChIP-qPCR assays with each factor would have enabled a more direct and comprehensive comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the criticism that we are comparing different assays. We have performed PLAs with different antibodies. Since the controls of the PLAs were not sufficient for us, we refrain from using them. ChIP-qPCR experiments are much more challenging to do side by side compared to PLAs, which is why we decided against looking at all factors with this method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Figure 2: Why did the authors choose the 8WG16 antibody? Does TFIIIC5 depletion suppress the MYCN-dependent reduction of total RNA polymerase II binding to promoters that they consistently showed in previous studies? Given that phosphorylation of the CTD impacts 8WG16 recognition, including Ser5-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II ChIPseq experiments might clarify this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the RNAPII (8WG16) antibody to exactly map non-phosphorylated RNAPII which shows us the binding of non-functional RNAPII.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figures 3 and 4: As it stands, the manuscript does not convincingly establish a functional connection between the results in Figures 2, 3, and 4 or elucidate potential mechanisms. Are changes in RNA polymerase II levels upon MYCN activation more pronounced at promoters located at MYCN hubs? Do changes in MYCN-enriched chromatin contacts upon TFIIIC5 depletion somehow correlate with alterations in RNA polymerase II levels? Performing similar cross-comparisons as in Figure 3C may help address this issue. Furthermore, it not clear how the authors concluded that MYCN/TFIIIC5-bound genes are not part of these so-called promoter hubs.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 3C we show that RNAPII levels are more pronounced upon MYCN activation at promoters located at MYCN hubs. Additionally, we show non-phosphorylated ChIP-seq on TSS and RNAPII-pSer2 ChIP-seq on TES density plots for promoters with MYCN interactions in the Figure for the Reviewers (Figure 3). We found no other difference than binding compared to the overall global analysis for all expressed genes showed in Figure 2B and Figure 2C. This goes on the same direction of the high expression observed of those genes in MYCN interactions observed in Figure 3C.</p><p>The changes observed in Figures 2B and 2C are global and do include the promoters with MYCN interactions. At the same time, it is required a higher number of replicates to statistically distinguish the MYCN interaction differences between TFIIIC5 presence and depletion. We acknowledge this limitation, and we therefore restrain any attempt towards this end. We base our conclusions on the other parts of the manuscript and on our previous studies that show that MYCN recruits TFIIIC, BRCA1, and the exosome to promoter proximal regions 1,4,10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 5: According to the PLA results, activation of MYCN could enhance RNA polymerase II-NELFE interaction in a TFIIC5-dependent manner.

Finally, do the authors conclude that the TFIIIC5 effect on MYCN-dependent changes in RNA polymerase II depends upon the recruitment of EXOSC5 and BRCA1? If so, it would be interesting to determine whether depletion of these factors phenocopies the effects observed with TFIIC5.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the criticism that we are comparing different assays.
