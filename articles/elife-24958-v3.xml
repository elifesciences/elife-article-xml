force generation within cells. We show here that organs can be sculpted instead by patterning anisotropic resistance within their extracellular matrix (ECM). Using direct biophysical measurements of elongating Drosophila egg chambers, we document robust mechanical anisotropy in the ECM-based basement membrane (BM) but not in the underlying epithelium. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) on wild-type BM in vivo reveals an anterior–posterior (A–P) symmetric stiffness gradient, which fails to develop in elongation-defective mutants. Genetic manipulation shows that the BM is instructive for tissue elongation and the determinant is relative rather than absolute stiffness, creating differential resistance to isotropic tissue expansion. The stiffness gradient requires morphogen-like signaling to regulate BM incorporation, as well as planar-polarized organization to homogenize it circumferentially. Our results demonstrate how fine mechanical patterning in the ECM can guide cells to shape an organ.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24958.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24958.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24958.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All organs have specific shapes and architectures that are necessary for them to work properly.

Although originating in a genetic program, morphogenesis of organs ultimately depends on physical forces, and specifically on their imbalances, to drive shape change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Thompson, 1917</xref>). A central question of morphogenesis is how such force imbalances are created by mechanical anisotropy that is generated within an organ’s components. Current paradigms derive from archetypes of morphogenetic processes such as tissue elongation, and elegant studies have revealed conserved mechanisms that drive elongation across many species. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, planar cell polarized (PCP) myosin contractility at the cell cortex generates junctional rearrangements that extend the germband, whereas in vertebrate embryos, PCP actin-based protrusions drive cell movements that extend the neural plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guillot and Lecuit, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heisenberg and Bellaïche, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vichas and Zallen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walck-Shannon and Hardin, 2014</xref>). In these textbook examples of morphogenesis, as in others such as gastrulation and epiboly, the force anisotropies that instruct shape are generated within the tissue’s cells.</p><p>In theory, asymmetric organs could be generated not only by spatially varying forces produced within cells, but also by spatially varying tissue properties that differentially resist uniformly applied forces. In epithelial organs, morphogenetic forces include not only tension between cells that can cause intercellular rearrangements, but also expansion of luminal contents normal to the epithelial plane; resistance to these forces is mediated by cells and by the extracellular matrix (ECM), including the basement membranes (BMs) that line all epithelia. In comparison to the action of cellular forces, the role of non-cellular influences on morphogenesis is poorly understood.</p><p>A comprehensive study of morphogenetic mechanics requires a tissue that is subject to both cellular and extracellular influences. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg chamber (or ‘follicle’) is such a tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and undergoes robust elongation during its development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Spradling, 1993</xref>). Each follicle is a simple tube-like organ consisting of just two cell types, with a somatic epithelium of ‘follicle cells’ (FCs) encasing an interconnected cyst of germ cells. The epithelium also produces an underlying BM that surrounds the entire follicle. The organ is initially spherical and grows throughout oogenesis, expanding ~5000 fold in volume over ~3 days. Expansion for the first 35 hr is isotropic, but subsequently becomes anisotropic as the follicle elongates &gt;2-fold specifically along the anterior–posterior (A–P) axis to form the distinctively shaped oval egg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Much of this elongation takes place without cell division. Genes and cell behaviors that are required for egg elongation have been identified, but the mechanical environment that actually shapes the tissue is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bilder and Haigo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cetera and Horne-Badovinac, 2015</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24958.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A mechanical stiffness gradient in the follicle basement membrane.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Elongation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle during oogenesis involves three components: the luminal germline, a surrounding epithelium, and an encasing basement membrane (BM) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Surprisingly, we find no evidence for differential cell-intrinsic forces within the organ, but instead document a robust spatial gradient in stiffness within the BM. Direct BM manipulation indicates that this mechanical gradient is instructive for tissue elongation. Fine mechanical patterning within the BM, generated by independent mechanisms along both the A–P and circumferential axes, endows the BM with anisotropic resistance to tissue expansion that deforms the growing tissue. These results highlight a new parameter of developmental mechanics by uncovering an unappreciated sophistication in BM mechanical properties that can directly impose organ shape.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cells in elongating follicles are mechanically isotropic</title><p>To understand the conditions that drive elongation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle, we first searched for mechanical anisotropy in the organ’s two distinct cell populations. In these assays as well as others below, we examined follicles at stage 8 and earlier, when they display a regular and A–P symmetric morphology. Previous genetic mosaic experiments with several ‘round egg’ mutations exclude the germline as a site of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frydman and Spradling, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wieschaus et al., 1981</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">; Viktorinová et al., 2009</xref>), while stripping of epithelium in <italic>Heteropeza</italic> results in round rather than elongated follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Went and Junquera, 1981</xref>). Similarly, we genetically ablated the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle epithelium (as well as its underlying BM), and found that germline growth resulted in a nearly spherical follicle at stages when elongation would normally have initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the germline is not an intrinsic source of mechanical anisotropy.</p><p>To assess whether the follicle epithelium showed PCP cortical contractility, we laser-ablated cellular junctions at different positions along the A–P axis and measured the recoil. In elongating epithelia including the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ectoderm and wing, this technique reveals differential tension along A–P and dorsal–ventral (D–V) axes, an anisotropy associated with polarized Myosin II accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bosveld et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Etournay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rauzi et al., 2008</xref>). However, in the elongating follicle epithelium, dissection of junctions resulted in equivalent retraction of A–P and circumferentially oriented junctions; polarized accumulation of Myo:GFP was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that neither follicle cell type intrinsically generates anisotropic physical forces.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Patterned mechanical stiffness in the follicle BM</title><p>To identify the source of mechanical anisotropy, we therefore turned to a non-cellular component of the organ: the ECM, specifically the BM. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle is enclosed by a BM that, like classic vertebrate BMs, is ~150 nm thick and contains Collagen IV, laminin, and perlecan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haigo and Bilder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Isabella and Horne-Badovinac, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Spradling, 1993</xref>). BMs and surrounding ECM are known to have important influences on animal organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daley and Yamada, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morrissey and Sherwood, 2015</xref>), but discovery of their mechanical roles has been impeded by the difficulty of measuring these directly in vivo. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle, the external position of the BM, the absence of a cellular stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the ability to develop in culture provided an unprecedented opportunity to assess the mechanical properties of an intact BM, in living tissue under physiological conditions.</p><p>We utilized Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to measure BM stiffness, calculating the Young’s modulus from the deflection of a cantilevered probe indenting into the basal follicle surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Treatment of follicles with purified collagenase decreased stiffness by 97% without detectable changes to epithelial junctions, whereas disruption of the cellular actomyosin network with Latrunculin A induced no significant change in the AFM measurements. Furthermore, reducing the turgor pressure of the follicle with a hypertonic solution (2000 mOsm sorbitol media) does not have an effect on the BM stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These controls indicate that the quantified stiffness predominantly derives from the BM.</p><p>AFM measurements at the center of staged wild-type (WT) follicles showed that the BM gradually stiffens as oogenesis proceeds, increasing from ~30 KPa at stage 3 to ~40 KPa at stage 5 and ~70 KPa at stage 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, although stiffness was highly consistent (&gt;5% variance) around the circumferential axis at a given position Figure 4F, it significantly varied along the A–P axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). At stages 3 and 5, poles were ~50% softer than the central or terminal regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> for definitions). This difference persisted into later stages, and the central regions further became ~30% stiffer than the terminal regions. Thus, AFM analysis reveals a symmetrical gradient of BM stiffness along the A–P axis of the follicle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>BM stiffness is instructive for tissue elongation</title><p>If the BM stiffness gradient is functionally important for organ elongation, it should be perturbed in conditions where elongation fails.

An alternative hypothesis is that BM stiffness is instead an indirect consequence of organ shape, passively reflecting undetected changes in cell-intrinsic properties. To distinguish between these possibilities, we directly manipulated BM components. We then measured effects on BM mechanics and subsequent tissue elongation, including manipulations in which the A–P stiffness gradient was either eliminated or preserved.

We immersed live follicles in deionized water, creating osmotic stress that leads to water influx into the follicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Acute expansion of the organ challenges the BM, resulting in bursting which can be monitored by live imaging.

We hypothesized that the frequency and speed at which the BM bursts would reflect its overall stiffness, whereas the position at which it bursts could indicate the location of a weak point.

All collagenase-treated follicles burst instantly.

Therefore, to investigate the role of BM fibril polarity per se in generating elongation-driving mechanical anisotropy, we uniformly overexpressed Perlecan, which antagonizes the constrictive properties of Collagen IV BMs and can induce round eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Isabella and Horne-Badovinac, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pastor-Pareja and Xu, 2011</xref>). This manipulation did not change the A–P levels, PCP, or circumferential distribution of Collagen IV fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5H,I</xref>). However, AFM analysis revealed that it did create a softer BM in which the anisotropic gradient has been eliminated, and the enclosed follicles fail to elongate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J,K</xref>). In osmotic stress experiments, follicles overexpressing perlecan swelled more isotropically and burst more rapidly than WT follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). Thus, despite the fact that neither the levels, local PCP, or supracellular organization of Collagen IV fibrils are altered in Perlecan-overexpressing follicles, the BM of these follicles had mechanical deficits similar to those of follicles completely lacking a BM. By contrast, follicles deficient for STAT-dependent A–P signaling also fail to elongate but show normal fibril polarity and organization, and are significantly more resistant to bursting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5J–L</xref>). Together, these data support a requirement for a circumferentially even distribution of PCP fibrils in elongation. However, they also reveal that PCP fibrils alone are insufficient to resist tissue growth anisotropically; the organ-shaping stiffness gradient requires patterned A–P BM levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Organ elongation is a fundamental developmental process, and is generally considered to be driven by cell-intrinsic polarized mechanical forces that actively deform tissues. Here, we demonstrate that an elongating tissue can rely instead on mechanical anisotropy patterned into the BM. Our data indicate that this asymmetric resistance within the extracellular environment, rather than asymmetric force generation within the cells, plays the dominant role in molding the follicle, prescribing subsequent morphogenetic cell behaviors. These results direct increased attention to fine BM spatial organization in creating the mechanical environment that shapes each tissue, and may fill the gap between the limited repertoire of cell-based morphogenetic mechanisms and the immense diversity of organ shapes.</p><p>Stromatic ECMs and BMs surround most animal organs, but their full roles in morphogenesis remain unresolved. Long regarded as an inert scaffold, ECM is known to influence tissue biology through actively regulating ligand availability and adhesion signaling; local BM deposition and degradation also play key roles in the branching morphogenesis of several mammalian organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daley and Yamada, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harunaga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morrissey and Sherwood, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pastor-Pareja and Xu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Varner and Nelson, 2014</xref>). However, analysis of the mechanical properties of vertebrate BMs in vivo is hampered by surrounding cellular stroma, whose removal necessitates non-physiological manipulations. Because of this, only exceptionally robust BMs, such as those of the eye, have been analyzed following denuding protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2016</xref>). By contrast, fly follicles lack a cellular stroma, and their topology allows direct access of AFM probes to the BM of an intact living tissue.</p><p>Our in vivo biophysical measurements of this native BM reveal an unappreciated degree of tissue-level mechanical patterning. Within each follicle, BM stiffness develops reliably and with spatial properties that are carefully regulated along both the A–P and circumferential axes. Along the A–P axis, a stiffness gradient is built that increases ~300% along a ~13-cell, 100 μm arc at stage 8. Perpendicular to this axis, stiffness around the circumference varies by less than 5% across the same distance. Our data reveal that both axes are critical for organ shaping, and merit a significant revision of the ‘molecular corset’ model previously proposed to mediate elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bilder and Haigo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cetera and Horne-Badovinac, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutzeit et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Isabella and Horne-Badovinac, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tucker and Meats, 1976</xref>). Hypotheses of corset structure have focused on the PCP organization of the basal actin network, the microtubule cytoskeleton, or the fibril-like BM. However, manipulations that preserve PCP alignment but nevertheless result in round follicles demonstrate that mechanical anisotropy at the length scale of individual BM fibrils is not sufficient to drive elongation. Instead, they suggest that consistent circumferential stiffness, probably associated with the supracellular BM fibrillar network generated by whole-tissue rotation, is a key element of corset effectiveness. Moreover, manipulations that flatten a pole-derived A–P signaling gradient also flatten the A–P stiffness gradient, and create isotropic organs. Thus, to drive elongation, the corset must also be anisotropic on a ‘global’ tissue-wide scale, in a manner that depends on morphogen-regulated mechanical properties.</p><p>The direct manipulations of BM components presented here, which lead to predicted tissue shape outcomes, argue that BM mechanics themselves are instructive for morphogenesis. Flattening the stiffness gradient in several ways, including by locally restricted BM alteration, prevents elongation, whereas hyperelongating follicles have an enhanced stiffness gradient. Although we cannot rule out undetected roles of these manipulations in altering cell behaviors via classical intercellular signaling, we see no evidence for such changes in the underlying epithelium. Instead, our results indicate that elongation is imposed by isotropic tissue growth meeting the anisotropic resistance fashioned within the BM. Consistent with this model, manipulations that alter absolute stiffness but preserve a relative gradient still result in tissue elongation. The extent to which ovarian cells respond compliantly or through well-characterized mechanical feedback mechanisms remain to be determined, but the data point to physical properties of the BM as the dominant influence.</p><p>Our results reveal a tissue elongation mechanism that is conceptually different from cell-intrinsic force asymmetries. Construction of mechanically patterned resistance in an ECM, along both axes orthogonal to its tissue interface, generates a force imbalance that imposes a specific shape on the growing organ, without necessitating spatially restricted localization of force generators within cells. Emerging examples point to the influence that substantial changes in exogenous physical forces can have in organ morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrndt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Etournay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harunaga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">rayRay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shyer et al., 2013</xref>) as well as in tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaushik et al., 2016</xref>). The discovery of precise organ-sculpting resistance within a BM motivates the development of tools and assays to explore, on a fine scale, true in vivo BM mechanical properties in both physiological and pathological contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains</title><p>The GAL4 drivers used were <italic>tjGAL4, mirrGAL4</italic> and <italic>fruGAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borensztejn et al., 2013</xref>); <italic>tubGAL80ts</italic> was used to control expression temporally by shifting flies to 29°.

Latrunculin A 50 µM (Sigma), FM4-64FX 5 µg/mL (Thermo), and purified Collagenase 1000 U/mL (Worthington LS005273) were diluted in Schneider’s complete media (10 mg/mL insulin, FBS and pen/strep) for live imaging.

Apical surfaces of interest (SOI) of the epithelia were identified by Sqh-GFP signal.

Maximum intensity projections were background subtracted with the Fiji plugin ‘subtract background’. A–P and circumferential junctions were categorized by 60–90° and 0–30° degrees, respectively, relative to the A–P axis.

Maximum intensity projections from multilayered pullbacks ±3 μm from the basal epithelia were generated. To measure A–P intensity, five 1-pixel-wide lines were drawn within a 10 μm wide stripe at the central meridian, where the pullbacks have minimal distortion. To measure circumferential intensity, five circumferential 1-pixel-wide lines were drawn within a 10 μm wide stripe along the circumferential meridian. Intensities were standardized to follicle length, then compared across follicles. Variance was calculated for each follicle using the Excel var.p formula.

MLCT-C cantilevers (Bruker) with a pyramidal tip and a nominal spring constant of 10 pN/nm were used in all experiments. The actual spring constant of each cantilever was determined by thermal calibration in air. Measurements were done in fluid.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Allan Spradling (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.

The system is specialized and builds on much previous work, but ultimately addresses a question of great generality and importance for understanding cell shape, namely whether anisotropies in (passive) resistance to an isotropic contractions or expansions are sufficient to result in polarized force distributions and morphogenetic movements. Previous works in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have long indicated that the follicle cells play the predominant role in shaping the oocyte. The initial expectation was that this would be a structure in the follicle cells themselves. What is exciting about the paper is the demonstration that the constraint is really in the ECM secreted by the follicles and the biophysical measurements that quantify and support that view. The demonstration that reprogrammed expression of ECM components and signaling regulators can alter stiffness is also highly significant. With several relatively minor changes described below the paper would be suitable for acceptance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The initial experiments to implicate a role for the follicle cells are weak and unnecessary given previous research on this system. The remarkably crude approach of completely ablating the follicular epithelium adds nothing of value and is not currently even interpreted correctly. The ablation of follicle cell junctions along the AP and DV axis is not described in detail nor is much data provided. The failure to detect junction-mediated anisotropy does not strongly implicate the ECM because it does not exclude anisotropy in cellular structures other than junctions, such as basal actin fibers. A better approach would be to cite classical papers by Wieschaus, and by Gutzeit where mosaics are used to show that the length vs circumference ratio is governed by an ovarian cell type that is not germ line derived, most likely the follicle cells.</p><p>2) The authors should clarify whether their experiments apply to egg elongation generally or only to early elongation. The authors study the initial elongation of the follicle that takes place from about stage 3 to stage 7. However, most previous papers have studied elongation throughout oogenesis, including significant additional elongation during stages 8-14.</p><p>3) The measurement of ECM stiffness using atomic force microscopy is a great strength of the paper. However, relatively few details or controls are shown to validate these measurements. Does the size, shape and exact placement of the tip matter? A large tip might be more relevant to the large scale morphogenetic forces under consideration. The force is applied at right angles to the material, but Young's modulus is conventionally determined by the deformation along the linear dimension of the material. Do the measurements depend on the questionable assumption that the ECM is locally isotropic in all dimensions? More primary data should be shown, rather than just ratios.</p><p>4) It is not entirely clear that from the experiments presented whether additional mechanisms are needed for egg elongation beyond the reductions in collagen deposition at the poles expected for geometric reasons due to rotation. Artificially changing polar BM stiffness causes problems, but the authors’ experiments and arguments fail to delineate how precise the gradient must be, and whether graded JAK/STAT signaling is essential because of its effects on the stiffness profile or on BM synthesis. The authors should more clearly justify statements such as: &quot;[these data]...reveal that PCP fibrils are insufficient alone to anisotropically resist tissue growth; the organ-shaping stiffness gradient requires patterned A-P BM levels&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24958.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The initial experiments to implicate a role for the follicle cells are weak and unnecessary given previous research on this system.

We have made use of published work as reviewer 2 suggested. This includes the 1981 Wieschaus paper on <italic>short egg</italic>, although we have previously examined <italic>seg</italic> mutants and cannot detect follicle shape defects before st. 8; the gene seems to regulate elongation at later stages (see point 2). Furthermore, osmotic bursting experiments revealed no significant differences between stage 8 WT and <italic>seg</italic> mutant follicles by (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>). We have moved former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-D</xref> to a Supplemental Figure.</p><p>The cell junction ablation experiments have been updated and clarified in the Figure Legend and Experimental Methods.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24958.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(<bold>A</bold>) St. 7-8 follicles were indented with a 10µm bead-tipped cantilever.</title><p>Relative stiffness differences between A-P position were similar to pyramidal-tipped cantilevers.

However, most previous papers have studied elongation throughout oogenesis, including significant additional elongation during stages 8-14.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers make an important point. Briefly, our goal here was to use the highly regular architecture of the early follicle to address the general question of whether basement membrane mechanics can directly instruct organ shape. Following stage 8, the non-uniform epithelial morphology, changes in nurse cell/oocyte volume, and coordinated actomyosin contractions in follicle cells create significant complications to analysis, particularly the mechanical assays at the heart of the manuscript. We note that most manipulations that cause follicle elongation defects at stage 8 also result in significant changes in final egg shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>). We have now clarified in the manuscript that our analyses focus on the initial stage of egg elongation.</p><p><italic>3) The measurement of ECM stiffness using atomic force microscopy is a great strength of the paper. However, relatively few details or controls are shown to validate these measurements. Does the size, shape and exact placement of the tip matter? A large tip might be more relevant to the large scale morphogenetic forces under consideration. The force is applied at right angles to the material, but Young's modulus is conventionally determined by the deformation along the linear dimension of the material. Do the measurements depend on the questionable assumption that the ECM is locally isotropic in all dimensions? More primary data should be shown, rather than just ratios.</italic> </p><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 2 now lays out how primary force-extension curves are used to derive stiffness scores, and the Methods have been expanded with additional detail.</p><p>We have also now repeated the measurements in WT follicles, using a cantilever with a 10 µm round bead. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>, this tip also detects a mechanical gradient in the BM, with the center being significantly more stiff than the termini. Previously, the Fletcher lab examined the differences between a small pyramidal tip and a large spherical tip (Rosenbluth, Biophys J, 2006) on synthetic substrates as well as leukocytes. In brief, they found that the standard deviations of the measurements is smaller with the larger spherical beads, but the validity of the Hertzian model used to extract elasticity becomes more questionable. The pyramidal tip is therefore preferred because it can give a more accurate depiction of absolute stiffness.</p><p>Because local features of the matrix can change positional stiffness values, we made four indentations at a given position to obtain an accurate average measurement. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> shows that tip placement at multiple sites along the circumferential axis within a given position along the AP axis detects ~5% variability in stiffness. This variability is much less than the regional variability, suggesting that differences in exact tip placement do not cloud the detection of the mechanical gradient.</p><p>The AFM measurements, involving calculations of values generated by indentations normal to the plane of the material, are derived using standard approaches within the field (e.g. Radmacher, Methods in Cell Biology, 2007). Isotropy is an important assumption. As a reviewer inferred, the Hertzian model used to calculate stiffness assumes that the sample is homogenous and isotropically linearly elastic; this is nearly never the case with biological samples, and a particular concern given the apparent fibril-like structure of the follicle BM. However, to date it is the best approximation that mechanobiology has. Anisotropy of the matrix at the length scale of individual BM fibrils will certainly be interesting to investigate, but we do not currently have a good technique to do so.</p><p><italic>4) It is not entirely clear that from the experiments presented whether additional mechanisms are needed for egg elongation beyond the reductions in collagen deposition at the poles expected for geometric reasons due to rotation. Artificially changing polar BM stiffness causes problems, but the authors’ experiments and arguments fail to delineate how precise the gradient must be, and whether graded JAK/STAT signaling is essential because of its effects on the stiffness profile or on BM synthesis. The authors should more clearly justify statements such as: &quot;[these data]…reveal that PCP fibrils are insufficient alone to anisotropically resist tissue growth; the organ-shaping stiffness gradient requires patterned A-P BM levels&quot;.</italic> </p><p>Although we are struck by the relatively strong R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> between BM stiffness anisotropy and follicle aspect ration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref> and recently extended to other genotypes), unfortunately our manipulations do not yet allow us to fine-tune the stiffness gradient to answer questions about precision. As mentioned in the text, we have not yet comprehensively analyzed transcription of all BM components, but the <italic>vkg</italic> pattern suggests that it is not regulated by JAK/STAT signaling. However, JAK/STAT is indeed required for relatively lower incorporation of Col IV into the anterior BM, along with the lowered anterior stiffness that creates a mechanical gradient.</p><p>While we acknowledge that EHBP1 overexpression at poles could be interpreted as neomorphic stiffening, we also see follicle rounding when the physiological JAK/STAT gradient is disrupted (by Dome-DN, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The elongation defects associated with central knockdown of Collagen IV as well as polar EHBP1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G, H</xref>) suggest that a gradient is still required, even when the BM has relatively high average stiffness.</p><p>We have now revised the text to clarify our conclusions about the necessity for both the circumferential PCP fibrils and the AP incorporation gradient. The former is based on the fact that follicles overexpressing either Dome-DN or Perlecan rotate appropriately and maintain circumferential collagen organization and stiffness, but nevertheless fail to elongate. The latter of course is based on the fact that Dome-DN overexpressing follicles also flatten the AP Collagen incorporation gradient.</p></body></sub-article></article>
