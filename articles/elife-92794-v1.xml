Two RNP granules in male germ cells, intermitochondrial cement and the chromatoid body (CB), are associated with PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and are required for transposon silencing and spermatogenesis. Other RNP granules in male germ cells, the reticulated body and CB remnants, are also essential for spermiogenesis. In this study, we disrupted FBXO24, a testis-enriched F-box protein, in mice and found numerous membraneless electron-dense granules accumulated in sperm flagella. <italic>Fbxo24</italic> knockout (KO) mice exhibited malformed flagellar structures, impaired sperm motility, and male infertility, likely due to the accumulation of abnormal granules. The amount and localization of known RNP granule-related proteins were not disrupted in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice, suggesting that the accumulated granules were distinct from known RNP granules. Further studies revealed that RNAs and two importins, IPO5 and KPNB1, abnormally accumulated in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa and that FBXO24 could ubiquitinate IPO5. In addition, IPO5 and KPNB1 were recruited to stress granules, RNP complexes, when cells were treated with oxidative stress or a proteasome inhibitor. These results suggest that FBXO24 is involved in the degradation of IPO5, disruption of which may lead to the accumulation of abnormal RNP granules in sperm flagella.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spermatogenesis is a specialized process by which spermatogonia differentiate into spermatocytes, round spermatids, elongating spermatids, and spermatozoa by undergoing meiosis and subsequent spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, round spermatids undergo dramatic morphological changes such as nuclear condensation, acrosome formation, flagellum formation, and cytoplasmic removal, leading to the formation of spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leblond and Clermont, 1952</xref>). To fertilize eggs, spermatozoa then travel a long distance to reach eggs and pass through the cumulus cell layer and zona pellucida (ZP) that encase eggs. The motility apparatus of spermatozoa is the flagellum which is divided into three parts, a midpiece, a principal piece, and an endpiece, in order from proximal to distal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eddy et al., 2003</xref>). The midpiece contains accessory structures called the mitochondrial sheath and outer dense fibers (ODFs) that surround the axoneme, a 9+2 arrangement of microtubules, while the principal piece contains a different accessory structure called the fibrous sheath and ODFs surrounding the axoneme. In contrast, the endpiece contains no accessory structures but the axoneme. Abnormal formation of these flagellar structures could lead to male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nsota Mbango et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are membraneless electron-dense structures that assemble through liquidâliquid phase separation and play critical roles in spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eddy, 1974</xref>). Among the RNP granules, intermitochondrial cement (IMC) observed in late spermatocytes and the chromatoid body (CB) found in round spermatids are involved in the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meikar et al., 2011</xref>). After meiosis, IMCs are no longer detectable because of mitochondrial dispersion, and CBs become gradually larger in round spermatids. In elongating spermatids, the CBs containing MIWI, the main effector protein of the piRNA pathway, disappear and two other RNP structures called a reticulated body and a CB remnant that contain TSKS, TSSK1, and TSSK2 appear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shang et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, we found that <italic>Tsks</italic> knockout (KO) mice failed to generate reticulated bodies and CB remnants, and were infertile with impaired cytoplasmic removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shimada et al., 2023</xref>), indicating that the formation and disassembly of RNP granules is highly regulated and important for spermiogenesis.</p><p>During spermiogenesis, post-translational modifications of proteins are critical since gene transcription is thought to cease with nuclear condensation. Ubiquitination is one of the post-translational modifications in which a small protein called ubiquitin is attached to target proteins. Ubiquitinated proteins are degraded by a ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is involved in various physiological phenomena in cells, such as cell cycle regulation and signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ciechanover and Schwartz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mani and Gelmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Protein ubiquitination is carried out by a cascade of enzymatic reactions, including ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-binding enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3), and target proteins ubiquitinated by E3 ligase are degraded by a large protein complex called the 26S proteasome. Among the approximately 600 E3 ligase genes estimated to be present in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2008</xref>), the mechanism and functions of ubiquitination mediated by the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) complex has been well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>). The SCF complex consists of several proteins such as SKP1, a cullin protein, an F-box protein, and RBX1, and can ubiquitinate various substrates by using different F-box proteins that recognize distinct substrates. In humans, at least 38 F-box proteins have been identified, but the functions of most F-box proteins remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kipreos and Pagano, 2000</xref>). In this study, we analyzed the function of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> (F-box protein 24), predominantly expressed in testes, and found that FXBO24 is essential for sperm flagellum formation and male fertility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Fbxo24</italic> is expressed predominantly in male germ cells after meiosis and interacts with SKP1</title><p>We performed RT-PCR using cDNAs obtained from multiple mouse tissues and found a specific band for <italic>Fbxo24</italic> in testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To identify stages in which <italic>Fbxo24</italic> was expressed in spermatogenesis, we performed RT-PCR using postnatal mouse testes over time. <italic>Fbxo24</italic> signals increased after birth, with solid signals observed around postnatal day 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) when round spermatids appear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kluin et al., 1982</xref>). Consistent with the RT-PCR results, single-cell transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hermann et al., 2018</xref>) indicates that mouse <italic>Fbxo24</italic> and its human orthologue, <italic>FBXO24</italic>, are expressed during the post-meiotic stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Pairwise sequence alignment of amino acids sequences revealed that FBXO24 is highly conserved between mice and humans (88% amino acid identity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>) with the F-box domains located near the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Because it has been reported that F-box proteins bind to SKP1 via the F-box domain to form the SCF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schulman et al., 2000</xref>), we investigated the interaction of FBXO24 with SKP1 by co-immunoprecipitation using HEK293T cells. We constructed vectors that express FBXO24 tagged with 3ÃFLAG with (wild-type [WT]) or without (ÎF) the F-box domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). When SKP1-1D4 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-1D4 antibody, WT FBXO24-FLAG was co-immunoprecipitated, whereas ÎF FBXO24-FLAG was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, left). Conversely, when an anti-FLAG antibody was used to immunoprecipitate WT or ÎF FBXO24-FLAG, SKP1-1D4 was co-immunoprecipitated only with WT FBXO24-FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, right). These results suggest that FBXO24 could function as a component of the SCF complex in mouse testis, during the post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Fbxo24</italic> is predominantly expressed in testes and essential for male fertility.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RT-PCR of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> in mouse adult tissues. <italic>Fbxo24</italic> is predominantly expressed in the testis.

Previous studies showed that various stresses, such as heat shock, arsenite treatment, or proteasome inhibition, trigger the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs), membraneless granules composed of RNPs. Further, it has been shown that SGs could contain KPNB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang and Tarn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mahboubi et al., 2013</xref>).

We analyzed whether IPO5 can localize to SGs under stress conditions to explore this possibility. We examined the subcellular localization of endogenous IPO5 and KPNB1 in COS7 cells treated with arsenite, an oxidative stress inducer. Immunostaining analyses revealed that IPO5 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm without the stress inducer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>); however, when cells were treated with arsenite, IPO5 was detected not only in the cytoplasm but also in cytoplasmic granules that were colocalized with KPNB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

These results suggest that the primary cause of infertility is impaired sperm migration in the female reproductive tract due to reduced sperm motility. In addition to the abnormal flagellar morphology, <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa could not undergo the acrosome reaction even after the A23187 treatment. We analyzed the amounts of SNARE-related proteins and PLCD4; however, no overt differences were found between the control and <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa. Recently, we found that FER1L5 is important for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent acrosome reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morohoshi et al., 2023</xref>), but no antibodies are available to analyze the amount of FER1L5. It is possible that FER1L5 or unknown proteins involved in the acrosome reaction deteriorated in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa. Alternatively, it is possible that acrosome reaction failure may be caused by impaired sperm capacitation associated with abnormal flagellar structures.</p><p>The TEM analyses observed numerous membraneless electron-dense granules in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO sperm flagella. Although the irregular arrangement of sperm mitochondria has been reported in KO mice of some mitochondria-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shimada et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shimada et al., 2019</xref>), numerous granules have not been observed in these KO spermatozoa. Proteomic analyses revealed that IPO5 and KPNB1 accumulated in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa without significant elevation of mitochondria-associated proteins. The lack of accumulation of KPNA2, which is part of the importin family, also suggests that there is selectivity in the accumulated proteins. Abnormal accumulation of proteins, including IPO5 and KPNB1, may lead to morphological abnormalities in sperm flagella since the SCF complex is critical for protein degradation and consequently regulate various cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>). FBXO24 likely plays a role in catalyzing protein degradation during spermiogenesis. Because we found that FBXO24 could interact with IPO5 in testes and catalyze ubiquitination of IPO5, FBXO24 may degrade IPO5 in the testis. Recently, mice lacking both PSME4 and ECPAS, proteasome-associated proteins, were shown to exhibit impaired male fertility with disorganized mitochondrial sheath, but numerous membraneless granules were not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sato et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that the accumulation of the granules is specific to <italic>Fbxo24</italic> deletion rather than simply caused by proteasome defects.</p><p>In addition to proteins, the total RNA amount increased in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa, suggesting that the abnormal granules observed in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO flagella may consist of RNPs. In germ cells, RNP granules have been well studied and shown to be essential for spermatogeneses, such as IMCs, CBs, reticulated bodies, and CB remnants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chuma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meikar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shimada et al., 2023</xref>). RNP granules are membraneless electron-dense structures that are similar to the abnormal granules in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO; however, the localization of MIWI, an IMC and CB marker, and TSKS, a reticulated body and CB remnant marker, was not disrupted in the KO. These results suggest that electron-dense granules accumulated in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa are different from well-studied RNP granules. SGs are also membraneless electron-dense granules that contain RNPs, which assemble through liquidâliquid phase separation in response to cellular stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Buchan and Parker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Protter and Parker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>). While transient SGs formed in response to oxidative stress or heat shock play roles in translational arrest to ensure cell survival, chronic SGs are relevant to neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marcelo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reineke and Neilson, 2019</xref>). It has been shown that, under arsenite-induced oxidative stress, KPNB1 relocates to SGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang and Tarn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mahboubi et al., 2013</xref>). Because we found that not only KPNB1 but also IPO5 can be recruited to SGs after arsenite or proteasome inhibitor treatment, electron-dense granules observed in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa may be RNP granules consisting of IPO5 and KPNB1. Our results suggest that FBXO24 is responsible for degrading proteins such as IPO5, which may prevent the accumulation of abnormal RNP granules. While this paper was under review, another group reported analyses of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice that exhibit not only disorganized mitochondrial coiling but also abnormal head morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2024</xref>). The differences from our study may be due to different mouse genetic backgrounds. The other group showed that FBXO24 mediates the degradation of MIWI via K48-linked polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2024</xref>). FBXO24 may be involved in the degradation of multiple proteins including IPO5 to support proper spermiogenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, we reveal that numerous RNP granules accumulated in sperm flagella when FBXO24, which is related to the UPS, was depleted. Small numbers of the RNP granules were found even in the control, suggesting that the ability to generate the granules is present in WT testes but may be suppressed by FBXO24. FBXO24 can be a key molecule for understanding the formation and function of the aberrant RNP granules in male fertility. Because amino acid sequences and expression patterns of FBXO24 are conserved, FBXO24 may also play similar roles in human testes.

Other possibility is that AR-related proteins are affected in Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa. Therefore, we analyzed the amounts of AR-related proteins with mass spectrometry (Figure S3C). Although previous studies indicate that the assembly of the SNARE complex is a key event prior to AR [Hutt et al., 2005 (PMID: 15774481); Katafuchi et al., 2000 (PMID: 11066067); Schulz et al., 1997 (PMID: 9356173); Tomes et al., 2002 (PMID: 11884041)], no clear differences were detected for SNARE proteins (Figure S3C and D). PLCD4 that is important for AR Fukami et al., 2001 (PMID: 11340203) was also detected in Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa (Figure S3C). Although we could not find differences in the amounts of AR-related proteins, it is still possible that FER1L5, another AR-related protein [Morohoshi et al., 2023 (PMID: 36696506)] not detected in the mass spectrometry analyses, or AR-related proteins not yet identified are affected in Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa. We added these results and discussion (line 160-166 and 305-312).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) KO sperm are unable to migrate in the female tract, and, more intriguingly, they do not pass through the utero-tubal junction (UTJ).

The body of experimental evidence that the authors present is extraordinarily strong in both breadth and depth. The authors investigate the protein's functions in male germ cells and sperm using a wide variety of approaches but focusing predominantly on their novel mouse model featuring deletion of the Fbxo24 gene and its product. Using this mouse, and a cross of it with another model that expresses reporters in the head and midpiece, they logically build from one experiment to the next. Together, their data show that this protein is involved in the regulation of membraneless electron-dense structures; loss of FBXO24 led to an accumulation of these materials and defects in the sperm flagellum and fertilizing ability. Interestingly, the authors found that several of the best-known components of electron-dense ribonucleoprotein granules that are found in the intermitochondrial cement and chromatoid body were not disrupted in the Fbxo24 knockout, suggesting that the electron-dense material and these structures are not all the same, and the biology is more complicated than some might have thought. They found evidence for the most changes in IPO5 and KPNB1, and biochemical evidence that FBXO24 and IPO5 could interact.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the summary comment of reviewer #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors are to be commended for the thoroughness of their experimental approaches and the extent to which they investigated impacts on sperm function and potential biochemical mechanisms. Very briefly, they start by showing that the Fbxo24 message is present in spermatids and that the protein can interact with SKP1, in a way that is dependent on its F-box domain. This points toward a potential function in protein degradation. To test this, they next made the knockout mouse, validated it, and found the males to be sterile, although capable of plugging a female. Looking at the sperm, they identified a number of ultrastructural and morphological abnormalities, which they looked at in high resolution using TEM. They also cross their model with RBGS mice so that they have reporters in both the acrosome and mitochondria. The authors test a variety of sperm functions, including motility parameters, ability to fertilize by IVF, cumulus-free IVF, zona-free-IVF, and ICSI. They found that ICSI could rescue the knockout but not other assisted reproductive technologies. Defects in male fertility likely resulted from motility disruption and failure to get through the utero-tubal junction but defects in acrosome exocytosis also were noted. The authors performed thorough investigations including both targeted and unbiased approaches such as mass spectrometry. These enabled them to show that although the loss of the FBXO24 protein led to more RNA and elevated levels of some proteins, it did not change others that were previously identified in the electron-dense RNP material.</p><p>The manuscript will be highly significant in the field because the exact functions of the electron-dense RNP materials have remained somewhat elusive for decades. Much progress has been made in the past 15 years but this work shows that the situation is more complex than previously recognized. The results show critical impacts of protein degradation in the differentiation process that enables sperm to change from non-descript round cells into highly polarized and compartmentalized mature sperm, with an equally highly compartmentalized flagellum. This manuscript also sets a high bar for the field in terms of how thorough it is, which reveals wide-ranging impacts on processes such as mitochondrial compaction and arrangement in the midpiece, the correct building of the major cytoskeletal elements in the flagellum, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive comment of reviewer #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are no real weaknesses in the manuscript that result from anything in the control of the authors. They attempted to rescue the knockout by expressing a FLAG-tagged Fbxo24 transgene, but that did not rescue the phenotype, either because of inappropriate levels/timing/location of expression, or because of interference by the tag. They also could not make anti-FBXO24 that worked for coimmunoprecipitation experiments, so relied on the FLAG epitope, an approach that successfully showed co-IP with IPO5 and SKP1.</p></disp-quote><p>We could not rescue the phenotype with Fbxo24-FLAG transgene, but different Fbxo24 mutant mice show the same phenotypes (Figure S6G).

However, the provided data do not substantiate this claim. To provide conclusive evidence to support the current title, the authors need to present evidence supporting: (1) direct degradation of IPO5 and KPNB1 by FBXO24; (2) the direct requirement of IPO5 for the formation of the membraneless granules, and (3) infertility resulting from the presence of membraneless granules, rather than other issues such as abnormal ODF and AX.</p></disp-quote><p>(1) direct degradation of IPO5 and KPNB1 by FBXO24.</p><p>To examine if IPO5 can be degraded by FBXO24, we performed a ubiquitination assay using HEK293T cells. Ubiquitination of IPO5 was upregulated in the presence of WT FBXO24 but not with the mutant ÎF-box FBXO24, suggesting that IPO5 can be ubiquitinated by FBXO24. We did not examine the ubiquitination of KPNB1 because we failed to construct a plasmid vector expressing mouse KPNB1. We think that KPNB1 is not the substrate because we did not detect the interaction between FBXO24 and KPNB1 (Figure 5E). We added the results of the ubiquitination assay (Figure 5F and line 261-265) and mentioned it in the abstract (line 35).</p><p>(2) the direct requirement of IPO5 for the formation of the membraneless granules.</p><p>(3) infertility resulting from the presence of membraneless granules, rather than other issues such as abnormal ODF and AX.</p><p>We revealed that IPO5 aggregate under stress condition in COS7 cells (Figure 6C and D); however, we did not examine whether IPO5 is required for the formation of the membraneless granules. We consider that protein degradation systems such as PROTAC or Trim-Away to knockdown IPO5 at the protein level in Fbxo24 KO mice could be a good way to see if the membraneless granules are diminished and male fertility is rescued. However, it takes time to apply the degradation systems in vivo. Therefore, we would like to leave this rescue experiment for future studies. We fixed the title and abstract (line 37-38), and removed the last sentence of the introduction.</p><p>Also, the other group reported the analyses of Fbxo24 KO mice [Li et al., 2024 (PMID: 38470475)] right after we submitted our manuscript to the eLife. They reported not only disorganized flagellar structures but also abnormal head morphology, which may lead to male infertility. The differences from our study may be due to different mouse genetic backgrounds. We mentioned it in the discussion section (line 348-353).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>(1) The authors claimed a significant increase in the total amount of RNAs in Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa (lines 259-261), suggesting that the ...contain RNAs.

However, because we did not show direct evidence that electron-dense structures contain RNAs, we removed the sentences (line 259-261 of the 1st submission manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The author should provide an explanation for the absence of a FLAG band in the input Tg in Figure 5D and the larger size of the IPO5 band in the FLAG-IP group compared to the input.
