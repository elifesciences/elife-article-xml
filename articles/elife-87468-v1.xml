double-strand break. However, the structural characterization of MCM8/9 for DNA binding/unwinding remains unclear. Here, we report structures of the MCM8/9 complex using cryo-electron microscopy single particle analysis. The structures reveal that MCM8/9 is arranged into a heterohexamer through a threefold symmetry axis, creating a central channel that accommodates DNA. Multiple characteristic hairpins from the N-terminal oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide (OB) domains of MCM8/9 protrude into the central channel and serve to unwind the duplex DNA. When activated by HROB, the structure of MCM8/9’s N-tier ring converts its symmetry from <italic>C3</italic> to <italic>C1</italic> with a conformational change that expands the MCM8/9’s trimer interface. Moreover, our structural dynamic analyses revealed that the flexible C-tier ring exhibited rotary motions relative to the N-tier ring, which is required for the unwinding ability of MCM8/9. In summary, our structural and biochemistry study provides a basis for understanding the DNA unwinding mechanism of MCM8/9 helicase in homologous recombination.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MCM8/9</kwd><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd><kwd>HROB</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>DNA unwinding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019341</institution-id><institution>Shenzhen Scientific and Technological Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JCYJ20200109142412265</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yingfang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100017621</institution-id><institution>Shenzhen Key Laboratory Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZDSYS20220606100803007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yingfang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019341</institution-id><institution>Shenzhen Scientific and Technological Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RCBS20200714114922284</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weng</surname><given-names>Zhuangfeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016691</institution-id><institution>Pearl River Talent Plan of Guangdong</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019ZT08Y464</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yingfang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32000860</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weng</surname><given-names>Zhuangfeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFE0210000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yingfang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32271321</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weng</surname><given-names>Zhuangfeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003453</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023A1515010245</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weng</surname><given-names>Zhuangfeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The hexametric structures of MCM8/9, revealed through cryo-electron microscopy single particle analysis, provide a foundational understanding of its helicase activity and offer novel insights into its mechanistic role.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA helicases play critical roles in multiple cellular processes including DNA replication, transcription, recombination, and repair. Dysfunction of multiple DNA helicases has been correlated with various human diseases including cancers, Bloom Syndrome, Werner Syndrome, Fanconi Anemia, reproductive deficiencies, and infertility, <italic>etc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brosh and Matson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heyer et al., 2010</xref>). One of the most extensively studied subfamilies of DNA helicases is the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins. In the human genome, the MCM family contains two subgroups of AAA+ ATPase/helicase complexes, consisting of eight MCM members (MCM2-9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maiorano et al., 2006</xref>). Structural studies of these complexes are critical for elucidating their mechanisms.</p><p>The hexameric MCM2-7 complex, also known as a replicative helicase, play a vital role in the initiation and elongation of eukaryotic chromosome replication. Previous structural and biochemical studies have revealed that the MCM2-7 complex exhibits high structural flexibility during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yuan and Li, 2020</xref>). It can adopt multiple conformations by interacting with its loaders and activators to form different intermediates, including the helicase-loading intermediate Orc-Cdc6-Cdt1-MCM2-7 (OCCM), the inactive MCM2-7 Double Hexamer (DH) and the active replicative helicase complex Cdc45-MCM2-7-GINS (CMG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abid Ali et al., 2016</xref>). For loading onto DNA, the apo MCM2-7 hexamer first binds to the licensing factor Cdt1. In the presence of ATP, the initiators ORC and Cdc6 assemble on the origin DNA to form an active loading platform and load the Cdt1-bound MCM2-7 onto DNA to form the OCCM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yuan and Li, 2020</xref>). The origin DNA is encircled into the central channel of the MCM2-7 hexamer via the MCM2-MCM5 entry ‘gate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Samel et al., 2014</xref>). While ATP hydrolysis occurs in OCCM, it seems that Cdt1, Cdc6, and ORC are released in sequential disassembly steps, and then the first loaded MCM2-7 encircling DNA recruits a second ORC-Cdc6 complex, which in turn loads the second Cdt1-bound MCM2-7 to form a head-to-head MCM2-7 DH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yuan and Li, 2020</xref>). During double-hexamer assembly, the N-tier ring of MCM2-7 rotates by nearly 30° when aligned with the MCM2-7 hexamer in its loading intermediate OCCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Noguchi et al., 2017</xref>). As the MCM2-7 double hexamer on DNA is inactive, lots of regulators along with the helicase activators Cdc45 and GINS complex, are required to convert the double hexamer into two activated CMG replicative helicases that translocate along the leading strands with a bi-directional replication mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Georgescu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eickhoff et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>). The aforementioned structural studies have also revealed that layers of characteristic hairpin loops inside the chamber of MCM2-7 hexamer, including the helix-2 insertion loops (H2I), the presensor-1 (PS1) as well as β-turn motifs of oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide (OB) domains, contribute to DNA binding and separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Slaymaker and Chen, 2012</xref>). Additionally, another allosteric communication loop (ACL) conserved in all MCM helicases was also found to be important for helicase activity. The ACL mediates inter-subunit interactions between the N-terminal DNA processing domain and the C-terminal AAA+ motor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sakakibara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>MCM8 and MCM9 make up the other helicase complex, which is the homolog of MCM2-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast to the replicative helicase MCM2-7, MCM8 and MCM9 function as a DNA helicase complex (MCM8/9) in HR-mediated DNA repair for DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lutzmann et al., 2012</xref>). Several studies have suggested that cells lacking <italic>MCM8</italic> and <italic>MCM9</italic> are highly sensitive to DNA cross-linking reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morii et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McKinzey et al., 2021</xref>). The <italic>MCM8</italic> and <italic>MCM9</italic> knock-out mice were found to be sterile and revealed gametogenesis deficiency as well as chromosomal damage due to impaired HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lutzmann et al., 2012</xref>). During HR repair, MCM8/9 was rapidly recruited to the DNA damage sites and colocalized with the recombinase Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2013</xref>). It also interacted with the nuclease complex MRN (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1), which was required for DNA resection at DSBs to facilitate HR repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, HROB (also known as C17orf53 or MCM8IP) has been identified as an essential factor in loading the MCM8/9 complex to the sites of DNA damage and stimulating its helicase activity to promote replication fork progression during DNA recombination and replication. Loss of HROB led to HR defects because it is necessary for the recruitment and activation of MCM8/9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hustedt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). The HROB harbors a flexible N-terminal domain (NTD), a central proline-rich region (PRR) and an OB-fold domain at the C-terminus. It was reported that the MCM8/9 binding motif (MBM) is embedded in the PRR region and binds to the NTD domains of MCM8/9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). Although progress has been made in understanding the role of MCM8/9 HR during the past decade, the structure-function relationship, especially the structural characterization of MCM8/9 helicase activity, remains unknown. Notably, MCM8/9 is composed of two subunits, MCM8 and MCM9. It is challenging to extrapolate its role through a simple comparison with MCM2-7, which consists of six subunits.</p><p>MCM8 and MCM9 proteins are structurally similar, with an MCM domain at the N-terminus (NTD) and an AAA+ ATPase domain at the C-terminus (CTD). The NTD and CTD are connected by flexible linkers (N-C linkers), which allow the movement of the AAA+ domain during unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brewster et al., 2008</xref>). The NTDs of MCM8 and MCM9 share an analogous domain organization and can be divided into three domains: the zinc finger domain (ZF), the helical domain (HD), and the OB domain. In addition to the AAA+ ATPase domain, MCM8 possesses an additional WHD domain in the CTD while MCM9 contains a putative helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain and an extensional C-tail at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Griffin and Trakselis, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the previous study, we reported a 6.6 Å cryo-EM structure of the human MCM8/9 (hMCM8/9) NTD ring. We also analyzed the crystal structures of MCM8 and MCM9 NTDs separately, which exhibited conformational changes when assembled into the MCM8/9 hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2021</xref>). However, the low-resolution structure of the MCM8/9 NTD ring is insufficient to fully illustrate the assembly and activation mechanisms of the MCM8/9 hexamer. Here, we present a near-atomic resolution structure of the chicken MCM8/9 (gMCM8/9) complex and a 3.95 Å cryo-EM structure of the human MCM8/9 NTD ring under HROB induction. Based on these structures, we conducted further investigation on the structural features of the DNA-binding region of MCM8/9 and the conformational changes required for its activation by HROB. Our structural and biochemical studies shed light on the structural and functional relationship of the MCM8/9 helicase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall structure of the gMCM8/9 helicase complex</title><p>As our previous study shows the hMCM8/9 helicase complex is unstable for high-resolution structure determination, we first solved the cryo-EM structure of the MCM8/9 complex from <italic>Gallus gallus</italic>.

The trimerization of the gMCM8/9 heterodimer is in line with our previously reported hMCM8/9 structure at 6.6 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2021</xref>). When we performed structural superposition, the NTD ring of gMCM8/9 superimposes well onto that of hMCM8/9, indicating that eukaryotic MCM8 and MCM9 form a conserved hexamer complex during evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). The diameter of the NTD ring is ~132 Å and that of the inner channel is ~28 Å which is large enough to accommodate dsDNA to pass through (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and S5). The assembly pattern of the gMCM8/9 complex with a threefold (<italic>C3</italic>) symmetry axis is unique among MCM helicases. It arranges the three MCM8 and three MCM9 in the same planes, enclosing a channel with multiple symmetrical hairpins. This assembly pattern differs from that of the eukaryotic MCM2-7 heterohexamer with non-symmetry and the archaeal MCM homohexamer with sixfold symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fletcher et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, a distinguishing feature of the gMCM8/9 is that the helical domain of gMCM8 contains a long α5 helix that protrudes around the hexameric ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The domain structures of gMCM8/9’s, including the MCM domains, the AAA+ motor domains, and the WH domain, fit well into their electron density maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). For each gMCM8/9 heterodimer, the positions of characteristic hairpin loops of MCM helicase, such as H2I, PS1, OB hairpins (referred to as OB-hps), and the ACL were well defined. Among them, the OB-hps extend to the central channel, while the ACLs are close to the H2I and PS1 hairpins within the AAA+ domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The assembly of gMCM8 and gMCM9 in the NTD ring</title><p>As our structural analysis revealed that the gMCM8/9 hexamer is the trimerization of the MCM8/9 heterodimer, this leads to the formation of three dimer interfaces within each MCM8/9 heterodimer and three putative trimer interfaces between each neighboring MCM8/9 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The high-resolution structure of the gMCM8/9 NTD ring allows us to analyze these two types of interfaces in detail, which serve as the structural basis of MCM8/9 assembly.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The assembly analysis of the gMCM8/9 N-terminal domain (NTD) ring.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The cutoff structure of the gMCM8/9 NTD presents in the cartoon.

Both the polar and hydrophobic interactions between respective β-strands are responsible for the binding of the MCM8/9 dimer. For example, the side chains of R220<sub>gMCM9</sub> and Q248<sub>gMCM9</sub> form hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl groups in the main chains of I172<sub>gMCM8</sub> and T226<sub>gMCM8,</sub> respectively. In addition, the main chain of T119<sub>gMCM9</sub> also forms a hydrogen bond with the neighboring carbonyl group in the side chain of D228<sub>gMCM8</sub>. Furthermore, the benzene ring of F253<sub>gMCM9</sub> inserts into a hydrophobic pocket surrounded by residues L179, P217, F181, L201, and Y199 from gMCM8 and W250 from gMCM9, which further stabilize the interaction between gMCM8 and gMCM9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>Compared to the strong interaction between the dimer interface, the interaction within the trimer interface is weaker. The trimer interface is dominated by electrostatic interaction and hydrogen-bonding interactions. The side chain of R152<sub>gMCM8</sub> forms salt bridges with both the side chains of D200<sub>gMCM9</sub> and D232<sub>gMCM9</sub>. In addition, the side chain of K158<sub>gMCM8</sub> forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of E37<sub>gMCM9</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Based on the preceding analysis, we assume that opening a ‘gate’ on the trimer interface for DNA loading will be easier than on the dimer interface. Taken together, these interactions facilitate and stabilize the assembly of the NTD hexameric ring of gMCM8/9.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Structural comparison of MCM8/9 and MCM2-7</title><p>To explore the functional state of gMCM8/9, we performed structural comparisons between gMCM8/9 and various MCM2-7-containing complexes. We first compared the gMCM8/9 structure with MCM2-7 in the OCCM complex by aligning their respective C-tier rings. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the NTDs of gMCM8/9 fit well with those of MCM7, MCM3, and MCM5, but rotated slightly in the following MCM2, MCM6 and MCM4. This minor variation is due to the opening ‘gate’ of the MCM5-MCM2 interface in the OCCM complex. When superimposing the hexameric gMCM8/9 complex onto one hexamer of the MCM2-7 DH, we found that the two C-tier rings aligned well while their N-tier rings had a ~30° clockwise rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Such rotation could be caused by the two hexameric complex’s different assembly patterns. A more plausible explanation is that the assembly of the MCM2-7 DH induces the conformational change in its N-tier ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Noguchi et al., 2017</xref>). We also compared the gMCM8/9 structure with that of MCM2-7 in the apo CMG complex and found that the NTD ring has a similar translation and rotation but slighter than in comparison with MCM2-7 DH (data not shown). As the NTD ring of MCM2-7 that transits from the DH to the CMG just requires a small domain translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>). Overall, our structure of gMCM8/9 was conformationally similar to the structure of the MCM2-7 complex in its loading intermediate OCCM rather than that in the DH. This is also consistent with previous findings that the recombinant MCM8/9 complex alone exhibited limited helicase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we presume the current structure of gMCM8/9 may represent a loading state of MCM8/9 helicase.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Structural comparison of gMCM8/9 with MCM2-7-containing intermediates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The gMCM8/9 hexamer (green cyan and slate) was aligned to the MCM2-7 hexamer (light pink) from the Orc-Cdc6-Cdt1-MCM2-7 (OCCM) complex.

Unfortunately, the density map of HROB-CTD was not observed in the reconstruction.

We also found that the structure of the hMCM8/9 NTD ring underwent a large conformational change when compared to the previously described hMCM8/9 NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2021</xref>). As a result, the two conformations were designated as Conformation I (hMCM8/9 NTD at 6.6 Å) and Conformation II (hMCM8/9 NTD at 3.95 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). In line with our observation, when superimposed these two conformations of hMCM8/9 NTD, we found that one of the trimer interfaces in Conformation II was expanded by ~5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This expansion further pushed its neighboring MCM8/9 heterodimers to shift to either side.

The three OB-hp of gMCM8 form the upper layer and the three gMCM9 OB-hp comprise the lower layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Importantly, the tip of the gMCM8 OB-hp contains several positively charged residues (K337, K339, K342) while the gMCM9 OB-hp contains continuous polar residues (H254, Q255, D256) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), which are conserved in hMCM8/9 (R345, K347, K350 in hMCM8 and Q252, Q253, D254 in hMCM9).

However, the hMCM8 ACL mutant (hMCM8_E295R) corresponding to that in mtMCM had no significant change even in the presence of HROB, implying that the MCM8’s NTD doesn’t interact with its CTD directly through ACL hairpins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, H</xref>).

We found that MCM8 and MCM9 form a single heterohexameric ring with a centric channel that allows the DNA to pass through. The OB hairpin loops within the centric channel may be involved in interacting with and separating substrate DNA. The N-C linkers of MCM8/9 play important roles in helicase activity. Notably, the regulator HROB induces a conformational change of the MCM8/9 NTD ring, which may underlie the helicase activation.</p><p>MCM8/9 and MCM2-7 are both MCM proteins with highly conserved domain organization and sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maiorano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maiorano et al., 2005</xref>). Compared with the heterohexameric structure of MCM2-7, the MCM8/9 hexamer is arranged in an alternate mode with the threefold symmetry axis. Interestingly, it was reported that the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> helicase DnaB also exists in a quaternary state with <italic>C3</italic> or <italic>C6</italic> symmetry and can change the symmetry states reversibly depending on the pH value of the buffers or the presence of nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Donate et al., 2000</xref>). It has been proposed that the symmetry transition plays a role in the loading of regulators on DNA and is directly linked to DNA translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Núñez-Ramírez et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, we doubt that MCM8/9 changes its symmetry from <italic>C3</italic> to <italic>C1</italic> symmetry in the presence of HROB. In other words, helicases may orchestrate the inner channels by controlling the relative positions of subunits, assisting in DNA loading and unwinding.</p><p>Taking inspiration from the structural and unwinding mechanisms of MCM2-7, we also investigated the key elements of MCM8/9 involved in DNA interaction or separation. In the central channel of the MCM2-7 complex, several structural elements involved in DNA binding and strand separation were illustrated by a series of CMG structures complexed with different types of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yuan and Li, 2020</xref>). According to recent research, the OB hairpin loops of MCM3, MCM4, MCM6, and MCM7 form ‘dam-and-diversion tunnel’ to block and divert the lagging strand from the leading strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yuan and Li, 2020</xref>). For the MCM8/9 complex, the OB-hps of MCM8 and MCM9 are essential for DNA unwinding. They form a two-layered structure with threefold symmetry. In which, three OB-hps of MCM9 form the upper layer, while three OB-hps of MCM8 form the lower layer, suggesting a synergistic mechanism for MCM8/9 OB hairpins to interact with DNA. When modeled a forked DNA into the channel, the OB-hp loops make very close contact with the DNA strand that passes through the channel, capable of inserting their loops into the major or minor grooves of the DNA in a sequential manner. While in the Conformation II of hMCM8/9 NTD ring, the OB-hps of hMCM8 and hMCM9 lose their <italic>C3</italic> symmetry without significant conformational change. This symmetry transition could be caused by HROB while inducing trimer interface expansion. In addition, the highly conserved residue F363 from the OB hairpin loop of MCM7 serves as a strand separation pin to unwind forked DNA via making a π-π interaction with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baretić et al., 2020</xref>). The highly conserved phenylalanine was also found on the OB-hps of MCM8 and MCM9 (F353 of hMCM8, F251 of hMCM9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). They will most likely perform functions similar to those found in MCM2-7.</p><p>We also present a new conformation (Conformation II) of the MCM8/9 NTD ring induced by HROB, which may enhance the DNA binding ability of the MCM8/9 complex. We found that when MCM8/9 is complexed with the CTD domain of HROB, it becomes more stable and exhibits significantly higher helicase activity. The HROB CTD domain is about 20 kDa and is composed of a flexible loop and an OB-fold domain. The flexible loop containing ~20 amino acids is sufficient to interact with the MCM8/9 complex, but it alone is unable to stimulate the helicase activity of MCM8/9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). Our helicase assay demonstrated that the OB-fold domain of HROB is required for MCM8/9 activation. The OB-fold domain is a nucleic acid-binding motif that likely help to load the DNA into the central channel of MCM8/9. Induced by HROB, the structure of the MCM8/9 NTD ring convert its <italic>C3</italic> symmetry to <italic>C1,</italic> and two of the MCM8/9 heterodimers translate and tilt following the expansion of the trimer interface. When the MCM2-7 double hexamer encircles the double-stranded origin DNA, the MCM5-MCM2 interface characterizes as a ‘gate’ that undergoes open and closed conformation change to engage the DNA entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Samel et al., 2014</xref>). The expansion of the MCM8/9 trimer interface may involve a transient conformation state to facilitate the DNA entry into the inner channel of the MCM8/9 hexamer. Thus, HROB not only aids in the loading of DNA into MCM8/9, but also acts as an activator, collaborating with MCM8/9 to promote DNA unwinding.</p><p>Benefiting from the rapid development of cryo-electron microscopy technology over the past decade, a dozen structures of MCM2-7-containing intermediates have been resolved including the OCCM, DH, and CMG with/ without DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yuan and Li, 2020</xref>). Based on these structures, the hand-over-hand rotary mode and the ‘dam-and-diversion tunnel’ model had been proposed for MCM2-7 helicase in DNA translocation and unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yuan and Li, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eickhoff et al., 2019</xref>). For MCM8/9 helicase, there is currently no established model to describe its unwinding mechanism. Here, our structural and biochemical studies have provided some hints in this regard. First of all, the structural dynamics analysis reveals that the MCM8/9 CTD ring rotates relative to the NTD ring. Second, the length of the MCM8 and MCM9 N-C linkers are surprisingly much longer than those of the MCM2-7 complex, which may permit the rotations of MCM8/9. The fact that single-site structure-guided mutations on the ACL loops have no effect on the helicase activity of MCM8/9 further supports the idea that the N-C linkers, rather than the ACL loop, mediated the interaction between the N-tier ring and the C-tier ring of MCM8/9. Last but not least, HROB can convert inactive MCM8/9 into an active helicase by recruiting and inducing a conformational change in the MCM8/9 NTD ring.</p><p>Although a rotary model is in sight and our findings also hint at a distinct unwinding mechanism of MCM8/9, many questions remain unsolved. The most pressing issue is that the type of DNA substrate unwound by MCM8/9 is unknown. In vivo sequencing and in vitro DNA binding results are required to screen appropriate substrates. Furthermore, as the HROB only stimulates ~60% of the MCM8/9 helicase in vitro, we believe that other regulators remain to be discover for the full activation of MCM8/9 helicase. Based on these results, the high-resolution structures of MCM8/9 with DNA in the presence of ADP or ATP are necessary to fully clarify the unwinding mechanism of MCM8/9. Despite these limitations, the MCM8/9 complex structures provided in this study will be a rich source of information for further research into the mechanism of DNA helicase in homologous recombination, as well as for the analysis of multiple disease mutations in MCM8/9 associated with premature ovarian failure as well as cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>The human MCM8/9 genes were obtained by reverse transcription of mRNA from HeLa cells.

The proteins were expressed in <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> (BTI-Tn5B1–4, Hi5) insect cells for 60 hr at 27 °C before harvesting. The cell pellet was collected by centrifugation at 800 × g and then freshly frozen by liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C before use. For purification, the cell pellet was resuspended with lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 350 mM KCl, 50 mM sodium glutamate, 10% glycerol, and 30 mM imidazole) and lysed by cell homogenizer (Avestin Emulsiflex C3). Then the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was mixed with nickel-NTA resin (Novagen) and was continuously stirred for 1 hr at 4 °C for adequate binding. The beads were then collected into a column and extensively washed with lysis buffer to remove undesired proteins. Target proteins were then eluted down with elution buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 80 mM KCl, 20 mM sodium glutamate, 5% glycerol, and 300 mM imidazole).

The bacteria solution was firstly cultured at 37 °C until the OD600 ≈ 0.8 and then cooled down to 16 °C. The expression of recombinant protein was induced by IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside) at a concentration of 0.2 mmol/L and kept expressing for another 20 hr. Subsequently, the cells were harvested and disrupted by a high-pressure cell homogenizer in lysing buffer. After centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with nickel-NTA beads and retained for 1 hr at 4 °C with rolling. Before elution, the SUMO tag was cleaved by Ulp Protease and finally, the HROB-CTD protein was eluted in the buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 80 mM KCl, 20 mM sodium glutamate, 5% glycerol. Following Ni-NTA affinity purification, the eluted protein was further purified by HiTrap Heparin HP 5 ml column (GE Healthcare) and size exclusion chromatography (HiLoadTM16/600 Superdex TM pg, GE Healthcare) in the same buffer using hMCM8/9.

A total of 2,134,191 particles were automatically picked by the template picker and 1,574,821 particles were produced after the inspect particle picks treatment. Three parallel runs of 2D classification (K=100) were performed using the data (binned 4) with a box size of 256 pixels. A small subset of the ‘good’ particles with clear secondary-structure features was selected from 2D classification results and was used to generate four initial models.

Four resolution gradient templates generated from non-uniform refinement were used for the multi-reference heterogeneous refinement, resulting in a 4.31 Å global reconstruction (290,080 particles) renamed consensus map. The NTD map was improved to 3.73 Å with local refinement followed by applying a tight N-terminal mask with <italic>C3</italic> symmetry. Local CTF refinement further improved the resolution to 3.66 Å.

To support the conclusion, the authors should show that the mutant proteins form the hexamer without problems. Otherwise, it is conceivable that the mutant proteins are flawed in complex formation. If that is the case, the authors cannot conclude that these motifs are vital for the helicase function.</p><p>A weakness of this paper is that the authors have already reported the structure of MCM8/9NTD utilizing human proteins (Li et al. Structure, 2021). Although they succeeded in revealing the high-resolution structure of MCM8/9-NTD with the chicken proteins in this study, the two structures are extremely comparable (Figure S2), and the interaction surfaces seem to be the same (Figure 2).</p><p>Another weakness of this paper is that the presented data cannot fully elucidate the mechanistic insights into how MCM8/9 functions as a helicase for two reasons. (1) The presented structures solely depict DNA unbound forms. It is critical to reveal the structure of a DNA-bound form. (2) The MCM8/9 activator, HROB, is not visible in the structural data. Even though HROB caused a conformational change in MCM8/9-NTD, it is critical to visualize the structure of an MCM8/9HROB complex.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments on our work. Regarding the first weakness mentioned above, the previously reported cryo-EM structure of hMCM8/9 NTD ring was achieved with a resolution of 6.6 Å. At this level of resolution, we were only able to observe the overall shape of the structure and a partial representation of the protein's secondary structure. It is hard for us to discern any specific details regarding the interaction interface between MCM8 and MCM9. In this study, we solved the structure of gMCM8/9 NTD ring with a resolution of 3.67 Å. We believe that the higher resolution of gMCM8/9 NTD structure provides a significant advantage in analyzing the interaction surface between MCM8 and MCM9. This improved resolution has enabled us to gain valuable insights into the assembly mechanism of the MCM8/9 hexamer, representing a significant step forward in our understanding of the MCM8/9 helicase complex.In response to the second weakness raised by the reviewer, we fully agree with the reviewer that high-resolution structures of the MCM8/9 complex with DNA or HROB are necessary to elucidate the mechanism of this helicase complex. We are actively working towards obtaining these complex structures using cryo-EM and X-ray crystal diffraction.</p><p>Moreover, we would like to address the reviewer's concern regarding the mutant proteins used in the in vitro helicase assays. We have conducted additional experiments to confirm that these mutant proteins do not impair the formation of the MCM8/9 hexamer. Specifically, we performed size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analyses of the wild-type (WT) MCM8/9 complex, as well as MCM8 and MCM9 mutant proteins (Author response image 1). The results demonstrated that all the proteins behaved consistently and displayed similar SEC profiles during the purification process. Notably, the N-C linker deletion mutant (hMCM8_Δ369-377+MCM9_Δ283-287) combining the MCM8 and MCM9 N-C linker deletions also behaved similarly with WT MCM8/9 (Author response image 2). These findings strongly suggest that the mutations in the OB-hps regions and the N-C linkers do not disrupt the hexamer formation of the MCM8/9 complex. Author response image 1 and Author response image 2 have been included into the supplementary figure S8 and S11, respectively.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>SEC profiles of WT and OB-hps mutants of MCM8/9 complex.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87468-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>SEC profiles of WT and N-C linker mutant of MCM8/9 complex.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87468-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I would like to provide some suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1. Throughout the manuscript, more density map data obtained by the cryo-EM should be shown for accurate evaluation of the data. For example, in Figure 1C, the authors state that inner channel of the gMCM8-9 hexamer is ~28 angstrom, apparently based on the ribbon model. This is not appropriate because the space upon ribbon model is not same as that upon the density map. For Figure 1B, they state that &quot;The domain structures of gMCM8-9 fit well into their electron map&quot;. If so, please show the actual docking data. Also for Figure 2, the docking presentation between the side chains in the ribbon model and the density map should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer for the constructive suggestions. In addition to releasing our structural data in the EMDB and PDB, we have also followed the reviewer’s suggestions to included more density map data in the supplementary material. In fact, when calculating the dimeter of the inner channel of the MCM8/9 hexamer, we also measured that upon the density map (Author response image 3. A and B), which is consistent with our report in our manuscript. To further evaluate the structure of MCM8/9, we have included additional docking structures based on the density map (Author response image 3. C-F).

To avoid re-annealing, the reaction was supplemented with a 100-fold unlabeled oligonucleotide. The reactions were then incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and stopped by adding 1 µl of stop buffer (0.4% SDS, 30 mM EDTA, and 6% glycerol) and 1µl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml, Sigma) into the reaction for another 10 min incubation at 37 °C. The products were separated by 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1× TBE buffer and analyzed by the Amersham typhoon (Cytiva).</p><p>In addition, to describe the expression of Flag-hMCM8/9 complex in Figure 4C, we have included the Pull-Down Assay in the “Material and Methods” section. The description is as follow: The HEK293T cells transfected with Flag-hMCM8/9-FL or Flag-hMCM8/9-NTD were cultured overnight and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cell pellets were resuspended with lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 04693132001)). After incubation for 45 min at 4°C with gentle agitation, the whole-cell lysates were collected by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 15 min, at 4 °C). GST beads coupled with 2 μg GST-HROB or GST alone were then incubated with an equal volume of above HEK293T cell lysates at 4°C for 4h. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer. Proteins bound to the beads were separated by SDS–PAGE and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-Flag antibody (Cytiva).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure 3C: This is just an assumed model. Please clearly state it in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We guess the reviewer is referring to Figure 5C. As Figure 3C depicts the top view of the gMCM8/9 hexamer structurally aligned with the MCM2-7 double hexamer (wheat) by aligning their respective C-tier ring. On the other hand, Figure 5C represents an assumed model where we docked a forked DNA fragment into the central channel of the gMCM8/9 hexamer. To address this assumed model, we have made thefollowing clarification in the revised manuscript: “We artificially docked a forked DNA into the central channel to generate a gMCM8/9-DNA model and found that the OB-hps of gMCM8 are capable to closely contact with it and insert their highly positively charged terminal loops into the major or minor grooves of the DNA strand, implying that they could be involved in substrateDNA processing and/or unwinding (Figure 5C)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure S1, C and D: The coloring of the gMCM8-9 CTD appears to show higher resolution than the NTD. May this be mispresentation?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's valuable feedback, and we have thoroughly re-evaluated Figure S1C and D. At the beginning, the local resolution distributions of the gMCM8/9 NTD and gMCM8/9 CTD were calculated using CryoSPARC. Upon re-examination, we found that the density maps of the gMCM8/9 CTD may be lower than 3.66 Å, because the density map of the gMCM8/9 CTD does not reveal more structural details than what is observed in the gMCM8/9 NTD. Thus, although the map shown in Figure S1D may appear to show a greater distribution of high-resolution regions., we would like to clarify that this discrepancy could be attributed to an optical illusion. We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

In response to this feedback, we would like to clarify the resolution estimation process for the gMCM8/9 CTD. Initially, we calculated the resolution of the gMCM8/9 CTD using the gold standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) method, which yielded a resolution of 3.66 Å. However, upon further analysis, we identified an issue with the GSFSC Resolution curves, which led to an overestimation of the resolution based on the density map of the gMCM8/9 CTD. To ensure a more reliable and accurate estimation, we employed the Phenix software package to calculate the mean resolution during the refinement process of the gMCM8/9 CTD structure. The calculated mean resolution was determined to be 5.21 Å, which aligns more reasonably with the characteristics of the density map. To address any potential misunderstandings and provide clarity, we have explicitly labeled and described the evaluation process for this mean resolution in the &quot;Single particle data processing&quot; section of the Materials and Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>1.

It also interacted with the nuclease complex MRN (MRE11RAD50-NBS1) and was required for DNA resection at DSBs to facilitate the HR repair (Introduction).&quot;</p><p>There is a debate about whether MCM8/9-HROB colocalizes with RAD51 and whether it works upstream or downstream of RAD51 (Park et al. MCB, 2013; Lee et al. Nat Commun., 2015;Lutzmann et al. Mol Cell, 2012; Nishimura et al. Mol Cell, 2012; Natsume et al. G&amp;D, 2017; Hustedt et al. G&amp;D, 2019; Huang et al. Nat Commun., 2020).</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer that previous studies have reported contradictory results regarding to the function of MCM8/9 in homologous recombination. Based on the structure information of MCM8/9, now we do not have direct evidence to resolve the ongoing debate. Nonetheless, based on our findings, we speculate that the MCM8/9 complex is likely involved in multiple steps within the process of homologous recombination. The structural insights provided by our study serve as a foundation for further investigations and may contribute to a better understanding of the complex and multifaceted roles of MCM8/9 in homologous recombination repair.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. I noted that the BioRxiv version 1 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.26.477944v1?versioned=true) contains a near-complete MCM8/9 with human protein based on the crystal analysis. Because its structure is comparable to chicken MCM8/9 revealed by cryo-EM, I highly suggest including this data in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The resolution of the hMCM8/9 crystal structure presented in our previous BioRxiv version is 6.6 Å, which is a little low. Moreover, it cannot provide more information than the present cryo-EM structures of MCM8/9. We are dedicated to optimizing the crystal quality and implementing strategies to enhance the resolution of the structure. We hope to present an improved crystal structure of hMCM8/9 in our forthcoming article.</p></body></sub-article></article>
