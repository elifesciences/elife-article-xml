Despite their evaluation in ongoing clinical trials, gaps remain in the evidence supporting their use. With a panel of patients with lived experiences of stroke, we performed a systematic review of animal models of stroke that administered a CCR5 antagonist and assessed infarct size or behavioural outcomes. MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase were searched. Article screening and data extraction were completed in duplicate. We pooled outcomes using random effects meta-analyses. We assessed risk of bias using the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) tool and alignment with the Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) and Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Roundtable (SRRR) recommendations. Five studies representing 10 experiments were included. CCR5 antagonists reduced infarct volume (standard mean difference −1.02; 95% confidence interval −1.58 to −0.46) when compared to stroke-only controls. Varied timing of CCR5 administration (pre- or post-stroke induction) produced similar benefit. CCR5 antagonists significantly improved 11 of 16 behavioural outcomes reported. High risk of bias was present in all studies and critical knowledge gaps in the preclinical evidence were identified using STAIR/SRRR. CCR5 antagonists demonstrate promise; however, rigorously designed preclinical studies that better align with STAIR/SRRR recommendations and downstream clinical trials are warranted.

Preclinical laboratory experiments on animal models may show potential, however thousands are rejected in the expensive and complicated process of human clinical trials. How should researchers design preclinical experiments to increase the chances of success in later human studies? One possible way is to match the type of evidence used by preclinical researchers with the expectations of clinicians and patients. Improving communication between these groups could ensure that preclinical studies contain experiments that are more relevant to a clinical trial setting.</p><p>With this in mind, Sharif, Jeffers et al. developed criteria for preclinical studies by analyzing multiple studies and collaborating with patient partners with lived experiences of strokes. This allowed the researchers to assess the readiness of a promising class of drugs known as CCR5 antagonists (which are already approved for medical conditions other than stroke) for clinical trials of stroke treatment.</p><p>Specifically, Sharif, Jeffers et al. screened for studies that included preclinical experiments in rats and mice that investigated the effect of CCR5 antagonists on brain recovery after stroke. From these, ten experiments which varied in the drug used, dose, and timing of treatment were compared, showing that in all cases the total area of the brain affected by stroke was reduced by the treatment. The CCR5 antagonists were also effective in treatments applied before or after a stroke event. Throughout the study the researchers worked with patient partners to assess the treatment outcomes that align with patient priorities, concluding that this factor should play a more significant role in the design of preclinical studies.</p><p>Overall, the findings show that CCR5 antagonists could represent a promising treatment for stroke patients and that future preclinical studies should involve patients and clinicians in experimental design to increase the chances of success in human trials. The proposed approach could be used in future studies when assessing which therapies should progress to human trials.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stroke</kwd><kwd>neuroprotection</kwd><kwd>maraviroc</kwd><kwd>preclinical</kwd><kwd>patient engagement</kwd><kwd>CCR5</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008572</institution-id><institution>University of Ottawa</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Social Accountability Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharif</surname><given-names>Ayni</given-names></name><name><surname>Fergusson</surname><given-names>Dean A</given-names></name><name><surname>Lalu</surname><given-names>Manoj M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research - Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CGV-186957</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jeffers</surname><given-names>Matthew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100015630</institution-id><institution>Ottawa Hospital Anesthesia Alternate Funds Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lalu</surname><given-names>Manoj M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000148</institution-id><institution>Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lalu</surname><given-names>Manoj M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CCR5 antagonists show promise for stroke cerebroprotection and recovery, although further preclinical evidence in clinically relevant domains could strengthen support for clinical translation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) is expressed across a variety of leukocyte subtypes, endothelial cells, and cell types in the brain (e.g., neurons, microglia, astrocytes), and is thought to play crucial roles in post-stroke neuroinflammation, blood–brain barrier repair, and neuronal survival/repair processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jing et al., 2023</xref>). CCR5 antagonists have emerged as potential therapeutic candidates for stroke, demonstrating both cerebroprotection and improved neural repair/recovery in preclinical animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takami et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joy et al., 2019</xref>). However, no CCR5 antagonist drug has an approved indication in the stroke context, necessitating studies to establish safety and efficacy this population. This has led to an ongoing clinical trial to investigate efficacy of CCR5 antagonists in combination with post-stroke rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dukelow, 2023</xref>).

Overall, a range of doses and clinically relevant administration times for cerebroprotection were evaluated across a variety of motor and cognitive behavioural domains. All studies tested both behavioural and histological outcomes and demonstrated cerebroprotective effects, but most studies failed to measure and control post-stroke temperature, which could potentially confound the observed cerebroprotection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corbett and Nurse, 1998</xref>). Most histological measurements were also assessed at &lt;72 hr, which could confound the observed cerebroprotective effects if cell death was merely delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corbett and Nurse, 1998</xref>). For CCR5 antagonists as a post-stroke recovery-inducing treatment, one experiment assessed the effects of initiating CCR5 administration in a similar post-stroke phase as the CAMAROS trial. This experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joy et al., 2019</xref>) did not demonstrate that each treatment group had equivalent baseline stroke volumes, which may potentially confound observed behavioural effects. Furthermore, the maximum dose used in mice (100 mg/kg) was not sufficient to attain cerebrospinal fluid levels of maraviroc observed in humans using the CAMAROS dosing regime (mice: 13.8 ± 5.4 ng/ml; humans 33.6–60 ng/ml) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joy et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Areas of concern were identified in all STAIR XI domains assessing ‘preclinical assessment and validation’ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Although adult animals were used in most of the preclinical studies, the reported weights and ages of these animals corresponded to young adults, rather than the aged adults that better represent the stroke population. All experiments used only male rodents that were free of common stroke comorbidities. It was also unclear if behavioural testing was performed during the inactive circadian phase or active (dark) phase, which could result in confounding if CCR5 antagonists affect arousal of animals during their inactive period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">MacLellan et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, none of the studies had their protocols or results directly replicated by an independent laboratory, or across multiple sites in a multilaboratory study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corbett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hunniford et al., 2023</xref>). Regarding stroke recovery, no studies assessed behavioural effects on upper extremity skilled reaching/grasping or potential interactions of CCR5 antagonists with rehabilitative therapies or established recanalization procedures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balbinot et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeffers and Corbett, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeffers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wechsler et al., 2023</xref>). These elements are highly relevant to the CAMAROS trial, as one of the primary outcomes of this trial is upper extremity performance on the Fugl-Meyer and maraviroc administration will be paired with an 8-week exercise program. These findings were supported by the PRIMED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2016</xref>) tool, which resulted in a Readiness for Translation Score of ‘medium’ (on a scale of ‘low’, ‘medium’, and ‘high’). This tool highlighted similar promising elements, as well as weaknesses, as our analysis above (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3 table4">Tables 3 and 4</xref>), identifying the limited preclinical evidence for the effects of CCR5 antagonists in clinically relevant sexes, ages, species, and disease comorbidities, without sufficient dose–response information to inform trials (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref>). Overall, our assessments highlight a variety of knowledge gaps, potential confounding factors, and areas of misalignment between the preclinical evidence and clinical trial parameters that could be improved with further preclinical experimentation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The overall body of preclinical evidence for CCR5 antagonists in stroke demonstrates potential acute cerebroprotection with corresponding impairment reduction, as well as improved functional recovery in the subacute/early chronic phase. Our systematic review also highlights evidence gaps that could impact successful clinical translation of CCR5 antagonists. Our analysis of 10 independent experiments, identified that acute administration of CCR5 antagonists within the first 24-hr post-stroke was associated with a marked reduction in infarct volume. This cerebroprotective reduction of infarct volume did not significantly vary based on treatment dose or any other experimental characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takami et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joy et al., 2019</xref>). Overall, the majority of behavioural effects appeared to be in a positive direction, but the low number of included studies precluded meta-analysis of these results. Indeed, no individual behavioural experiment included more than 10 CCR5-treated animals, and given the wide range of dosages, timings, routes, stroke models, and rodent strains involved, the certainty of these findings is limited and should be interpreted cautiously. Pooling data across heterogenous experimental designs, animal/stroke models, and treatment parameters, as we have done with the infarct volume analysis in the present study, can introduce variability that increases the risk of overestimating or underestimating the true effect of the intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higgins et al., 2023b</xref>). Treatment effects observed across model systems and therapeutic compounds may represent different biological mechanisms. Despite this potential limitation, meta-analysis can provide valuable insights, especially in preclinical settings where the sample sizes of individual studies may be too small to detect significant effects on their own. In these cases, pooling data across studies can help identify overarching estimates of benefits and harm, highlight subgroups of interest, and help guide areas of future research. As described in the results above, we attempted to mitigate the risks of inappropriate data pooling through careful investigation of heterogeneity, subgroup analyses, and differentiation between outcomes where we felt that meta-analytic pooling was (infarct volume) and was not (behavioural outcomes) appropriate. Overall, we believe that our results indicate that further investigation is warranted to determine the optimal timing of administration and behavioural domains under which CCR5 antagonists exhibit the strongest post-stroke cerebroprotective and recovery-inducing effects.</p><p>Despite the positive direction of treatment effects across all studies of CCR5 antagonists, we found a substantial risk of bias in the underlying studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hooijmans et al., 2014</xref>). As is commonly observed in the preclinical literature, all studies either did not adequately report their randomization/blinding methods and exhibited evidence of selective/incomplete reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fergusson et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fergusson et al., 2019a</xref>). Such features are associated with biased overestimations of preclinical treatment efficacy, which raises further concerns about the reliability and validity of the present findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sena et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Macleod et al., 2008</xref>). Future studies should carefully incorporate all elements of the ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines to help ensure that results are transparently reported and improve confidence in the findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Percie du Sert et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Comprehensiveness of the preclinical evidence for CCR5 antagonists was assessed in relation to STAIR and SRRR consensus recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corbett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lyden et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finklestein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fisher et al., 2009</xref>). These recommendations aim to provide investigators and regulators with ‘assurance that the candidate treatment shows signals of efficacy and safety, before embarking on an expensive clinical development program’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lyden et al., 2021</xref>). The included studies provide good initial evidence for acute cerebroprotection, as well as mechanistic and behavioural evidence for enhanced recovery in the late subacute/early chronic post-stroke phase. However, demonstration of efficacy under a wider range of conditions, such as in aged animals, females, animals with stroke-related comorbidities, more clinically relevant timing of dose administrations, or in conjunction with rehabilitative therapies are necessary to provide further confidence in these findings. In addition, all studies used unique doses, timings, and outcomes, so independent replication of the most promising study parameters would further increase certainty in the evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corbett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lyden et al., 2021</xref>). Future preclinical research should aim to address these evidence gaps to further increase the clinical relevance and comprehensiveness of evidence for CCR5 antagonists in stroke.</p><p>In relation to the ongoing CAMAROS trial assessing maraviroc in the subacute post-stroke phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dukelow, 2023</xref>), the most relevant preclinical evidence comes from one experiment within the Joy et al. study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joy et al., 2019</xref>) where maraviroc was initially administered at 3–4 weeks post-stroke and continued daily for 11 weeks. This experiment demonstrated that administration of maraviroc in the late subacute/early chronic post-stroke phase improved functional recovery on the grid walk, but not cylinder, task. These experimental conditions could potentially align with the putative therapeutic window and outcomes of interest being assessed in CAMAROS (e.g., 10-min walk test co-primary outcome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dukelow, 2023</xref>). However, caution is warranted as this pivotal supporting preclinical evidence is based on a low sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 9). Moreover, potential differences in dosing, severity of infarct, concomitant rehabilitative therapy, and other factors discussed above could influence the degree to which these results successfully translate to the clinical environment. Finally, clinically relevant secondary outcomes in the CAMAROS trial, such as cognitive and emotional domains as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Stroke Aphasia Depression Questionnaire (SADQ) were not modelled in the preclinical literature. Although one study included a cognitive outcome, the other treatment parameters of this study were not aligned to the CAMAROS trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). Future preclinical studies should assess a more diverse and comprehensive battery of clinically relevant behavioural tasks, which could be based on the range of outcomes employed in the CAMAROS trial, or those found in the SRRR recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corbett et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, the Joy et al. study provides a plausible biological mechanism and ‘proof of concept’ for how CCR5 antagonism might enhance neuroplasticity that improves functional recovery after stroke.</p><p>Our present synthesis of the preclinical evidence for CCR5 antagonists used novel approaches to increase its utility for assessing certainty of the findings and identification of knowledge gaps. First, we engaged patients with lived experiences of stroke throughout the review process to ensure that our research questions, outcomes, and interpretations aligned with the priorities of the ultimate end-user of stroke research. Second, we incorporated consensus recommendations for both preclinical cerebroprotection and recovery research as an evidence evaluation tool, which we found often aligned with the priorities of our patient panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corbett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lyden et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finklestein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fisher et al., 2009</xref>). This guided assessment of the alignment of preclinical evidence with parameters of ongoing clinical trials, as well as appraisal of comprehensiveness of the preclinical evidence with a focus on translational validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drude et al., 2021</xref>) rather than only internal validity and risk of bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hooijmans et al., 2014</xref>). We also used this method to provide concrete avenues for future preclinical studies to close knowledge gaps and improve certainty in the effects of CCR5 antagonists under clinically relevant experimental conditions. Similar approaches should be considered by future preclinical systematic reviews to improve interpretation of the preclinical evidence from a translational perspective.</p><p>In conclusion, CCR5 antagonists show promise in preclinical studies for stroke cerebroprotection, corresponding reduction in impairment, as well as improved functional recovery related to neural repair in the late subacute/early chronic phase. However, high risk of bias and the limited (or no) evidence in clinically relevant domains underscore the need for more rigorous and transparent preclinical research to further strengthen the current preliminary evidence available in the literature. Addressing these concerns will not only enhance the reliability of preclinical evidence but also better inform the design and execution of clinical trials of CCR5 antagonists, such as the ongoing CAMAROS trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dukelow, 2023</xref>). The integration of expert recommendations, such as STAIR and SRRR, should guide future preclinical investigations and synthesis of the body of preclinical evidence in stroke recovery research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corbett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lyden et al., 2021</xref>). Our present approach serves as a template by which the preclinical evidence supporting translation to clinical trials can be weighed when justifying early clinical trials of novel interventions for stroke cerebroprotection and recovery.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We registered the review protocol on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42023393438) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lalu et al., 2023</xref>).

Monthly meetings occurred with the patients and caregivers to provide educational sessions of background knowledge of preclinical stroke, systematic review conduct, and discuss research findings as the review progressed. We co-developed a terms of reference document a priori to document details of the engagement (i.e., roles, responsibilities, expectations, project goals, etc.). The patient partners co-developed the research question to address patient interests, including chronic stroke recovery (i.e., the panel was particularly interested in evaluating the effects of extended drug administration), consideration of physical therapy in tandem with drug administration, inclusion of stroke-relevant comorbidities, spasticity, and motor and cognitive outcomes.

The search strategy underwent peer-review using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) checklist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGowan et al., 2016</xref>). We searched MEDLINE (OVID interface, including In-Process and Epub Ahead of Print), Web of Science, and Embase (OVID interface). The search was conducted 25 October 2022, to align with the listed launch date of the CAMAROS trial (15 September 2022). Our intention in doing so was to collate and assess all preclinical evidence that could have feasibly informed the clinical trial. We sought to assess the comprehensiveness of evidence and readiness for translation of CCR5 antagonist drugs at the time of their actual translation into human clinical trials, as well as the alignment of the CAMAROS trial design to the existing preclinical evidence base.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Selection process and data collection</title><p>We deduplicated citations and uploaded them into DistillerSR (Evidence Partners, Ottawa, Canada).

authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper is well-organized, with clearly defined sections. The systematic review methodology is thorough, with clear eligibility criteria, search strategy, and data collection methods. The risk of bias assessment is also detailed and useful for evaluating the strength of evidence. The involvement of a patient panel is noticeable and positive, ensuring the research addresses real-world concerns and aligning scientific inquiry with patient perspectives. The statistical approach used for analyzing seems appropriate.</p><p>The authors are encouraged to take into account the following points:</p><p>As the authors have acknowledged, there is a high risk of bias across all included studies, particularly in randomization, selective outcome reporting, and incomplete data, which could be highlighted more explicitly in the paper's discussion section, particularly the potential implications for the generalizability of the results. The authors can also suggest mitigation strategies for future studies (e.g., better randomization, blinding, reporting standards, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to highlight mitigation strategies that will allow preclinical researchers to more transparently report future studies. We have directed readers to ensure reporting in alignment with the ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines for further details on reporting of preclinical studies, as follows in paragraph two of the Discussion, “Future studies should carefully incorporate all elements of the ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines to help ensure that all results are transparently reported and improve confidence in the findings.(41)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>None of the studies include female animals, and the use of young adult animals (instead of aged models) limits the applicability of the findings to the human stroke population, where stroke incidence is higher in older adults and perhaps the gender issue must be included to reflect the translational aspects. The authors can add to the paper's discussion section that perhaps future preclinical studies should include both sexes and aged animals to align better with the clinical population and improve the translation of findings. Another point is the comorbidity. Comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension are prevalent in stroke patients. How can these be considered in preclinical designs? The authors should emphasize the importance of future research incorporating such comorbid models to enhance clinical relevance. None of the studies had independent replication of their findings, which is a key limitation, especially for a field with high translational expectations. This should be highlighted as a critical next step for validating the efficacy of CCR5 antagonists.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these are important evidence gaps to address. Although we highlighted these gaps in paragraph 3 of the Discussion, we have now added a more explicit call to action for researchers to address these gaps at the end of the relevant paragraph as follows, “Future preclinical research should aim to address these evidence gaps to further increase the clinical relevance and comprehensiveness of evidence for CCR5 antagonists in stroke.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The studies accessed limited cognitive outcomes (only one reported a cognitive outcome). Given the importance of cognitive recovery post-stroke, this is a gap to highlight in the discussion. Future studies should include more diverse and comprehensive behavioral assessments, including cognitive and emotional domains, to fully evaluate the therapeutic potential.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded on this important point in paragraph four of the Discussion, which explores the alignment of the preclinical literature to the CAMAROS trial, as follows, “Finally, clinically relevant secondary outcomes in the CAMAROS trial, such as cognitive and emotional domains as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Stroke Aphasia Depression Questionnaire (SADQ) were not modelled in the preclinical literature. Although one study included a cognitive outcome, the other treatment parameters of this study were not aligned to the CAMAROS trial. Future preclinical studies should assess a more diverse and comprehensive battery of clinically relevant behavioural tasks, which could be based on the range of outcomes employed in the CAMAROS trial, or those found in the SRRR recommendations.(9)”</p><p>This addition highlights the lack of supporting preclinical evidence for cognitive recovery post-stroke. We also offer recommendations on discrete ways to address this gap in future preclinical studies by taking inspiration from the outcomes used in CAMAROS as well as the SRRR guidelines used throughout our assessment of the CCR5 literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The timing of CCR5 administration across studies varies widely (from pre-stroke to several days post-stroke) complicating the interpretation and comparison of results. The authors are encouraged to add that future preclinical studies could focus on narrowing the therapeutic window to more clinically relevant time points.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the review and feel that this recommendation is currently captured in paragraph three of our Discussion - “However, demonstration of efficacy under a wider range of conditions, such as in aged animals, females, animals with stroke-related comorbidities, more clinically relevant timing of dose administrations, or in conjunction with rehabilitative therapies are necessary to provide further confidence in these findings.” As mentioned above, we added a new sentence to the end of this paragraph to make it more explicit that these are gaps that should be addressed by future preclinical research. “Future preclinical research should aim to address these evidence gaps to further increase the clinical relevance and comprehensiveness of evidence for CCR5 antagonists in stroke.” We also added the word “clinically” to the original sentence mentioned above to more explicitly align with the reviewer’s recommendation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper identifies some alignment with clinical trials, but there are several gaps, too, particularly in the types of behavioral tests used in preclinical studies versus those in clinical trials. If this systematic review and meta-analysis aim to formulate a set of recommendations for future studies, it is important that the authors also propose specific preclinical behavioral tasks that could better align with clinical measures used in trials, like functional assessments related to human stroke outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we added a sentence to Discussion paragraph four, the comparison to the CAMAROS trial, that provides recommendations as to the behavioural tasks that would be useful to employ in future studies. Namely, “Future preclinical studies should assess a more diverse and comprehensive battery of clinically relevant behavioural tasks, which could be modelled after the range of outcomes employed in the CAMAROS trial, or those found in the SRRR recommendations.(9)” The SRRR recommendations that we reference here provide discrete consensus recommendations for interested readers on behavioural task selection, as well as priority rankings based on rodent species, to better align with clinical measures used in trials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion needs some revisions. It could benefit from an expanded explanation of CCR5's mechanistic role in neuroplasticity and stroke recovery. For instance, linking CCR5 antagonism more closely with molecular pathways related to synaptic repair and remyelination would enhance the quality of the discussion and understanding of the drugs' potential.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided a synthesis of CCR5’s proposed mechanistic roles in the Supplementary Materials, Figure S1 (for a summary pathway diagram), and Table S3 (for a list of potential mechanistic pathways and supporting evidence presented in each paper). Given our focus on study quality and alignment with translational recommendations, we felt that it was more appropriate to not focus on mechanistic elements in the Discussion. Indeed, the appraisal of the quality of support for each potential mechanism was beyond the scope of our present analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the tool is used to assess the risk of bias, it might be helpful to integrate a broader framework for evaluating the quality of included studies. This could include sample size justifications, statistical power analysis, or the use of pre-registration in animal studies. These elements can also introduce bias or minimize those if in place.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree these are important and the SYRCLE risk of bias tool we used addresses many major domains of bias mentioned by the reviewer (e.g., selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias). For example, the SYRCLE item of “selective outcome reporting” domain address pre-registration by asking “Was the study protocol available and were all of the study’s pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes reported in the current manuscript?”. The SYRCLE Risk of Bias tool represents the current state of the art for risk of bias assessment in preclinical systematic reviews and aligns well with similar tools used clinically, such as the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Although the tool does not assess statistical power, we would note that this is considered to be a separate issue from internal validity, and it is the reason this is not even assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool used in clinical systematic reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please also highlight confounding factors that might have influenced the results in the included studies, such as variation in stroke models, dosing regimens, or behavioral assessment methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that exploring potential confounding factors is an important element of the assessment. We highlight potential confounding factors in several parts of the Results and Discussion, such as in our Synthesis of Behavioural Outcomes section, “…equivalent infarct volumes were not demonstrated between the treated and control groups in this cohort, which could potentially lead to confounding effects.” and Comprehensiveness of Preclinical Evidence section, “All studies tested both behavioral and histological outcomes and demonstrated neuroprotective effects, but most studies failed to measure and control post-stroke temperature, which could potentially confound the observed neuroprotection (Table S4).(32) Most histological measurements were also assessed at &lt;72 hours, which could confound the observed neuroprotective effects if cell death was merely delayed.(32) For CCR5 antagonists as a post-stroke recovery-inducing treatment, one experiment assessed the effects of initiating CCR5 administration in a similar post-stroke phase as the CAMAROS trial. This experiment (Joy et al.)(6) did not demonstrate that each treatment group had equivalent baseline stroke volumes, which may potentially confound observed behavioral effects.”</p><p>Although there are many factors that could potentially confound the observed results, we believe that we have addressed some of the most prominent examples that are known in the preclinical stroke literature. We expanded our statement in the final sentence of the Results to highlight this, “Overall, our assessments highlight a variety of knowledge gaps, potential confounding factors, and areas of misalignment between the preclinical evidence and clinical trial parameters that could be improved with further preclinical experimentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is some discussion of the meta-analysis' limitations due to the few studies, but this point could be more thoroughly addressed. Please consider including a more critical discussion of the limitations of pooling data from heterogeneous study designs, stroke models, and outcome measures. What can this lead to? Is it reliable to do so, or does it lack scientific rigor? The authors are encouraged to formulate a balanced discussion adding, positive and negative aspects.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment regarding the limitations related to pooling data from heterogeneous study designs, stroke models, and outcome measures. We have added to the original limitations described in the first paragraph of our Discussion with additional text to provide a better balance about the potential risks and benefits of the meta-analysis strategy that we undertook in the present study.</p><p>“Pooling data across heterogenous experimental designs, animal/stroke models, and treatment parameters, as we have done with the infarct volume analysis in the present study, can introduce variability that increases the risk of overestimating or underestimating the true effect of the intervention.(38) Treatment effects observed across model systems and therapeutic compounds may represent different biological mechanisms. Despite this potential limitation, meta-analysis can provide valuable insights, especially in preclinical settings where the sample sizes of individual studies may be too small to detect significant effects on their own. In these cases, pooling data across studies can help identify overarching estimates of benefits and harm, highlight subgroups of interest, and help guide areas of future research. As described in the results above, we attempted to mitigate the risks of inappropriate data pooling through careful investigation of heterogeneity, subgroup analyses, and differentiation between outcomes where we felt that meta-analytic pooling was (infarct volume) and was not (behavioural outcomes) appropriate. Overall, we believe that our results indicate that further investigation is warranted to determine the optimal timing of administration and behavioral domains under which CCR5 antagonists exhibit the strongest post-stroke neuroprotective and recovery-inducing effects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conclusion should more explicitly acknowledge that while CCR5 antagonists show potential, the findings are still preliminary due to the limitations in the preclinical studies (high bias risk, lack of diverse animal models). Overall, the conclusion can end with a call for rigorous, well-controlled, and replicated studies with improved alignment to clinical populations and trials to show that the conclusion remains inconclusive, considering what has been analyzed here.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified our concluding paragraph to highlight that the current evidence should be considered preliminary, as follows, “In conclusion, CCR5 antagonists show promise in preclinical studies for stroke neuroprotection, corresponding reduction in impairment, as well as improved functional recovery related to neural repair in the late sub-acute/early chronic phase. However, high risk of bias and the limited (or no) evidence in clinically relevant domains underscore the need for more rigorous and transparent preclinical research to further strengthen the current preliminary evidence available in the literature.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting, timely, and high-quality study on the potential neuroprotective capabilities of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonists in ischemic stroke.

Is it possible to screen the recent literature (maybe up to 12/2024) to see whether any additional studies were published?</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following statements to the “Information sources and search strategy” section of Materials and Methods to clarify the timing and intention of our search strategy, “The search was conducted October 25, 2022, to align with the listed launch date of the CAMAROS trial (September 15, 2022). Our intention in doing so was to collate and assess all preclinical evidence that could have feasibly informed the clinical trial. We sought to assess the comprehensiveness of evidence and readiness for translation of CCR5 antagonist drugs at the time of their actual translation into human clinical trials, as well as the alignment of the CAMAROS trial design to the existing preclinical evidence base.”</p><p>Although we agree that an update of the search provides valuable information for the field, we believe that the studies entering the literature after the launch of the CAMAROS trial fill a different conceptual niche than those prior to trial launch (since newer preclinical studies explicitly did not inform decisions to move to clinical trials or clinical trial design). It is our view that newer studies should be assessed from a lens of how effectively they close knowledge gaps that were present at trial launch and emulate the conditions of clinical trial populations and design parameters (which represent the de facto most “clinically relevant” conditions). Such an analysis would require a different approach that is outside the scope and aims of the present study. The present study provides an assessment of the preclinical literature up to the date of the translation of CCR5 antagonist drugs into human clinical trials (via the CAMAROS trial), which we believe will serve as a valuable prospective benchmark for evaluating the predictiveness of preclinical evidence after the results of the CAMAROS trial emerge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Please clearly define the difference between &quot;study&quot; and &quot;experiment,&quot; as this is not entirely clear. Is an &quot;experiment&quot; a distinct investigation within a particular publication (=study) that can describe more than one such &quot;experiment&quot;? Thanks for clarifying.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added definitions for “studies” and “experiments” immediately after the first time they are mentioned in paragraph one of the Study Selection section of Results, as follows: “Herein, “studies” refer to the published articles as a unit, while “experiments” refer to distinct investigations within each published article used to test various hypotheses (i.e., a subunit of “studies” comprised of a select cohort of animals).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Is there an opportunity to conduct a correlation analysis between the quality of a study (for instance, after transforming the ROB assessment into a kind of score) and reported effect sizes for particular experiments or studies? This might be highly interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting suggestion, which under different circumstances could provide insights into potential associations between study quality and effect size, as have been observed in the literature (e.g., Macleod et al., 2008; PMID:18635842). However, we are unable to assess this relationship in the present dataset as all studies were scored as “high risk of bias”, meaning that there was no variability in terms of observed study quality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Minor aspects:</p><p>(1) The scope of the work is perfectly in line with very recent STAIR recommendations, which strongly suggest assessing potential interventions that may augment impact and improve outcomes in recanalization procedures (Wechsler et al., doi: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.123.044279; PMID 37886850). The authors may to discuss their work in light of these recent recommendations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the more recent STAIR recommendation document, as well as its focus on assessing interventions in conjunction with recanalization procedures. An item related to the importance of combining novel interventions with established recanalization procedures was included as part of Table S4 but was not highlighted in the main text. We have added to the final paragraph of the Results section “Comprehensiveness of preclinical evidence” to highlight that no studies tested CCR5 antagonist drugs in conjunction with recanalization procedures as follows, “…no studies assessed behavioural effects on upper extremity skilled reaching / grasping or potential interactions of CCR5 antagonists with rehabilitative therapies or established recanalization procedures (Table S4).(35–38)” The Weschler reference provided by the reviewer has now been cited as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors may wish to consider the term &quot;cerebroprotective&quot; rather than &quot;neuroprotective&quot; unless neurons are the only cells to which a respective statement applies.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that “cerebroprotective” is the more appropriate term and have thus substituted it wherever we previously used “neuroprotective”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The paper features a mixture between American (e.g.,&quot; hemorrhagic&quot;) and British English (e.g., &quot;favours&quot;). Although this is not untypical for Canadian English, deciding on one or the other may be an option.</p></disp-quote><p>Given <italic>eLife</italic>’s basis in the UK, we have modified the language used throughout to be consistent with British English style.</p></body></sub-article></article>
