id="abs1"><title>Background:</title><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome’s (PCOS) main feature is hyperandrogenism, which is linked to a higher risk of metabolic disorders. Gene expression analyses in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle reveal dysregulated metabolic pathways in women with PCOS, but these differences do not necessarily lead to changes in protein levels and biological function.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>To advance our understanding of the molecular alterations in PCOS, we performed global proteomic and phosphorylation site analysis using tandem mass spectrometry, and analyzed gene expression and methylation. Adipose tissue and skeletal muscle were collected at baseline from 10 women with and without PCOS, and in women with PCOS after 5 weeks of treatment with electrical stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Perilipin-1, a protein that typically coats the surface of lipid droplets in adipocytes, was increased whereas proteins involved in muscle contraction and type I muscle fiber function were downregulated in PCOS muscle. Proteins in the thick and thin filaments had many altered phosphorylation sites, indicating differences in protein activity and function. A mouse model was used to corroborate that androgen exposure leads to a shift in muscle fiber type in controls but not in skeletal muscle-specific androgen receptor knockout mice. The upregulated proteins in muscle post treatment were enriched in pathways involved in extracellular matrix organization and wound healing, which may reflect a protective adaptation to repeated contractions and tissue damage due to needling. A similar, albeit less pronounced, upregulation in extracellular matrix organization pathways was also seen in adipose tissue.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our results suggest that hyperandrogenic women with PCOS have higher levels of extra-myocellular lipids and fewer oxidative insulin-sensitive type I muscle fibers. These could be key factors leading to insulin resistance in PCOS muscle while electric stimulation-induced tissue remodeling may be protective.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>Swedish Research Council (2020-02485, 2022-00550, 2020-01463), Novo Nordisk Foundation (NNF22OC0072904), and IngaBritt and Arne Lundberg Foundation.

Although not part of the diagnosis, insulin resistance and abdominal obesity are common and lead to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kakoly et al., 2019</xref>). PCOS affects 8–17% of women worldwide. More than 50% of women with PCOS are overweight or obese, and obesity worsens all symptoms, including insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kakoly et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber and Franks, 2021</xref>). In those with PCOS, obesity is associated with an altered adipose tissue function, increased visceral fat, adipocyte hypertrophy, and lower adiponectin levels compared with BMI-matched controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mannerås-Holm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Villa and Pratley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mannerås-Holm et al., 2014</xref>). In recent independent bidirectional Mendelian studies, obesity is even thought to contribute to or cause the development of PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brower et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Adipose tissue dysfunction also leads to consequences in other metabolic tissues. Overweight/obese women with PCOS are at increased risk of developing lipotoxicity due to increased triglyceride and free fatty acid levels and increased fatty acid uptake into non-adipose cells, including skeletal muscle, which is exacerbated by increased intra-abdominal fat with high lipolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dumesic et al., 2022</xref>). The lipotoxic state in skeletal muscle includes increased expression of genes involved in lipid storage and epigenetic changes, as demonstrated in a PCOS-like sheep model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, excessive uptake and extracellular storage of free fatty acid in skeletal muscle promotes insulin resistance. Moreover, skeletal muscle from women with PCOS exhibits transcriptional, epigenetic, and protein changes associated with insulin resistance, accompanied by an inflammatory, oxidative, and lipotoxic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corbould et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nilsson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stepto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stepto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moreno-Asso et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Several studies show that defects in mRNA expression of mitochondrial function, fat oxidation, and immunometabolic pathways in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle contribute to insulin resistance in women with PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nilsson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stepto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stepto et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, the mechanism underlying the reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in PCOS skeletal muscle likely differs from insulin resistance in BMI-matched controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corbould et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nilsson et al., 2018</xref>). This finding is consistent with the theory that PCOS is a disorder with genetically distinct subtypes of PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dapas et al., 2020</xref>). However, mRNA expression does not always translate to alterations in protein levels and changes in biological function. The first proteomics data on visceral fat and skeletal muscle from severely obese women with PCOS used mass spectrometry of selected protein spots on a 2D gel electrophoresis and were published a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cortón et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montes-Nieto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Insenser et al., 2016</xref>). This method is limited as only a few proteins could be identified. Today, the combination of liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry provides us with thousands of proteins. Recent publications map the proteome in serum, follicular fluid, ovary, and endometrium from women with PCOS, and the proteome in serum may provide new biomarkers for PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulkhalikova et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). We here use a nontargeted quantitative proteomics approach to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle from women with PCOS.</p><p>We have previously shown that electrically stimulated muscle contractions, known as electroacupuncture, improve glucose regulation and decrease androgen levels in overweight/obese women with PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stener-Victorin et al., 2016</xref>). When acupuncture needles are stimulated by low-frequency electrical stimulation, they cause muscle contractions similar to those that occur during exercise. Muscle contractions activate specific physiological signaling pathways, and electrical muscle stimulations and exercise act through partially similar signaling pathways to induce glucose uptake in the acute response to muscle contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benrick et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, long-term intervention with both exercise and electrical stimulation has been shown to improve glucose regulation, promote ovulation, decrease muscle sympathetic nerve activity, and reduce circulating androgens in women with PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stener-Victorin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hutchison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jedel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johansson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stener-Victorin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tiwari et al., 2019</xref>). The molecular mechanisms mediating the effect on adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in response to long-term electrical stimulation remain unclear. Therefore, the second aim is to use proteomics to provide mechanistic explanations for the improved glucose homeostasis in response to long-term electrical stimulation treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study was conducted at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital and the Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden, in accordance with the standards set by the <italic>Declaration of Helsinki</italic>.

Needle biopsies from subcutaneous adipose tissue from the umbilical area and skeletal muscle tissue from vastus lateralis were obtained under local anesthesia (Xylocaine, AstraZeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden), from cases and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The fat biopsies were rinsed with saline before both tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until further analysis. Thereafter, women with PCOS received low-frequency electrical stimulations causing muscle contractions, so called electroacupuncture. Acupuncture needles were placed in somatic segments corresponding to the innervation of the ovaries and pancreas, bilaterally in abdominal muscle, in quadriceps muscles, and in the muscles below the medial side of the knee. Needles were inserted to a depth of 15–40 mm with the aim of reaching the muscles. Needles were connected to an electrical stimulator (CEFAR ACUS 4; Cefar-Compex Scandinavia, Landsbro, Sweden) and stimulated with a low-frequency (2 Hz) electrical signal for 30 min. The intensity was adjusted every 10th minute due to receptor adaptation, with the intention to produce local muscle contractions without pain or discomfort. Treatment was given three times per week over 5 weeks, and the number of treatments varied from 11 to 19. Two sets of needle placements were alternated to avoid soreness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stener-Victorin et al., 2016</xref>).

The changes in protein expression in adipose tissue were small, whereas in skeletal muscle of women with PCOS there was a clear downregulation of proteins involved in muscle contraction. The skeletal muscle contains a mixture of slow-twitch oxidative and fast-twitch glycolytic myofibers, which exhibit different physiological properties. Type I, or red fibers, are slow-twitch fatigue-resistant muscle fibers that have higher mitochondrial and myoglobin content, and are thus more aerobic than type II fast-twitch fibers. Several proteins specific to or known to be highly expressed in type I muscle fibers were consistently downregulated in women with PCOS. These proteins are located in both the thick and the thin filaments of slow-twitch fibers. These data suggest that there are fewer type I fibers, decreased number and/or smaller, in the PCOS muscle. Unfortunately, we were unable to quantify the number of type I fibers in the entire cohort because of the poor quality of the PCOS muscle biopsies and the unavailability of muscle tissue. We also identified several differently phosphorylated sites in proteins located in the thick and thin filaments, indicating a differential protein activity, since phosphorylation can change the activity of a protein.</p><p>Here, we show that the signaling pathway important for the transition between fast and slow fibers was downregulated and that individuals with PCOS had lower expression of myosin heavy chain beta (encoded by <italic>MYH7</italic>), which is specific for slow-twitch oxidative type I fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schiaffino and Reggiani, 2011</xref>). A decrease in type I fibers has been shown in three different androgen-excess rodent models, including this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holmäng et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2019</xref>). This effect on type I fibers was partly protected by the coadministration of the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide. Moreover, mice that lack the AR specifically in skeletal muscle were completely protected against this effect. These findings suggest that exaggerated androgen signaling in skeletal muscle directly affects the muscle fiber-type composition. While we found a lower abundance of type I muscle fiber in muscle-specific AR knockout females, a recent study shows that depleting AR signaling in skeletal muscle does not lead to necrotic fibers, aberrant histology, or changes in key metabolic functions in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghaibour et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, androgen signaling is likely to be important for normal muscle development but may play a different and dose-dependent role in adulthood. Impaired insulin sensitivity in hyperandrogenic animals is associated with fewer type I fibers and increased type II fibers in skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holmäng et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2019</xref>), features expected to result in reduced insulin sensitivity in this tissue as a higher proportion of oxidative type I fibers leads to better insulin responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stuart et al., 2013</xref>). In line with a higher mitochondrial content in type I fibers, there was a lower expression of several mitochondrial matrix proteins: enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase, 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 1, enoyl-CoA delta isomerase 1, hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase, and acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (GO:0005759, q=0.004) in women with PCOS. Moreover, a lower expression of the mitochondrial acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 correlated with a higher HOMA-IR (Spearman’s rho = −0.46, p=0.04), suggesting that an impaired mitochondrial function contributes to insulin resistance. Moreover, a lower proportion of type I fibers correlated with the severity of insulin resistance in subjects with the metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stuart et al., 2013</xref>). Androgens appear to decrease highly oxidative and insulin-sensitive type I muscle fibers and increase glycolytic and less insulin-sensitive type II fibers in non-athletes, further promoting the development of insulin resistance. However, whether these changes in muscle morphology precede or follow the development of insulin resistance in women with PCOS is not known. Moreover, the SERCA2a, which is expressed primarily in slow-twitch skeletal muscle, was less abundant in PCOS muscle. The SERCA2a pump transports calcium ions from the cytosol back to the sarcoplasmic reticulum after muscle contraction to keep the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration at a low level. Its function is closely related to muscle health and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu and Van Remmen, 2021</xref>). There were three sites with lower phosphorylation in SERCA2a, suggesting that lower SERCA2a expression is not only a reflection of decreased type I fibers but also an altered function. Impaired SERCA2 function may lead to increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which in turn can impair force production and mitochondrial function in type I fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu and Van Remmen, 2021</xref>). Although serum androgen levels are positively correlated with athletic performance in female athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bermon et al., 2018</xref>), skeletal muscle contraction and filament sliding pathways were downregulated in muscle biopsies from hyperandrogenic women with overweight/obesity in this study. Thus, androgens may have differential actions on female skeletal muscle function in moderately physically active subjects and female athletes.</p><p>Androgens are mainly produced in the ovaries and adrenal glands but there is also a local production in adipose tissue. In overweight/obese women with PCOS, increased AKR1C3 levels mediated increased testosterone generation from androstenedione in subcutaneous adipose tissue, which enhanced lipid storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O’Reilly et al., 2017</xref>). Higher expression of AKR1C1 and AKR1C3 in PCOS skeletal muscle in this study could increase local synthesis of androgens via the backdoor pathway, and increase androgenic signaling in skeletal muscle.</p><p>The expression of proteins involved in lipid transport and negative regulation of lipid metabolism was increased in the muscles of women with PCOS. Lipid transport was clustered around apolipoproteins C1, C2, and C3. Interestingly, a recent proteomics study shows that serum apolipoprotein C3 levels are higher in insulin-resistant women with PCOS compared to insulin-sensitive women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Could apolipoproteins aid in the deposition of excess fat in skeletal muscle and contribute to lipotoxicity? Fatty acids in skeletal muscle that do not undergo beta-oxidation in the mitochondria inevitably contribute to lipid synthesis. There was indeed a lower expression of various mitochondrial proteins involved in mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase, enoyl-CoA delta isomerase 1, and acyl-CoA thioesterase 11 (R-HSA-77289, q=0.0008) in PCOS muscle. The most important single fate for these fatty acids is triacylglycerol esterification and storage in lipid droplets. Perilipins act largely as a scaffold protein on lipid droplets. Perilipin-1 is localized in the periphery of intramuscular lipids, known as extracellular lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gandolfi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). In pig, muscle perilipin-1 proteins are localized around lipid droplets in mature and developing adipocytes in correspondence with extra-myocellular lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gandolfi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the high expression of peilipin-1 in muscle from women with PCOS is likely a sign of lipotoxicity. Taken together, intramuscular lipid accumulation and type I muscle fiber decline likely contribute to insulin resistance in PCOS muscle.</p><p>PCOS is associated with chronically elevated levels of inflammatory markers in the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Orio et al., 2005</xref>) and low-grade inflammation has been suggested to play a key role in the pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mancini et al., 2021</xref>). We and others have previously shown that many of the significantly enriched gene expression pathways in PCOS muscle are involved in immune responses or are related to immune diseases in muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nilsson et al., 2018</xref>). A distinct pattern was the downregulation of a family of genes named the HLA complex and downregulation of gene sets associated with inflammatory responses in the PCOS muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manti et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, the HLA-B was the most downregulated protein, in line with lower gene expression of HLA-B in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nilsson et al., 2018</xref>). The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish endogenous proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders by making peptide-presenting proteins that are present on the cell surface. When the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign, this will trigger self-destruction of the infected cell. Numerous HLA alleles have been identified as genetic risk factors for autoimmune thyroid disease, which is increased nearly threefold in women with PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zeber-Lubecka and Hennig, 2021</xref>). The co-occurrence of PCOS and autoimmune thyroid disease has led to the suggestion that PCOS itself may be an autoimmune disorder. At the same time, five different immunoglobulins were upregulated, which contributed to the enrichment of immune system pathways.</p><p>In adipose tissue, the difference between groups was small with relatively few differently expressed proteins but several of the proteins with a higher expression play a role in immune system processes including immunoglobulins and HLA-B. Sequestosome-1 is an immunometabolic protein that is both involved in the activation of nuclear factor kappa-B and regulates mitochondrial functionality by modulating the expression of genes underlying mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poon et al., 2021</xref>). Alterations in the immune response and immunometabolic pathways are seen in both muscle and adipose tissue, but whether and how these alterations affect and potentially contribute to the pathophysiology of PCOS remains to be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Electrical stimulation-related proteome changes</title><p>Regular physical exercise improves insulin sensitivity and is the first-line approach to manage both reproductive and metabolic disturbances in those with PCOS and overweight or obesity, but adherence is low. Electrical stimulations inducing contraction could therefore be an alternative way to ameliorate symptoms in women with PCOS, alongside exercise. Transcriptomic changes in response to one single bout of electrical stimulation mimic the response to one bout of exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benrick et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that long-term treatment with electrical stimulation or exercise also triggers overlapping signaling pathways. Five weeks of repeated treatment with electrical stimulation did not alter mRNA expression but increased the expression of several hundred proteins in skeletal muscle and about 50 proteins in adipose tissue. The most pronounced changes in both tissues were mechanisms involved in wound healing such as the increase in ECM formation and enriched pathways for nitric oxide metabolic process and Fc-gamma receptor signaling pathways. Moreover, wound healing and blood coagulation pathways were upregulated in skeletal muscle, suggesting that repeated needling induces small damages in the tissues that trigger a wound healing response. However, increased expression of ECM-related structural components such as collagens and integrins are not only involved in wound healing, but are also increased in response to muscle contractions as previously shown in response to eccentric exercise and repeated electrical stimulation with electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mackey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hyldahl et al., 2015</xref>). We propose that these changes are induced by contraction but we cannot rule out that the ECM-related changes occurred as a direct result of repeated needle insertion. The delayed synthesis of collagens and subsequent strengthening of the ECM structural matrix in response to both exercise and electrical stimulation without needle insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mackey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hyldahl et al., 2015</xref>) supports the idea that contractions induce remodeling of the ECM that may provide protective adaptation to repeated contractions.</p><p>We hypothesized that electrical stimulations mimic the response to repeated exercise. Therefore, we searched for overlap between changes in the proteome following electrical stimulation treatment in this study and a meta-analysis on the exercise-induced proteome in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Padrão et al., 2016</xref>). Seven proteins were changed in both conditions: fibrinogen beta-chain, actin, vimentin, annexin A2, moesin, gelsolin, and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase. Actin, vimentin, and moesin make up structural parts of the cytoskeleton and all proteins are enriched in the GO terms immune system processes (GO:0002376) and positive regulation of metabolic processes (GO:0009893). Current evidence suggests that there are immunometabolic alterations in skeletal muscle from women with PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nilsson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stepto et al., 2020</xref>), and increased expression of the abovementioned proteins could cause contraction-induced changes in the immunometabolic response.</p><p>Repeated treatment with electrical stimulation improves glucose homeostasis and lowers Hba1c in women with PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stener-Victorin et al., 2016</xref>). A not so well-characterized, upregulated pathway involves exocytosis and protein transport, which is of interest with regard to glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation stimulated by AMP kinase (AMPK). The activity of AMPK in muscle increases substantially during contraction and increases glucose transport. AMPK has been linked to at least two mechanisms for the control of vesicle trafficking, namely the regulation of Rab and the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate in the control of GLUT4 translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sylow et al., 2017</xref>). The Rab GTPase-activating proteins TBC1D1 and TBC1D4 are thought to mediate the effects of AMPK on GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport. At present, it is unclear which specific Rab proteins might be regulated by AMPK downstream of TBC1D1 and TBC1D4, but Rab-13 appears to act downstream of TBC1D4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sylow et al., 2017</xref>). Six Rab proteins showed higher expression after electrical stimulation, including Rab-13, making these proteins potential candidates for regulating glucose uptake by electrically stimulated contractions. The proteome in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle did not show differential expression of proteins with well-known metabolic effects that can easily explain the improvement in Hba1c. This could be due to the timepoint when the biopsies were collected, which was within 48 hr of the last treatment when the acute effects of electrical stimulation are no longer present and the long-term changes may be more subtle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Limitations</title><p>The interpretation of the protein expression in this study is limited by the relatively small number of women (n=10/group), the inclusion of only Caucasian women, and a mix of PCOS phenotypes since we used the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria. Moreover, we cannot distinguish whether the identified dysregulated pathways are responses to PCOS or causal effectors. Some may argue that another limitation is the fact that we cannot identify the changes in protein expression in specific cell types, i.e., adipocytes and myocytes, as the biopsies consist of many different cell types and structures, e.g., nerves, immune cells, vessels, and connective tissue. However, this can also be seen as a strength, as no cell acts independently of the cells surrounding it.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings suggest that highly oxidative and insulin-sensitive type I muscle fibers are decreased in PCOS which in combination with more extra-myocellular lipids may be key factors for insulin resistance in PCOS muscle. In adipose tissue, the difference between groups was small. A 5-week treatment with electrical stimulation triggered a wound healing response in both adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. In addition, remodeling of the ECM can provide protective adaptation to repeated skeletal muscle contractions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Clinical trial registration The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NTC01457209).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>The study was conducted at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital and the Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden, in accordance with the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki.

The number of tissue samples analyzed would however do so. Although no functional studies have been done, we do show that hyperandrogenism is associated with a shift towards fewer type I fibers in skeletal muscle. In the revised manuscript we have added data showing that androgens (dihydrotestosterone, DHT) have a direct effect on reducing the number of type I muscle fibers in a PCOS-like mouse model. Prepubertal DHT exposure led to a dramatic decrease in type I fibers, and this effect was partly prevented by the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide (Fig. 4A). Moreover, while skeletal muscle specific AR knockout mice presented with fewer type I muscle fibers, they were protected against the DHT-induced type I muscle fiber loss (Fig. 4B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This study provides the proteomic and phosphoproteomics data for our understanding of the molecular alterations in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle from women with PCOS.

Without a thorough elucidation of the mechanistic underpinnings, the significance and novelty of the study are compromised.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We do provide solid evidence that women with PCOS have a lower expression of proteins specific for type I muscle fibers. A comprehensive exploration of the mechanism driving the observed results is not within the scope of this paper. However, we have included experimental data from a PCOS-like mouse model to strengthen our results that hyperandrogenism has a direct effect on lowering the number of type I fibers. Prepubertal dihydrotestosterone (DHT) exposure led to a dramatic decrease in type I fibers, and this effect was abolished in DHT-exposed mice with skeletal muscle-specific deletion of the androgen receptor (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the decrease in type I fibers was partly prevented by the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide in wild-type mice (Fig. 4A). Notably, unchallenged skeletal muscle specific AR knockout mice had fewer type I muscle fiber.These data indicate that muscle AR signaling is important for normal muscle development, but that exaggerated muscle AR signaling leads to decreased abundance of type I muscle fibers in adult females.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1.

The channels of the images were split and converted into 8-bit. The minimum and maximum thresholds were adjusted and kept constant for all the images. Regions of interest were drawn around the cells and empty space for background intensity measurement. The mean perilipin-1 intensity was measured and corrected by deducting the background. A total of 28 PCOS and 33 control cells were quantified. The quantification of perilipin-1 staining is included in Fig. 2D.

Further exploration and elucidation of the mechanisms involved would greatly enhance the quality and impact of the study. For example, the authors need to provide sufficient evidence to elucidate why PCOS patients exhibit changes in these proteins and phosphorylation sites, as well as how these changes may impact PCOS patients, such as whether they are related to fertility. It would be valuable to provide further mechanistic insights to enhance the scientific rigor of the study.</p><p>I encourage the authors to further refine their research and resubmit the manuscript with a more robust and comprehensive exploration of the mechanistic aspects to strengthen its scientific merit.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: PCOS is characterized by reproductive and metabolic features. Changes in protein expression and phosphorylation sites in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue likely impact metabolic function to a larger degree than fertility. With that said, altered muscle function may affect insulin resistance and inflammation, thereby potentially aggravating reproductive status including ovulatory cyclicity and fertility potential. We found that aldo-keto reductase family 1 members C1 (AKR1C1) and C3 (AKR1C3), which for example can convert androstenedione to testosterone, had a higher expression in skeletal muscle. Expression of AKR1C1 was strongly correlated to higher circulating testosterone levels (Spearman rho=0.65, P=0.002), suggesting that muscle may produce testosterone via the backdoor pathway (added to the second paragraph of the results section). Moreover, a lower expression of the mitochondrial acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 correlated with a higher HOMA-IR (Spearman rho=-0.46, P=0.04), suggesting that an impaired mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation contributes to insulin resistance. There was indeed a lower expression of various mitochondrial matrix proteins, some involved in mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation; enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase; enoyl-CoA delta isomerase 1, and acyl-CoA thioesterase 11 (R-HSA-77289, q=0.0008) in PCOS muscle (this has been added to the discussion).</p><p>A comprehensive exploration of the mechanism driving these changes is not within the scope of this paper. However, we have added data from PCOS-like mice to strengthen the paper. This mouse model supports our hypothesis that androgens drive the shift towards less type I muscle fibers, an effect that can be partly reversed by blocking the androgen receptor with the antagonist flutamide (Fig. 4A). Prepubertal DHT exposure led to a dramatic decrease in type I fibers but this effect was not observed in DHT-exposed mice with skeletal muscle-specific deletion of the androgen receptor (Fig. 4B). These data strongly indicate that AR signaling is driving the decrease in type I muscle fibers in females.</p></body></sub-article></article>
