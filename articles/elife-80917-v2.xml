binding motif that facilitates the transfer of parental histones following DNA replication. Here, we show that Mcm2 is important for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The Mcm2-2A mutation defective in histone binding shows defects in silencing of pluripotent genes and the induction of lineage-specific genes. The defects in the induction of lineage-specific genes in the mutant cells are likely, at least in part, due to reduced binding to Asf1a, a histone chaperone that binds Mcm2 and is important for nucleosome disassembly at bivalent chromatin domains containing repressive H3K27me3 and active H3K4me3 modifications during differentiation. Mcm2 localizes at transcription starting sites and the binding of Mcm2 at gene promoters is disrupted in both Mcm2-2A ES cells and neural precursor cells (NPCs). Reduced Mcm2 binding at bivalent chromatin domains in Mcm2-2A ES cells correlates with decreased chromatin accessibility at corresponding sites in NPCs. Together, our studies reveal a novel function of Mcm2 in ES cell differentiation, likely through manipulating chromatin landscapes at bivalent chromatin domains.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mouse ES cell differentiation</kwd><kwd>parental histone transfer</kwd><kwd>neural differentiation</kwd><kwd>Mcm2</kwd><kwd>bivalent chromatin domains</kwd><kwd>chromatin accessibility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35118015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhiguo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mcm2 promotes mouse embryonic stem cells differentiation through manipulating chromatin landscapes at bivalent chromatin domains.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Embryonic stem (ES) cells (ESCs) are pluripotent cells that possess both the ability to self-renew and the potential to differentiate into lineage-specific cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Los Angeles et al., 2015</xref>). The ability of ESCs to differentiate into specific lineage cell type both in vivo and in vitro opens exciting opportunities to study the events regulating the earliest stages of lineage specification during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keller, 2005</xref>). During mouse ESC differentiation, pluripotency genes such as <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Sox2,</italic> and <italic>Nanog</italic> are silenced, whereas lineage-specific genes are up-regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sha and Boyer, 2008</xref>). These dynamic changes in gene expression are regulated by transcription factors as well as chromatin factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Young, 2011</xref>). For instance, the silencing of pluripotency genes (<italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Sox2,</italic> and <italic>Nanog</italic>) is associated with both a dramatic reduction of tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), a histone modification associated with active gene transcription, and an increase in H3K27me3, a repressive histone modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atlasi and Stunnenberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, the promoters of lineage-specific genes, which are marked by both repressive H3K27me3 and active H3K4me3 marks, needs to be resolved for silencing and/or induction of lineage-specific genes during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harikumar and Meshorer, 2015</xref>). Although significant processes have been made to understand these dynamic changes in chromatin states during differentiation, the regulation of these dynamic changes remains underexplored.</p><p>Histone chaperones, a group of proteins best known for their roles in the assembly of DNA into nucleosomes following DNA replication and gene transcription, have been found to play multiple roles in stem cell maintenance and differentiation. For instance, chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1), a histone chaperone involved in the deposition of newly synthesized H3-H4 onto replicating DNA, is important for cell fate maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishiuchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith and Stillman, 1989</xref>). Depletion of subunits of the CAF-1 complex in embryonic fibroblasts results in increased reprogramming efficiency into iPSC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheloufi et al., 2015</xref>). In ESCs, CAF-1 depletion leads to an increase in the percentage of 2C-like cells (2-cell-stage embryos), as well as defects in differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishiuchi et al., 2015</xref>). The role of CAF-1 in differentiation and the 2C-like state is linked to the function of CAF-1 in DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly. In contrast, Asf1a, a histone chaperone involved in the delivery of newly synthesized H3-H4 to CAF-1 in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly, as well as to HIRA, a histone chaperone involved in replication-independent (RI) nucleosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Koning et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">English et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>), regulates the disassembly of nucleosomes at bivalent chromatin domains for the induction of lineage-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, histone chaperone CAF-1 promotes the formation of H3K27me3-mediated silencing at pluripotent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>), whereas HIRA facilitates the PRC2 silencing complex at developmental loci during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banaszynski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ray-Gallet et al., 2002</xref>). The H3.3-HIRA pathway also safeguards identities of differentiated cells, indicating its bimodal role in cell fate transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fang et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, histone chaperones involved in deposition of newly synthesized H3-H4 play multiple roles in ESC differentiation and maintenance.</p><p>In addition to histone chaperones involved in the deposition of newly synthesized histones, we and others have also uncovered a group of proteins that function in recycling parental histone H3-H4 following DNA replication. Pole3 and Pole4, two subunits of leading strand DNA polymerase ε, interact with H3-H4 and facilitate the transfer of parental histones to leading strands of DNA replication forks in both yeast and mouse ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, Mcm2, a subunit of the minichromosome maintenance proteins 2–7 (Mcm2-7) complex that plays an essential role in DNA replication as the replicative helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tye, 1999</xref>), contains a histone binding domain (HBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). Mutations at HBDs (Y81A and Y90A) of Mcm2 (Mcm2-2A) in both yeast and mouse ESCs leads to defects in the transfer of parental histones to lagging strands of DNA replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Petryk et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, Mcm2 interacts with Asf1 that is bridged by H3-H4 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Groth et al., 2007</xref>). Besides its functions in DNA replication and histone deposition, Mcm2 also interacts with the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA Pol II in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, and the Mcm2-7 complex is required for RNA Pol II-mediated transcription at some settings in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Snyder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yankulov et al., 1999</xref>), indicating a possible role of Mcm2 in gene transcription.</p><p>Mouse ESCs with deletion of Pole3 and Pole4 or mutations at the HBD of Mcm2 grow normally and maintain stemness. As parental histones with their histone modifications are the blueprint for the recapitulation of the epigenetic landscape during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corpet and Almouzni, 2009</xref>), we investigated the roles of these parental histone chaperone proteins during differentiation of mouse ESCs. We found that Mcm2, relying on its HBD, promotes mouse ESC differentiation. The Mcm2-2A mutant ESCs show defects both in silencing of pluripotent genes and induction of lineage-specific genes during differentiation. The defects in induction of lineage-specific genes are associated with reduced Asf1a binding in Mcm2-2A mutant cells. Mcm2 localizes at transcription starting sites (TSS) and that this localization is dramatically reduced in Mcm2-2A cells, which correlates with reduced chromatin accessibility at bivalent chromatin domains during differentiation. Together, these studies reveal a novel role for Mcm2 and its ability to bind H3-H4 in the differentiation of mouse ESCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mcm2, Pole3, and Pole4 are required for the differentiation of mouse ESCs</title><p>CAF-1, Asf1a, and HIRA are histone chaperones involved in deposition of newly synthesized H3-H4, whereas Mcm2, Pole3, and Pole4 are involved in parental histone transfer and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Serra-Cardona and Zhang, 2018</xref>). It is known that CAF-1, Asf1a, and HIRA function in stem cell differentiation through distinct mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banaszynski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheloufi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore asked whether histone chaperones involved in parental histone transfer are also important in this process. To do this, we first monitored the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs), which mimics the formation of three germ layers in vitro, in Pole3 KO, Pole4 KO, Mcm2-2A single and double mutant mouse ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Briefly, three-dimensional colonies (EBs) were formed in hanging drops without leukemia inhibiting factor (LIF) for 3 days. Then, EBs were cultured in suspension and collected at different times during differentiation for the evaluation of morphology and expression of selected genes involved in stemness and lineage specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mcm2-2A mutation in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) impairs differentiation.</title><p>See also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>.

We found that Mcm2-2A mutant and WT cells showed similarly low frequencies of 2C-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), indicating that ESC plasticity is not altered in Mcm2-2A mutant cells. Together, these results suggest that the ability of Mcm2 to bind histone H3-H4 plays an important role during mouse ESC differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mcm2-2A mutation compromises mouse ESC differentiation into neural lineages</title><p>To further study the function of Mcm2 and Pole4 during ESC differentiation, we differentiated WT, Mcm2-2A, and Pole4 KO single and double mutant ESCs into neural lineage cells as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2018</xref>).

Interestingly, from day 7 to day 9, we observed a dramatic loss of GFP expression in WT cells, whereas ~30% of Mcm2-2A cells preserved GFP signals at day 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Accordingly, we detected higher expression level of Pou5f1 and Nanog proteins in Mcm2-2A cells compared to WT cells after differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Finally, Mcm2-2A cells upon differentiation did not exhibit neural cell morphology like WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), providing additional support to the idea that the Mcm2-2A mutation compromises the differentiation of mouse ESCs.</p><p>Next, we tested whether exogenous expression of Mcm2 might rescue defects in differentiation of Mcm2-2A mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Upon differentiation, we observed that the Mcm2-2A mutant cells expressing WT Mcm2 exhibited typical neural cell morphology similar to that of neural precursor cells (NPCs) generated from WT ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Gene expression analysis by RT-PCR indicated that expression of WT Mcm2 in Mcm2-2A cells led to silencing of <italic>Pou5f1</italic> to a similar degree as WT cells. Interestingly, expression of Mcm2 partially rescued the defects in the expression of lineage-specific genes in Mcm2-2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These results indicate that defects in differentiation in Mcm2-2A mutant cells can be at least partially rescued by the expression of Mcm2 exogenously.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mcm2 and Asf1a function in the same pathway for the induction of lineage-specific genes</title><p>Mcm2 interacts with histone chaperone Asf1, which is bridged by H3-H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). Consequently, the Mcm2-Asf1 interaction is reduced in Mcm2-2A cells. We have shown that deletion of Asf1a, but not Asf1b, in mouse ESCs impairs the induction of lineage-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). To understand how Mcm2-2A affects differentiation, we first overexpressed Asf1a in Mcm2-2A cells and found that Asf1a overexpression could not rescue the defects in differentiation of Mcm2-2A cells based on analysis of cell morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>) and the expression of <italic>Pou5f1</italic> and lineage-specific genes (<italic>Sox21</italic> and <italic>Pax6</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). Next, we knocked out Asf1a in either WT cells or Mcm2-2A mutant cells using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F, G</xref>) and compared the effects of Asf1a KO, Mcm2-2A, and Mcm2-2A Asf1a KO on neural differentiation. We observed that Mcm2-2A Asf1a KO double mutant exhibited similar morphology as Mcm2-2A cells but not Asf1a KO cells after differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H</xref>). As reported, Asf1a KO dramatically reduced the induction of lineage-specific genes, while having little effects on the silencing of <italic>Pou5f1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, both Mcm2-2A cell line and Mcm2-2A Asf1a KO double mutant cell line showed compromised silencing of <italic>Pou5f1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2I</xref>). On the other hand, while significant defects in the induction of neural lineage gene expression (<italic>Pax6</italic> and <italic>Sox21</italic>) were detected in either Mcm2-2A cells or Asf1a KO cells, Mcm2-2A Asf1a KO double mutant cells did not show additional defects in the induction of lineage-specific genes compared with Mcm2-2A or Asf1a KO single mutant alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2I</xref>), Interestingly, we observed that Mcm2-2A mutant suppressed the defects in the induction of another neural lineage marker, <italic>Zfpm2</italic> in Asf1a KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2I</xref>). These results indicate that Mcm2 likely have two roles during differentiation, silencing of pluripotent genes and induction of lineage-specific genes, the latter of which is mediated, at least in part, through Mcm2-H3-H4-Asf1a interaction. This idea was further supported by transcriptome analysis described below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mcm2-2A mutation perturbs transcription globally during differentiation</title><p>To understand how the Mcm2-2A mutation affects ESC differentiation, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and analyzed the transcriptome of WT and Mcm2-2A mouse ESCs as well as NPCs collected on day 9 of neural differentiation. In general, the Mcm2-2A mutation caused greater gene expression changes in NPCs than in ESCs, with 54 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between WT and Mcm2-2A ESCs and 609 DEGs between WT and Mcm2-2A NPCs (false discovery rate&lt;0.01, |log2 fold change|&gt;1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), providing an explanation for the observation that the Mcm2-2A mutation does not affect stemness or proliferation of mouse ESCs dramatically. Inspection of RNA-seq data confirmed that the silencing of pluripotency gene <italic>Pou5f1</italic> as well as the induction of two neural lineage genes (<italic>Sox21</italic> and <italic>Pax6</italic>) in Mcm2-2A NPCs was compromised compared to WT NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Unsupervised cluster analysis separated the 648 DEGs identified in Mcm2-2A cells into four groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of 352 down-regulated genes in Mcm2-2A NPCs were enriched in neurodevelopment, such as forebrain/hindbrain development and neural nucleus development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), whereas 238 up-regulated genes compared to WT ESCs were related to stem cell population maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Of note, the differential effects of Mcm2-2A mutant on the expression of genes in NPCs compared to ESCs likely reflect the role of Mcm2 in the differentiation process, but not necessarily due to differential effects of Mcm2 on ESCs and NPCs. Nonetheless, the Mcm2-2A mutation shows defects in both silencing of pluripotent genes and the induction of lineage-specific genes during differentiation, which in turn contributes to the differentiation defects observed in the mutant cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Effects of Mcm2-2A mutation on gene transcription in embryonic stem (ES) cells and in neural precursor cells (NPCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between wild type and Mcm2-2A mutant ES cells (left) and NPCs (right) from two independent replicates, with numbers of significantly up-regulated and down-regulated genes (red dots, p&lt;0.01, |log2 fold change|&gt;1) shown.

Furthermore, the genes whose expression affected by Asf1a KO did not overlap with those affected by Mcm2-2A mutations in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>, ), suggesting that Asf1a likely affects gene expression in ESCs independent of Mcm2. Interestingly, we observed that most of the down-regulated genes in Mcm2-2A mutant NPCs (62% of total), which represent those genes showing defects in induction compared to WT NPC, were overlapped with the down-regulated genes in Asf1a KO NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and most of these genes were bivalent genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

These results support the idea that Mcm2 and Asf1a function together for the induction of lineage-specific genes expression during differentiation. Collectively, these results suggest that Mcm2’s function in promoting ESC differentiation is partially dependent on Asf1a. However, Mcm2 and Asf1a also have independent roles in gene regulation, with Mcm2, but not Asf1a, participating in the silencing of pluripotency genes during differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Mcm2-2A mutation disrupts the epigenetic landscape in differentiated cells</title><p>During differentiation, histone modification landscapes are rewired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</xref>).

Initial studies of Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN using antibodies against Mcm2 or against the Flag epitope fused to Mcm2 and Mcm2-2A proteins in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2022</xref>) indicate that Mcm2 antibody and Flag antibody CUT&amp;RUN profiles, each of which had two independent repeats, were highly correlated with each other. Using p=0.0001 as a cutoff, we identified 13742 Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks in WT ESCs, demonstrating the reproducibility and reliability of Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN datasets. These peaks likely reflect Mcm2 association with chromatin because control samples (IgG CUT&amp;RUN or Flag CUT&amp;RUN in untagged cells) identified far fewer peaks with the same cutoff, with a large fraction of these peaks did not overlap with Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks or Flag-Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). We also noticed the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio for the Mcm2 and Flag-Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks. Once loaded on chromatin during G1 phase of the cell cycle, it is known that the CMG helicase travels along with DNA replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Prioleau and MacAlpine, 2016</xref>). On the other hand, Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN experiments were performed using asynchronous ESCs. Therefore, the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio of Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks likely reflect the dynamic nature of chromatin binding of the CMG helicase during the cell cycle progression. Nonetheless, because of low signal-to-noise ratio, cautions should be made for the interpretation of Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN results described below.</p><p>To gain insight into these Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks, we aligned and clustered these Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks based on their overlaps with H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 CUT&amp;RUN signals and ATAC-seq peaks in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We observed that the majority of Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks were enriched with H3K4me3 CUT&amp;RUN signals and ATAC-seq peaks. A small number of Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks were found at bivalent chromatin domains (H3K4me3+ and H3K27me3+), with far fewer peaks co-localizing with H3K27me3 markers (H3K4me3-, H3K27me3+) in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, left). However, when taking into consideration of total number of H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and bivalent domains in ESCs, we observed that over 26% bivalent domains had at least one Mcm2 peaks nearby compared with 21% H3K4me3 peaks having a Mcm2 peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We also performed similar analysis on 2686 of Mcm2 peaks identified in WT NPCs and observed that almost all the Mcm2 peaks co-localized with H3K4me3 and ATAC-seq peaks (H3K4me3+, H3K27me3-) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right).

Most of these Mcm2 reduced peaks occurred at active promoters and bivalent chromatin regions, whereas increased peaks showed no specific enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Because of dramatic changes of Mcm2 localization in both Mcm2-2A ESCs and NPCs, we first asked whether the changes of Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks in ESCs correlated with those in NPCs. We observed that at the reduced Mcm2 peaks in Mcm2-2A NPCs, Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN density in Mcm2-2A ESCs was also dramatically decreased compared to WT ESCs, whereas at increased Mcm2-2A CUT&amp;RUN peaks in Mcm2-2A NPCs, Mcm2 density in Mcm2-2A ESCs was higher than in WT ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

This finding suggests that the reduced association of Mcm2 with chromatin in Mcm2-2A ESCs likely contributes to the reduced expression of these genes during differentiation to NPCs. Taken together, these results indicate that Mcm2 localizes at the TSS of actively transcribed regions in both ESCs and NPCs and that the histone binding of Mcm2 is important for its chromatin binding in ESCs and NPCs. Furthermore, the reduced chromatin binding of Mcm2-2A in ESCs, while having minor effects on gene expression in ESCs, may render these genes susceptible to deregulation during differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Mcm2 facilitates chromatin accessibility during mouse ESC differentiation</title><p>The landscape of chromatin accessibility dynamically changes during the development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Trevino et al., 2020</xref>).

Because Mcm2 peaks in ESCs can be classified into four groups based on their co-localization with H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, we analyzed ATAC-seq signals at each group in WT and Mcm2-2A ESCs and NPCs. In ESCs, while Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN density in Mcm2-2A mutant cells was reduced in all four groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>), ATAC-seq signals were slightly reduced in Group 2 (H3K4me3+, H3K27me3-) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>), suggesting that the reduced Mcm2 binding does not affect chromatin accessibility dramatically.

The N-terminus of Mcm2 contains a conserved histone binding motif that interacts with H3-H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). Mutations at this histone binding motif (Mcm2-2A) that impair Mcm2’s ability to bind H3-H4 lead to a dramatic enrichment of parental H3-H4 at leading strands compared to lagging strands of DNA replication forks during early S phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Petryk et al., 2018</xref>). Using two different in vitro differentiation assays, we observed that Mcm2-2A mutant mouse ESCs, while growing normally, showed dramatic defects during differentiation. Furthermore, we found that the Mcm2-2A mutation induces global changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and histone modifications during differentiation. Together, these studies reveal a novel role of Mcm2, through its interaction with H3-H4, during differentiation.</p><p>Previously, we have shown that deletion of two histone chaperones involved in deposition of newly synthesized H3-H4, Asf1a and the p150 subunit of the CAF-1 complex, also impairs differentiation of mouse ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). Compared to CAF-1 p150 KO and Asf1a KO cells, the Mcm2-2A mutation exhibited distinct defects in differentiation. p150 KO mutant ESCs show defects in both the silencing of pluripotent genes and induction of lineage-specific genes during differentiation, with defects in the former much more pronounced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, Asf1a KO ESCs minimally impact the silencing of pluripotent genes and dramatically affect the induction of lineage-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). Silencing of pluripotent genes and induction of lineage-specific genes are both defective in Mcm2-2A cells, with the defects in the latter more pronounced. These results suggest that CAF-1, Mcm2, and Asf1a likely perform non-overlapping functions during differentiation.</p><p>First, our results indicate that Mcm2 and Asf1a function in the same pathway for the induction of lineage-specific genes. For instance, we found that Mcm2-2A Asf1a KO double mutant cells showed similar defects in induction of lineage-specific gene as Mcm2-2A and Asf1a KO single mutant alone, suggesting that Mcm2 and Asf1a function in the same pathway for the induction of lineage-specific genes during differentiation. Second, transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq indicate that a large fraction of genes defective in induction during differentiation were overlapped between Mcm2-2A and Asf1a KO cells. Previously, it has been shown that Asf1 interacts with Mcm2 and this interaction, bridged by H3-H4, is reduced in Mcm2-2A mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, we found that Asf1a is important to resolve bivalent chromatin domains through its ability for nucleosome disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this idea, chromatin accessibility at bivalent chromatin domains is reduced the most in Mcm2-2A mutant cells during differentiation, and this reduction is linked to the reduced Mcm2 at bivalent chromatin domains in ESCs, indicating that in addition to its role in parental histone transfer, Mcm2 also has a role in dynamic changes in chromatin during cell fate transition. Therefore, we suggest that Mcm2 and Asf1a function together at bivalent chromatin domains for the induction of lineage-specific genes during differentiation.</p><p>Second, our results indicate that Mcm2-2A mutant ESCs also show defects in differentiation in Asf1a-independent manner. For instance, silencing of pluripotent genes such as <italic>Pou5f1</italic> and <italic>Nanog</italic> was defective in Mcm2-2A, but not Asf1a KO cells. Furthermore, Mcm2-2A Asf1a KO double mutant cells also display defects in silencing of <italic>Pou5f1</italic> similar to Mcm2-2A cells. In addition to reduced binding to Asf1a, Mcm2-2A mutant cells are also defective in the transfer of parental H3-H4 to lagging strands of DNA replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Petryk et al., 2018</xref>) in ESCs. Therefore, the defects in silencing of pluripotent genes in Mcm2-2A mutant cells may be due to defects in the recycling of parental H3 during differentiation. Consistent with this idea, mutations at Pole3 and Pole4, two other genes involved in recycling both parental H3.3 and H3.1 in mouse ESCs following DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2022</xref>), also result in defects in differentiation. Currently, the fate of parental histones at different chromatin domains during mouse ESC differentiation is largely unknown. It is possible that the ability of Mcm2 to recycle both parental H3.1 and H3.3 contributes to dynamic changes in chromatin states during differentiation. Alternatively, it is possible that Mcm2, via its ability to bind H3-H4, regulates gene expression directly during differentiation. Supporting this idea, we have shown that Mcm2 localizes at gene promoters of actively transcribed genes in both ESCs and NPCs. Furthermore, MCM2-7 proteins are associated with RNA Pol II in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Snyder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yankulov et al., 1999</xref>), and Mcm2 and Mcm5 are required for Pol II-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Snyder et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, it is possible that defects in silencing of pluripotent genes in Mcm2-2A mutant cells are associated with firing of dormant origins. It is known that excessive amounts of MCM2-7 complexes than active origins are loaded on chromatin during G1 phase of the cell cycle. Dormant origins provide a first line of defense for the genome under replication stress. ESCs contain more dormant origins than progenitor cells such as NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ge et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this idea, we detected 13742 and 2686 Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks, respectively, in WT ESCs and NPCs. Furthermore, activation of dormant origins is impaired in Mcm2 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibarra et al., 2008</xref>), and that partial depletion of Mcm4 and Mcm5 does not affect ESCs self-renewal but impairs their differentiation, including toward the neural lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ge et al., 2015</xref>). However, unlike depletion of MCM subunits in these studies, Mcm2-2A mutation in yeast and mouse ESCs has little impacts on the response to replication stress. Therefore, it is unlikely that defects in differentiation in Mcm2-2A mutant cells are largely due to its impact on firing of dormant origins. Nonetheless, future studies are needed to address whether Mcm2’s role in differentiation, in particular its role in silencing of pluripotent genes during differentiation is linked to its ability to bind H3-H4.</p><p>In summary, our results indicate that Mcm2, through its interaction with H3-H4, likely regulates differentiation through multiple mechanisms, one of which involves in the resolution of bivalent chromatin domains through its interaction with Asf1a bridged by H3-H4.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials availability statement</title><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Zhiguo Zhang (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genetics.cuimc.columbia.edu/profile/zhiguo-zhang-phd">zz2401@cumc.columbia.edu</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell culture and cell lines</title><p>The mouse E14 ESC line (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_C320">CVCL_C320</ext-link>) was kindly provided by Dr Tom Fazzio (University of Massachusetts Medical School) and tested negative for mycoplasma.

complex in the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into neuronal lineages. A series of compelling experimental manipulations dissect the abnormalities in the formation of heterochromatin at pluripotent genes and the resolution of bivalent chromatin domains at lineage-specific genes in differentiation in response to mutation of the histone binding domain of Mcm2. These findings provide new insights into the replication-independent roles of Mcm2, and will be of interest to scientists working on development and embryonal cell differentiation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80917.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Dang</surname><given-names>Weiwei</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02pttbw34</institution-id><institution>Baylor College of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.06.16.496513">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.16.496513v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Further control data, analysis, and discussion on Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN experiments as suggested by both reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the reviewers’ suggestions and addressed their concerns related to this suggestion/requirement. Specifically, we performed two controls for Mcm2CUT&amp;RUN, (1) CUT&amp;RUN using antibodies against IgG, (2) CUT&amp;RUN using Flag antibodies in wild type ES cells without Mcm2-Flag. We used the same parameters for peak calling on these two controls. As shown in (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and 1C), we identified far few peaks in each of the two controls. Importantly, a large fraction of these peaks identified in the controls did not overlap with Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks obtained using antibodies against Mcm2 or against the Flag epitope in cells expressing Flag-Mcm2. These results indicate that Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks reflect Mcm2 binding. The relatively low signal to noise in Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN samples were likely due to dynamic nature of Mcm2 chromatin binding. Once loaded on chromatin during G1 phase of the cell cycle, it is known that the CMG helicase travels along DNA replication forks. Furthermore, Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN experiments were performed using asynchronous cells. These factors contribute to low signal to noise for Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN. We have also performed analysis using SEACR as suggested by the reviewers and we found that our original analysis is likely more reliable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Clarification on the differences in Mcm2-2A mutant phenotype between ESCs and NPCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We discussed one potential reason for the differential impact of Mcm2-2A mutation on ES cells and in NPCs. It is known that excessive amounts of MCM2-7 helicase, greater than the number of replication origins, are loaded on chromatin during G1 phase of the cell cycle (Lei, Kawasaki et al. 1996, Edwards, Tutter et al. 2002). These excessive amount of MCM2-7 helicase, while not needed during unperturbed S phases of the cell cycle, helps fire dormant origins under replication stress (Woodward, Gohler et al. 2006). It is reported that ESCs contain more dormant origins than progenitor cells such as NPCs (Ge, Han et al. 2015). Consistent with this idea, we detected 13742 and 2686 Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks, respectively, in wild type ES cells and NPCs. Furthermore, it is known that the depletion of Mcm5, whiling having little impact on stemness of ES cells, but dramatically affects differentiation (Ge, Han et al. 2015). However, I would like to point out that the differentiation defects detected in Mcm2-2A mutant cells are unlikely due to the impact of this mutant on dormant origins as Mcm2-2A mutant cells exhibited little defects in response to replication stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Potential redundancy between Mcm2 and histone chaperones.</p></disp-quote><p>Mcm2 is known to interact with Asf1 and this interaction is bridged by H3-H4. Furthermore, the Mcm2-Asf1 interaction is reduced in Mcm2-2A mutant cells. Therefore, we tested whether overexpression of Asf1a could rescue the differentiation defects of Mcm2-2A mutant cells. We found that Asf1a overexpression in Mcm2-2A cells did not rescue the differentiation defects of Mcm2-2A mutant cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). However, overexpression of Mcm2 rescued the differentiation defects of Mcm2-2A cells.</p><p>To further investigate the relationship between Mcm2 and Asf1a, we knocked out Asf1a in both WT cells and Mcm2-2A mutant cells using CRISPR/Cas9 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2F and 2G) and analyzed the effects of Asf1a KO, Mcm2-2A and Mcm2-2A Asf1a KO double mutation on differentiation. We observed that Mcm2-2A Asf1a KO double mutant exhibited similar morphology as Mcm2-2A cells but not Asf1a KO cells after differentiation (Figure 2—figure supplement 2H). Moreover, both Mcm2-2A single and Mcm2-2A Asf1a KO double mutant cell lines showed defects in silencing of <italic>Oct4</italic>, while Asf1a KO cells did not show this defect (Figure 2—figure supplement 2I), implying Mcm2 has a role in silencing of Oct4, which is independent of its interaction with Asf1a. On the other hand, we observed that the defects in the induction of neural lineage gene expression (<italic>Pax6</italic> and <italic>Sox21</italic>) in Mcm2-2A cells and Asf1a KO cells as well as in Mcm2-2A cells Asf1a KO double mutant cells were quite similar (Figure 2—figure supplement 2I), indicating that Mcm2 functions in the same pathway with Asf1a for the induction of lineage specific genes upon differentiation. This idea was supported by analysis of transcriptomes changes in Asf1a KO and Mcm2-2A cells during differentiation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Based on these results and Mcm2 binding at bivalent chromatin domains, we propose that Mcm2 and Asf1a function together to resolve bivalent chromatin domain during exit from pluripotency. Furthermore, Mcm2 also has a role in silencing of pluripotent genes and this role is independent of Asf1a. We discussed three possible models for Mcm2 in silencing of pluripotent genes during differentiation (p23-24).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Clarification on how Mcm2 may regulate deposition of newly synthesized or recycled histones.</p></disp-quote><p>While it has been reported that Mcm2 may be involved in deposition of newly synthesized H3-H4 (Huang, Stromme et al. 2015), recent studies from my lab and Dr. Groth’s lab indicate that Mcm2-2A mutant cells are primarily defective in parental histone transfer in yeast and mouse ES cells (Gan, Serra-Cardona et al. 2018, Petryk, Dalby et al. 2018, Li, Hua et al. 2020). We discussed this point in the discussion in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Clarification on the role of reduced dormant origins reflected in the reduced density of Mcm2 at the origins in the differentiation to neuronal lineages.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included this point in the discussion. Specifically, it is possible that defects in differentiation detected in Mcm2-2A mutant cells are likely linked to firing of dormant origins. It is known that excessive MCM2-7 complexes compared to active origins are loaded in G1 for activation of dormant origins, which are not needed for the S phase progression under normal conditions. However, dormant origins fire under replication stress. Furthermore, it has been shown that partial depletion of Mcm4 and Mcm5, two other subunits of MCM2-7 complex, while having little impacts on the self-renewal of ES cells, impairs the differentiation of ES cells including toward the neural lineage (Ge, Han et al. 2015). Therefore, it is possible that the differentiation defects of Mcm2-2A mutant arise from defects in dormant origins. Arguing against this idea, we have shown that Mcm2 and Asf1a functions together for the induction of lineage specific genes. Moreover, Mcm2-2A mutant cells are not sensitive to replication stress inducer, such as hydroxyurea. Furthermore, there is little evidence indicating that deletion of Asf1a affects dormant origin firing. We discussed these points in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The reviewers concur that investigating the mechanism of Mcm2 differential engagement with the bivalent chromatin domains in ESCs vs NPCs is an open question and may require extended experiments. It is recommended for authors to provide additional discussions on this issue if it is not feasible to be addressed experimentally in a revision.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers’ suggestion. We might have misled the reviewers that Mcm2 has different roles at bivalent chromatin domains of ES cells and NPCs in our original text. To clarify this situation, we have modified the discussion dramatically based on the new results indicating that Mcm2 and Asf1a function together for resolving bivalent chromatin domains during pluripotency exit. The role of Mcm2 in differentiation likely reflects its role in the differentiation process, but not necessarily due to the differential role of Mcm2 in ES cells and NPCs. We tried to point this out at the result as well as in the Discussion section in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>As noted in the &quot;Public Review&quot; section, there is some concern about the low signal to noise of the Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN data that potentially impacts some of the conclusions.

We identified far more Mcm2 peaks using a &quot;stringent&quot; mode with its default numeric threshold of &quot;0.01&quot; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>).

Although most of these peaks in IgG samples were not overlapped with Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks using the same method and cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>), we observed that several potentially real Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks in Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN samples were not identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>, indicated by shadow).</p><p>Based on these results, we felt that the peak calling by MACS2 did not produce many false positive peaks in the negative control samples, and at the same time, the annotated peaks in Mcm2 CUT&amp;RUN had high densities due to the stringent cutoff we set (<italic>p</italic>=0.0001).
