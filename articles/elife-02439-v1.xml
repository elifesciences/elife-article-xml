Here we show that astrocytes that serve as neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mouse subventricular zone (SVZ) express the histone methyltransferase EZH2. This Polycomb repressive factor is required for neurogenesis independent of its role in SVZ NSC proliferation, as <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic>-deficiency in <italic>Ezh2</italic>-deleted SVZ NSCs rescues cell proliferation, but neurogenesis remains defective. <italic>Olig2</italic> is a direct target of EZH2, and repression of this bHLH transcription factor is critical for neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, <italic>Ezh2</italic> prevents the inappropriate activation of genes associated with non-SVZ neuronal subtypes. In the human brain, SVZ cells including local astroglia also express EZH2, correlating with postnatal neurogenesis. Thus, EZH2 is an epigenetic regulator that distinguishes neurogenic SVZ astrocytes, orchestrating distinct and separable aspects of adult stem cell biology, which has important implications for regenerative medicine and oncogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02439.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02439.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02439.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In addition to the billions of nerve cells called neurons, the brain and spinal cord also contain star-shaped cells called astrocytes. At first it was thought that all astrocytes were the same, but it later became clear that there are several different types of astrocytes that perform different functions. Most neurons are formed in the embryo, but some astrocytes that are found deep within the brain can act as ‘neurogenic stem cells’ and continue to produce new neurons during adult life. However, it was not clear how these neurogenic astrocytes were different from other astrocytes.</p><p>Now Hwang et al. have found that neurogenic astrocytes contain a protein called EZH2 that is not found in other types of astrocyte in the adult brain. Researchers already knew that this protein, which acts to help keep DNA tightly packed inside the nucleus and to keep genes switched off, was important for brain development. EZH2 was also known to prevent stem cells from prematurely turning into specialized cell types. But, surprisingly, Hwang et al. found that EZH2 has two distinct roles in neurogenic astrocytes: it allows them to multiply to make more astrocytes, and it also helps guide astrocytes into becoming neurons. Hwang et al. showed that different sets of genes were involved in these two roles.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02439.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02439.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>EZH2</kwd><kwd>Polycomb</kwd><kwd>SVZ neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>glioma</kwd><kwd>astrocyte heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>OLIG2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000009</institution-id><institution>Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2-OD006505-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006064</institution-id><institution>Sontag Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>VA Merit Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I01 BX000252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UCSF Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research, funded in part by the Sandler Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oldham</surname><given-names>Michael C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute Medical Fellows Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salinas</surname><given-names>Ryan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine Graduate Student Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delgado</surname><given-names>Ryan N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine Clinical Fellow Training Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paredes</surname><given-names>Mercedes F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A number of genes associated with the development of brain tumors are epigenetically repressed in specialized astrocytes to enable the production of neurons in the postnatal brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is now appreciated that, like neurons, astrocytes serve multiple functions in the adult brain and are heterogeneous in their identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang and Barres, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Molofsky et al., 2012</xref>). While astrocytes are distributed widely throughout the brain, only those located in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus serve as neurogenic NSCs for all of adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009</xref>). Though several transcriptional regulators have been identified that distinguish neurogenic astroglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsieh, 2012</xref>), what makes adult NSCs epigenetically distinct from non-neurogenic astrocytes remains an outstanding question. Understanding these differences may yield novel insights into how adult stem cells retain the competence to self-renew and generate multiple specialized cell types.</p><p>In particular, Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which comprise a chromatin-remodeling system that mediates transcriptional repression, have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in the development of various cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aloia et al., 2013</xref>). PcG proteins assemble into two functionally distinct Polycomb repressive complexes, PRC1 and PRC2. PRC2 typically contains the core components SUZ12, EED, RbAp46/48, and EZH2, a histone methyltransferase responsible for catalyzing histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). In the prevailing model of PcG-mediated repression, PRC2 is targeted to specific loci, and the deposited H3K27me3 marks serve as a platform to recruit PRC1, leading to transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Most of what is known about PRC2 developmental function derives from studies of the embryo. In the early developing forebrain, conditional deletion of <italic>Ezh2</italic> results in a shortened period of neuronal production related to lack of precursor cell proliferation and premature NSC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pereira et al., 2010</xref>); in contrast, deletion of <italic>Ezh2</italic> a few days later during corticogenesis causes an increase in the duration of neurogenesis and a delay in astrocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirabayashi et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, EZH2, in concert with other PcG members, appears to orchestrate the temporal alterations in embryonic NSC behavior.</p><p>In contrast to the dynamic and transient nature of embryonic NSCs, adult NSCs are relatively stable in their differentiation potential and are maintained for all of adult life. Postnatal NSCs lacking PRC1 component BMI1 are defective for self-renewal, in part due to the derepression of cell cycle inhibitors encoded by the <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic> locus (also known as <italic>Cdkn2a</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Molofsky et al., 2003</xref>). Whether PcG factors are required for other aspects of adult neurogenesis such as lineage specification is not known.</p><p>In this study, we found EZH2 expression to be a distinguishing feature of neurogenic astrocytes in the adult mouse brain. <italic>Ezh2</italic> in SVZ NSCs was required for distinct functions, regulating both cell proliferation and neuronal lineage specification. To enable SVZ NSC self-renewal, EZH2 directly repressed the <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic> locus. <italic>Ink4a/Arf-</italic>deletion reversed the proliferation defect of <italic>Ezh2</italic>-deleted NSCs, but neurogenesis was still greatly impaired. In SVZ cells, EZH2 directly targeted <italic>Olig2</italic>, and repression of this bHLH transcription factor was required for neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, genome-wide transcript and chromatin analyses revealed a role for EZH2 in preventing the aberrant activation of transcriptional regulators that specify alternative neuronal lineages. In the human brain, EZH2 was also expressed in astroglia and neuronal precursors of the early infant SVZ, suggesting that this PRC2 factor plays key roles in postnatal human neurogenesis. Taken together, these data indicate that EZH2 is a critical epigenetic determinant for the maintenance of multipotent astroglia, enabling both proliferation and cell fate specification of an adult stem cell population.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Robust EZH2 expression in the postnatal brain is selectively retained by SVZ astroglia and their neurogenic lineage</title><p>EZH2 is expressed widely in the embryonic brain, including in radial glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pereira et al., 2010</xref>), which are the primary precursor of all major neural cells in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009</xref>).

Co-IHC of EZH2 with markers of SVZ cell types demonstrated EZH2 expression in the entire neurogenic cell lineage, from the GFAP+ type B1 astroglial cells that serve as self-renewing SVZ NSC, to DLX2+ transit amplifying type C cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and finally to DCX+ type A neuroblasts that migrate from the SVZ through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory bulb (OB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Of note, EZH2 also co-localized with OLIG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which is expressed in a small subset of both type B1 and C cells in the SVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Menn et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Upon arriving into the core of the OB, DCX+ neuroblasts migrate tangentially into the granule cell layer (GCL) where they differentiate into NeuN+ neurons. Interestingly, DCX+ cells away from the OB core had decreased levels of EZH2, and NeuN+ neurons that populate the GCL were mostly EZH2-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These data indicate that EZH2 is expressed in SVZ neurogenic astroglia, their immature daughter cells, and is gradually downregulated upon terminal differentiation.</p><p>Both SVZ type B1 cells and local non-neurogenic, postmitotic ependymal cells arise from local radial glia shortly after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merkle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spassky et al., 2005</xref>).

In addition, while almost all EZH2+ cells (&gt;99%) in the postnatal SVZ express the cell cycle marker Ki67+, only a small percentage (∼7%) of Ki67+ cells located away from the SVZ were EZH2+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, data not shown), suggesting that EZH2 expression is not a strict consequence of cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Conditional deletion of <italic>Ezh2</italic> in SVZ NSCs inhibits neurogenesis in vivo</title><p>To study Ezh2-deficency in SVZ NSCs, we used mice with conditional alleles of <italic>Ezh2</italic> (<italic>Ezh2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup>) and the <italic>hGFAP-cre</italic> transgene, which drives Cre-mediated recombination in the precursors of the cerebellar granule cell layer, hippocampal dentate gyrus, and SVZ NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>hGFAP-cre;Ezh2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> animals were born at expected Mendelian ratios and did not exhibit gross morphological or behavioral defects as compared to their <italic>hGFAP-cre;Ezh2</italic><sup><italic>F/+</italic></sup> or non-<italic>hGFAP-cre</italic> littermates (hereafter referred to as controls).

While most astrocytes do not generate neurons in the early postnatal brain, SVZ astrocytes retain the ability to produce neurons and glia throughout life. Thus, conceptually, SVZ astrocytes appear to have ‘preserved’ the multi-lineage developmental potential of their radial glial cell origin, whereas non-neurogenic astrocytes apparently ‘lose’ this stem cell characteristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gonzales-Roybal and Lim, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The expression of EZH2 strongly correlated with the neurogenic potential of glial cells along this developmental continuum. EZH2 is expressed in embryonic radial glia and is required for proper cortical neuron differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirabayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pereira et al., 2010</xref>). We detected EZH2 expression in early postnatal radial glia, including those that give rise to the SVZ astrocytes. While EZH2 expression decreased over time in non-neurogenic brain regions, this PRC2 factor remained highly expressed in SVZ astrocytes into adulthood. Interestingly, PRC1 component BMI1—which is required for SVZ NSC self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Molofsky et al., 2003</xref>)—does not become similarly restricted to neurogenic astrocytes and is instead also expressed in mature neurons and astrocytes of the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chatoo et al., 2009</xref>). This suggests that BMI1, while clearly required for adult neurogenesis, is not a distinguishing feature of SVZ astrocytes; instead, BMI1 may function more broadly in a variety of mature and immature neural cell types.</p><p>During the first 2 weeks of life, astrocytes isolated from the cortex can give rise to multipotent NS cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Laywell et al., 2000</xref>). After these first 2 postnatal weeks, cortical astrocytes lose their ability to generate such neurogenic cell cultures. Intriguingly, this reported loss of neurogenic competence during postnatal development parallels our observation that EZH2 was no longer detected in the cortex by P15. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of EZH2 in cultured postnatal astrocytes induces the expression of <italic>Nestin</italic> and other markers of radial glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sher et al., 2011</xref>). Future studies may address whether re-expression of EZH2 in non-SVZ astrocytes can enable neurogenesis or their directed transdifferentiation into neurons in vivo for potential therapeutic purposes.</p><p>Acute deletion of <italic>Ezh2</italic> in SVZ NSCs resulted in decreased neurogenesis, and this deficiency in part related to reduced cell proliferation. As has been found in other stem cell systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aloia et al., 2013</xref>), in SVZ cells, <italic>Ink4a</italic> was enriched with both H3K27me3 and the EZH2 methyltransferase.

These findings are coherent with the finding that <italic>Ink4a</italic> repression by BMI1 is required for SVZ NSC self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Molofsky et al., 2003</xref>). Given our current understanding of Polycomb-mediated gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>), these data suggest that <italic>Ink4a</italic> repression in SVZ astrocytes requires EZH2 for the local H3K27me3 enrichment, and that BMI1 is required for the subsequent transcriptional repression mediated by PRC1.</p><p>While these data clearly indicated that EZH2 is required for proper SVZ NSC proliferation, the expression of EZH2 in type C and A cells suggested that EZH2 also plays a role in neuronal lineage specification. By deleting <italic>Ezh2</italic> in <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> SVZ NSCs, we were able to evaluate the <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic>-independent roles of <italic>Ezh2</italic> in neurogenesis. This genetic strategy enabled the identification of <italic>Olig2</italic> as a key direct target of EZH2-mediated repression. OLIG2 is expressed in a subset of both type B1 and type C cells, but not in migratory neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hack et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Menn et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that OLIG2 is expressed only at early stages of the SVZ neurogenic lineage. However, the epigenetic mechanisms required to repress <italic>Olig2</italic> during neurogenesis were not known. Our results demonstrate that EZH2 is critical for <italic>Olig2</italic> repression, which we found to be a key aspect of SVZ neurogenesis. While EZH2 is well recognized for its role in maintaining stem cells in an undifferentiated state, the EZH2-dependent downregulation of <italic>Olig2</italic> illustrates a critical function for EZH2 in cell lineage specification.</p><p>How EZH2-mediated repression is targeted to specific loci is still not well understood. In a subpopulation of SVZ cells, EZH2 was co-expressed with OLIG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that while EZH2 is present in these cells, its repressive activities have not been localized to the <italic>Olig2</italic> locus. Future work may reveal how other factors, possibly including long non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simon and Kingston, 2013</xref>), serve to dynamically target EZH2 to specific loci at different states of the neurogenic lineage.</p><p>In addition to repressing <italic>Olig2</italic>, EZH2 was also required to prevent the aberrant expression of many homeodomain-containing transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3 fig4s4 fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 3, 4, and 5</xref>), including those involved in the embryonic development of non-OB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ikeda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that EZH2 plays a role in restricting SVZ NSCs to neuron subtypes appropriate for the OB. It remains to be determined whether the misexpression of these transcription factors contributes to the neurogenic defect of <italic>Ezh2</italic>-deleted SVZ NSCs.</p><p>While EZH2 was not observed in mature, non-neurogenic astrocytes, the expression of this H3K27 methyltransferase is common to high-grade gliomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crea et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Orzan et al., 2011</xref>). Given that EZH2 directly targeted <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic>, a tumor suppressor locus that is frequently inactivated in human GBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brennan et al., 2013</xref>), it is possible that EZH2 in SVZ astrocytes increases their oncogenic potential. Indeed, mouse SVZ precursors give rise to tumors more frequently than non-SVZ cells when oncogenic alterations are induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcantara Llaguno et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Thus, EZH2 has been investigated as a potential chemotherapeutic target for gliomas. Inhibition of EZH2 in human GBM cell lines results in decreased cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suva et al., 2009</xref>), and in other GBMs, <italic>EZH2</italic> knockdown results in derepression of <italic>BMPRIB</italic>, which may reduce tumorigenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). However, recent discoveries raise questions about this therapeutic approach. Expression of H3.3 with a K27M mutation results in a dominant-negative inhibition of PRC2 function, leading to a global decrease in H3K27me3, and this K27M H3.3 mutation is a major driver of pediatric high-grade glioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bender et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that EZH2 can have distinct and separable developmental roles provides a conceptual resolution to these seemingly paradoxical findings. In some gliomas, inhibition of EZH2 may reduce cell proliferation, possibly by de-repressing <italic>Ink4a/Arf.</italic> However, in other gliomas, loss of EZH2 function could lead to the aberrant expression of factors such as <italic>OLIG2</italic>, which can drive tumorogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ligon et al., 2007</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>OLIG2</italic> is one of most highly expressed genes in the K27M glioma subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that the development of EZH2 inhibitors for cancer chemotherapy will benefit from a continued understanding of the multiple, distinct roles that EZH2 plays in development and cell differentiation.</p><p>While most neurogenesis in the human brain is complete by the time of birth, the infant brain SVZ contains many young migrating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanai et al., 2011</xref>). In the one-week old human brain, EZH2 expression was primarily observed in DCX+ neuroblasts and a subset of GFAP+ astroglia. Thus, EZH2 is expressed in GFAP+ astroglia in the human SVZ when neurogenesis is observed.</p><p>In the 18-month-old brain, when SVZ neurogenesis is sparse, we did not find EZH2+ cells in the SVZ. In particular, we did not observe GFAP+, EZH2+ cells at this time point, though we cannot rule out the existence of EZH2+ cells in other parts of the SVZ. Nevertheless, for this region of the lateral ventricle SVZ, the near absence of postnatal neurogenesis correlated with the loss of astroglia expressing EZH2. This suggests that this specialized, neurogenic astrocyte population is transient in the human brain. Future studies will be required to determine whether the loss of EZH2 expression is a cause or a consequence of this decrease in SVZ neurogenic activity.</p><p>Taken together, our studies establish EZH2 as a distinguishing feature of astroglial cells in the postnatal neurogenic SVZ of both the mouse and human brain. Furthermore, we identify distinct and separable roles for EZH2 in the production of new neurons from a multipotent stem cell population. These results provide novel insights into the complex role that this Polycomb repressive factor plays in normal development and gliomagenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Ezh2</italic> <sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> mice featuring LoxP sites flanking the four exons that encode for the essential SET domain were maintained and genotyped as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>hGFAP-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhuo et al., 2001</xref>) and <italic>UBC-Cre/ERT2</italic> mice were purchased from from Jackson Laboratories and described previously.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Marianne Bronner, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The role of epigenetic regulators in the adult NSC niche remains very poorly defined. Here the role of <italic>Ezh2</italic>, a histone methyltransferase component of the PRC complex is examined in the adult SVZ. Seamlessly moving between in vivo and in vitro forms of analysis this study finds that conditional deletion of <italic>Ezh2</italic> results in decreased neurogenesis and proliferation. Mechanistically, this phenomenon can be uncoupled: the proliferation defects are mediated through repression of the p16-locus, while the neurogenic defects are mediated through repression of <italic>Olig2</italic>. This part of the paper is extremely well done and the dissociation of proliferative mechanisms from neurogenic mechanisms is really quite novel and interesting.</p><p>Altogether, this is an excellent paper that explores the role of a key epigenetic regulator in NSC populations in the adult SVZ and in the process reveals that distinct molecular mechanisms regulate NSC proliferation and neurogenic capacity. The latter point is an important conceptual advance, as the prevailing view in the field is that these two processes are coupled.</p><p>Although the work is definitely of <italic>eLife</italic> quality, the manuscript would benefit from some modifications, further experiments and reorganization, as detailed below:</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) We are not sure if the microarray/ChIP-Seq analysis adds much to the paper. It seems that at least some in vivo validation of a few key targets in their system would strengthen this part of the paper. As it stands, it is simply a list of genes with correlated functions. If these data are retained, the construction of the manuscript would benefit from presenting the microarray analysis earlier and then investigating the mechanism of action of EZH2 focusing on <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic> and <italic>Olig2</italic>.</p><p>2) The analysis of early post-natal brain is interesting, but the rationale for doing these experiments is weak. The adult mouse SVZ is not necessarily a model for developing human LV neurogenesis and the authors should be more cautious here.</p><p>3) Similarly, it is not logical that the authors repeatedly refer to adult neural stem cells as a subtype of astrocyte, when the whole point of the study is to set about demonstrating how the NSC differ from bona fide astrocytes. The reasons presented in the paper for referring to adult NSC as a subtype of astrocyte do not seem very compelling and the findings of the present study in fact make this claim even less compelling. Based on available functional and molecular evidence, including the findings presented in this study, adult NSC seem to have far more in common with developmental radial glial NSC than they do with mature astrocytes. Mature differentiated astrocytes have many specific functions in the CNS, such as maintenance of ion and water homeostasis, or interactions with synapses in grey matter, and many more. There is no evidence that adult NSC exert any of these astrocyte functions. If such evidence exists, the authors should refer to it. What reason do the authors have for not referring to adult NSC simply as adult radial glia or as a subtype of radial glia? Is this not more logical, based even on the findings of the present study? What purpose does it serve to call adult NSC a subtype of astrocyte? To do so seems only to confuse the differences between functionally distinct cell types. Astrocytes are a principal cell type of the CNS. In no other organ system is a stem cell referred to as a sub-type of a tissue specific principal cell. Better reasons for the repeated claim of adult NSC as an astrocyte subtype should be presented, if indeed they exist.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the authors should explain why <italic>Olig2</italic> and <italic>Ezh2</italic> are co-expressed, when later in the paper they show that <italic>Ezh2</italic> represses <italic>Olig2</italic>. This might confuse readers who are not experts in gene regulation, etc.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, they should confirm the presence of SVZ populations (i.e., B, C, A cells) in the <italic>Ezh2</italic>-<italic>cKO</italic> mouse. Given that the <italic>hGFAP-Cre</italic> is active relatively early, it is important to confirm that there are no developmental defects in these mice.</p><p>6) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, they should include the figure supplement 1B/C in the main figure. Having the ARF/<italic>Ink4a</italic> expression and ChIP-Seq data in the body of the paper will help reader with the rationale for this key experiment.</p><p>7) The <italic>Olig2</italic>-shRNAi experiment in vitro is nice. It is important to do this experiment in vivo; inject <italic>Olig2</italic>-shRNAi virus into the SVZ of P16-null;<italic>Ezh2</italic>-null mice and assess whether neurogenesis is restored.</p><p>8) Loss of <italic>Olig2</italic> results in increased astrocyte production (Zhou, et al. Cell 2002). In the <italic>Olig2</italic>-shRNAi studies, they should assess astrocyte production as well.</p><p>9) The co-staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is confusing. In the paper they make the point that <italic>Ezh2</italic> is downregulated once the neuroblasts reach the OB and differentiate in to neurons. This is correlated with their observation that <italic>Ezh2</italic> expression is generally downregulated in the human after neurons have been produced. I would streamline this part of the paper to simply make that point.</p><p>10) EZH2 is expressed in most (all?) cell types where it plays an active role in regulating cellular programs. The observed pattern of expression with exclusive presence of EZH2 in neurogenic niches thus likely represents an effect of a threshold of detection by the antibody. The wording of the manuscript should cautiously convey this point rather than assuming that cells outside of SVZ are devoid of EZH2 expression.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02439.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) We are not sure if the microarray/ChIP-Seq analysis adds much to the paper.

The Results and Discussion sections describing the human postnatal brain analyses have been greatly streamlined. By making such revisions to the text, we believe that our descriptions of these results are now more circumspect.</p><p><italic>3) Similarly, it is not logical that the authors repeatedly refer to adult neural stem cells as a subtype of astrocyte, when the whole point of the study is to set about demonstrating how the NSC differ from bona fide astrocytes. The reasons presented in the paper for referring to adult NSC as a subtype of astrocyte do not seem very compelling and the findings of the present study in fact make this claim even less compelling.

Astrocytes are a principal cell type of the CNS. In no other organ system is a stem cell referred to as a sub-type of a tissue specific principal cell. Better reasons for the repeated claim of adult NSC as an astrocyte subtype should be presented, if indeed they exist</italic>.</p><p>Astrocytes were originally named for their star-like morphology, and the heterogeneity of this glial cell population has been underappreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang and Barres, 2010</xref>). We believe that our work illustrates how epigenetic regulators such as <italic>EZH2</italic> may contribute to this cellular diversity. As pointed out by researchers in the astrocyte research community, while ion and water homeostasis and synapse regulation are indeed important roles for astrocytes, it is now recognized that some astrocytes can have other roles including the function as neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang and Barres, 2010</xref>; Wang and Bordey, 2008; Robel et al., 2011). Importantly, distinct subtypes of this glial cell population likely contribute to the diversity of astrocyte functions.</p><p>Adult SVZ NSCs have not been referred to as radial glia due to their non-radial orientation, non-bipolar cellular morphology, and lack of contact with the pial surface of the brain. Instead, NSCs in the SVZ have been defined as astrocytes by a number of different criteria. Briefly, SVZ astrocytes have many morphological and ultrastructural similarities to mature astrocytes (Doetsch et al., 1997), have the presence of glycogen granules (Peretto et al., 1999), and have endfeet contact with blood vessels (Mirzadeh, et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2008). There are also similarities in their electrophysiological properties (Filippov et al., 2003, Fukuda et al., 2003). Furthermore, SVZ astrocytes express multiple genes associated with astrocyte identity and function including GFAP, GLAST, AQP4, Connexin 30, and GLT1. Of note, AQP4 is a water channel protein that is key to the regulation of water homeostasis, and this protein is expressed prominently by SVZ astrocytes and is dynamically regulated during neurogenesis (Cavazzin et al., 2006). GLAST and GLT1 are glial glutamate transporters that are involved in the regulating the extracellular concentrations of glutamate and are expressed in GFAP + cells in the SVZ (Liu et al., 2006).</p><p><italic>4) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>, the authors should explain why</italic> Olig2 <italic>and</italic> Ezh2 <italic>are co-expressed, when later in the paper they show that</italic> Ezh2 <italic>represses</italic> Olig2<italic>. This might confuse readers who are not experts in gene regulation, etc</italic>.</p><p>We agree that these results might be confusing to readers who are not familiar with epigenetic mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. We have therefore added text to the Discussion related to this interesting finding:</p><p>“In addition, how <italic>EZH2</italic>-mediated repression is targeted to specific loci is still not well understood. In a subpopulation of SVZ cells, EZH2 was co-expressed with <italic>OLIG2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that while <italic>EZH2</italic> is present in these cells, its repressive activities have not been localized to the <italic>Olig2</italic> locus. Future work may reveal how other factors, possibly including long non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simon and Kingston, 2013</xref>), may serve to dynamically target <italic>EZH2</italic> to specific loci at different states of the neurogenic lineage.”</p><p><italic>5) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>, they should confirm the presence of SVZ populations (i.e., B, C, A cells) in the</italic> Ezh2-cKO <italic>mouse. Given that the</italic> hGFAP-Cre <italic>is active relatively early, it is important to confirm that there are no developmental defects in these mice</italic>.</p><p>We have performed new analysis to address this reviewer comment that we have added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>. As we reported in the previous manuscript, there was a 4-fold decreased in the number of DCX + type A cell neuroblasts <italic>hGFAP-cre;Ezh2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> mice. However, as we added in the text:</p><p>”This decrease was not due to a developmental defect in the SVZ, as we did not find any significant differences in the type C cell (DLX2+, DCX-negative) population nor a deficit in the type B cell (GFAP+, Nestin+) population in <italic>hGFAP-cre;Ezh2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> mice (Figure–figure supplement 3)”.</p><p>Thus, we do not believe that developmental defects primarily account for the observed reduction in SVZ neurogenesis.</p><p><italic>6) For</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>, they should include the figure supplement 1B/C in the main figure.

References in the text have been changed accordingly. We thank the reviewers for this helpful and clarifying suggestion.</p><p><italic>7) The</italic> Olig2<italic>-shRNAi experiment</italic> in vitro <italic>is nice. It is important to do this experiment</italic> in vivo<italic>; inject</italic> Olig2<italic>-shRNAi virus into the SVZ of P16-null;</italic>Ezh2<italic>-null mice and assess whether neurogenesis is restored</italic>.</p><p>We agree that an in vivo demonstration of the rescue of the neurogenesis defect observed in <italic>Ezh2</italic>-deleted cells by <italic>Olig2</italic>-shRNA virus would be of interest. Unfortunately, although the experiment is conceptually quite straightforward, from past experience, we estimate that this experiment would take more than six months to perform based on the following reasons:</p><p>Each <italic>hGFAP-cre;Ezh2</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup>;<italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mouse has 5 transgenic or mutant alleles, and this is further complicated by the fact that the <italic>hGFAP-cre</italic> transgene cannot be reliably crossed in from the female. Thus, this complex genotype is quite time-consuming to generate.</p><p>Currently, we have very limited numbers of animals that can serve as the parents of the required crosses. It will then take a few more successful breedings to generate the numbers of mice (4–6 per group) usually required for stereotactic injection experiments. Then, we would need to wait 60 more days to perform the shRNA injection in the adult SVZ. We thus anticipate that it would take four or more months to even attempt this experiment once.</p><p>Furthermore, in our experience, these types of experiments (stereotactic injections into complex genetic backgrounds) require several experimental groups and repetitions to generate reliable results.</p><p>In addition, because stereotactic injections of viruses does not selectively infect the neural stem cell (NSC) population (in fact, mostly migratory young neurons are infected), the analysis will also require birthdate analysis and a differentiation time course, which may require even greater numbers of mice (e.g., 4–6 animals 2–4 days after injection and also 4–6 animals after 1 or 2 weeks after injection).</p><p>In summary, if this experiment were to be included, we believe that the issues outlined above would cause a significant delay in the publication of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>8) Loss of</italic> Olig2 <italic>results in increased astrocyte production (Zhou, et al. Cell 2002). In the</italic> Olig2<italic>-shRNAi studies, they should assess astrocyte production as well</italic>.</p><p>In Zhou et al. (Cell 2002), the authors show that loss of <italic>Olig2</italic> in oligodendrocyte progenitors of the embryonic spinal cord increases astrocyte production. In our studies, we showed that <italic>Olig2</italic> knockdown of aberrant <italic>Olig2</italic> expression in <italic>Ezh2</italic>-deleted SVZ cells increases neurogenesis. We have performed new experiments to address the reviewers’ question about astrocyte differentiation in our experimental system and added it to the text.</p><p><italic>“Ezh2</italic><sup><italic>Δ/Δ</italic></sup><italic>;Ink4a/Arf</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> SVZ NSCs with <italic>Olig2</italic>-knockdown produced nearly 3–fold more Tuj1+ cells after 3 d of differentiation as compared to cells infected with the control vector <italic>with no significant increase of GFAP-positive cells</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–Figure Supplement 2E and 2F</xref>).”</p><p><italic>9) The co-staining in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>is confusing.
