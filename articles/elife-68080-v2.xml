Bacteria and humans express members of the AlkB enzymes family, which directly remove 3meC. However, other organisms, including budding yeast, lack this class of enzymes. It remains an unanswered evolutionary question as to how yeast repairs 3meC, particularly in single-stranded DNA. The yeast Shu complex, a conserved homologous recombination factor, aids in preventing replication-associated mutagenesis from DNA base damaging agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). We found that MMS-treated Shu complex-deficient cells exhibit a genome-wide increase in A:T and G:C substitutions mutations. The G:C substitutions displayed transcriptional and replicational asymmetries consistent with mutations resulting from 3meC. Ectopic expression of a human AlkB homolog in Shu-deficient yeast rescues MMS-induced growth defects and increased mutagenesis. Thus, our work identifies a novel homologous recombination-based mechanism mediated by the Shu complex for coping with alkylation adducts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Rad51 paralogs</kwd><kwd>Shu complex</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>alkyation damage</kwd><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd><kwd>Rad51</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES030335</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernstein</surname><given-names>Kara A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA218112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>129182-RSG-16-043-01-DMC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernstein</surname><given-names>Kara A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>133947-PF-19-132-01-DMC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hengel</surname><given-names>Sarah R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Shu complex enables lesion bypass of specific alkylation-induced DNA damage including abasic sites and 3-methyl-cytosine.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alkylating agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) induce a diverse set of base lesions that are recognized and repaired by the base excision repair (BER) pathway or direct repair enzymes such as the AlkB family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yi and He, 2013</xref>). However, when these lesions, or its repair intermediates, are encountered by a replisome, replication fork stalling can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shrivastav et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sobol et al., 2003</xref>). In this scenario, DNA base damage is preferentially bypassed using homologous recombination (HR) or translesion synthesis (TLS), postponing its repair but allowing replication to be completed in a timely fashion. These pathways are often referred to as post-replication repair (PRR) or DNA damage tolerance (DDT) and are best described in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arbel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boiteux and Jinks-Robertson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ulrich, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, HR-mediated PRR is an error-free pathway and is dependent on the polyubiquitination of PCNA by the Mms2-Rad5-Ubc13 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arbel et al., 2020</xref>). Lesion bypass is achieved by Rad51 filament formation, and recombination between sister chromatids to fill the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps originated from the stalling of replicative polymerases. While HR can bypass these lesions in an error-free manner, TLS can also bypass this damage. However, TLS may lead to mutations and is often referred to as error-prone lesion bypass. In yeast, TLS serves as an alternative pathway to error-free lesion bypass, as disruption of genes involved in the error-free PRR pathway leads to an increase in mutations that is dependent on TLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Broomfield et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Swanson et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The study of the error-free PRR pathway is challenging due to the diverse roles of HR proteins in additional processes, such as double-strand break (DSB) repair. The Shu complex is an evolutionarily conserved HR factor that we recently discovered to function in strand-specific DDT during replication and thus provides an excellent model to specifically study HR proteins in the context of PRR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Godin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Godin et al., 2016c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martino and Bernstein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosenbaum et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the Shu complex is a heterotetramer formed by the SWIM domain-containing protein, Shu2, and the Rad51 paralogs, Csm2, Psy3, and Shu1. The Shu complex promotes Rad51 filament formation, a key step for HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Godin et al., 2016c</xref>). Consistent with their role in DSB repair, most HR genes deletions lead to increased sensitivity to DSB-inducing agents. However, this is not the case with the Shu complex, as its mutants are primarily sensitive to the alkylating agent MMS, but not to the DSB-inducing agents such as ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Godin et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shor et al., 2005</xref>). This makes the Shu complex attractive to dissect the role of HR in the tolerance of replication-associated DNA damage.</p><p>Previous studies from our group and others demonstrated that the Shu complex operates in the error-free branch of the PRR to tolerate DNA damage from MMS-induced lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ball et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Godin et al., 2013</xref>). Despite these findings, it has remained unknown which MMS-induced lesions, or repair intermediates, the Shu complex is important for. Our previous results uncovered genetic interactions between factors of the BER pathway and the Shu complex upon MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Godin et al., 2016b</xref>). Notably, cells lacking the BER purinic/apyrimidinic site (AP) endonucleases and AP lyases that process AP sites exhibit exquisite sensitivity toward alkylating agents and display a three order of magnitude increase in mutations rates when the Shu complex is disrupted. We recently demonstrated that the Shu complex is important for the tolerance of AP sites, also referred to as abasic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosenbaum et al., 2019</xref>). However, it remains an outstanding question as to whether the Shu complex may recognize other MMS-induced fork blocking lesions.</p><p>Here, we addressed whether the Shu complex function is specific for AP sites or if it is important for the recognition of a broader range of DNA lesions. To do this, we performed whole genome sequencing of Shu mutant cells (i.e. <italic>csm2∆</italic>) that had been chronically exposed to MMS. In turn, this allowed us to obtain an unbiased spectrum of mutations the Shu complex helps to mitigate. We determined that the Shu complex prevents mutations at both A:T and C:G base pairs. However, transcriptional and replicative asymmetries in C:G mutations suggest a novel role for the Shu complex in the tolerance of three-methyl cytosine (3meC), in addition to AP sites. Importantly, unlike bacteria and human cells that have an enzyme that directly repairs 3meC, this family of enzymes is absent in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and therefore it has remained unknown how 3meC are repaired in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sedgwick et al., 2007</xref>). Our data suggest that the Shu complex is important for 3meC tolerance. Indeed, expression of human <italic>ALKBH2</italic>, responsible for 3meC repair, specifically rescues the MMS sensitivity of Shu complex mutant cells and alleviates their MMS-induced mutagenesis. In contrast to Shu complex mutants, we observe that <italic>ALKBH2</italic> expression very weakly rescues the MMS sensitivity associated with HR deletion strains. Altogether, our findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for the Shu complex in mediating damage tolerance of 3meC in ssDNA, finally uncovering how yeast tolerate these highly toxic lesions. Additionally, the ability of the Shu complex to facilitate tolerance of 3meC DNA damage through homology-directly bypass likely highlights an important repair pathway for these lesions even in organisms that express AlkB homologs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Unbiased genome-wide analysis of mutation patterns suggests that the Shu complex function in the error-free bypass of specific MMS-induced lesions</title><p>To determine the identity of MMS-induced lesions that the Shu complex helps the replication fork to bypass, we chronically exposed Shu complex-deficient cells to MMS. In particular, wild-type (WT) or <italic>csm2∆</italic> cells were plated on MMS-containing medium and then individual colonies were transferred every 2 days onto fresh medium containing 0.008% MMS, for a total of 10 passages. We then extracted genomic DNA from these colonies and performed whole genome sequencing to measure mutation frequencies. Consistent with previous findings, <italic>csm2∆</italic> cells accumulated a median 12.7-fold more mutations than WT upon MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Godin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Godin et al., 2016b</xref>). Base substitutions, insertion/deletion mutations, and complex mutations (consisting of two or more mutations separated by 10 bp or less) were all elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), with base substitutions constituting approximately 95% of the total mutations in both the MMS-treated WT and <italic>csm2∆</italic> yeast. MMS-induced mutations were largely randomly distributed across yeast genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> ). To infer which DNA lesions caused the mutations, we analyzed the substitution patterns considering the MMS-induced lesion profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beranek, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sikora et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wyatt and Pittman, 2006</xref>). 3meA is the most common MMS-induced lesion at A:T base pairs in dsDNA and can itself be mutagenic or converted to a mutagenic AP site by the Mag1 glycosylase or by spontaneous depurination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shrivastav et al., 2010</xref>). When these AP sites are encountered by a replicative polymerase, they can lead to its stalling. TLS activity on 3meA-derived AP sites leads to an A-&gt; G and A-&gt; T substitution pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) due to the tendency of Rev1 or the replicative polymerase δ incorporating a C or A on AP sites, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haracska et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoopes et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, most substitutions at A:T bases in MMS-treated WT yeast A to G and A to T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Previous analyses of MMS-treated <italic>mag1∆</italic> yeast revealed that deletion of the glycosylase responsible for initiating BER of 3meA resulted in a mutation spectrum also predominantly composed of A to G and A to T substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mao et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that these two mutation types are likely directly induced by 3meA as opposed to 3meA-derived AP sites. MMS-treated <italic>csm2∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) displayed elevated A-&gt; G transitions and A-&gt; T transversions, consistent with a function for the Shu complex in the bypass of 3meA or 3meA-derived AP sites, as we recently demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Godin et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosenbaum et al., 2019</xref>). MMS-induced mutations selected in the <italic>CAN1</italic> gene in <italic>mag1∆</italic> yeast primarily occur at A:T bases (similar to MMS-induced mutations previously identified by whole genome sequencing of <italic>mag1∆</italic> yeast), indicative of 3meA-induced mutations, while MMS-induced <italic>CAN1</italic> mutations in <italic>csm2</italic>Δ yeast are primarily caused by C or G substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, the mutation spectrum from <italic>mag1∆ csm2</italic>Δ double mutant yeast mirrors that from <italic>mag1</italic>∆ yeast despite a previously determined higher MMS-induced mutation rate for <italic>mag1∆ csm2</italic>Δ than <italic>mag1</italic>-deficient yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Godin et al., 2016b</xref>). This spectrum, therefore, indicates that elevated frequency of A:T substitutions in <italic>mag1∆ csm2</italic>Δ yeast compared to <italic>csm2</italic>Δ yeast is due to higher amounts of 3meA present (due to the lack of Mag1) that are normally bypassed with the help of the Shu complex. 7meG is the most common MMS-induced DNA adduct at G:C base pairs and is not itself mutagenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shrivastav et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is eliminated by spontaneous depurination, or Mag1 excision, which both lead to AP sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bjørås et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shrivastav et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wyatt et al., 1999</xref>). When AP sites are generated from guanines, their bypass by Rev1 is error-free because it incorporates a C across the missing base. Alternatively, bypass by the replicative polymerase results in the incorporation of A across the missing base, which leads to a G to T transversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Interestingly, the MMS-induced mutation profile at G:C base pairs in WT yeast not only includes G-&gt; T mutations but also high levels of G-&gt; A and G-&gt; C mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that 7meG-derived AP sites are unlikely to cause these mutations. Deletion of <italic>CSM2</italic> results in a similar spectrum of MMS-induced G:C substitutions compared to that observed in WT yeast, but at elevated frequency, indicating that the Shu complex mediates tolerance of the same MMS-induced lesion that contributes to G:C base pair mutagenesis in WT cells, possibly N3-methylcytosine (3meC). 3meC is a mutagenic DNA adduct predominantly induced by MMS at ssDNA and can block the replicative polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shrivastav et al., 2010</xref>).

Additionally, lesions subject to preferential repair of the transcribed DNA strand by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) can also display transcriptional asymmetry (i.e. having higher mutation densities on the non-transcribed strand compared to the transcribed strand). Therefore, we evaluated whether mutations from our whole genome sequenced yeast displayed either transcriptional or replicative asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

The transcriptional asymmetry of A:T mutations in MMS-treated <italic>mag1</italic>∆ yeast results from TC-NER activity on unrepaired 3meA, indicating that the Shu complex may help prevent mutations associated with 3meA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beranek, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sikora et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wyatt and Pittman, 2006</xref>). However, increased mutagenesis of the minor ssDNA-specific lesion <italic>N</italic><sup>1</sup>-methyl adenine (1meA) would also be expected to produce higher mutation densities on the non-transcribed strand. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that 1meA contributes to the increased MMS-induced mutation rate in <italic>csm2Δ</italic> cells. G:C mutations in MMS-treated WT yeast displayed little to no transcriptional or replicative strand asymmetry, while the same mutations in MMS-exposed <italic>csm2</italic>∆ cells exhibited both types of strand bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The transcriptional asymmetry displayed higher densities of C mutations on the non-transcribed strand, consistent with either TC-NER removal of 3meC or preferential formation of 3meCs on the transiently ssDNA non-transcribed strand, instead of an asymmetry derived for TC-NER of 7meG. To determine if the transcriptional asymmetry, of the G:C mutations, is due to increased 3meC on the non-transcribed strand or the result TC-NER activity, we measured the frequency and spectra of MMS-induced mutations selected in the <italic>CAN1</italic> gene in <italic>csm2</italic>∆ and <italic>csm2</italic>∆ <italic>rad26</italic>∆ yeast.

This may suggest that either TC-NER can function within this region or some ssDNA is assessable on the non-transcribed strand due to the binding of TFIIH to the promoter region upstream of the TSS. Likewise, replicative asymmetry indicated elevated C mutations associated with the lagging strand template across the yeast genome, suggesting that 3meC lesions formed during lagging strand synthesis are bypassed in an error-free manner in Shu proficient yeast.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Transcriptional and replicative strand biases of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)-induced substitutions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The density of A mutations (i.e. the fraction of A bases mutated) or C mutations on the transcribed (blue) and non-transcribed (orange) strand across yeast transcripts in wild-type (WT) and <italic>csm2∆</italic> cells.

This family is conserved from bacteria to humans; however, no yeast homolog has been found. Therefore, as of yet, it remains unknown how yeast tolerates and repairs the highly toxic 3meC.

In this <italic>RAD55</italic> mutant, three serine residues (2,8,14) are mutated to alanine residues (<italic>rad55-S2,8,14A</italic>). Since the <italic>rad55-S2,8,14A</italic> mutant cells largely phenocopy the defects observed in a Shu complex mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herzberg et al., 2006</xref>), we asked whether Rad55 function in MMS-induced DNA damage may be uncoupled from its role in canonical DSB repair.

To further investigate the genetic relationship between the Shu complex and Rad55, we combined either <italic>rad55</italic>∆ or <italic>rad55-S2,8,14A</italic> with a <italic>csm2</italic>∆ mutant.

This observation is surprising since the Shu complex is thought to function downstream of Rad55. However, it is consistent with the specificity of the Shu complex in directly recognizing and enabling tolerance of MMS-induced DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosenbaum et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Rad55 directly interacts with Csm2-Psy3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaines et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Godin et al., 2013</xref>). While Rad55-S2,8,14A mutant maintains its protein interactions with Rad57, Rad51, and Rad52, its interaction with the Shu complex has yet to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herzberg et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the Shu complex may help recruit Rad55 to specific MMS-induced DNA lesions by interacting with phosphorylated Rad55 or at the interface where Rad55 is phosphorylated. To test this, we performed Y2H analysis of Rad55 or Rad55-S2,8,14A with Csm2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Interestingly, we observe a reduced interaction between Rad55-S2,8,14A with Csm2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Unfortunately, we were unable to confirm the Rad55-Csm2 interaction by co-immunoprecipitation, perhaps because the interaction is transient and is best observed by Y2H or in vitro pulldowns. These results suggest that Rad55 phosphorylation may stimulate its interaction with Csm2 or that Csm2 interacts with Rad55 in that region. In the context of MMS-induced DNA damage, our findings suggest that the Shu complex is likely contributing to the recognition of specific MMS-induced lesions and recruiting the HR machinery, such as Rad55-Rad57, to the lesion to facilitate their bypass and enable their repair following replication. Furthermore, other factors, such as a stalled replication fork, may also contribute to their recruitment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Among the many alkylation-induced DNA lesions, 3meC is notable for its cytotoxic and mutagenic impact during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nieminuszczy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shrivastav et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sikora et al., 2010</xref>). In eukaryotes, the adduct is formed endogenously from <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl methionine (SAM) reactivity with DNA and from the enzymatic activity of DNA methyltransferases, and exogenously from alkylating agents such as nitrosamines, which are present in the tobacco smoke, temozolomide, or MMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee and Walker, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dango et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pataillot-Meakin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rošić et al., 2018</xref>). 3meC occurs primarily in ssDNA and can stall the replicative polymerases. Unlike bacteria and higher eukaryotes, yeast does not encode for an enzyme capable of directly repairing 3meC from ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Admiraal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sedgwick et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, yeast relies on bypass mechanisms to complete DNA replication. Here, we utilized the budding yeast model to demonstrate that the Shu complex facilitates an HR-mediated error-free bypass of alkylation damage, including 3meC and AP sites, to prevent mutagenesis and toxicity.</p><p>The Shu complex is primarily involved in the tolerance of replicative base-template damage, being dispensable for DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ball et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Godin et al., 2016b</xref>). This makes the Shu complex ideal to dissect the role of HR during bypass of specific base lesions. The major phenotypes observed in MMS-exposed Shu complex disrupted cells are decreased cell survival and elevated mutation frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ball et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Godin et al., 2016c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shor et al., 2005</xref>).

This <italic>ALKBH2</italic> rescue is partial, which is consistent with the Shu complex role in tolerance of another MMS-induced lesion, an AP site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Godin et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosenbaum et al., 2019</xref>). We also note that in some cases alkbh2-CD-expressing cells exhibit more mutations than the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>). These results suggest that perhaps alkbh2-CD may interfere with the processing of 3meC. Although it is not possible to specifically induce 3meC, it is possible to regulate the occurrence of its template, by controlling the amount of ssDNA in MMS-exposed cells. It would be interesting to observe how the rescue by expression of <italic>ALKBH2</italic> correlates with the amount of ssDNA. Consistently, our results show that <italic>ALKBH2</italic> is only able to rescue the MMS sensitivity of Shu complex mutant cells that are progressing through S-phase and therefore exhibit ssDNA intermediates and when an HR-dependent error tolerance occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>When a replication fork stalls, the replicative helicase and polymerase can uncouple, and ssDNA can form behind the fork on the lagging strand. To analyze a fork-like substrate in vitro, we previously analyzed different types of forks including double-flap, 5' flap, 3' flap, and static flaps, and observe similar binding affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosenbaum et al., 2019</xref>). A double-flap substrate could parallel the uncoupling of the helicase and polymerase. We previously showed that the Shu complex bind to a double-flap substrate containing an AP site mimetic on the ssDNA lagging strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosenbaum et al., 2019</xref>). While we did not observe increased binding affinity for a double-flap with 3meC and 1meA with Csm2-Psy3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), other factors may contribute to binding such as the other Shu complex members or the Rad51 paralogs, Rad55-Rad57. In support of this model, a connection between the human RAD51 paralog, RAD51C, and ALKBH3 was recently described where RAD51C was important for the recruitment of ALKBH3 to DNA with 3meC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mohan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The error-free PRR pathway requires polyubiquitination of PCNA by Mms2-Ubc13-Rad5 and the activity of the core HR machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Branzei and Szakal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2015</xref>).

Since 3meC is often observed as the main lesion contributing to mutagenesis from MMS in ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2010</xref>) (i.e. 3meC produces more mutations than 1meA), then one would expect MMS-induced G:C mutations to predominate if 1meA was the primarily mutagenic lesion at A:T lesions that the Shu complex helps to bypass. Thus, the similarity in the A:T substitution patterns induced by MMS in WT and <italic>csm2</italic>∆ yeast is likely due to the majority of mutations stemming from 3meA lesions in both cases.</p><p>Whether the similarity in the MMS-induced G:C substitution pattern in WT and <italic>csm2</italic>∆ cells is likewise due to the mutations in both cases stemming from the same lesions is less clear. While the observed substitution pattern for MMS-induced G:C substitutions is generally inconsistent with a mutagenic mechanism, 7meG lesions are converted to AP sites prior to substitution event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and 7meG lesions themselves are frequently thought to be non-mutagenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shrivastav et al., 2010</xref>), recent determination of MMS-induced mutation spectra in ssDNA indicates that some base substitutions in WT yeast are caused by lesions on G bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saini et al., 2020</xref>). Based on the expected lesion abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drabløs et al., 2004</xref>), these mutations would likely be caused by 7meG directly or due to the combined effects of several of its spontaneously formed chemical derivatives. This mutation spectrum is complementary to previously established spectra for 3meC-induced mutations in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2010</xref>), making it difficult to assess whether G:C substitutions in MMS-treated WT yeast or <italic>csm2</italic>∆ cells are due to 7meG lesions or 3meC lesions formed in transient ssDNA based on substitution patterns alone. In the case of MMS-induced mutations in <italic>csm2</italic>∆ cells, the additional transcriptional and replicative asymmetries are suggestive of the Shu complex protecting against mutations induced by 3meC (i.e. more frequent mutation of C in strands expected to be more often transiently single-stranded). The ability to observe this strand bias requires the lesions causing the bias must constitute a relatively large portion of the G:C substitutions; and the additional suppression of MMS-induced toxicity in <italic>csm2</italic>∆ cells by ALKBH2 expression confirms that at least some of the mutations are 3meC-derived. However, evidence of strand bias does not exclude the possibility that 7meG also induces error-free lesion bypass mediated through the Shu complex and contributes to the MMS-induced mutation spectra observed in WT and <italic>csm2</italic>∆ yeast.</p><p>A previous study claimed that yeast <italic>TPA1</italic> is an AlKB homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shivange et al., 2014</xref>). However, in our hands, and consistent with a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Admiraal et al., 2019</xref>), <italic>tpa1Δ</italic> cells show no increased sensitivity to MMS. Furthermore, unlike other genes that are involved in repairing MMS-induced lesions, we find that <italic>TPA1</italic> does not exhibit a synthetic sick phenotype with Shu complex mutants upon MMS exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Recently, the Mag1 glycosylase was shown to excise 3meC in dsDNA, therefore, initiating their repair through BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Admiraal et al., 2019</xref>). However, Mag1 cannot excise 3meCs from ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Admiraal et al., 2019</xref>). Whole genome sequencing of MMS-treated <italic>mag1∆</italic> yeast also contains primarily an elevation of substitutions at A:T base pairs indicating that Mag1 activity in yeast contributes little to protecting against 3meC-induced mutations. This is likely due to the restriction of these lesions to ssDNA and highlights the need for a mechanism to bypass this lesion during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Mag1 likely plays a significant role in the removal of 3meC from dsDNA after its Shu complex-mediated bypass allows replication to be completed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Previous work from our group and others shows that the Shu complex role is functionally conserved in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abreu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martino and Bernstein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martino et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, human cells containing Shu complex deletions are sensitive to MMS and DNA alkylating agents. Therefore, future studies will address whether the human Shu complex functions as a backup of the ALKBH enzymes in tolerating mutagenesis and toxicity from 3meC. This is of particular importance since both <italic>ALKBH2</italic> and <italic>ALKBH3</italic> have been proposed as tumor suppressors, being silenced in various tumors, including gastric and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fedeles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knijnenburg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stefansson et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>ALKBH3</italic> is often overexpressed in different cancers and inhibition of <italic>ALKBH2</italic> and <italic>ALKBH3</italic> can sensitize cancer cells to alkylating chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koike et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tasaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, the upregulation of <italic>ALKBH2</italic> and <italic>ALKBH3</italic> mediates the resistance to chemotherapeutic agents such as temozolomide and <italic>ALKBH3</italic> loss leads to endogenous 3meC accumulation in tumors cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cetica et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dango et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johannessen et al., 2013</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The Bernstein lab has made relevant contributions to understand the role of the Shu complex in HR-mediated repair. In this new study, the authors show that Shu is critical for 3meC damage tolerance in yeast and that expression of human ALKBH2, responsible for the repair of 3meC rescues the MMS-sensitivity of Shu mutants but not that of HR mutants. It is a provocative idea that the Shu complex may directly detect alkylated bases, such as 3-methylC, as well as various DNA repair intermediates. The study is relevant for the DDR field and merits publication, provided that the following suggestions or questions are attended.</p><p>1. Would the mutation rate of the double mutants csm2 mag1 show an increase compared to single mutants? These data can be added. Analysis of can1 resistant mutants would work.</p><p>2. The transcriptional asymmetry displaying higher densities of C mutations on the NT strand consistent with either TC-NER or preferential formation of 3meC in NT can be tested using rad26 csm2 double mutants. Analysis of mutations at the can1 gene should be sufficient. Alternatively, if authors have a system to turn transcription OFF and ON to study mutations, they can study mutations in both conditions.</p><p>3. A view of certain regions, like CAN1, showing all mutations, would be good to figure out clustering of mutations, if any, and some other parameters.</p><p>4. What's the effect of ALKB2 on the mutation rate in HR mutants in MMS? One at least could be tested.</p><p>5. A parallel study on the mutation rate (can-resistant mutations would work) in MMS-untreated and treated cells should be done for rad55 csm2 and rad55-SA csm2 mutants tested in (Figure 5). Could the MMS sensitivity of the rad55-SA allele be reproduced from the previous work?</p><p>6. While the Y2H is a good approach, co-IP is necessary to conclude the reduced interaction of Rad55-SA with Csm2.</p><p>7. It would strengthen the impact of the work if the mechanism could be extended to other types of DNA lesions. In other words, does Csm2-Psy3 also bind to other types of lesions in ssDNA/flapped DNA?</p><p>8. Line 296-298: The WT +/- ALKBH2 should be included in figure 4A to support this conclusion.</p><p>9. The mutation spectra is very similar in the presence and absence of csm2. Is this true? Did authors collect sufficient data with the WT strain to quantitatively compare mutation spectra? This would be interesting to address directly in the manuscript. This has implications for the function of csm2 if it were to be more important for specific types of mutation events.</p><p>10. What is the physiological significance of a double-flap structure? It would have helped to have some minimal discussion of how this type of structure might form. Is there greater specificity for binding of the Shu-complex to abasic sites or alkylated sites in a single flap that might mimic a stalled replication fork. It feels like a lot is made of this 2-fold difference in binding affinity and not enough attention to what might be present in the cell for the Shu complex to recognize. It is very surprising that there is a big anisotropy change with a labeled single strand oligo. Does this indicate that Shu is binding to the entire 5' flap, including the label? It is stated that the raw binding data is provided, but I could not find it in the supplemental tables. I would have liked to see how total fluorescence might change as a function of protein concentration. I also noticed that Kd values are different in each sequential paper. This could be due to improved protein quality, but it would be helpful to spend more attention to the quality of the protein. If the protein binds tightly, then it is beneficial to perform a binding assay under high concentration of DNA in order to determine the amount of protein capable of binding the DNA. This would be an excellent biochemical assay to compare different sources of protein.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68080.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Analysis of can1 resistant mutants would work.</p></disp-quote><p>The mutation rate for csm2 mag1 double mutants was determined in Godin et al., NAR. The rate of MMS-induced mutation is increased in the csm2 mag1 double mutants compared to the csm2 and mag1 single mutants. In the revision to this manuscript, we generated MMS-induced <italic>CAN1</italic> mutation spectra for the csm2, mag1, and csm2 mag1 double mutants. This data has been added to Figure 1—figure supplement 3. We found that the csm2 mag1 double mutants have a mutation spectrum similar to the mag1 single mutants, but different from the csm2 single mutant. This is due to csm2 mag1 double mutants and mag1 double mutants having more substitutions at A:T base pairs, presumably due to the lack of repair mechanisms for 3meA. This data further supports a role for the Shu complex in the error-free bypass of 3meA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

This data has been added in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. It indicates that co-deletion of rad26 with csm2 does not significantly increase the <italic>CAN1</italic> mutation rate above that of csm2. Additionally, substitutions in <italic>CAN1</italic> of MMS-treated csm2-deficiency yeast favor C-based mutations in the NT over G-based mutations (which would be C in the transcribed strand). This slight transcriptional asymmetry was still present in the csm2 rad26 strain, suggesting that the transcriptional asymmetry of C mutations is due to the preferential formation of 3meC on the NT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. A view of certain regions, like CAN1, showing all mutations, would be good to figure out clustering of mutations, if any, and some other parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the selection bias that would occur for mutations in CAN1 that were obtained by selecting for canavanine-resistance, we decided to create a graphical representation of non-selected MMS-induced mutations in whole genome sequencing of WT and csm2-deficient yeast on chromosome V. This graphic nicely shows the increased density of mutations in the csm2Δ isolates compared to WT yeast. However, no obvious clustering was observed. This data is now in Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. What's the effect of ALKB2 on the mutation rate in HR mutants in MMS? One at least could be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this valuable suggestion. We have tested the effect of ALKBH2 on the mutation rate in <italic>rad51∆</italic> cells (New Figure 5C). As predicted by our model, the mutation rate of MMS-treated <italic>rad51∆</italic> cells is significantly reduced when ALKBH2 is expressed but not with the catalytically inactive ALKBH2 mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. A parallel study on the mutation rate (can-resistant mutations would work) in MMS-untreated and treated cells should be done for rad55 csm2 and rad55-SA csm2 mutants tested in (Figure 5). Could the MMS sensitivity of the rad55-SA allele be reproduced from the previous work?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have now included the results of a <italic>CAN1</italic> mutagenesis assay for untreated and MMS-treated <italic>rad55∆ csm2∆</italic> and <italic>rad55-SA csm2∆</italic> mutant cells (New Figure 5F). Consistent with our MMS sensitivity assay, the <italic>rad55-SA csm2∆</italic> double mutant cells showed no increased spontaneous or MMS-induced mutation rates compared to the <italic>csm2∆</italic> single mutant cells.</p><p>As the reviewer noted, the MMS sensitivity of the rad55-SA allele is reproducible from prior work from the Heyer lab (Hertzberg et al., (2006) MCB 26(22): 8396; Figure 3A). Although we observe less sensitivity at 0.02% relative to the 0.03% (Figure 5E). This small difference could be due to the Heyer lab incubating their plates for 8 days at 20°C whereas we grew ours at 30°C for 48 hours. Overall, the findings are the same and reproducible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. While the Y2H is a good approach, co-IP is necessary to conclude the reduced interaction of Rad55-SA with Csm2.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that a co-IP would be a wonderful complementary approach to the Y2H. However, the interaction between Rad55 and Csm2 has been shown by Y2H and direct in vitro pull-downs, and we have failed to detect it by co-IP despite several attempts by multiple individuals. We have tried by pulling down on either Rad55 or Csm2, as well as treating the cells with MMS and using S-phase synchronized cells as well. It is possible that this interaction, despite its importance, is too transient or weak to be detected by co-IP. We have now addressed this point in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. It would strengthen the impact of the work if the mechanism could be extended to other types of DNA lesions. In other words, does Csm2-Psy3 also bind to other types of lesions in ssDNA/flapped DNA?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is important to examine multiple substrates with a myriad of MMS-induced lesions. We have had substantial delays in receiving modified oligos due to COVID-19 and supply chain issues from the vendors. For example, it took 7 months to get the one 3meC substrate and we were unable to examine this modification at other locations in the DNA. Similarly, it took 4 months to receive the 1meA substrate. We have now performed the equilibrium titrations with both 3meC and 1meA and while we observe binding, we do not observe an increase in binding affinity. More details regarding these findings are addressed in the points below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Line 296-298: The WT +/- ALKBH2 should be included in figure 4A to support this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included data from MMS-treated WT cells with and without ALKBH2 (New Figure 4A, lanes 1-3). As expected, we observe a slight but not significant difference between the mutation rates of WT with or without ALKBH2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The mutation spectra is very similar in the presence and absence of csm2. Is this true? Did authors collect sufficient data with the WT strain to quantitatively compare mutation spectra? This would be interesting to address directly in the manuscript. This has implications for the function of csm2 if it were to be more important for specific types of mutation events.</p></disp-quote><p>We identified ~2400 MMS-induced mutations in WT yeast and ~8800 MMS-induced mutations in csm2-deficient yeast. These numbers of mutations are sufficient to quantitatively compare the mutation spectra. It is true that the WT and csm2 spectra are very similar, except that csm2-deficient yeasts have many more mutations. This is likely due to A:T mutations in WT and csm2-deficient yeast being both caused by 3meA and C:G mutations being caused by a possible combination of both 3meC and 7meG. 7meG and 3meC can produce similar mutation substitution patterns. The role of the Shu complex in bypassing multiple MMS-induced lesions is now discussed in the discussion of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.

It feels like a lot is made of this 2-fold difference in binding affinity and not enough attention to what might be present in the cell for the Shu complex to recognize.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and have now clarified this point. When a replication fork stalls, the replicative helicase, and polymerase can uncouple and ssDNA can form behind the fork on the lagging strand. Our previous studies in Rosenbaum et al., 2019 showed that the DNA binding subunits Csm2-Psy3 bind similarly to double-flap, 5’ flap, 3’ flap, and static flaps (Rosenbaum et al., (2019) Nature Communications, 3515; Supplementary Figure 5B). Our in vivo data supports the model that the Shu complex functions preferentially on the lagging strand and to enable error-free bypass of multiple MMS-induced DNA lesions in this context. We have now addressed these points in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is very surprising that there is a big anisotropy change with a labeled single strand oligo. Does this indicate that Shu is binding to the entire 5' flap, including the label?</p></disp-quote><p>While there is a substantial change in anisotropy, this assay does not provide information regarding where the Shu complex binds on this oligonucleotide. We have tried to determine stoichiometry using several different approaches. We tried FAM fluorescence and anisotropy under stoichiometric conditions (saturating DNA concentrations, 1 µM). We have also tried atomic force microscopy and structural studies but have not been successful to date.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is stated that the raw binding data is provided, but I could not find it in the supplemental tables. I would have liked to see how total fluorescence might change as a function of protein concentration.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight; the anisotropy files have been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also noticed that Kd values are different in each sequential paper.

This would be an excellent biochemical assay to compare different sources of protein.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, our initial studies in the first draft of this manuscript were performed with a protein preparation that aggregated and thus we thought that the binding affinity was increased due to increased protein purity. Our updated purification protocol has been added in the manuscript in the Materials and methods. We fixed this aggregation by modulating our purification scheme, performed binding assays with three preparations of recombinant Csm2-Psy3, and now observe binding isotherms consistent with our previous publications (Rosenbaum et al., 2019).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that understanding the stoichiometry is important for understanding how Csm2-Psy3 binds to double-flap substrates. We have tried to perform stoichiometric titrations with higher concentrations of DNA (400 nM and 1 uM) but the protein at these salt concentrations aggregates and this, unfortunately, prohibits obtaining stoichiometries.</p></body></sub-article></article>
