organelles present on the majority of neurons in the mammalian brain throughout adulthood. Recent evidence suggests that cilia regulate multiple aspects of neuronal development, including the maintenance of neuronal connectivity. However, whether ciliary signals can dynamically modulate postnatal circuit excitability is unknown. Here we show that acute cell-autonomous knockdown of ciliary signaling rapidly strengthens glutamatergic inputs onto cultured rat neocortical pyramidal neurons and increases spontaneous firing. This increased excitability occurs without changes to passive neuronal properties or intrinsic excitability. Further, the neuropeptide receptor somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) is localized nearly exclusively to excitatory neuron cilia both <italic>in vivo</italic> and in culture, and pharmacological manipulation of SSTR3 signaling bidirectionally modulates excitatory synaptic inputs onto these neurons. Our results indicate that ciliary neuropeptidergic signaling dynamically modulates excitatory synapses and suggest that defects in this regulation may underlie a subset of behavioral and cognitive disorders associated with ciliopathies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>neuropeptide</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>SSTR3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM122463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sengupta</surname><given-names>Piali</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 MH118464</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turrigiano</surname><given-names>Gina G</given-names></name><name><surname>Sengupta</surname><given-names>Piali</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 NS111562</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turrigiano</surname><given-names>Gina G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neuropeptidergic signaling via cilia-localized receptors dynamically regulates excitatory synaptic drive in postnatal rat neocortical pyramidal neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Primary cilia are microtubule-based compartmentalized organelles that are present on nearly all mammalian cell types including neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gerdes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Louvi and Grove, 2011</xref>). Cilia concentrate signaling molecules and play critical roles in transducing environmental stimuli to regulate cellular properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bangs and Anderson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elliott and Brugmann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hilgendorf et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, disruption of cilia and cilia-based signaling is causal to a set of pleiotropic disorders termed ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis and Katsanis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Youn and Han, 2018</xref>). Abnormalities in brain development are a characteristic feature of many ciliopathies, highlighting the critical role of cilia in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guemez-Gamboa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Louvi and Grove, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Valente et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Youn and Han, 2018</xref>). Cilia have now been implicated in neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and establishment of synaptic connectivity during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baudoin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chizhikov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Higginbotham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Higginbotham et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Spassky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Willaredt et al., 2008</xref>). Intriguingly, cilia along with their complex signaling machinery are retained on mature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arellano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guadiana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sterpka and Chen, 2018</xref>), but whether ciliary signaling dynamically modulates mature neuronal properties has not been explored.</p><p>Recent studies have begun to implicate cilia in the establishment as well as maintenance of circuit connectivity and excitability in the postnatal brain. Loss of cilia and ciliary signaling results in defects in dendritic development and integration of adult born neurons into hippocampal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kumamoto et al., 2012</xref>). Disruption of ciliary signaling also reduces dendritic complexity and affects synaptic connectivity of interneurons in the postnatal striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, cilia loss in mature dentate granule cells leads to altered contextual memory and synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rhee et al., 2016</xref>). In a particularly interesting study, cilia in cerebellar Purkinje neurons were shown to be necessary for the maintenance of excitatory contacts from the climbing fibers of neurons in the inferior olivary nuclei of the medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowie and Goetz, 2020</xref>). In these reports, the effects on neuronal and circuit properties, and on synaptogenesis and synapse maintenance, manifested after prolonged (weeks to months) loss of cilia and/or ciliary signaling in the postnatal brain. Whether ciliary signaling can modulate synaptic properties on a more rapid timescale to adjust neuron and circuit excitability is unknown.</p><p>Neuronal cilia in different brain regions specifically localize a diverse set of neuropeptide and neurotransmitter receptors. Cilia-localized receptors in the brain include serotonin receptor 6, melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1, somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3), and dopamine receptors D1, D2, and D5 among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berbari et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brailov et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Domire et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hamon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Händel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Loktev and Jackson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Marley and von Zastrow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schulz et al., 2000</xref>). Signaling via these ciliary receptors is proposed to be mediated in part via regulation of adenylyl cyclase 3 (AC3) and the cAMP second messenger. Similar to the localization patterns of these receptors, AC3 is also specifically enriched in the cilia of diverse neuron types in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berbari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guadiana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bishop et al., 2007</xref>). Mutations in these receptors and AC3 are associated with a range of cognitive, metabolic, and behavioral disorders that are hallmarks of many ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Einstein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lee and Gleeson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Loktev and Jackson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Youn and Han, 2018</xref>). These receptors continue to be expressed in neuronal cilia in adults, and many of the cognate neurotransmitter and neuropeptide ligands are released locally by neurons or modulatory inputs, suggesting that cell–to-cell signaling through cilia-localized receptors plays an important role in the postnatal brain.</p><p>Neuronal circuits must maintain excitability within narrow bounds to prevent signal saturation or silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2000</xref>), but the mechanisms that establish and dynamically maintain circuit excitability over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales are incompletely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Turrigiano, 2017</xref>). Several ciliopathies manifest with symptoms consistent with imbalances in excitability, such as cognitive impairment and recurrent epileptic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guemez-Gamboa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lee and Gleeson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Novarino et al., 2011</xref>). These observations suggest the intriguing hypothesis that ciliary signaling plays an important role in adjusting neuronal excitability, either by altering intrinsic excitability through modulation of ion channel function or distribution, or by regulating the properties of excitatory or inhibitory synapses. The notion that neuropeptide and neurotransmitter release might converge on cilia to dynamically adjust intrinsic or synaptic properties, and thus modulate circuit excitability, has not been tested.</p><p>Here, we show that disruption of cilia and ciliary signaling in individual postnatal cortical pyramidal neurons in primary neuronal culture rapidly (&lt;24 hr) and cell-autonomously strengthens excitatory synapses onto these neurons. Consistent with enhanced excitatory transmission, acute loss of cilia results in increased neuronal firing without affecting intrinsic neuronal excitability. In contrast to previous findings from chronic cilia disruption, acute cilia disruption has no major impact on dendritic arborization. We find that the SSTR3 neuropeptide receptor is specifically localized to the cilia of excitatory cortical neurons but not inhibitory interneuron subtypes, and that an SSTR3-selective antagonist and agonist bidirectionally modulate excitatory synaptic properties over similarly rapid timescales. Our results indicate that neuropeptidergic signaling via cilia-localized receptors dynamically modulates synaptic strength and plays a critical role in regulating neuronal excitability in the postnatal mammalian brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neuronal morphology is unaffected upon acute disruption of ciliary signaling in the postnatal cortex</title><p>Ciliogenesis in neocortical pyramidal neurons occurs progressively during early postnatal development, beginning at birth, with cilia reaching maximal lengths after several weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arellano et al., 2012</xref>).

After 11 days in vitro (DIV), the majority of cortical neurons extended a single primary cilium from their soma, as assessed via staining with the neuronal cilia markers ARL13B and AC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berbari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bishop et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caspary et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sipos et al., 2018</xref>). To ask whether cilia distribution and length are similar between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, we quantified the percentage of GAD67-positive (inhibitory interneurons) and GAD67-negative (excitatory) neurons containing cilia. Approximately 90% of both cell types exhibited cilia of lengths similar to those of postnatal neocortical neurons in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arellano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>).

To perturb cilia in a cell-autonomous manner, we transfected DIV9-10 cortical cultures at low efficiency (5–10 neurons transfected/dish) with GFP alone, or GFP and one of two shRNAs targeting the ciliary small GTPase Arl13b (shArl13b_1 and shArl13b_2).

We tested this by recording AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), which represent the postsynaptic response to release of individual vesicles of glutamate; the amplitude of these currents is a direct correlate of postsynaptic strength. To isolate and measure mEPSCs, we obtained whole cell voltage clamp recordings from DIV11 control or shArl13b-transfected neurons in the presence of tetrodotoxin (to block spike-mediated release), APV (to block NMDA receptor-mediated currents), and picrotoxin (to block GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated currents) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left).

Intrinsic excitability is controlled by the balance of voltage-gated ion channels in the cell membrane which determine how many action potentials a neuron fires for a given amount of depolarizing current. To determine whether cilia disruption impacts the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons, we pharmacologically blocked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents (see Materials and methods), injected direct current steps to evoke spikes, and then plotted the number of spikes evoked as a function of injected current to generate firing rate vs current (F–I) curves. Knockdown of ARL13B had no significant impact on intrinsic excitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Taken together with the lack of an effect on passive neuronal properties and dendritic arborization, these data show that intrinsic neuronal excitability and morphology are unaffected by acute and cell-autonomous manipulation of cilia.

P15–16 animals were injected with a GFP-expressing AAV viral vector, and 7 days later, brain slices were examined via immunostaining. GFP-expressing pyramidal neurons were identified by their characteristic morphologies, and primary cilia were co-labeled with antibodies against AC3 and SSTR3.

To manipulate SSTR3 signaling, we took advantage of the previously described SSTR3-selective agonist (L-796,778) and antagonist (MK-4256), which can bidirectionally regulate SSTR3-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">He et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Rohrer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rohrer and Schaeffer, 2000</xref>) (see Materials and methods). We treated DIV10-11 neuronal cultures for varying periods of time with either the agonist or antagonist, and then fixed and stained for excitatory pre- and post-synaptic markers. Since not all neurons in culture express detectable SSTR3 in their cilia, we additionally immunostained with antibodies against SSTR3 and confined our analysis to neurons with robust SSTR3 expression. Because of species overlap between antibodies, we used Shank3 as the postsynaptic marker for these experiments; Shank3 specifically localizes to excitatory synapses and the intensity of synaptic Shank3 is correlated with postsynaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Monteiro and Feng, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tatavarty et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Verpelli et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Manipulating SSTR3 signaling induced bidirectional changes in the intensity of both Shank3 and VGlut1 at colocalized sites that developed over several hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We tested whether the effects of pharmacological manipulation of SSTR3 on synaptic strength are mediated through ciliary signaling. We knocked down cilia function, applied the SSTR3 agonist, and quantified the intensity of the excitatory synaptic marker Shank3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Neurons were transfected with GFP alone or with shIft88 and shCep164 for 48 hr, treated with DMSO (control) or SSTR3 agonist for 24 hr, and were then fixed and immunolabeled with antibodies against Shank3 and SSTR3. SSTR3 labeling could be detected in many but not all of the shortened cilia of shRNA-transfected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), indicating that this receptor retained localization to these truncated cilia. Consistent with our previous data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), the SSTR3 agonist decreased the fluorescence intensity of Shank3 puncta in control (GFP-expressing) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, in hairpin-expressing neurons with truncated cilia, the intensity of the Shank3 signal was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), also as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, the SSTR3 agonist was not able to reduce Shank3 intensity in neurons with truncated cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Together, these data suggest that SSTR3-mediated modulation of excitatory synapses likely relies on proper cilia function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We show here that cilia play a critical role in the maintenance of neuronal excitability in the postnatal cortex. Acute disruption of ciliary signaling cell-autonomously and rapidly strengthens excitatory synapses onto glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, without affecting inhibitory synapses. Consequently, neurons with disrupted cilia have more and stronger excitatory synapses, and increased mean firing rates. We find that the SSTR3 neuropeptide receptor is selectively localized to the cilia of cortical excitatory neurons, and that inhibition or activation of ciliary SSTR3-mediated signaling bidirectionally modulates excitatory synapses onto these neurons on similar rapid hours-long timescales. Our results indicate that neuropeptidergic signaling via cilia-localized receptors can dynamically modulate neuronal excitability, and raise the possibility that disorders arising from altered E/I balance in cortical circuits may in part be due to defects in cilia function in the postnatal mammalian brain.</p><p>We find that acute and cell-autonomous cilia perturbation affects excitatory synapses onto pyramidal neurons, without impacting dendritic inhibitory synapse number, dendritic arborization, intrinsic neuronal excitability, or passive neuronal properties. Thus, this rapid ciliary signaling pathway appears to be specific for the regulation of excitatory synapses, although we are unable to exclude the possibility that the extent of ciliary knockdown may be insufficient to modulate inhibitory synapses on this rapid timescale. There are many neocortical inhibitory interneuron types that synapse onto specific postsynaptic domains of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Urban-Ciecko and Barth, 2016</xref>), and some classes of inhibitory synapses may be affected. Nevertheless, the net impact of the observed synaptic changes leads to increased firing rates, suggesting that any effects on inhibition also contribute to this enhanced excitability, or are not sufficient to counteract changes in excitatory synaptic drive. It is also currently unknown whether ciliary signaling in neocortical GABAergic interneurons similarly rapidly modulates their synaptic or intrinsic properties. We speculate that cell type-specific ciliary signaling pathways that integrate distinct extracellular cues may also have important roles in neocortical interneuron subtypes. In this work, we describe the direct and cell-autonomous impact of ciliary signaling in pyramidal neurons. It is likely that the circuit-level impact on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic loops, and thus on circuit excitability, will be more complex in ciliopathies that affect cilia function in all neocortical cell types.</p><p>SSTR3 is selectively enriched in the cilia of excitatory neurons, with rare expression in inhibitory neuron cilia. SOM+ interneurons are present throughout cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Urban-Ciecko and Barth, 2016</xref>), suggesting that these interneurons may modulate excitatory neurons via cilia localized SSTR3. Since AC3 is present in the cilia of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, inhibitory neuron cilia are likely to contain a distinct complement of signaling proteins. Neuronal cilia in the brain express Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling components, dopamine and serotonin receptor subtypes, as well as subsets of neuropeptide and neurohormone receptors in a brain region- and cell type-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berbari et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brailov et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Domire et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Green et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hamon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Händel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Koemeter-Cox et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Loktev and Jackson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sipos et al., 2018</xref>). Adding to this complexity, ciliary localization of these molecules can be dynamically modulated by extracellular signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bangs and Anderson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Domire et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Green et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nachury, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Najafi and Calvert, 2012</xref>). Thus, as in olfactory neurons and photoreceptors, central neurons likely actively regulate the targeting and localization of ciliary signal transduction proteins as a function of cell type, developmental stage, and context. This dynamic control of cilia signaling protein content in turn likely allows these organelles to appropriately sense changing extracellular cues and transduce these cues to regulate diverse aspects of neuronal development and function.</p><p>There is now increasing evidence of a link between cilia and the establishment and long-term maintenance of synapses in the brain. Prolonged loss of cilia signaling (weeks to months) in multiple brain regions has been shown to result in defects in the maintenance of dendritic and axonal morphology, loss of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connectivity, and neuronal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowie and Goetz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kumamoto et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, we find that loss of ciliary signaling on acute timescales of hours to days in cultured neocortical pyramidal neurons rapidly alters excitatory synaptic properties without any apparent effects on dendritic morphology. Our results suggest that neuropeptidergic signaling via ciliary receptors continuously modulates neuronal excitability in the mature brain. In future, precise temporal manipulation of cilia function in vivo may identify the molecular pathways by which ciliary signaling regulates synapse function and maintenance on different timescales.</p><p>How might neuropeptidergic signaling from a cilium located on the soma be transmitted to regulate different aspects of synaptic function?

Similar transcription-dependent mechanisms may also underlie cilia-driven regulation of network connectivity. On more rapid timescales, ciliary signaling may modulate synaptic strength via posttranslational regulation of synaptic protein function. For instance, cAMP- and calcium-dependent kinases such as PKA and CaMKII modulate synaptic plasticity via direct phosphorylation of AMPAR subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buonarati et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Herring and Nicoll, 2016</xref>); the functions of one or both of these kinases at synapses could be modulated by signals from cilia.

Cilia were labeled with two markers and fluorescence intensity was quantified from ROIs using either Metamorph (Molecular Devices) or ImageJ (NIH). Background fluorescence was subtracted using ROIs from the cell soma or from regions without neurons. Total fluorescence per ROI was averaged and normalized to control treatments. Quantification of synaptic protein intensity and synapse density was performed similar to our published procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gainey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tatavarty et al., 2020</xref>). Images were taken distal to the primary branch point of apical-like dendrites to ensure uniformity across samples. Analyses of synaptic protein intensity were performed using the Granularity application module in Metamorph; granules with a minimum overlap of 3 pixels in all channels were defined as colocalized puncta and selected for analysis. Total pixel intensities of each punctum were summed and then averaged across puncta for each neuron. For quantification of dendritic complexity, tiled images of apical-like arbors were taken and lengths were measured using ImageJ (NIH); nodes were counted at primary, secondary, and tertiary branch points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Whole cell patch clamp experiments were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices) on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope equipped with differential interference contrast optics and epifluorescence.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our policy on revisions we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised if at all possible (as discussed below), and if some aspects cannot be completed in a reasonable amount of time, to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>We hope you can include some of the requested additional data with the expectation that if you cannot accomplish all, you will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Tereshko et al. broadly examine the role of primary cilia in neuronal connectivity and function. Using cultured postnatal rat cortical neurons, the authors elegantly demonstrate that acute disruption of ciliary signaling rapidly strengthens glutamatergic inputs onto cortical pyramidal neurons and increases their spontaneous firing. Bidirectional pharmacological manipulation studies show that ciliary SSTR3 receptor signaling is critical for this effect. This study identifies a role for primary cilia in neuronal function and define a mechanisms that may underlie circuit malfunction in ciliopathies.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all found the manuscript to be of broad and substantial interest to cell biologists and neurobiologists and supported its publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However they also all agreed that two areas of the manuscript would be significantly strengthened with additional data. After discussion about whether additional data were required to support the current claims or whether it was possible to address these points with more discussion, the reviewers agreed that they would state their concerns here and leave it to the authors to decide the manner in which they would address these points. They reiterated in the discussion that they felt the increased impact of the paper with at least some of this additional data would be worth the authors' investment of time.</p><p>The first concern was that all of the work relied on neuronal culture. The major concern about this preparation was that because some of the results differed from what has previously been reported in mouse models, it was hard to compare and interpret these findings in light of previous findings. In particular, the fact that the culture preparation has a different synaptic network organization than intact neural circuits was a concern. The reviewers all want to see at least one experiment in a more in vivo circuit context if it were possible for the authors to do in a reasonable time frame. Their comments and suggestions are as follows:</p><p>(1) It is unclear to one reviewer how well this recapitulates what happens to these neurons in vivo, especially given that the findings differ from previous findings to some degree (i.e. Guo et al. found that inhibitory synapses are reduced in the striatum; Kumamoto et al. find weakened excitatory synapses; Bowie and Goetz find fewer excitatory connections on Purkinje neurons, etc). There could be very important and interesting reasons for these differences – timescale, cell type, etc as the authors argue, however some attempt should be made to assess the findings in vivo.</p><p>(2) Could some of these experiments be done in a context that is closer to in vivo? For example viral transduction of shRNAs into the neonatal cortex followed by an assessment of neuronal connectivity? Electrophysiology might also be performed in slice culture. The authors already use virus to transduce the neonatal cortex in Figure 5, a similar approach could be used to perform in vivo knockdown to confirm some of the results.</p><p>(3) Altered E/I balance also occurs when interneuronal cilia function is disrupted (Guo et al., 2017). Highlighting (in Discussion section) how cilia malfunction in interneurons, projection neurons , and associated astroglial cells may converge to contribute to E/I imbalance in cortical circuits in ciliopathies will be useful.</p><p>The second area of discussion regarded the role of SSTR3 in ciliary signaling. All of the reviewers felt this was an impactful finding of the study, but all of them also felt that the studies in support of this mechanism could be stronger. Again, the reviewers made suggestions of additional experiments that would strengthen this section and they encourage the authors to consider adding something in this section of the study if it can be done in a reasonable time frame (all three reviewers had one common suggestion – all three versions of the suggestion are included below as 1a-c). The reviewer comments on this section were as follows:</p><p>(1a) In Figure 6, the authors conclude that SSTR3 in the primary cilium is primarily important for maintaining appropriate numbers of excitatory synapses. It would be useful to examine whether the SST agonist/antagonist effects are eliminated by the loss of cilia. For example, would the effects of the SST agonist be rescued if cilia were lost?</p><p>(1b) Test whether knockdown of the same ciliary proteins affects the response of the neurons to the SST agonist/antagonist. Since SSTR3 is localized almost exclusively to cilia, it seems likely that the effects of the agonist/antagonist are due to signaling at the cilium, and conversely that the increase in excitatory synapses upon cilium ablation is due to loss of SSTR3 from that compartment, but it would be good to take another step to tie those two together more directly.</p><p>(1c) In the test of SSTR3, it remains unclear whether the regulation by altering the activity of SSTR3 remains if the cilium is depleted. I feel that both the physiology section (the presentation was immature) and SSTR3 section (the findings were too correlated) are immature. If work hard, these</p><p>may be revised within 6-8 weeks.</p><p>(2) The authors conclude that “SSTR3 is expressed primarily, if not exclusively, by excitatory neurons in the neocortex” – this statement needs additional evidence. While the images shown in Figure 5 demonstrate the expression of SSTR3 in isolated pyramidal neuronal cilia, unambiguous demonstration of SSTR3 primarily in pyramidal neurons in neocortex will require, at minimum, additional data on SSTR3 ciliary expression in whole cross sections of the neocortex. Images of postnatal neocortex (with all layers) co-labeled with SSTR3 and excitatory or inhibitory neuronal markers will be needed. Including such data will support the conclusion. Otherwise, modify the statement of exclusivity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65427.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all found the manuscript to be of broad and substantial interest to cell biologists and neurobiologists and supported its publication in eLife.

The authors already use virus to transduce the neonatal cortex in Figure 5, a similar approach could be used to perform in vivo knockdown to confirm some of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>A key difference between observations reported here as compared to previous work (Guo et al., Kumamoto et al., Bowie and Goetz) is the timescale of the manipulations. Here, we report the effects of acute manipulation of ciliary signaling – on the timescale of hours to 1-2 days. In contrast, previous work reported the effects upon disruption of cilia and ciliary signaling on much longer timescales of weeks to months. Further, here we examine neocortical pyramidal neurons while previous studies examined other cell types; there are likely to be cell-type specific roles for ciliary signaling in synapse maintenance. Our results provide the first indication that ciliary neuropeptidergic signaling may continuously modulate excitatory synapses in the cortex. Prolonged loss of this signaling may then lead to disruption of neuronal dendritic and axonal morphology, synaptic connectivity, and neurodegeneration.</p><p>Technical challenges prevent us from disrupting ciliary signaling on acute timescales in vivo in the rat cortex. We attempted to knockdown ARL13b in vivo in initial experiments, but found that the earliest time point at which we can detect viral expression is 7 days following virus injection into the rat cortex. Robust viral expression is likely to occur well after 7 days following infection. However, we cannot compare and interpret results obtained from disrupting cilia for &gt;1 week in vivo to those obtained from acutely disrupting cilia in culture for 24-48 hrs. Performing these acute manipulations in the brain remains a major goal for the future but will likely require that we switch to using a mouse model.</p><p>We have now added a section to the Discussion that addresses the above points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Altered E/I balance also occurs when interneuronal cilia function is disrupted (Guo et al., 2017). Highlighting (in Discussion section) how cilia malfunction in interneurons, projection neurons , and associated astroglial cells may converge to contribute to E/I imbalance in cortical circuits in ciliopathies will be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added text and references in the Discussion that highlight this important point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second area of discussion regarded the role of SSTR3 in ciliary signaling. All of the reviewers felt this was an impactful finding of the study, but all of them also felt that the studies in support of this mechanism could be stronger. Again, the reviewers made suggestions of additional experiments that would strengthen this section and they encourage the authors to consider adding something in this section of the study if it can be done in a reasonable time frame (all three reviewers had one common suggestion – all three versions of the suggestion are included below as 1a-c). The reviewer comments on this section were as follows:</p><p>1a) In Figure 6, the authors conclude that SSTR3 in the primary cilium is primarily important for maintaining appropriate numbers of excitatory synapses. It would be useful to examine whether the SST agonist/antagonist effects are eliminated by the loss of cilia. For example, would the effects of the SST agonist be rescued if cilia were lost?</p><p>1b) Test whether knockdown of the same ciliary proteins affects the response of the neurons to the SST agonist/antagonist. Since SSTR3 is localized almost exclusively to cilia, it seems likely that the effects of the agonist/antagonist are due to signaling at the cilium, and conversely that the increase in excitatory synapses upon cilium ablation is due to loss of SSTR3 from that compartment, but it would be good to take another step to tie those two together more directly.</p><p>1c) In the test of SSTR3, it remains unclear whether the regulation by altering the activity of SSTR3 remains if the cilium is depleted. I feel that both the physiology section (the presentation was immature) and SSTR3 section (the findings were too correlated) are immature. If work hard, these</p><p>may be revised within 6-8 weeks.</p></disp-quote><p>All reviewers requested that we determine whether loss of cilia abolishes SSTR3-dependent effects on excitatory synapses.</p><p>To address these comments, we transfected cultures with shIft88/shCep164 or GFP alone for 48 hrs, treated with the SSTR3 agonist or DMSO (control) for 24 hrs, and then immunostained for Shank3 (postsynaptic marker) and SSTR3. As shown in new Figure 6D, a subset of the truncated cilia in shRNA-transfected neurons retained expression of SSTR3. Consistent with our previous data (Figure 6B), we find that treatment with the agonist decreased Shank3 intensity in control (GFP-expressing) neurons (new Figure 6E). As expected from our data with truncated cilia (Figure 2C), reducing cilia length increases Shank3 intensity (new Figure 6E). Importantly, in neurons with truncated cilia, the SSTR3 agonist was no longer able to reduce Shank3 intensity (new Figure 6E). These results imply that the cilium is necessary for SSTR3 signaling-dependent regulation of excitatory synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors conclude that “SSTR3 is expressed primarily, if not exclusively, by excitatory neurons in the neocortex” – this statement needs additional evidence. While the images shown in Figure 5 demonstrate the expression of SSTR3 in isolated pyramidal neuronal cilia, unambiguous demonstration of SSTR3 primarily in pyramidal neurons in neocortex will require, at minimum, additional data on SSTR3 ciliary expression in whole cross sections of the neocortex. Images of postnatal neocortex (with all layers) co-labeled with SSTR3 and excitatory or inhibitory neuronal markers will be needed. Including such data will support the conclusion. Otherwise, modify the statement of exclusivity.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide representative images of neurons in all layers of the V1 area of the neocortex of P1 rats co-immunostained for NeuN, GAD67, and SSTR3 in new Figure 5—figure supplement 1A. Under our conditions, NeuN primarily (although not exclusively) marks excitatory neurons, whereas GAD67 exclusively marks inhibitory neurons. As shown in new Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B, while the majority of NeuN-positive neurons across all layers contain ciliary SSTR3, fewer than 10% of GAD67-positive neurons in each cortical layer express this receptor although the cilia of these inhibitory interneurons continue to express AC3 (Figure 5C, and Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). These data further support our conclusion that ciliary SSTR3 expression is largely restricted to excitatory neurons in the neocortex.</p><p>We also added new data to Figure 5D showing that VIP+ interneurons do not contain SSTR3-positive cilia.</p></body></sub-article></article>
