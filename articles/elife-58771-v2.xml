vaccine escape in the human pathogen <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> can be largely attributed to competence-induced transformation. Here, we studied this process at the single-cell level. We show that within isogenic populations, all cells become naturally competent and bind exogenous DNA. We find that transformation is highly efficient and that the chromosomal location of the integration site or whether the transformed gene is encoded on the leading or lagging strand has limited influence on recombination efficiency. Indeed, we have observed multiple recombination events in single recipients in real-time. However, because of saturation and because a single-stranded donor DNA replaces the original allele, transformation efficiency has an upper threshold of approximately 50% of the population. The fixed mechanism of transformation results in a fail-safe strategy for the population as half of the population generally keeps an intact copy of the original genome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic></kwd><kwd>transformation</kwd><kwd>competence development</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd><kwd>single cell analysis</kwd><kwd>horizontal gene transfer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_172861</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veening</surname><given-names>Jan-Willem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>771534- PneumoCaTChER</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veening</surname><given-names>Jan-Willem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-BLAN-1331</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Polard</surname><given-names>Patrice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007428</institution-id><institution>Naito Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kurushima</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>40AR40_185533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veening</surname><given-names>Jan-Willem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXStasis-17-CE13-0031-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Polard</surname><given-names>Patrice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>DNA uptake and recombination in pneumococcus are highly efficient and independent of the cell-cycle or genetic location of the transformed allele, but limited to maximally 50% of the population.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The opportunistic human pathogen <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (the pneumococcus) kills over a million individuals each year, despite the introduction of several vaccines targeting its capsule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Croucher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">O'Brien et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Prina et al., 2015</xref>). Because of its ability to take-up DNA from its environment by competence activation, genes associated with capsule biosynthesis are rapidly transferred from one strain to the other thereby contributing to vaccine escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Salvadori et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, antibiotic resistance remains a cause of concern and competence-dependent recombination plays an important role in the spread of drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sw et al., 2019</xref>). For example, one of the main genetic sources for penicillin resistance in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is DNA acquired from non-pathogenic Streptococci from the viridans group such as <italic>S. mitis</italic> that also lives in the human nasal and oral cavities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bryskier, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Janoir et al., 1999</xref>). Consistently, antibiotic- resistant pneumococci and vaccine-escape variants remain an important cause of invasive infections in spite of the introduction of the conjugate vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Fenoll et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Levy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ouldali et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although pneumococcal competence is one of the best studied bacterial regulatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gómez-Mejia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Johnston et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lin and Kussell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Salvadori et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shanker and Federle, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Straume et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Veening and Blokesch, 2017</xref>), and pneumococcal transformation was already discovered in the early twentieth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avery et al., 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Griffith, 1928</xref>), we have a poor understanding on how competence-dependent transformation drives pneumococcal population dynamics, serotype displacement and the spread of antibiotic resistance. Importantly, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) via natural transformation is not only conserved in Streptococci but is present in many human pathogens where it promotes the spread of virulence determinants and antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brockhurst et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dubnau and Blokesch, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Johnston et al., 2014</xref>). For this reason, it is crucial to understand what the main bottlenecks are during the take-up and recombination of exogenous DNA that leads to transformed new genotypes.</p><p>In contrast to many other competent pathogens such as <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> spp. and <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> in which competence is constitutively expressed, competence development in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is only activated under specific conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blokesch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Claverys et al., 2006</xref>). Pneumococcal competence is under control of a two-component quorum sensing system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). ComC is cleaved and exported by the peptidase-containing ATP-binding cassette transporter ComAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chandler and Morrison, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Håvarstein et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hui et al., 1995</xref>). Cleaved ComC autoinducer is commonly referred to as competence stimulating peptide (CSP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alloing et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Håvarstein et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Håvarstein et al., 1995</xref>). CSP is recognized by the membrane-bound histidine kinase ComD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Håvarstein et al., 1996</xref>). Once a certain threshold level of CSP has been reached, as the culture reaches higher densities, or when other environmental factors increase local CSP concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Domenech et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Moreno-Gámez et al., 2017</xref>), ComD will autophosphorylate and transfer the phosphoryl group to the response regulator ComE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Martin et al., 2013</xref>). Phosphorylated ComE then dimerizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boudes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>) and binds to a specific DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Martin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pestova et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Slager et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Ween et al., 1999</xref>). The <italic>comCDE</italic> and <italic>comAB</italic> operons are under direct control of ComE, setting up a positive feedback loop. The genes under control of ComE are called the early <italic>com</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Importantly, phosphorylated ComE also activates expression of the gene encoding the alternative sigma factor ComX. ComX activates transcription of the so-called late <italic>com</italic> genes, which includes the genes required for DNA uptake and integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Campbell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dagkessamanskaia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Luo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pestova and Morrison, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Slager et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). While regulation of competence is highly diverse between naturally transformable bacteria, the actual DNA uptake and integration machinery is largely conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen and Dubnau, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Johnston et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Regulation of pneumococcal competence and transformation.</title><p>Schematic overview showing representative competence-related genes involved in pneumococcal transformation. Competence development is initiated by activation of the early <italic>com</italic> genes (shown in blue area). ComAB exports ComC and processes it into the competence stimulating peptide (CSP). The two-component system ComDE recognizes CSP and positively regulates the early <italic>com</italic> genes. Subsequently, the alternative sigma factor ComX, activates late <italic>com</italic> gene expression (shown in orange area). ComGA, GB, and GC are assembled to form the DNA-binding pilus. EndA is the endonuclease that cleaves dsDNA into ssDNA. ComEA, ComEC, ComFA, and ComFC form the ssDNA uptake channel. Internalized foreign ssDNA is protected by SsbB and DprA. DprA ensures the loading of RecA on single strand tDNA to form a presynaptic filament and the resulting DNA scanning complex is capable of homologous (or homeologous) recombination with the recipient chromosome.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58771-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>During pneumococcal competence, exogenous double stranded DNA (dsDNA) is bound by a type IV-like pilus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Laurenceau et al., 2013</xref>) and subsequently sequestered to the DNA uptake machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Note that in contrast to some other competent bacteria, pneumococcus binds and takes up DNA of any sequence, including non-kin DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mell and Redfield, 2014</xref>). Next, the dsDNA is processed into single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) by the EndA nuclease and internalized through a membrane pore consisting of ComEC. Once inside, the ssDNA is bound by a competence-specific ssDNA-binding protein, SsbB, and stabilized by DprA and RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attaiech et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergé et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This complex undergoes homology scanning and forms a temporal hetero-duplex during strand invasion which can lead to homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mortier-Barrière et al., 2007</xref>). The exact details on the kinetics of this process, as well as how the hetero-duplex is resolved in most cells remains elusive. The competent transformation state in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is transient as DprA interacts with phosphorylated ComE to inhibit its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mirouze et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, several key Com proteins are rapidly turned over after their synthesis, leading to a window of DNA uptake of approximately 15 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tomasz, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Weng et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>As most work on pneumococcal competence and transformation has been performed using bulk assays, it is unclear what the actual bottlenecks are during competence development and why one cell will be transformed whereas another one will not. Here, we have set up single-cell transformation assays that allow us to quantify successful recombination events in real-time. This study provides direct evidence for several decade-old models underpinning bacterial transformation, and offers new insights that help explain why competence-induced transformation is so effective in changing global pneumococcal population structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>All pneumococci become competent and bind exogenous DNA</title><p>To quantify pneumococcal transformation efficiency and determine at which step potential bottlenecks arise, we systematically analyzed every stage during the process: (1) competence development, (2) production of the DNA uptake machinery, (3) binding of exogenous DNA, and (4) recombination and expression of the newly acquired genetic information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). While competence development in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is limited to approximately 10% of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Maamar and Dubnau, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Smits et al., 2005</xref>), up to 100% of cells within pneumococcal populations have been reported to become competent when induced with exogenously added synthetic CSP or when grown on semi-solid surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergé et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Domenech et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Litt et al., 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Moreno-Gámez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Slager et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To quantify competence development in clonal pneumococcal populations in a systematic fashion, we constructed a set of reporters. First, we assessed the timing of both naturally induced and artificially induced competence (by the addition of synthetic CSP) at the population level utilizing a firefly luciferase reporter under the control of the late competence <italic>ssbB</italic> promoter (strain DLA3). Cells were grown in C+Y medium at 37°C (see Materials and methods) and growth and luciferase activity were measured every 10 min. As expected, under these experimental conditions, the population rapidly activates <italic>ssbB</italic> in the presence of added CSP, while in the absence of externally added CSP, the <italic>ssbB</italic> promoter peaks after approximately 100 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To determine which fraction of the cells switch on the competence pathway, we fused the <italic>ssbB</italic> promoter to a fast folding yellow fluorescent protein (msfYFP) and integrated this construct at the native <italic>ssbB</italic> locus (strain VL2219). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>,~97% of the population was positive for <italic>ssbB</italic> expression 20 min after addition of synthetic CSP as determined by fluorescence microscopy followed by automated image analysis (see Materials and methods for details). Importantly, spontaneous competence without the addition of synthetic CSP was reached in 92% of the population showing that almost all pneumococci, regardless of their cell length and cell-cycle status become naturally competent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Single-cell analysis of competence activation and DNA binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Kinetics of bacterial growth and competence development.

Traditionally, transformation efficiencies are evaluated using antibiotic selection methods. However, these selection methods have limitations because they depend on the counting of colony forming units, which can lead to the overestimation of transformation efficiencies, due to inefficient separation of transformed from non-transformed daughter cells and nongenetic inheritance of antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dalia and Dalia, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Domenech et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ephrussi-Taylor, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ephrussi-Taylor, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

As tDNA (orange line) is processed to a ssDNA DNA molecule during internalization, recombination can only occur on one strand of the host chromosome. Therefore, if the tDNA encodes new phenotypic information, which of (<bold>i</bold>) coding or (ii) noncoding strand to be replaced will affect phenotypic expression dynamics derived from the newly acquired allele. (<bold>B</bold>) Hypothetical model of phenotypic expression dynamics depending on which strand is replaced by tDNA. In case of coding strand replacement (<bold>i</bold>), RNAP uses the original allele as template to synthesize transcripts (gray dashed line), and transcription of tDNA-derived sequence occurs only once the homo-duplex forms after one replication cycle. Also, it may take more cell divisions to replace the original product (proteins, etc.) (gray balls) by tDNA-derived products (orange balls) to express visible phenotype. Meanwhile, in case of noncoding strand replacement (ii), transcription from tDNA is permitted as RNAP recognizes the tDNA sequence and synthesizes transcripts from it (orange dashed line). Consequently, tDNA-derived products (orange balls) come up right after recombination before cell division without forming the homo-duplex. After cell division, tDNA-derived products can be nongenetically distributed even in progenitor with homo-duplex of original allele not only in one with homo-duplex of tDNA-derived allele. Therefore, in this case nongenetic inheritance is observed. This phenotypically intermediate state should be solved according to a couple of cell divisions as nongenetic inheritance will be diluted out.

Similarly, as already shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the cell indicated by the white arrow expresses fluorescence relatively early during the time -lapse, and also gradual reduction of fluorescence is observed in progenitors in one side of the lineage. On the other hand, the cells indicated by yellow arrow started expressing fluorescence a little bit later than cells indicated by white arrow, suggesting that this lineage might need cell division to form homo-duplex to transcribe tDNA allele. Importantly, this cell lineage did not show evidence of nongenetic phenotypic expression. Collectively, according to the model described in panel B, it seems that the cell lineage indicated by the white arrow was transformed at the noncoding strand, and the cell indicated by the yellow arrow was transformed at the coding strand.

Notably, only half of the recipients’ descendants appear to strongly express HlpA-mScarlet-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, right lineage). Contrary, after three more divisions the non-transformed lineage no longer expresses red fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, left lineage). These results are in line with a recent study in <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> that showed a period of nongenetic inheritance in daughter cells during transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dalia and Dalia, 2019</xref>). Similar observations were made when using a different transformation reporter system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>, see below).

Therefore, at least one round of DNA replication and division is required to generate two different homo-duplex chromosomes in progeny cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The fact that we initially also observe fluorescence in the untransformed lineage suggests that phenotypic expression derived from the acquired allele might occur prior to forming a homo-duplex.

Previously, it was shown that the concentration of donor DNA as well as the length of the homology regions strongly influences transformation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Keller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lee et al., 1998</xref>). To examine recombination bottlenecks in our single-cell setup, we treated our reporter recipient strain VL1784 with CSP and used intact <italic>hlpA-mScarlet-I</italic> donor tDNA with various lengths of homology surrounding the stop codon (fragments of 2.7, 5, or 7 kb) at a range of different concentrations (0.0032, 0.032, 0.32, or 3.2 nM). Then, after 4 hr incubation in liquid medium to allow for complete homo-duplex allele formation and dilution of nongenetically inherited HlpA-mScarlet-I, cells were separated from chains by vigorously shaking on a bead beater devise (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Finally, transformation efficiencies were quantified by flow-cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In line with studies using classical plating methods to assess transformation efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Keller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lee et al., 1998</xref>), higher transformation frequencies were observed at higher donor DNA concentrations and with longer homology regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, the frequency of transformation plateaued at ~50% regardless of the concentration of donor DNA and sequence homology length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This is in contrast to reported transformation frequencies using traditional plating assays where transformation frequencies of higher than 75% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ephrussi-Taylor, 1958</xref>) and up to 100% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Marie et al., 2017</xref>) have been reported. This discrepancy can be explained by the lack of separation of transformed from non-transformed cells within the counted colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the observed limitation in transformation frequency is due to an unique feature of the <italic>hlpA-stop-mScarlet-I</italic> reporter, we constructed an alternative reporter cassette in which we translationally fused the superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) and SPV_1159, a nonessential small membrane protein under control of the strong constitutive P3 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Keller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sorg et al., 2015</xref>) cloned into the transcriptionally silent CEP locus at 295° on the circular chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, strain VL1786). Based on this construct, a recipient strain was constructed containing a stop codon mutation in the linker between <italic>spv_1159</italic> and <italic>sfGFP</italic> (strain VL1788). Indeed, this <italic>spv_1159-sfGFP</italic>-based transformation reporter demonstrated similar transformation characteristics as the <italic>hlpA-mScarlet-I</italic> reporter in time-lapse microscopy and flow-cytometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).

In control strain VL3485 (P<sub>lac</sub>_<italic>dcas9</italic>, without sgRNA), induction of dCas9 by IPTG did not affect the transformation efficiency with <italic>hlpA-mScarlet-I</italic> tDNA. However, when RecA expression was depleted by induction with IPTG in strain VL3486 (P<sub>lac</sub>_<italic>dcas9</italic>+sgRNA-recA), the transformation frequency was decreased in an IPTG-dose dependent manner. Note that although RecA is known to be critical for optimal growth in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mortier-Barrière et al., 1998</xref>), the CRISPRi depletion levels during competence did not affect bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, transformation efficiencies were of a similar order across all tested loci and genetic orientations, with a maximal recombination efficiency of approximately 50%. We do note that certain loci consistently demonstrate higher transformation efficiencies than others (cf. CEP locus vs <italic>bgaA</italic> locus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), but no significant differences were observed regarding the orientation of the construct (see Discussion).</p><p>By performing time-lapse microscopy and tracking cell fates across several generations, we can, in principle, tell whether there was a preference for integration at either the leading or lagging strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). By placing the direction of transcription of the reporter on the leading strand, RNAP will thus use the noncoding strand as template. In this situation, only if the noncoding strand is replaced by the donor DNA, fluorescence will be apparent during the first cell cycle upon transformation. If the donor DNA is integrated at the coding strand, it will take one more replication cycle before the hetero-duplex is resolved and the noncoding strand contains the intact reporter and fluorescence will be observed later than in the first case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Indeed, we can observe all different scenarios with transformants rapidly expressing HlpA-mScarlet-I (possible noncoding strand or double stranded recombinants) and cells that only express HlpA-mScarlet-I after the first cell division (possible coding strand recombinants) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). As we did not simultaneously track DNA replication in these cells, we cannot exclude the possibility that after transformation, a round of replication occurs before phenotypic expression. Nevertheless, together with the ‘bulk’ (FACS) single-cell transformation experiments described above, the time-lapse data strongly suggest that there is no preference for integration at either the leading or lagging strand and that this is an unbiased event. These findings correspond with work done in the 1960s and 1970s that showed that either strand of the incoming dsDNA is degraded randomly by EndA and either strand has a similar chance of being integrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Puyet et al., 1990</xref>). Recent work in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> demonstrated that 7% of transformation events occurred at both strands of the integration site, and it was speculated that this was because of integration of multiple donor ssDNA’s replacing both the leading and lagging strand of the recipient. By recording 76 single-cell transformation events using time-lapse microscopy, we found six cases in which both daughter cells (7.8%) expressed fluorescence, suggestive of double transformation events on both strands. These findings also indirectly indicate that hetero-duplex DNA can be transcribed by RNAP and do not necessarily require a round of DNA replication to form homo-duplex DNA (see below and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Uptain and Chamberlin, 1997</xref>]).

In single fragment (allele) transformation the proportion of progenitors with a tDNA-replaced allele or the original allele becomes 50:50. This can be predicted and explained by the principle mechanism of natural genetic transformation in which tDNA is processed into single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and is integrated into one strand of the host chromosome. (<bold>B, C</bold>) Expected genetic proportion after saturated multiple transformations in case each recombination event is independent from the other. Note that for simplification, the single circular chromosome is depicted as separate linear fragments. As shown in this study, multiple transformation events can occur at the distinct loci at the same time in single cell. If multiple transformation events do not interfere with each other and take place independently, most cells in the population would have a higher chance to acquire a tDNA, and the proportion of untransformed cells that did not acquire any tDNA fragments should be reduced. In the case of 2 tDNAs (panel b), the expected outcome would be that 25% of the transformants obtained both new alleles, 25% just one of the two tDNAs and 25% would have the wild-type genome. In the case of 3 tDNAs (panel c), the expected outcome, when every tDNA would be converted on one of the recipient strands independent from the next tDNA, would be that 12.5% of the transformants would have the wild-type genome.

However, the relative transformation efficiencies do seem to be independent. For instance, from the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (double tDNA), the observed transformation frequencies were for single <italic>hlpA-mScarlet-I</italic> red transformants (<bold>R</bold>) 20.2%.

The observed transformation frequencies for both <italic>hlpA-mScarlet-I</italic> (<bold>R</bold>) and <italic>spv_1159-sfGFP</italic> (<bold>G</bold>) was 15.6%. So, the observed number of R cells were 20.2 + 15.6 = 35.8% and the observed number of G cells were 15.2 + 15.6 = 30.8%. These values are largely in line if transformation of both <italic>mScarlet-I</italic> (<bold>R</bold>) and <italic>spv_1159-sfGFP</italic> (<bold>G</bold>) are independent as the chance (<bold>P</bold>) to become R = 0.358 × (1–0.308) = 24.7% (observed 20.2%).

Together, these data suggest that in principle each transformation event is independent from each other but, since non-homologous DNA can compete for successful recombination events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), saturation of the uptake and integration system become limiting as well as off target recombination events that cannot be measured in our SNP assay.

In line with our previous observations, each single transformation with a saturated concentration of donor tDNA resulted in a recombination efficiency not higher than 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Interestingly, every possible recombination event happened within the population: cells were observed in which just a single recombination event took place (the most occurring type of transformation), two recombination events (2.2 ± 0.9%, 4.1 ± 2.7% or 2.1 ± 1.8% for each possible combination) or even three recombination events (1.5 ± 1.1% of all cells). Nevertheless, more than half of the population (58.7 ± 13.4%) did not show any fluorescence when simultaneously transformed with three tDNAs.

However, when providing multiple tDNAs, the untransformed fraction even increases and becomes greater than 50%. Recently, it was shown using whole genome sequencing of transformation events occurring during contact-dependent DNA uptake, that a single recipient could have at least 29 different recombination events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cowley et al., 2018</xref>). Together, this suggests that many recombination events are likely going unnoticed in our single-cell transformation assay, and that these recombination events become limiting, as we can only detect successful recombination when the stop codon in our fluorescent reporter is replaced for a functional allele. If this is true, adding non-specific DNA would compete with donor tDNA resulting in reduced transformation efficiencies. To test this, we utilized homology-unrelated <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived DNA fragments of 5 kb with a similar GC content to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> as competing donor DNA. Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, co-transformation of strain VL1803 (<italic>hlpA-stop-mScarlet-I</italic>, <italic>spv_1159-stop-sfGFP</italic>) with <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA significantly reduced the transformation efficiency. When 0.32 μM of <italic>hlpA-mScarlet-I</italic> tDNA alone was used as 7 kb donor DNA, approximately 43% of cells were transformed. However, when 0.32 μM of <italic>hlpA-mScarlet-I</italic> tDNA was given in the presence of saturating amounts of <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA (3.2 μM), only 3% of transformants were observed. Together, these data suggest that the fact that we never reach transformation efficiencies higher than 50% of the population even in the presence of multiple tDNAs, is because of saturation of the DNA uptake and integration machinery. The saturation can be caused by non-successful recombination events with donor DNA or successful recombination events with the donor DNA but outside of the stop SNP that cannot be detected in the single-cell assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Efficient HGT in sessile co-cultures</title><p>So far, we demonstrated that transformation is highly efficient under ideal and saturated experimental settings in which pure PCR products were used as donor DNA. Previous studies showed that natural environments also promote efficient HGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cowley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Domenech et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, in pneumococcal biofilms, which are a model for nasopharyngeal colonization, competence and fratricide are strongly induced, resulting in high relative concentrations of DNA. To assess transformation potential under more realistic conditions, we tested transformation efficiency in a co-culture system in which two pneumococcal strains are grown together on a semi-solid surface without adding synthetic CSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; see Materials and methods section for detail procedure). HGT in such systems is based on genomic DNA released by dead cells followed by DNA uptake and transformation of competent recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Domenech et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we used strain R895 (<italic>cmR</italic>) as recipient and strain R4692 (<italic>∆comCDE</italic>, <italic>smR</italic>, <italic>novR</italic>) as donor. Both are genetically identical unencapsulated R800 derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lefevre et al., 1979</xref>) except for a single SNP conferring streptomycin (SNP in <italic>rpsL</italic>) or novobiocin (SNP in <italic>gyrB</italic>) resistance and a chloramphenicol resistance cassette present in the recipient R895 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Strain R4692 is also unable to activate competence due to a <italic>comCDE</italic> deletion so transformation can only occur in one direction from donor (R4692) to recipient (R895). R895 and R4692 were pre-cultured separately until early exponential phase and then mixed in an approximate ratio of 3:7 (see Materials and methods). The mixture was immediately spotted on agar plates followed by incubation at 37°C for 4 hr to allow spontaneous competence development and transformation between strains. Cells were collected by scraping them from the plates and separated by sonication. Serial dilutions of the resulting cell suspension were plated with 4.5 µg/mL of chloramphenicol (for the recovery of the total number of viable recipient cells) and with combinations of chloramphenicol plus streptomycin (10 µg/mL) and/or novobiocin (4 µg/mL) (for the recovery of the single or double transformed recipient cells). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, also in this more realistic model, very high transformation efficiencies are obtained with a single transformation efficiency with <italic>smR</italic> or <italic>novR</italic> of 5.70 × 10<sup>−2</sup>% (SD, 5.70 × 10<sup>−2</sup>%) or 1.75 × 10<sup>−2</sup>% (SD, 1.68 × 10<sup>−2</sup>%), respectively. Double transformation efficiency with both <italic>smR</italic> and <italic>novR</italic> was 8.01 × 10<sup>−5</sup>% (SD, 9.92 × 10<sup>−5</sup>%), which is close to the product of the single transformation efficiencies (5.70 × 10<sup>−2</sup>% × 1.75×10<sup>−2</sup>% = 9.9×10<sup>−4</sup>%). As a control, we also performed experiments using strain R4574 as donor (same genotype as R4692, but not harboring <italic>smR</italic> or <italic>novR</italic> allele), which never generated streptomycin nor novobiocin-resistant R895, demonstrating that de novo mutations conferring resistance do not occur in this experimental setup. Together, these experiments support our single- cell observations that multiple transformation events occur efficiently and independently even in more realistic settings within sessile co-cultures.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Horizontal gene transfer between <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the transformation assay between <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains.

In addition, many genes are mosaic such as several genes encoding for penicillin-binding proteins in penicillin-resistant clinical strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hakenbeck et al., 2012</xref>). One of the main reasons for the high level of genome plasticity and rapidly changing population dynamics is because of the highly conserved competence-based transformation system present in nearly all pneumococcal genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Croucher et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, rapid spread of antibiotic resistance alleles and capsule loci have been observed among human populations under selective pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chewapreecha et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we investigated the molecular basis for competence-dependent transformation at the single-cell level and show that the uptake, integration, and expression of tDNA are highly efficient and are largely independent from the recipient’s cell-cycle stage or of the chromosomal position of the target locus. This was made possible by the setup of a sensitive real-time detection system to quantify successful homeologous recombination events. A major benefit of the here established single-cell approach over traditional plate-based assays is that it allows for the detection of more subtle effects and offers better resolution to study the kinetics of the processes involved. Indeed, using the system developed here, we could visualize and quantify the recombination of three different tDNAs in single recipient cells demonstrating the efficiency of the pneumococcal transformation process.</p><p>Genome sequencing has indicated that up to 29 recombination events may have taken place in a single round of transformation in the same cell when selecting for the transfer of an antibiotic resistance allele in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cowley et al., 2018</xref>), while 40 recombination events have been reported in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carrasco et al., 2016</xref>). Our work now provides direct evidence that this is not an anomaly and that multiple recombination events are possible during a single transformation episode, even in the absence of selection. Besides shedding light on the efficiency by which transformation can happen in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, by imaging transformation at the single-cell level, we provide direct evidence that typically only one recipient strand is replaced during competence-dependent transformation, and that there is no bias toward replacement of the leading or lagging strand. As observed in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, in approximately 7% of transformants, both strands can be replaced, which is likely caused by DNA repair leading to removal of the recipient strand on the hetero-duplex or by integration of multiple tDNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dalia and Dalia, 2019</xref>). This is in line with predictions made using unlinked antibiotic resistance alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Porter and Guild, 1969</xref>). In addition, our single-cell observations suggest that the replaced noncoding strand by recombination within the hetero-duplex is immediately transcribed by RNAP and can lead to lineages of cells with nongenetic inherited phenotypes, or that the transformed allele is replicated and transcribed well before cell division occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>We show that any site regardless of its chromosomal position or orientation with regard to DNA replication can be efficiently transformed, although not with the exact same efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Possible explanations for local difference in recombination efficiency could be the levels of DNA compaction or transcription activity. As RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange is a reversible reaction in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dutreix et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Konforti and Davis, 1990</xref>), under steady state conditions DNA strand exchange rarely reaches 50% efficiency. However, in vivo, when providing a single tDNA to competent cells, we readily reach 50% DNA strand exchange, again highlighting that this process is highly efficient under our experimental conditions.</p><p>Interestingly, we find that the percentage of untransformed cells is lower when three tDNAs are provided instead of two tDNAs (~58% vs ~49% of untransformed cells, respectively: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Together with the observation that the presence of non-homologous DNA reduced our observed transformation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), suggests that, in principle, every recombination event is independent of the next, but that many unsuccessful recombination events and successful recombination events outside the stop codon of our reporter are taking place and that this limits the efficiency of site-specific recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>The overall biological implication of the limitation on competence-dependent transformation is that this mechanism ensures that in most cases one copy of the original recipient DNA remains unaltered. This might represent a fail-safe scenario so that in case a deleterious tDNA is incorporated, at least one daughter cell will survive. While this might be considered as a 'spandrel’ effect: a characteristic that flows inevitably from a selected phenotype but has not been selected for directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Gould and Lewontin, 1979</xref>), being able to safely sample from a large pan-genome might contribute to the vast genome plasticity and genome diversity as observed in natural pneumococcal populations. Interestingly, we also find highly efficient HGT and independent transfer of genetic markers between a donor and recipient pneumococcal strain growing together on agar plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), indicating that our single-cell observations under laboratory conditions also reflect settings that depend on lysis of the donor cell and uptake of chromosomal DNA. It will be interesting to see how efficient competence-dependent transformation and HGT is under more realistic conditions such as within polymicrobial community within a host. Future single-cell work will allow the investigation of the localization of the enzymes involved in transformation, how strand exchange during transformation occurs and what the dynamics of the molecular machines are during DNA uptake, integration, and expression of tDNA.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Various</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">NCBI Taxon: 1313</td><td valign="top">See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Various oligonucleotides</td><td valign="top">This paper (Sigma-Aldrich)</td><td valign="top">Primers for cloning</td><td valign="top">See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">D-Luciferine</td><td valign="top">Synchem</td><td valign="top">bc219; CAS: 115144-35-9</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">FIJI</td><td valign="top">doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2019">10.1038/nmeth.2019</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Oufti</td><td valign="top">doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.13264">10.1111/mmi.13264</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_016244">SCR_016244</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">BactMAP</td><td valign="top">doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14417">10.1111/mmi.14417</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/veeninglab/BactMAP">https://github.com/veeninglab/BactMAP</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">SuperSegger</td><td valign="top">doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.13486">10.1111/mmi.13486</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/wiggins-lab/SuperSegger">https://github.com/wiggins-lab/SuperSegger</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth condition</title><p>All pneumococcal strains used in this study are derivatives of serotype 2 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> D39V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avery et al., 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Slager et al., 2018</xref>) unless specified otherwise.

After celllist file were imported into R, cells were filtered between 0.7–1.2 µm in width length to exclude false events derived from noise or miss-segmentation. Threshold of fluorescence of signal intensity was defined based on negative or positive control for each experiment setting. &gt;500 cells were analyzed at least for each replicate. To exclude the possibility of overlap in detection of fluorescence (particularly mTurquoise2/msfYFP and msfYFP/mScarlet-I) in multi-fragments transformation, we ensured that single transformation experiments did not show any signal in the other channels and this was confirmed by looking at the protein localization patterns.</p><p>For generating cell lineage trees from time-lapse imaging, the stacked time-lapse images were processed by FIJI and stabilization between time frames was performed by Huygens (Scientific volume imaging).

In wild- type, <italic>endA<sup>+</sup></italic> cells, surface-bound DNA is immediately internalized into the cytosol or degraded otherwise, which makes surface-bound DNA accumulation hard to be visualized as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergé et al., 2013</xref>). After gently thawing stock cultures, aliquots were inoculated at an OD550 of 0.006 in C+Y medium, supplemented with 20 mM HCl to prevent spontaneous competence development, and grown at 37°C to an OD550 of 0.3. These precultures were inoculated (1/50) in C+Y medium (pH 7.8) and incubated at 37°C. In these conditions, competence developed spontaneously and reached its maximal level in the population after 55–60 min. At 35 min, 1 ml samples were collected and induced, or not, with synthetic CSP (50 ng/ml). At 50 min, these samples were incubated for 5 min with 10 ng of a 285 bp DNA fragment labeled with a Cy3 fluorophore at its 5’ extremities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergé et al., 2013</xref>). Cells were pelleted (3000 x g, 3 min), washed twice in 500 µL C+Y, and resuspended in 20 to 50 µL C+Y medium before microscopy.

Images were captured and processed using the Nis-Elements AR software (Nikon). Cy3 fluorescence images were false colored red and overlaid on phase contrast images. Overlaid images were further analyzed to quantify the number of cells bound with Cy3-labeled DNA. Single cells were first detected using the threshold command from Nis-Elements and cells bound or not to DNA were manually classified using the taxonomy tool.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Evaluation of transformation frequency using the fluorescence reporter</title><p>To quantify the efficiency of transformation with tDNA fragments, reporter cells were pre-cultured in C+Y (pH 6.8) at 37°C to an OD595 nm of 0.2. Right before inoculation, cells were collected by centrifugation (6000 x g for 3 min) and resuspended in fresh C+Y at pH 7.9, adjusted to OD = 0.1. Competence was induced by incubation in the presence of CSP (100 ng/µL) at 37°C for 10 min and then donor tDNA was provided the indicated concentration.

R895 is a naturally competent derivative of unencapsulated strain R6 and carries a chloramphenicol resistance marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chastanet et al., 2001</xref>). R4692 is unable to develop competence and carries point mutations conferring resistance to streptomycin, novobiocin and rifampicin. R4574 was used as a negative control donor strain. All strains were pre-cultured in C+Y (pH 6.8) at 37°C to an OD550 nm of 0.1. Cells were then collected by centrifugation (6000 x g for 3 min) and concentrated 3-fold in fresh C+Y at pH 7.9. Mixed inoculates containing 30 µL of donor strain R895 and 70 µL of recipient strain (R4574 or R4692) were subsequently spotted onto Petri dishes containing 3% horse blood CAT-agar (1% agar) supplemented with catalase (300 U/mL). Different ratios of donor and recipient were tested (1:1, 1:10 and 3:7) and a 3:7 ratio showed the least HGT variation across experiments. After 4 hr incubation at 37°C, cells were scraped off the plates and separated by sonication in an ultrasonic cleaner (90 s, 50 Hz). Serial dilutions were plated with 4.5 µg/mL of chloramphenicol and with combinations of chloramphenicol plus streptomycin (10 µg/mL) and/or novobiocin (4 µg/mL). Transformation efficiency was calculated by dividing the number of transformants by the total number of viable recipient count. Four independent biological replicates were performed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jelle Slager and Arnau Domenech for critically reading this manuscript, two anonymous referees, Juan Carlos Alonso and all members of the Veening lab for stimulating discussions.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This elegant and insightful paper develops a powerful new set of quantitative assays for tracking recombination in single cells to answer fundamental questions about natural transformation in the pathogenic bacterium <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>; and thereby, resets paradigms in this research area. The paper shows that any site or orientation with regard to DNA replication can be transformed in pneumococcal cells, including multiple chromosomal insertions; however, there is an intrinsic limitation to the efficiency of recombination, possibly related to the level of off-marker recombination. This limitation likely has implications to pneumococcal genome evolution, affecting exchange of genes that determine virulence and antibiotic resistance.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Unbiased homeologous recombination during pneumococcal transformation allows for multiple chromosomal integration events&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Petra Levin as Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jason Rosch (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>All three reviewers felt that the manuscript was experimentally sound and praised the authors for their use of single cell analysis to tackle the question of why some cells are transformed and others are not in a population of genetically competent Pneumococci. The thoughtful presentation of complicated and extensive data was appreciated by all. Two reviewers were enthusiastic about the study's conclusions regarding bet hedging and the potential for an intrinsic limit on recombination efficiency, reducing the potential for off-marker recombination which, as reviewer #3 notes, might have implications to pneumococcal evolution. At the same time, reviewer #2 had some reservations about the significance of the data in light of previous studies of Pneumococcus and other naturally competent organisms. Most importantly, this reviewer questions whether the finding that only a portion of bacteria incorporate exogenous DNA is a particularly novel and, regardless, whether the saturating DNA concentrations used in the study are representative of a &quot;natural&quot; environment.</p><p>Given the discrepancy between the three reviewers with regard to the papers potential impact, we would like to request that you and your co-authors revise the paper, paying special attention to ensuring that the major conclusions are contextual both in terms of previous work and with regard to physiological relevance. I am including reviewer #2's comments in their entirety at the end of this letter to ensure you are aware of all concerns in this regard.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this work Kurushima et al. use recently developed fluorescent labelling techniques to study natural transformation in the human pathogen <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. Previously, genetic marker analyses have been used to study the different aspect of this process, but with these new techniques the process can now be studied at the single cell level. The authors used the single cell analysis to identify new transformation bottlenecks and tried to determine why some cells are genetically transformed and others are not. Related experiments have been performed in the past using classic genetics and Kurushima et al. were able to confirm these studies. In that sense, in my opinion, the novelty is limited and no important new molecular insights are provided. They found that the number of cells that are ultimately transformed is plateauing at approximately 50%, despite the fact that most cells bind DNA. This is partially the result of the heteroduplex formed after recombination followed by separation by strand replication, combined with the fact that the DNA binding sites on cells are limited so that there is a competition between DNA markers at saturating DNA concentrations. The authors argue that this mechanism entails a &quot;fail-safe strategy for the population as half of the population generally keeps an intact copy of the original genome&quot;. I find this conclusion far-fetched for two reasons. Firstly, the DNA recombination event followed by DNA replication will automatically assure that only half the population will inherit the mutation, and to speak of a strategy implies that the organism has specifically evolved this system, but we are dealing here with a well-known and general recombination system found in many organisms that will generally result in a 50/50 distribution. Maybe more importantly, under natural conditions it is highly unlikely that cells encounter saturating levels of tDNA. In their experiments the authors use 3.2 nM DNA for transformation. If my calculation is correct, this would amount to 19xE11 DNA molecules per ml, which seems a bit high when assuming tDNA comes from lysed bacteria. In nature, this number will be much (much) smaller therefore there is no need for the bacterium to come up with a dedicated strategy to assure that not all cells in a population are being transformed. Finally, the results are very well presented and the paper makes easy reading.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58771.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this work Kurushima et al. use recently developed fluorescent labelling techniques to study natural transformation in the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae.

To this end, we performed a set of new experiments (new Figure 8) in which we grew two pneumococcal strains together on agar plates in which one of the strains cannot become competent and carries SNPs conferring streptomycin and novobiocin resistance, respectively. In this scenario, horizontal gene transfer occurs via lysis of the recipient and by transformation of the then liberated environmental chromosomal DNA (new Figure 8A). One could argue this experiment more closely mimics the natural polymicrobial biofilm-like niche pneumococci encounter in the human nose, compared to our in vitro experiments using PCR products as donor DNA. As shown in new Figure 8B, also in this experimental setup, transformation is very efficient, up to 5.70 x 10<sup>-2</sup> (~0.05% of recipient cells are transformed) and markers transform independent of each other as demonstrated by our single cell analysis. We think this new experiment underscores that competence-based transformation is a main driver for pneumococcal genome evolution. We like to note that we do not think that the fail-safe has evolved as a dedicated strategy, but is rather a consequence of the recombination mechanism. This was mentioned in the Discussion as being a ‘spandrel effect’ and we have now further clarified this in the revised manuscript and changed fail-safe mechanism to fail-safe scenario.</p></body></sub-article></article>
