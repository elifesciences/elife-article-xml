We found significant sex and genotype differences in bone from wildtype (WT) mice compared to mice lacking <italic>Fndc5</italic> (knockout [KO]), with and without calcium deficiency. Despite their bone being indistinguishable from WT females, KO female mice were partially protected from osteocytic osteolysis and osteoclastic bone resorption when allowed to lactate or when placed on a low-calcium diet. Male KO mice have more but weaker bone compared to WT males, and when challenged with a low-calcium diet lost more bone than WT males. To begin to understand responsible molecular mechanisms, osteocyte transcriptomics was performed. Osteocytes from WT females had greater expression of genes associated with osteocytic osteolysis and osteoclastic bone resorption compared to WT males which had greater expression of genes associated with steroid and fatty acid metabolism. Few differences were observed between female KO and WT osteocytes, but with a low-calcium diet, the KO females had lower expression of genes responsible for osteocytic osteolysis and osteoclastic resorption than the WT females. Male KO osteocytes had lower expression of genes associated with steroid and fatty acid metabolism, but higher expression of genes associated with bone resorption compared to male WT. In conclusion, irisin plays a critical role in the development of the male but not the female skeleton and protects male but not female bone from calcium deficiency. We propose irisin ensures the survival of offspring by targeting the osteocyte to provide calcium in lactating females, a novel function for this myokine.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>irisin</kwd><kwd>Fndc5</kwd><kwd>osteocytes</kwd><kwd>osteocytic osteolysis</kwd><kwd>hypercalcemia</kwd><kwd>lactation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PO1039355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bonewald</surname><given-names>Lynda F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of mice lacking the precursor for irisin, FNDC5, provides evidence for a sex-specific role of irisin in calcium release from bone due to osteocytic osteolysis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is widely accepted that bone and muscle interact mechanically as movement of the skeleton by muscle is essential for life. Less well-known but becoming more generally accepted is that muscle and bone can communicate through secreted factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brotto and Bonewald, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonewald, 2019</xref>). Muscle produces factors such as β-aminoisobutyric acid and irisin with exercise, that have positive effects on bone, adipose tissue, brain, and other organs, whereas sedentary muscle produces factors such as myostatin that has negative effects on both bone and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brotto and Bonewald, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Karsenty and Mera, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kitase et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boström et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hamrick et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Many of the factors secreted by bone are produced by osteocytes, the most abundant and the longest-living bone cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonewald, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dallas et al., 2013</xref>). These cells are derived from terminally differentiated osteoblasts that become surrounded by the newly mineralizing bone matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dallas et al., 2013</xref>). Osteocytes are multifunctional and appear to be the major mechanosensory cell in bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonewald, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Temiyasathit and Jacobs, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Uda et al., 2017</xref>). Under unloaded conditions, these cells produce sclerostin, a negative regulator of bone formation and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa β ligand (RANKL), the major factor that recruits and activates osteoclasts to resorb bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nakashima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Xiong and O’Brien, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ono et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, with anabolic mechanical loading, these cells produce factors such as prostaglandin E2 that have positive effects on myogenesis and muscle function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mo et al., 2015</xref>). Osteocytes play a major role in mineral metabolism, through regulation of both calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Osteocytes secrete fibroblast growth factor 23 to target the kidney to regulate phosphate excretion. Both parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid-related peptide (PTHrP) regulate calcium homeostasis via the PTH type 1 receptor on osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Teti and Zallone, 2009</xref>). Under the physiological calcium-demanding condition of lactation, osteocytes respond to PTHrP by removing their surrounding perilacunar matrix to provide calcium for offspring, and upon weaning this perilacunar matrix is rapidly replaced, a process referred to as perilacunar remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Qing and Bonewald, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Qing et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wysolmerski, 2013</xref>). However, under pathological conditions such as ovariectomy, hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphatemic rickets, and cancer, excessive removal of their perilacunar matrix occurs through osteocytic osteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tsourdi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jähn-Rickert and Zimmermann, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shimonty et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Bone is the largest calcium reservoir in the body and human mothers can lose an average of 250 mg/day of calcium in milk, emphasizing the need for a calcium-replete diet to prevent bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Qing et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wysolmerski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kalkwarf, 2004</xref>). During lactation, PTHrP targets the osteocyte to elevate genes coding for factors necessary for the removal of their calcium-ladened perilacunar matrix and to increase RANKL as an activator of osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kovacs, 2001</xref>). During lactation, RANKL targets osteoclasts, thereby driving osteoclastic bone resorption. Osteocytic osteolysis is accomplished through the expression of ‘osteoclast-specific’ genes such as cathepsin K (<italic>Ctsk</italic>), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP, gene <italic>Acp5</italic>), and carbonic anhydrase 1 (<italic>Car 1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Qing and Bonewald, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Qing et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, there is an increase in genes coding for the proton pumps, ATPase H<sup>+</sup> transporting V1 subunit G1 (<italic>Atp6v1g1</italic>), and ATPase H<sup>+</sup> transporting V0 subunit D2 (<italic>Atp6v0d2</italic>) necessary to dissolve and remove calcium from bone collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jähn et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Systemic calcium deficiency such as a decrease in dietary calcium triggers an increase in PTH, acting to mobilize calcium from bones to maintain normal homeostatic circulating calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goltzman, 2008</xref>). Worldwide, over 3.5 billion people suffer from dietary calcium deficiency, and women are at a higher risk of this condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kumssa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Body et al., 2016</xref>). Aging often results in hypocalcemia and bone loss due to low vitamin D, hypoparathyroidism, genetic abnormalities, medications decreasing dietary calcium absorption, and menopause in women. Calcium deficiency can lead to osteopenia, osteoporosis, and increased fracture risk, primarily due to secondary hyperparathyroidism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kumssa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Body et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Irisin is a recently discovered myokine generated in response to exercise when fibronectin type III domain containing protein 5 (FNDC5) is proteolytically cleaved by a yet undetermined protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boström et al., 2012</xref>). FNDC5 is expressed in the heart, kidney, testes, brain, and other tissues; however, skeletal muscle appears to be the primary producer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Erickson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Maak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tsourdi et al., 2022</xref>). Cleaved irisin circulates to distant organs, such as adipose tissue where irisin increases a thermogenic gene program, including the expression of uncoupling protein 1 in a process referred to as browning. This is associated with increased energy expenditure and improvement in glucose tolerance, both of which are important for the prevention of type 2 diabetes and the reduction of complications from obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Perakakis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Korta et al., 2019</xref>). Irisin can also regulate glucose uptake in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), and increases myogenesis and oxidative metabolism, responsible for increasing skeletal muscle mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Colaianni and Grano, 2015</xref>). Irisin also plays an important positive role in cognitive functions with exercise, aging, and degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Islam et al., 2021</xref>). Using the tail-vein injection method to deliver exogenous irisin, it was shown that irisin can cross the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Islam et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Results from studies regarding the effects of irisin on the skeleton are complex and somewhat contradictory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colaianni et al., 2015</xref> have shown that recombinant irisin exerts a beneficial effect on cortical bone in young male mice by reducing the secretion of osteoblast inhibitors and increasing the activity of osteogenic cells. However, another study has shown that recombinant irisin treatment of MLO-Y4 osteocyte-like cells induces gene- and protein-level expression of <italic>Sost</italic>/sclerostin, a negative regulator of bone formation while maintaining cell viability under oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Estell et al., 2020</xref> have shown using female FNDC5 overexpressing female mice that irisin acts directly on osteoclast progenitors to increase differentiation and promote bone resorption. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2018</xref> have shown that 9-month-old ovariectomized FNDC5 global knockout (KO) mice are protected against ovariectomy-induced trabecular bone loss through the inactivation of osteocytic osteolysis and osteoclastic bone resorption. The majority of these studies used only male or female mice, suggesting a sex-dependent response may be responsible for these seemingly opposing findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Estell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colaianni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kawao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colucci et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Posa et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>As shown previously, FNDC5 deletion has a protective effect against ovariectomy- induced bone loss via a reduction of osteocytic osteolysis and osteoclastic resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). We, therefore, hypothesized that FNDC5 deletion would also be protective against bone loss due to calcium deficiency that occurs with lactation and a calcium-deficient diet. Our data show that the female skeleton in FNDC5 null female mice was resistant to bone loss due to both lactation and low calcium. However, for FNDC5 null males, deletion not only failed to protect but exacerbated bone loss in response to low calcium. We propose that male and female osteocytes respond to irisin differently under calcium-demanding conditions based on the divergence of the male and female osteocyte transcriptome with sexual maturity when the female osteocyte must serve a critical role in reproduction and lactation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>With lactation, FNDC5 global KO mice lose less bone and are mechanically stronger compared to WT</title><p>No significant differences were observed in either bone composition or morphometry between 4- and 5-month-old virgin wildtype (WT) and FNDC5 global KO female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B, and C</xref>, detailed result in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), showing that the absence of FNDC5/irisin does not affect female bone development. It has been previously shown that during lactation, maternal bones release calcium to supplement milk, especially in response to the large calcium demand induced by large litter size or a calcium-deficient diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wysolmerski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ardeshirpour et al., 2015</xref>). Similar to previous studies, 2 weeks of lactation resulted in bone loss in both WT and KO mice, with a significant reduction in cortical bone area (Ct. B.Ar), cortical bone area fraction percentage (Ct.B.Ar/T.Ar%), and cortical thickness (Ct. Th) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) as well as bone mineral density (BMD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, the KO mice lost less bone compared to the WT mice, as evidenced by the significantly higher bone area fraction percent, cortical thickness, and BMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B, and C</xref>) as well as the lower percentage of bone loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These data suggest that the FNDC5 KO mice are more resistant to the effects of calcium demand. Analysis of trabecular bone parameters including trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th), trabecular spacing (Tb. Sp), and trabecular number (Tb.

Of note, the majority of bone studies have been performed either exclusively on males, or females, but few on both. Most studies have used recombinant irisin treatment whereas we have focused on the effects of deleting irisin. Other studies have mainly examined the effects on osteoblasts and osteoclasts, whereas our studies have focused on osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Global deletion of FNDC5 on a normal diet had essentially no effect on bone in females, but in contrast, the null male mice have significantly more bone compared to WT males, but this bone has impaired mechanical properties. This suggests that the lack of FNDC5 is having no effect on the development or growth of the female skeleton, but does affect the male skeleton, increasing the size yet impairing matrix properties responsible for strength. Examination of their osteocytes showed that both female and male null mice have significantly fewer TRAP-positive osteocytes compared to their sex-matched WT controls suggesting that their osteocytes are more quiescent or less primed for bone resorption.</p><p>Challenging the null animals with calcium deficiency revealed dramatic differences in osteocytic osteolysis and osteoclast activation, two major functions of osteocytes. Deletion of FNDC5 in females is partially protective against calcium deficiency, but deletion in males accelerates both of these osteocyte functions resulting in greater bone loss compared to controls. We have shown previously that under calcium-demanding conditions such as lactation, osteocytes express genes previously thought only to be specific for osteoclasts including cathepsin K, TRAP, carbonic anhydrase, the proton pump V-ATPase, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Qing et al., 2012</xref>) and shown that osteocytes are the major source of RANKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nakashima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Xiong and O’Brien, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, lactating females lacking FNDC5 were partially resistant to bone loss, similar to ovariectomized females as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). To determine the effects of calcium deficiency on males, mice were given a low-calcium diet for 2 weeks. Unlike the protective effects of FNDC5/irisin deletion in females, bone loss was exacerbated in null males compared to controls on a low-calcium diet.</p><p>With 2 weeks of lactation and litter size comparable to WT controls, the null female mice had less circulating RANKL, fewer TRAP-positive osteoclasts, fewer TRAP-positive osteocytes, and smaller lacunar size. Our observation that the deletion of FNDC5/irisin makes lactating mice partially resistant to bone loss has an important implication with regard to the purpose of lactation. Lactation is a critical period for pups as they obtain essential nutrients, especially calcium, from the mother’s milk for their proper growth. Calcium lost by the mother’s bone during lactation is rapidly replaced upon weaning with complete recovery of bone mass within a week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Qing et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wysolmerski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kalkwarf, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kovacs, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wysolmerski, 2012</xref>). Our data suggest that FNDC5/irisin acts as a regulator of calcium release from maternal bones to fulfill the offspring demands during lactation. Therefore, irisin appears to play a beneficial role in ensuring offspring survival and consequently, successful reproduction.</p><p>To determine if low calcium would have a similar effect on male FNDC5 null bone, both males and females were subjected to a low-calcium diet for 2 weeks. The effects of a low-calcium diet on female osteocytes and bone loss were essentially identical to the effects of lactation, with two exceptions. First, serum RANKL levels were not significantly different between virgin and lactating null females, while they were between null females on a normal compared to a calcium diet suggesting that RANKL plays less of a role in lactation compared to calcium deficiency. Second, the medullary cavity and endosteal bone in the low-calcium females were completely protected in the FNDC5 null females but were not in the lactating FNDC5 null mice. Bone loss due to lactation or due to dietary calcium deficiency may target different bone sites. Our unpublished observations suggest that endosteal bone is removed faster than periosteal bone with lactation, but this remains to be carefully validated. This difference may also be due to elevated PTHrP during lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kovacs, 2001</xref>), whereas hypocalcemia increases circulating PTH levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goltzman, 2008</xref>), and it is not clear if hormones target distinct bone sites. Similar to the lactating FNDC5 null mice, the null females placed on the low-calcium diet had fewer TRAP-positive osteoclasts, fewer TRAP-positive osteocytes, and smaller lacunar size. Serum RANKL levels increased in both WT and null mice with dietary calcium deficiency, therefore, serum RANKL alone is not enough to explain the partial protective effect of FNDC5 deletion against bone loss. In summary, female null mice are not only resistant to bone loss due to estrogen deficiency as we showed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2018</xref>) but are also resistant to calcium deficiency either due to an increase in PTHrP as with lactation, or an increase in PTH as with a low-calcium diet.</p><p>Osteoporosis manifests earlier in females due to menopause, but males also develop osteoporosis but at an older age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Johannesdottir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Johnston and Dagar, 2020</xref>), and the elderly are known to suffer from calcium deficiency which accelerates bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kumssa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Body et al., 2016</xref>). Dietary calcium deficiency has been shown previously to affect female and male bone differently where female rat bones are more sensitive to a low-calcium diet compared to males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Geng and Wright, 2001</xref>). Similarly, in our study, we saw that WT females were more affected by calcium deficiency and lost more bone compared to WT male mice. However, the opposite was observed for the FNDC5/irisin null mice, where female null mice were partially resistant, and male null mice were more susceptible to bone loss with calcium deficiency compared to their WT counterparts. Despite starting with more bone volume compared to WT, the FNDC5 null males had increased osteocyte lacunar area and lost more bone with dietary calcium deficiency compared to WT males. This greater bone loss can be explained through the dramatic increase of TRAP-positive osteocytes and TRAP-positive osteoclasts, but not by a significantly greater increase in circulating RANKL. This sex difference indicates that FNDC5/irisin may be involved in the regulation of calcium release from bone via osteocytes in a sex-dependent manner.</p><p>Lacunar area is an indicator of osteocyte regulation of their lacunar microenvironment. Here, we report that osteocyte lacunar size is significantly larger in virgin WT female mice compared to same-age WT males. This difference in lacunar area indicates a distinction between female and male osteocyte function. The mammalian skeleton is a sexually dimorphic organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sharma et al., 2023</xref>), and female and male bones respond differently to circulating factors, hormones, and myokines as well as other challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kurapaty and Hsu, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Osipov et al., 2022</xref>). As osteocytes are regulators of bone formation and resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonewald, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dallas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Robling and Bonewald, 2020</xref>), this sex difference may be due to differences in male and female osteocytes. A recent study by Youlten and colleagues has shown that male and female osteocyte transcriptomes are distinctly different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Youlten et al., 2021</xref>). At 4 weeks of age, the female osteocyte transcriptome diverges from the male osteocyte transcriptome and these differences continue with age. A cluster of genes more highly expressed in female osteocytes compared to male osteocytes are those involved in bone resorption, the same ones elevated in osteocytes in response to lactation. These transcripts include genes necessary for osteocytic perilacunar remodeling and reduction in pH, which are essential for calcium removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Qing et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that the larger lacunar area in female osteocytes compared to male osteocytes may be due to the higher expression of bone resorption genes.</p><p>The magnitude of the effect size due to FNDC5 deficiency appears modest with regard to the quantitative cortical bone parameters. However, if one examines the changes in osteocyte lacunar size and the mechanical properties of these bones, the differences are greater. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, the lacunar area of the WT females on a low-calcium diet increases by over 30% and the FNDC5 null by less than 20%, while in the males it is approximately 38% in WT compared to 46% in null. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buenzli and Sims, 2015</xref>, a potential total loss of ~16,000 mm<sup>3</sup> (16 mL) of bone occurs through lactation in the human skeleton. This was based on our measurements in lactation-induced murine osteocytic osteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Qing et al., 2012</xref>). They used our 2D section of tibiae from lactating mice showing an increase in lacunar size from 38 to 46 µm<sup>2</sup>. In that paper we also showed that canalicular width is increased with lactation. Therefore, this suggests dramatically lower intracortical porosity due to the osteocyte lacunocanalicular system in female null mice compared to female WT mice either with lactation or a low-calcium diet and a dramatic increase in intracortical porosity in null males compared to WT males on a low-calcium diet. Based on these data, using the FNDC5 null animals, we would speculate that the product of FNDC5, irisin, is having a significant effect on the ultrastructure of bone in both males and females challenged with a low-calcium diet.</p><p>To begin to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the sex and genotype differences, we compared the osteocyte transcriptomes of 5-month-old female and male, WT and null mice. Our results show that the osteocyte transcriptomes of female and male WT mice are significantly different under normal conditions. A surprising difference we observed but not described in the Youlten paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Youlten et al., 2021</xref>) was that compared to WT female osteocytes, WT male osteocytes have much higher expression of genes involved in steroid, lipid, and cholesterol metabolism and transport pathways, lipid and solute carrier genes, and apolipoprotein genes. This suggests that osteocyte metabolism and bioenergetics are distinctly different between WT females and WT males. We hypothesize that the DEGs in these bioenergetic and metabolic pathways modulate bone mass and formation and may shed light on the sexual dimorphism of bones. As these differentially regulated pathways were not previously reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Youlten et al., 2021</xref>, this may be due to differences in strain, housing, diet, or microbiome. Another explanation is the greater osteocyte purity in our study as we used a series of collagenase digestions and EDTA chelation to remove any surface cells which was not performed in the Youlten paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Youlten et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>A second major difference between female and male WT osteocytes was the higher expression of genes involved in collagen matrix formation, bone mineralization, remodeling, resorption, and osteocytic osteolysis pathways in females compared to males. Many of the highly expressed bone resorption genes in WT female osteocytes have been shown to be elevated during lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Qing et al., 2012</xref>) including <italic>Acp5</italic>, <italic>Ctsk</italic>, and <italic>Mmp13</italic>, all involved in osteocytic osteolysis. This further supports our hypothesis that WT female osteocytes are more primed for resorption compared to WT males, presumably to meet the increased calcium demand during lactation, and correlates with the observed larger lacunae compared to males.</p><p>TGFβ is another potential player in osteocyte perilacunar/canalicular remodeling. Alliston and colleagues generated transgenic mice with reduced expression of the TGFβ type II receptor in mice expressing Dmp1-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dole et al., 2020</xref>) (PMID: 32282961) and found a significant difference in bone parameters and markers of osteocyte perilacunar remodeling between the sexes. The females were subjected to lactation and the transgenics were found to be resistant to osteocytic osteolysis compared to controls. However, these investigators did not investigate the lacunar remodeling process in males as compared to females as was performed in the present study using a low-calcium diet. Their study does suggest that TGFβ is involved in the osteocytic osteolysis that occurs with lactation, however, even though the transgenic males showed a disrupted lacunocanlicular network compared to WT males, this does not necessarily indicate a defect in perilacunar remodeling. It is more likely that the defect occurred during bone formation when osteoblasts were differentiating into osteocytes. In our study, we observed a higher expression of <italic>TGFb3</italic> in WT female mice compared to WT male mice, with no significant differences in <italic>TGFb1</italic> or <italic>TGFb2</italic> expression. This suggests that TGFβ3 may play a role in generating the larger lacunar area in WT females compared to WT males through increased matrix-related signaling in irisin-replete conditions.</p><p>Few differences were observed between WT female and null female osteocyte transcriptomes as would be expected for bone morphometry and the only difference observed was the number of TRAP-positive osteocytes. In contrast, osteocytes from WT males and null males are significantly different with regard to fatty acid and lipid metabolism pathways whereas null male mice have lower expression of these genes compared to WT males. This suggests a role for irisin in lipid metabolism and bioenergetics in male osteocytes. Lower expression in the null male mice may be responsible for the higher bone mass and inferior biomechanical properties compared to WT males suggesting these pathways mediate the effects of FNDC5/irisin on male bone.</p><p>Osteocytes from null females have higher expression of genes and pathways involved in collagen matrix organization, ossification, and mineralization compared to null males. Unlike WT males and females, there was no difference in expression of lipid, cholesterol, and fatty acid metabolism genes in null males compared to null females. Again, this indicates that FNDC5/irisin regulates male bone through these lipid-related pathways.</p><p>Lactation and calcium deficiency induce the same changes in females. Similar to that reported previously for lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Qing et al., 2012</xref>), osteocytes from WT female mice on a low-calcium diet exhibited an increase of several osteoclast/resorption/lactation genes including <italic>Acp5</italic>, <italic>Ctsk</italic>, <italic>Oscar</italic>, <italic>Mst1r</italic>, and <italic>Pth1r</italic> compared to WT females on a normal diet. Surprisingly, we also observed an increase in bone formation genes including <italic>Col1a1</italic>, <italic>Alpl</italic>, and <italic>Bglap</italic>. As osteocytic osteolysis is rapidly reversed within a week of weaning, the osteocyte may be preparing to rapidly reverse bone loss. We propose that once calcium is replenished, shutting off the proton pump will rapidly reverse the pH within the osteocyte lacunae, allowing bone-forming proteins such as alkaline phosphatase to become active to rapidly replace the osteocyte perilacunar matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jähn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Silver et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaplan, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farley and Baylink, 1986</xref>).</p><p>The main molecular mechanism responsible for the resistance of null female mice to calcium deficiency compared to WT female mice is lower expression of genes such as <italic>Tnfsf11</italic>, responsible for osteoclastic resorption. A correspondingly lower expression of bone formation genes including <italic>Col1a1</italic>, <italic>Alpl</italic>, and <italic>Bglap</italic> compared to WT females on a low-calcium diet was observed. The lower expression of both formation and resorption genes suggests a coupling of resorption with formation. Irisin appears to regulate calcium release in the female skeleton.</p><p>Osteocytes from WT male mice on a low-calcium diet expressed higher levels of bone resorption genes including <italic>Tnsfs11</italic>, <italic>Acp5</italic>, <italic>Ctsk</italic>, <italic>Oscar</italic>, and <italic>Mst1r</italic> compared to WT male mice on a normal diet as expected. Like the females, there is a coupling with bone formation genes as there is also an increase in <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Col1a1</italic>, suggesting the potential for osteocytes to rapidly replace their perilacunar matrix with calcium repletion. Similarly, the male null mice with calcium deficiency showed an increase in bone resorption genes including <italic>Tnsfs11</italic>, <italic>Oscar</italic>, and <italic>Car3</italic>, as well as an increase in bone formation genes such as <italic>Alpl</italic> and <italic>Bglap</italic> compared to null mice on a normal diet. The major differences between WT male mice with calcium deficiency and FNDC5 null male mice with calcium deficiency were the lower expression of genes involved in the extracellular matrix organization, ossification, and bone development pathways in the null male mice compared to WT males. This suggests a mechanism for how null male mice lose more bone with calcium deficiency compared to WT males.</p><p>Irisin could be having direct or indirect effects on osteocytes. Irisin can modulate adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boström et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Celi and Brown, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Luo et al., 2022</xref>), can potentially modulate osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells through <italic>α</italic>V<italic>β</italic>5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>), and bone marrow adipose tissue can modulate bone properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yeung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rosen and Bouxsein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Muruganandan and Sinal, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Styner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schwartz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">During, 2020</xref>) as well as osteocyte number and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al Saedi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Saedi et al., 2020</xref>).

Our data do not show significant expression of <italic>Fndc5</italic> in osteocytes. Studies from our group have found no expression of <italic>Fndc5</italic> in primary osteoblasts and primary osteocytes (transcriptome analysis with a raw count of 8–12), however both skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) and C2C12 myotubes have high expression of <italic>Fndc5</italic> (transcriptome raw count of 512–1000, unpublished). As such, we postulate that the effect of irisin on osteocytes is not an autocrine effect, but rather due to irisin production by skeletal muscle.</p><p>Irisin must bind to <italic>α</italic>V<italic>β</italic>5 integrins to function. Osteocytes express high levels of this receptor which was first discovered using the female MLO-Y4 osteocyte-like cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). Integrins are usually stable in the cell membrane with a half-life of 12–24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moreno-Layseca et al., 2019</xref>). In our RNA sequencing data, we observed a stable expression of both <italic>ITGAV</italic> and <italic>ITGB5</italic>, encoding integrins <italic>α</italic>V and <italic>β</italic>5 respectively, with no differences between either WT or null, male or female, calcium-replete or calcium-deficient mice. Recently it has been published that Hsp90<italic>α</italic> is necessary to facilitate irisin-<italic>α</italic>Vβ5 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mu et al., 2023</xref>). <italic>Hsp90a</italic>, the gene encoding this heat shock protein, is very highly expressed in both WT and null male and female mice, with no significant regulation by diet. The high expression of Hsp90<italic>α</italic> in osteocytes may explain their significant and rapid responses to irisin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In summary, during normal development and on a regular diet, FNDC5/irisin deletion has few if any effects on the female skeleton but a significant effect on the male skeleton resulting in more but weaker bone. However, with challenges, such as calcium deficiency, dramatic differences were observed. Our data suggest that irisin activates the osteocyte in females to initiate the removal of their perilacunar matrix and for bone resorption through osteoclast activation, presumably to provide calcium for reproduction purposes. In contrast, in males, irisin protects against osteocytic osteolysis and osteoclastic bone resorption under calcium-demanding conditions. This sex-specific effect may be due to the sexual dimorphism of the osteocyte transcriptome. The major findings of our work is summarized in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We have discovered a new novel function of irisin to ensure the survival of offspring and that irisin is essential for male but not female skeletal development. These findings could have implications for understanding sex-dependent differences in bone diseases, such as osteoporosis, and lead to the development of sex-targeted therapies.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Graphical abstract (image was created using BioRender.com and published using a CC BY-NC-ND license with permission).</title><p>No differences are observed in bone from Fndc5/irisin null female, whereas null male skeletons are larger but weaker compared to wildtype controls.

Uniquely mapped reads were used to quantify the gene-level expression employing featureCounts (subread v2.0.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liao et al., 2014</xref>) with the following parameters: ‘-s 2 -Q 10’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Quality control of samples</title><p>During data quality control, one of the KO female control samples (sample 23) was found to have a similar proportion of reads on chromosome Y as in male mice and a very low expression of the gene Xist, typically highly expressed in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), therefore this sample was excluded from the analysis.</p><p>The WT female low-calcium diet samples (samples 16, 17, and 18) had low mapping percentages of 37%, 32%, and 61%, respectively. This may be due to bacterial contamination. The two possible methods to process these data are to filter all the possible contaminated reads before alignment or align the reads without filtering. However, filtering the possible contaminated reads before alignment may result in removing some reads from the mouse genome which is similar to the bacterial genome (causing lower gene expression). In contrast, using data without filtering may result in some genes having higher expression levels due to reads from the bacterial genome which are aligned to mice genes. We decided to perform a principal component analysis using data without filtering and found that the samples clearly clustered into four groups: control male mice, control female mice, low-calcium diet male mice, and low-calcium diet female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Within each group, the separation of WT and KO mice is also clear. Due to contamination, samples 16 and 18 were slightly far apart from the others. However, contamination should not have a large global influence on the data as samples 16, 17, and 18 are close to the non-contaminated samples 5 and 6, also in the low-calcium diet female group. Additionally, we validated the data using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with selected genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>DEG analysis</title><p>The read counts matrix was imported to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Team RC, 2022</xref>, and analyzed with DEseq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Within DESeq2, read counts data were normalized with median of ratios, and DEGs were detected after independent filtering. In DEG analysis, we first detected DEGs between different groups. Significant genes were defined as genes with an unadjusted p-value less than 0.01 and absolute log2 fold-change larger than 1. Gene set enrichment analysis was applied on gene sets from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gene Ontology Consortium, 2021</xref>, using R package clusterProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). p-Value of less than 0.05 was considered as significant for the gene ontology analysis.

Consistent with the previous findings of Kim et al. (2018), the authors report 'protective' effects of irisin deficiency in lactating female FNDC5-null mice due to reduced osteocytic osteolysis. Interestingly, FNDC5 null mice show distinct changes when placed on LCD, with mutant females showing some protection from hyperparathyroidism-induced bone loss, while mutant males (which have more cortical bone at baseline) show increased LCD-induced bone loss. Furthermore, new insights into irisin's role in osteocytes regarding cellular energetic metabolism were provided by sex and gene-dependent transcriptomic datasets. Strengths of the well-written manuscript include clear description of sex-dependent effects, strong transcriptomic datasets, and focus on cortical bone changes using microCT, histomorphometry, BSEM, and serum analysis. Despite these strengths, important weaknesses are noted (below) which could be addressed to improve the impact of the work for a broad audience.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) Overall, the magnitude of the effect size due to FNDC5 deficiency in both male and female mice is rather modest at the level of bone mass. Looking at the data from a qualitative perspective, it is clear that knockout females still lose bone during lactation and on the low calcium diet (LCD). It is difficult to assess the physiologic consequence of the modest quantitative 'protection' seen in FNDC5 mutants since the mutants still show clear and robust effects of lactation and LCD on all parameters measured. Similarly, the magnitude of the 'increased' cortical bone loss in FNDC5 mutant males is also modest, and perhaps could be related to the fact that these mice are starting with slightly more cortical bone. Since the authors do not provide a convincing molecular explanation for why FNDC5 deficiency causes these somewhat subtle changes, I would like to offer a suggestion for the authors to consider (below, point #2) which might de-emphasize the focus of the manuscript on FNDC5. If the authors chose not to follow this suggestion, the manuscript could be strengthened by addressing the consequences of the modest changes observed in WT versus FNDC5 KO mice. I understand that the effects of FNDC5 are more obvious at the level of osteocyte morphology, and it is reasonable to emphasize these findings here.</p><p>(2) The bone RNA-seq findings reported in Figures 4-6 are quite interesting. Although Youlten et al previously reported that the osteocyte transcriptome is sex-dependent, the work here certainly advances that notion to a considerable degree, and likely will be of high interest to investigators studying skeletal biology and sexual dimorphism in general. To this end, one direction for the authors to consider might be to refocus their manuscript towards sexually-dimorphic gene expression patterns in osteocytes and the different effects of LCD on male versus female mice. This would allow the authors to better emphasize these major findings, and then to use FNDC5 deficiency as an illustrative example of how sexually-dimorphic osteocytic gene expression patterns might be affected by deletion of an osteocyte-acting endocrine factor. Ideally, the authors would confirm RNA-seq data comparing male versus female mice in osteocytes using in situ hybridization or immunostaining. Of course, this point is only a suggestion for the authors to consider.</p><p>(3) It would be appreciated if the authors could provide additional serum parameters (if possible) to clarify incomplete data in both lactation and low-calcium diet models: RANKL/OPG ratio, Ctx, PTHrP, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. I understand that this may not be possible due to lack of available material.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92263.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The goal of this study was to examine the role of FNDC5 in the response of the murine skeleton to either lactation or a calcium-deficient diet. The authors find that female FNDC5 KO mice are somewhat protected from the bone loss and osteocyte lacunar enlargement caused by either lactation or a calcium-deficient diet. In contrast, male FNDC5 KO mice lose more bone and have a greater enlargement of osteocyte lacunae than their wild type controls. Based on these results, the authors conclude that in males irisin protects bone from calcium deficiency but that in females it promotes calcium removal from bone for lactation.</p><p>While some of the conclusions of this study are supported by the results, it is not clear that the modest effects of FNDC5 deletion have an impact on calcium homeostasis or milk production.</p><p>Specific comments.</p><p>(1) The authors sometimes refer to FNDC5 and other times to irisin when describing causes for a particular outcome. Because irisin was not measured in any of the experiments, the authors should not conclude that lack of irisin is responsible. Along these lines, is there any evidence that either lactation or a calcium-deficient diet increases production of irisin in mice?</p><p>(2) The results of the irisin-rescue experiment shown in figure 2G cannot be appropriately interpreted without normal diet controls. In addition, some evidence that the AAV8-irisin virus actually increased irisin levels in the mice would strengthen the conclusion.</p><p>(3) There is insufficient evidence to support the idea that the effect of FNDC5 on bone resorption and osteocytic osteolysis is important for the transfer of calcium from bone to milk. Previous studies by others have shown that bone resorption is not required to maintain milk or serum calcium when dietary calcium is sufficient but is critical if dietary calcium is low (Endo. 156:2762-73, 2015). To support the conclusions of the current study, it would be necessary to determine whether FNDC5 is required to maintain calcium levels when lactating mice lack sufficient dietary calcium.</p><p>(4) The amount of cortical bone loss due to lactation is very similar in both WT and FNDC5 KO mice. The results of the statistical analysis of the data presented in figure 1B are surprising given the very similar effect size of lactation. The key result from the 2-way ANOVA is whether there is an effect of genotype on the effect size of lactation (genotype-lactation interaction). The interaction terms were not provided. Similar concerns are noted for the results shown in figure 1G and H.</p><p>(5) It is not clear what justifies the term 'primed' or 'activated' for resorption. Is there evidence that a certain level of TRAP expression lowers the threshold for osteocytic osteolysis in response to a stimulus?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92263.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary: Irisin has previously been demonstrated to be a muscle-secreted factor that affects skeletal homeostasis. Through the use of different experimental approaches, such as genetic knockout models, recombinant Irisin treatment, or different cell lines, the role of Irisin on skeletal homeostasis has been revealed to be more complex than previously thought and this warrants further examination of its role. Therefore, the current study sought to rigorously examine the effects of global Irisin knockout (KO) in male and female mouse bone. Authors demonstrated that in calcium-demanding settings, such as lactation or low-calcium diet, female Irisin KO mice lose less bone compared to wildtype (WT) female mice. Interestingly male Irisin KO mice exhibited worse skeletal deterioration compared to WT male mice when fed low-calcium diet. When examined for transcriptomic profiles of osteocyte-enriched cortical bone, authors found that Irisin KO altered the expression of osteocytic osteolysis genes as well as steroid and fatty acid metabolism genes in males but not in females. These data support authors' conclusion that Irisin regulates skeletal homeostasis in a sex-dependent manner.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The major strength of the study is rigorous examination of the effects of Irisin deletion in the settings of skeletal maturity and increased calcium demands in female and male mice. Since many of the common musculoskeletal disorders are dependent on sex, examining both sexes in the preclinical setting is crucial. Had the investigators only examined females or males in this study, the conclusion from each sex would have contradicted each other regarding the role of Irisin on bone. Also, the approaches are thorough and comprehensive that assess the functional (mechanical testing), morphological (microCT, BSEM, and histology), and cellular (RNA-seq) properties of bone. Transcriptomic data deposited to NCBI GEO data repository will be a valuable resource to musculoskeletal researchers who aim to further assess the affects of Irisin on skeleton.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One of the weaknesses of this study is a lack of detailed mechanistic analysis of why Irisin has sex-dependent role on skeletal homeostasis. However, the osteocyte transcriptome comparisons between LC females vs. LC males lay a foundation for such future mechanistic studies.</p><p>Another weakness is authors did not present data that convincingly demonstrate that Irisin secretion is altered in the skeletal muscle between female vs. male WT mice in response to calcium restriction. The supplement skeletal muscle data only present functional and electrophysiological outcomes. Since Itgav or Itgb5 were not different in any of the experimental groups, it is assumed that the changes in the level of Irisin is responsible for the phenotypes observed in WT mice. Assessing Irisin expression will further strengthen the conclusion based on observing skeletal changes that occur in Irisin KO male and female mice.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92263.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shimonty</surname><given-names>Anika</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Indiana University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Indianapolis</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pin</surname><given-names>Fabrizio</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Indiana University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Indianapolis</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Prideaux</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Indiana University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Indianapolis</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Gang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Indiana University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Indianapolis</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Huot</surname><given-names>Joshua</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Indiana University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Indianapolis</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Hyeonwoo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Daejon</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rosen</surname><given-names>Clifford j</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Maine Health Access Foundation</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Portland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Spiegelman</surname><given-names>Bruce M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Dana Farber Cancer Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bonewald</surname><given-names>Lynda F</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Indiana University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Indianapolis</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the magnitude of the effect size due to FNDC5 deficiency in both male and female mice is rather modest. Looking at the data from a qualitative perspective, it is clear that knockout females still lose bone during lactation and on the low calcium diet (LCD). It is difficult to assess the physiologic consequence of the modest quantitative 'protection' seen in FNDC5 mutants since the mutants still show clear and robust effects of lactation and LCD on all parameters measured. Similarly, the magnitude of the 'increased' cortical bone loss in FNDC5 mutant males is also modest and perhaps could be related to the fact that these mice are starting with slightly more cortical bone. Since the authors do not provide a convincing molecular explanation for why FNDC5 deficiency causes these somewhat subtle changes, I would like to offer a suggestion for the authors to consider (below, point #2) which might de-emphasize the focus of the manuscript on FNDC5. If the authors chose not to follow this suggestion, the manuscript could be strengthened by addressing the consequences of the modest changes observed in WT versus FNDC5 KO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree that the magnitude of the effect size due to FNDC5 deficiency is modest with regards to the quantitative cortical bone parameters. However, if one examines the changes in osteocyte lacunar size and the mechanical properties of these bones, the differences are greater. As shown in Figure 3 E, the lacunar area of the WT females on a low calcium diet increases by over 30% and the KO by less than 20%, while in the males it is approximately 38% in WT compared to 46% in KO mice. According to Sims and Buenzli (PMID: 25708054) a potential total loss of ~16,000 mm3 (16 mL) of bone occurs through lactation in the human skeleton. This was based on our measurements in lactation-induced murine osteocytic osteolysis (Qing et al PMID: 22308018). They used our 2D section of tibiae from lactating mice showing an increase in lacunar size from 38 to 46 um2. In that paper we also showed that canalicular width is increased with lactation. Therefore, this would suggest a dramatic decrease in intracortical porosity due to the osteocyte lacunocanalicular system in female KO on a low calcium diet compared to WT females and a dramatic increase in KO males compared to WT males. Also, PTH was higher in the serum of female WT compared to female KO mice on a low calcium diet, the opposite for males in order to maintain normal calcium levels (See Table 1). Based on this data, using the FNDC5 null animals, we would speculate that the product of FNDC5, irisin, is having a highly significant effect on the ultrastructure of bone in both males and females challenged with a low calcium diet.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The bone RNA-seq findings reported in Figures 4-6 are quite interesting. Although Youlten et al previously reported that the osteocyte transcriptome is sex-dependent, the work here certainly advances that notion to a considerable degree and likely will be of high interest to investigators studying skeletal biology and sexual dimorphism in general. To this end, one direction for the authors to consider might be to refocus their manuscript toward sexually-dimorphic gene expression patterns in osteocytes and the different effects of LCD on male versus female mice. This would allow the authors to better emphasize these major findings, and to then use FNDC5 deficiency as an illustrative example of how sexually-dimorphic osteocytic gene expression patterns might be affected by deletion of an osteocyte-acting endocrine factor. Ideally, the authors would confirm RNA-seq data comparing male versus female mice in osteocytes using in situ hybridization or immunostaining.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for this suggestion. We have compared the different effects of LCD on male versus female mice in our revised version and have added a figure containing this information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Along the lines of point #2 (above), the presentation of the RNA-seq studies in Figures 4-6 is somewhat confusing in that the volcano plot titles seem to be reversed. For example, Figure 4A is titled &quot;WT M: WT F&quot;, but the genes in the upper right quadrant appear to be up-regulated in female cortical bone RNA samples. Should this plot instead be titled &quot;WT F: WT M&quot;? If so, then all other volcano plots should be re-titled as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have now insured that the plots are appropriately labeled.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Have the authors compared male versus female transcriptomes of LCD mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have now compared the male vs female transcriptomes of LCD mice and added an additional figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It would be appreciated if the authors could provide additional serum parameters (if possible) to clarify incomplete data in both lactation and low-calcium diet models: RANKL/OPG ratio, Ctx, PTHrP, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: It is not possible to quantitate each of these as the serum has been exhausted. We have checked the RANKL/OPG ratio in the RNA seq and qPCR data using osteocyte enriched bone chips and found no difference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Lastly, the data that overexpressing irisin improved bone properties in Fig 2G was somewhat confusing. Based on Kim et al.'s (2018) work, irisin injection increased sclerostin gene expression and serum levels, thus reducing bone formation. Were sclerostin levels affected by irisin overexpression in this study? Was irisin's role in modulating sclerostin levels attenuated with additional calcium deficiency?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have not observed any differences in the osteocyte Sost mRNA expression between WT and KO normal and low-calcium-diet male and female mice in our RNAseq and qPCR data. As such, we did not check the Sost levels for the 2G experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The goal of this study was to examine the role of FNDC5 in the response of the murine skeleton to either lactation or a calcium-deficient diet. The authors find that female FNDC5 KO mice are somewhat protected from bone loss and osteocyte lacunar enlargement caused by either lactation or a calcium-deficient diet. In contrast, male FNDC5 KO mice lose more bone and have a greater enlargement of osteocyte lacunae than their wild-type controls. Based on these results, the authors conclude that in males irisin protects bone from calcium deficiency but that in females it promotes calcium removal from bone for lactation.</p><p>While some of the conclusions of this study are supported by the results, it is not clear that the modest effects of FNDC5 deletion have an impact on calcium homeostasis or milk production.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>(1) The authors sometimes refer to FNDC5 and other times to irisin when describing causes for a particular outcome. Because irisin was not measured in any of the experiments, the authors should not conclude that lack of irisin is responsible. Along these lines, is there any evidence that either lactation or a calcium-deficient diet increases the production of irisin in mice?</p></disp-quote><p>therefore we have extrapolated that the observed effects are due to a lack of circulating irisin. However, this does not rule out that Fndc5 itself could have a function, but this would have to be most likely in muscle and not in the osteocyte as we do not detect significant levels of irisin in either primary osteoblasts nor primary osteocytes compared to muscle and C2C12 cells. As such, we concluded that the phenotypical differences we saw in our experiments are due to a lack of irisin. We now address the reviewer’s point in the discussion. The measurement of irisin in the circulation with lactation or with low calcium diet of normal mice has not been performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The results of the irisin-rescue experiment shown in figure 2G cannot be appropriately interpreted without normal diet controls. In addition, some evidence that the AAV8-irisin virus actually increased irisin levels in the mice would strengthen the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We do not have the normal diet controls at this time. We have quantitate tagged irisin in other AAV experiments and found highly significant expression</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) There is insufficient evidence to support the idea that the effect of FNDC5 on bone resorption and osteocytic osteolysis is important for the transfer of calcium from bone to milk. Previous studies by others have shown that bone resorption is not required to maintain milk or serum calcium when dietary calcium is sufficient but is critical if dietary calcium is low (Endo. 156:2762-73, 2015). To support the conclusions of the current study, it would be necessary to determine whether FNDC5 is required to maintain calcium levels when lactating mice lack sufficient dietary calcium.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree that it would be important to measure calcium levels in the milk to test the hypothesis that FNDC5 is important to maintain calcium levels in milk. However, as the calcium levels are normal in the serum, we are assuming they are normal in milk. This would require future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The amount of cortical bone loss due to lactation is very similar in both WT and FNDC5 KO mice. The results of the statistical analysis of the data presented in figure 1B are surprising given the very similar effect size of lactation. The key result from the 2-way ANOVA is whether there is an effect of genotype on the effect size of lactation (genotype-lactation interaction). The interaction terms were not provided. Similar concerns are noted for the results shown in figure 1G and H.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree, thanks. We will now add the interaction terms in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is not clear what justifies the term 'primed' or 'activated' for resorption. Is there evidence that a certain level of TRAP expression lowers the threshold for osteocytic osteolysis in response to a stimulus?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The number of TRAP positive osteocytes in female KO mice are lower than in female WT. The number of TRAP positive osteocytes are lower in WT males compared to WT females. We propose that irisin plays a role in the number of TRAP positive osteocytes in normal, WT females by readying or preparing these cells to rapidly respond to low calcium. We will use the term ‘primed’ and will not use the term ‘activated’. We are open to any terminology or description as to why this is observed and what irisin could be doing to the osteocyte.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Irisin has previously been demonstrated to be a muscle-secreted factor that affects skeletal homeostasis. Through the use of different experimental approaches, such as genetic knockout models, recombinant Irisin treatment, or different cell lines, the role of Irisin on skeletal homeostasis has been revealed to be more complex than previously thought and this warrants further examination of its role. Therefore, the current study sought to rigorously examine the effects of global Irisin knockout (KO) in male and female mouse bone. Authors demonstrated that in calcium-demanding settings, such as lactation or low-calcium diet, female Irisin KO mice lose less bone compared to wild-type (WT) female mice. Interestingly male Irisin KO mice exhibited worse skeletal deterioration compared to WT male mice when fed a low-calcium diet. When examined for transcriptomic profiles of osteocyte-enriched cortical bone, authors found that Irisin KO altered the expression of osteocytic osteolysis genes as well as steroid and fatty acid metabolism genes in males but not in females. These data support the authors' conclusion that Irisin regulates skeletal homeostasis in sex-dependent manner.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The major strength of the study is the rigorous examination of the effects of Irisin deletion in the settings of skeletal maturity and increased calcium demands in female and male mice. Since many of the common musculoskeletal disorders are dependent on sex, examining both sexes in the preclinical setting is crucial. Had the investigators only examined females or males in this study, the conclusions from each sex would have contradicted each other regarding the role of Irisin on bone. Also, the approaches are thorough and comprehensive that assess the functional (mechanical testing), morphological (microCT, BSEM, and histology), and cellular (RNA-seq) properties of bone.</p><p>Weaknesses: One of the weaknesses of this study is a lack of detailed mechanistic analysis of why Irisin has a sex-dependent role on skeletal homeostasis. This absence is particularly notable in the osteocyte transcriptomic results where such data could have been used to further probe potential candidate pathways between LC females vs. LC males.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Our future studies will focus on understanding the molecular mechanism behind the sex-dependent effects of irisin. Our RNA seq data shows a significant difference in the lipid, steroid, and fat metabolism pathways between male and female mice, as well as between WT and KO mice. Future studies will focus on these pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another weakness is authors did not present data that convincingly demonstrate that Irisin secretion is altered in the skeletal muscle between female vs. male WT mice in response to calcium restriction. The supplement skeletal muscle data only present functional and electrophysiolgical outcomes. Since Itgav or Itgb5 were not different in any of the experimental groups, it is assumed that the changes in the level of Irisin is responsible for the phenotypes observed in WT mice. Assessing Irisin expression will further strengthen the conclusion based on observing skeletal changes that occur in Irisin KO male and female mice.</p><p>Response: The problem is that the commercial assays for irisin are not dependable, and results can differ widely across and beyond the physiologic range of 1-10 ng/ml. In part this is due to the nature of the polyclonal antibodies used and the resultant cross reactivity with other proteins. It was shown in Islam et al, 2021 (Nature Metabolism) that the commercial ELISAs were completely unreliable in mice and the only reliable method of measuring circulating irisin is mass spectrometry.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>(1) Were there any low calcium diet food intake or body weight alterations between littermates and FDNC5 KO mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Yes, and we can now include the body weight data and the food intake data in the supplement. We do not observe any significant difference between the groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Fig 1, ideally the authors would provide the osteocyte lacunar density along with the lacunar area.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We do not observe any difference in osteocyte density in any of the groups. There is not sufficient time within 2 weeks to see a change in osteocyte density because there is no new bone formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) What is the author's comment on the involvement of irisin on TGF-B signaling since the authors observed peri lacunar remodeling in FDNC5 KO mice? Authors should also include this in the discussion section regarding the Irisin-TGF-B signaling in terms of observed increased matrix-related signals.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Perilacunar modeling is the removal followed by the replacement of the perilacunar and pericanilucular matrix as occurs with lactation (Qing et al 2012). Osteocytic osteolysis is the first half of that process where the matrix is removed. Alliston and colleagues generated transgenic mice with reduced expression of the TGFb Type II receptor in mice by using the Dmp1-Cre (PMID: 32282961). They clearly found a significant difference in bone parameters, the appearance of the osteocyte lacunocanalicular network, and markers of the osteocyte perilacunar remodeling between the sexes, however they did not compare the lacunar remodeling process in males as compared to females. The females were subjected to lactation and were found to be resistant to osteocytic osteolysis. To compare males and females, they would have had to challenge both sexes to a high calcium demanding condition such as low calcium diet as performed in the current study. Their study does suggest that TGFβ is involved in the osteocytic osteolysis that occurs with lactation. However, as the null males showed an abnormal lacunocanlicular network compared to wildtype males, this does not necessarily indicate a defect in perilacunar remodeling. It is more likely that the defect occurred during bone formation when osteoblasts were differentiating into osteocytes. Therefore, we will reference this paper regarding the role of TGFβ in osteocytic osteolysis in females with lactation but not in the comparison of males to females. We have examined the normalized expression of TGFβ1, 2, and 3 in the present study and found no significant differences in TGFβ1 or 2 in any of the groups, but did find significantly higher expression of TGFβ3 in females compared to males for WT (fdr &lt; 0.05), LCD WT (fdr &lt; 0.05), and Control KO (p value &lt; 0.01). Perhaps this isoform is playing a major role in osteocytic osteolysis that occurs with lactation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Did the authors compare the transcriptomic dataset between lactated female WT vs. KO groups? Or were the RNA-seq studies only performed on LCD study samples?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have examined RNA sequence on the LCD study samples, and not in the lactating females.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Line 401 on page 14 states that the sexes respond differently to calcium deficiency. Lacunar area increases in both sexes, so the response is very similar. What appears to be different between the sexes is the role of FNDC5 in this process.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Female WT mice have higher osteocyte lacunar area at baseline with normal diet compared to WT males. With the low calcium diet, lacunar area increases in both sexes, with female WTs having a greater increase. We agree that what appears to be different between the sexes is the role of FNDC5 when challenged with high calcium demand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The authors state in the abstract and discussion that 'We propose Irisin ensures the survival of offspring by targeting the osteocytes...'.
