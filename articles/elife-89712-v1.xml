Yet, the factors that control LLPC specification and survival remain poorly resolved. Using intravital two-photon imaging, we find that in contrast to most plasma cells (PCs) in the bone marrow (BM), LLPCs are uniquely sessile and organized into clusters that are dependent on APRIL, an important survival factor. Using deep, bulk RNA sequencing, and surface protein flow-based phenotyping, we find that LLPCs express a unique transcriptome and phenotype compared to bulk PCs, fine-tuning expression of key cell surface molecules, CD93, CD81, CXCR4, CD326, CD44, and CD48, important for adhesion and homing. Conditional deletion of <italic>Cxcr4</italic> in PCs following immunization leads to rapid mobilization from the BM, reduced survival of antigen-specific PCs, and ultimately accelerated decay of antibody titer. In naÃ¯ve mice, the endogenous LLPCs BCR repertoire exhibits reduced diversity, reduced somatic mutations, and increased public clones and IgM isotypes, particularly in young mice, suggesting LLPC specification is non-random. As mice age, the BM PC compartment becomes enriched in LLPCs, which may outcompete and limit entry of new PCs into the LLPC niche and pool.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CXCR4</kwd><kwd>vaccination</kwd><kwd>bone marrow</kwd><kwd>multiphoton</kwd><kwd>long-lived plasma cells</kwd><kwd>antibody</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL141491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jing</surname><given-names>Zhixin</given-names></name><name><surname>Ovando</surname><given-names>Luis</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Rosa</given-names></name><name><surname>Fooksman</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI132633</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Demouth</surname><given-names>Megan</given-names></name><name><surname>Chandran</surname><given-names>Kartik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006984</institution-id><institution>Irma T.

Variability in the duration of antibody responses is chiefly dependent on the composition of short-lived and long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) produced, which can have distinct lifespans of a few days and months or years in mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sze et al., 2000</xref>). The ability to generate LLPCs also declines with old age, and hence the durability of the vaccine response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frasca and Blomberg, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palacios-Pedrero et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, understanding how LLPCs are generated and maintained are essential for enhancing durability of vaccine-induced antibody responses in humans.</p><p>Previous studies have reported these LLPCs are enriched in the bone marrow (BM) but can also be found in spleen and mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Manz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Slifka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bortnick et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bohannon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lemke et al., 2016</xref>). Tracking of endogenous polyclonal LLPCs is challenging, requiring labeling and tracking by thymidine analogs like BrdU, or looking for antigen-specific antibody-forming cells by ELISPOTs. However, these approaches are not amenable to tracking live cells by flow cytometry, as there have been no phenotypic markers for endogenous LLPCs, making these cells elusive. Approaches to genetically track LLPCs were recently established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al., 2020</xref>), which allows studying their turnover and generation.</p><p>One major question is how these cells are specified. LLPCs can mature from newly minted plasmablasts in the germinal center that have undergone affinity maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takahashi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Phan et al., 2006</xref>). However, LLPCs can also develop in a T cell-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bortnick and Allman, 2013</xref>) and B-1 lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vergani et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that there are multiple, distinct pathways to becoming LLPCs, or specification is regulated extrinsically by their niche, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robinson et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, it is unclear if LLPCs arise from unique clones, unique pools of B cells, or are just randomly specified from the bulk plasma cell (PC) pool, in a stochastic manner, potentially through maturation in the bone marrow (BM) niche. Determining what is required for LLPC specification is important for vaccine development.</p><p>A second major question regarding LLPCs is how they are maintained and survive in a cell-specific manner. While functionally they are metabolically active, quiescent, murine LLPCs (defined as B220- 2NBDG<sup>+</sup>) are thought to have minimal transcriptional specificity compared to bulk PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, human LLPCs (CD19<sup>-</sup> CD138<sup>high</sup>) have been shown to be transcriptionally distinct from other mature PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joyner et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The BM is a major lodging site for LLPCs and it is believed that key cell-extrinsic cellular and molecular factors support their longevity. PCsâ migratory behavior and positioning within BM parenchyma is also linked to chemokine receptor signaling, cell adhesion, cytokine, and age of mice. Previous work from our laboratory found that as PCs age, CXCR4 expression is increased, suggesting LLPCs may upregulate certain key molecules for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benet et al., 2021</xref>). CXCR4 is a master chemokine receptor for BM tropism but its role in humoral immunity is thought to be dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nie et al., 2004</xref>). However, CXCR4 drives PC motility in the BM and is upregulated on PC with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benet et al., 2021</xref>). We and others have shown that BM PCs are spatially organized in clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mokhtari et al., 2015</xref>) and PCs are less motile when they enter these clusters, suggesting extrinsic signals may be important cues for motility. Moreover, in mice lacking APRIL, a key survival cytokine for PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benson et al., 2008</xref>), these clusters were reduced, suggesting clusters and cell dynamics may be functionally important for PC survival.</p><p>In this study, we aim to understand what unique features are associated with LLPC physiology, at a molecular, cellular, and spatial-temporal level using cell fate labeling of PCs. We find that these cells exhibit intrinsic changes in gene expression and cell motility patterns that may underlie their unique ability to persist for long periods of time, despite potential competition from a continuously evolving PC pool. Among the factors promoting their survival, CXCR4 plays a dominant cell-intrinsic role in promoting LLPCs retention and survival and thus, maintaining durability of humoral responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PC turnover rate decreases with mouse age</title><p>We previously reported that in middle-aged mice, PC motility and clustering within the BM and their recirculation capacity was increased, in comparison to young mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benet et al., 2021</xref>). We speculated that these changes in PC dynamics could alter homeostatic PC turnover rates and may also reflect changes in frequency of LLPCs within PC pool with aging. To study LLPC survival mechanisms, we constructed a novel mouse line, Blimp1-ERT2-Cre-TdTomato (BEC), which contains a tamoxifen-inducible cre recombinase (ERT2-cre) and fluorescent reporter TdTomato under the control of the <italic>Prdm1</italic> (BLIMP1) locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). We verified that &gt;99% of CD138<sup>high</sup>B220- BM PCs were TdTomato<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) and that 94% of TdTomato<sup>+</sup> were ASCs (CD138<sup>High</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).

Acute treatment with tamoxifen for 3 consecutive days induced robust Cre-mediated recombination and irreversible expression of YFP, comprised of 98% PCs at day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) but not in the absence of tamoxifen treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Over time, YFP<sup>+</sup> PCs that survive for months should by definition be bona fide LLPCs. However, in these mice, not all LLPCs would be YFP<sup>+</sup>, as new LLPCs should develop in the unlabeled (YFP<sup>-</sup>) fraction.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Plasma cell (PC) turnover rate decreases with mouse age.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PC purity of TdTomato<sup>+</sup>YFP<sup>-</sup> and TdTomato<sup>+</sup>YFP<sup>+</sup> cells in BEC-YFP mouse at day 5 post tamoxifen treatment.

At day 150, only 1.8% BM PCs were YFP<sup>+</sup> in young mice compared to 14% in middle-aged mice, while in spleen, 0.6% YFP<sup>+</sup> PCs remained in young mice compared to 3.1% in middle-aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Based on absolute numbers of YFP<sup>+</sup> PCs, we analyzed rate of PC decay in the BM and spleen and found that BM PCs decay more rapidly in young mice (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 58 days) than in middle-aged mice (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 93 days) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In the spleen, decline of labeled PCs was overall faster than in the BM, in line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). However, we observed that the decline was slightly more rapid in young mice (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 28 days) as compared to middle-aged mice (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 39 days) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Thus, we conclude that homeostatic PC turnover is dependent on tissue-specific microenvironment and aging, suggesting that LLPCs may accumulate with aging, particularly in the BM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>BM LLPCs display cell-intrinsic arrest and clustering</title><p>Reduced PC turnover with age, specifically in the BM niche, suggested that PCs were more sessile and better retained in the BM with aging. However, our previous study that showed middle-aged mice had increased overall PC motility and recirculation compared to young mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benet et al., 2021</xref>). We hypothesized that in our previous study, imaging and recirculation measurements did not discriminate between behaviors of LLPCs and immature PCs, which may have different dynamics.</p><p>To test this idea, we applied BEC fate labeling to specifically track polyclonal LLPC dynamics and organization in the BM of unimmunized mice. While YFP expression from <italic>Rosa26</italic> reporter was bright enough to visualize labeled LLPCs, YFP<sup>-</sup> bulk PCs, which also expressed low levels of Tomato from expression of the BEC allele (Tomato<sup>dim</sup>), were insufficiently labeled for deep imaging in the BM. Thus, we bred double PC reporter, Blimp1-YFP BEC <italic>Rosa26<sup>LSL-Tomato</sup></italic> mice, in which all PCs were YFP<sup>high</sup> from expression of the Blimp1-YFP reporter, and with tamoxifen treatment, could be fate-labeled to co-express high levels of Tomato. We treated these mice with tamoxifen and analyzed surface phenotype of PCs at day 5 and 60 post treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Tomato<sup>bright</sup> labeled PCs were easily discernable from Tomato<sup>dim</sup> bulk PCs by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). While at day 5 post treatment, Tomato<sup>bright</sup> and Tomato<sup>dim</sup> PCs were similar in PC maturation markers CXCR4 and CD93, by day 60, Tomato<sup>bright</sup> were phenotypically distinct suggesting they had matured to an LLPC state (explored further in the next section). Using intravital time-lapse imaging, we compared Tomato<sup>bright</sup> and Tomato<sup>dim</sup> BM PCs dynamics in young and middle-aged mice at day 5, day 30, and day 60 post tamoxifen in order to determine the contribution of intrinsic PC age/maturity to their motility and positioning. We could discriminate and track both PC populations on the basis of Tomato expression in the same time-lapse movies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2âvideo 1</xref>). At day 5 after treatment, dynamics of both subsets of PCs were similar, based on cell trajectories, track and displacement velocities, and mean-squared displacement analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, at day 30 and 60 timepoints, Tomato<sup>bright</sup> PCs showed reduced motility as compared to Tomato<sup>dim</sup> PCs indicating PC age correlated with reduced cell motility. This effect with PC aging was seen in both young and middle-aged mice, suggesting it was cell intrinsic, and thus related to LLPC maturation. While average speeds for Tomato<sup>bright</sup> PCs were relatively slow, some rare PCs were highly motile. At day 30 and 60 timepoints, these fast cells were predominantly in Tomato<sup>dim</sup> populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), consistent with immature, short-lived PCs having faster motility than LLPCs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Bone marrow (BM) long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) display cell-intrinsic arrest and clustering.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental setup for intratibial two-photon intravital imaging of both TdTomato<sup>dim</sup>YFP<sup>+</sup> bulk plasma cells (PCs) and TdTomato<sup>bright</sup>YFP<sup>+</sup> LLPCs in the same young or middle-aged mouse by timestamping at days 5, 30, and 60 after oral gavage tamoxifen treatment.

We used two approaches to determine if LLPCs were more clustered than total bulk PCs. First, we applied our custom script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benet et al., 2021</xref>) to identify high-density PC clusters. We masked these regions and found that at late timepoints after tamoxifen, Tomato<sup>bright</sup> LLPCs were more enriched in clusters than bulk PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). As this approach can be sensitive to PC densities, we developed a second approach to determine if subsets of PCs were enriched in clusters, based on measuring the nearest distance to 20 PC neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Using this measurement, we found that at day 60, Tomato<sup>bright</sup> LLPCs were closer to neighboring PCs (i.e. more clustered) than Tomato<sup>dim</sup> bulk PCs, in the BM of both young and middle-aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Taken together, while overall PC motility increases with mouse age, most of the increases in motility can be accounted for by bulk PCs and not by LLPCs, which were relatively sessile. This decrease in LLPC motility is also accompanied by an aggregation or retention in PC clusters, suggesting these are LLPC niches, and may be important for their cell-intrinsic survival or retention in the BM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>LLPCs exhibit unique surface phenotype and accumulate in the BM with mouse aging</title><p>Based on previous datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhmetzyanova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cornelis et al., 2020</xref>), we curated a candidate list of 19 PC markers, to identify surface markers of LLPCs. We measured normalized surface expression (fold change) on YFP<sup>+</sup> LLPCs over YFP<sup>-</sup> bulk PCs, in the BM and spleen of both young and middle-aged BEC-YFP mice at day 5, 30, 90, or 150 post tamoxifen treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We identified six markers that were upregulated (CD93, CD81, CXCR4, and CD326) or two downregulated (CD44 and CD48) with PC age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). For the most part, these changes were subtle, whereas CD93 and CD81 expression showed the largest difference in surface expression with PC age. CD93 expression was uniquely bimodal among all tested markers, with YFP<sup>+</sup> LLPCs in BM and spleen were predominantly found in CD93<sup>high</sup> subset, in line with genetic evidence for its importance in LLPC maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chevrier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Correcting for their relative abundance at day 5, labeled WT (Tomato<sup>bright</sup>) PCs in BM hardly decayed over 90 days, whereas ~50% of CXCR4<sup>cKO</sup> were lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Within the spleen, PC turnover was overall more rapid, with a 50% and 90% loss of WT and CXCR4<sup>cKO</sup> labeled PCs, respectively. Overall, WT PCs outcompeted CXCR4<sup>cKO</sup> PCs in the BM and spleen over time as assessed by competency ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). We analyzed changes in key PC pro-survival factors, Mcl1 and Bcl2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>), and found that WT labeled PCs had higher relative expression than CXCR4<sup>cKO</sup> counterparts, and while they had similar levels at day 5, PC survival was compromised by loss of CXCR4 over time in bone and spleen suggesting CXCR4 is important for long-term survival of PCs.</p><p>CXCR4 signaling can directly promote cell survival via AKT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scotton et al., 2002</xref>), but it may act indirectly on PC survival by dislodging from survival niches. Thus, we asked if loss of antigen-specific CXCR4<sup>cKO</sup> PCs was due to cell death in the BM, or egress from the BM niche, eventually leading to PC loss. Chimeric mice were intra-tibially (IT) injected with 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OH-TAM), to induce cre recombination in PC subsets in one bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We used this approach previously to track recirculation of BM PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benet et al., 2021</xref>). At day 1 post injection, WT PCs within the injected tibia were the predominant location of labeled PCs, consistent with a local administration and activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). However, within CXCR4<sup>cKO</sup> PC pool, most of the labeled PCs were predominantly found in the spleen, but also found at higher frequencies in other bones. This subset-specific effect is unlikely due to leakage of 4-OH-TAM to other tissues, as it would have affected both groups of PCs equally. Thus, the likely conclusion is that CXCR4<sup>cKO</sup> must have rapidly egressed the BM upon cre-deletion of <italic>Cxcr4</italic>. Over time labeled WT PCs egressed the tibia and redistributed to other sites whereas the labeled CXCR4<sup>cKO</sup> PC remained fixed in spleen and other niches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). To confirm this effect was due to rapid egress, mice were pretreated with pertussis toxin (PTX), which we had found could block PC motility in the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benet et al., 2021</xref>). Pretreatment with PTX prevented CXCR4<sup>cKO</sup> PCs from accumulating in the spleen, following IT administration of 4-OH-TAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, deletion of <italic>Cxcr4</italic> triggers rapid mobilization of PCs from the BM, suggesting dislodging PCs from their niche occurs prior to defects in cell survival.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>CXCR4 retains plasma cells (PCs) in the bone marrow (BM).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental setup for intratibial injection into WT:CXCR4<sup>cKO</sup> mixed BM chimera in the presence or absence of pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment.

Based on previous studies of PC transcriptome studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2018</xref>), we expected mRNA expression differences in LLPCs to be minor, and due to the over-representation of immunoglobulins in the transcriptome, we performed bulk RNA-seq with deep reads (50 million reads per sample) to improve our resolution of global changes. For these studies, we FACS-purified matching populations of YFP<sup>+</sup> LLPCs and YFP<sup>-</sup> bulk PCs from BM and spleen of BEC-YFP mice, on day 90 post tamoxifen treatment. We used groups from both young and middle-aged mice for these studies to see what effect mouse age played in gene expression or PC composition. As negative controls, we also sorted YFP<sup>+</sup> and YFP<sup>-</sup> PCs from middle-aged mice, on day 5 post treatment. In all, we analyzed 12 groups of PCs (n=3/4 per group, 44 samples total).

Based on the sample dendrogram, we found that most LLPC (yellow) and bulk PC (red) samples clustered separately, and within the LLPCs, BM (light green) and splenic (dark green) samples were closely related (column headings on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Specifically, groups 5 and 2 genes contained DEGs that were either upregulated or downregulated in all LLPC groups, respectively. Group 1 genes were specifically upregulated in splenic LLPCs, suggesting tissue-specific expression patterns. To better understand the overlaps or similarities of these LLPC groups, we generated an UpSet analysis plot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conway et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lex et al., 2014</xref>), based on pair-wise comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Splenic LLPCs from young and middle-aged mice had the most DEGs, likely because splenic (YFP<sup>-</sup>) bulk PCs used in comparisons were highly enriched in short-lived PCs. Among DEGs shared among LLPC subsets, many were shared by three or four of groups. 12 DEGs were shared by all LLPCs (<italic>Cd55</italic>, <italic>Cxcr3</italic>, <italic>Cyp4f18</italic>, <italic>Fam3c</italic>, <italic>Gpx3</italic>, <italic>H2-Aa</italic>, <italic>H2-Ab1</italic>, <italic>Hcst</italic>, <italic>Prss57</italic>, <italic>Rab3b</italic>, <italic>Slamf6</italic>, <italic>Spag5</italic>).

As expected, PCs from day 5-treated mice showed the highest overlap of clones between YFP<sup>+</sup> and YFP<sup>-</sup> subsets in all tissues, along with bulk (YFP<sup>-</sup>) PCs in BM and spleen, consistent with their heterogenous PC phenotypes and coordinated timing for PC differentiation. LLPCs in the BM and spleen had more clonal overlap than with matched bulk PCs taken from the same sites. This trend was more striking in young mice, which have fewer LLPCs in the YFP<sup>-</sup> subset than in middle-aged mice, suggesting these LLPCs may arise from a different clonal population of B cells in young mice than in middle-aged mice.</p><p>LLPCs have been suggested to arise from germinal centers, which could suggest that residency time in the GC may regulate selection into the LLPC pool. To see if polyclonal LLPCs were more highly mutated than total bulk PCs, we compared overall somatic hypermutation (SHM) frequencies in V regions matching samples of YFP<sup>+</sup> (LLPC) and YFP<sup>-</sup> (bulk PCs) and found that day 90 LLPC clones had fewer mutations than bulk PCs in BM or spleen whereas no differences in mutations were observed between day 5 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). When averaging all clones per sample, LLPCs also had fewer SHM than paired bulk PC samples in the same tissue of the same mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). LLPCs timestamped at 6â8 weeks (young mice) had even fewer mutations than LLPCs in middle-aged mice. Overall, this confirms that PC cells need not arise from affinity-selected GC B cells in order to enter the LLPC pool.</p><p>Finally, to see if certain clones were âpublicâ (or shared by at least two samples from different mice), we analyzed heavy chain clonal overlap (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>) in all samples. Young mice had the highest overlap of shared public clones compared to other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). We analyzed which groups of PCs were responsible for this elevation and found that LLPCs in BM and spleen accounted for most of the public clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, we analyzed the top 100 most abundant public clones across all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) and found a biased enrichment toward LLPC samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).

Moreover, once LLPCs are specified, the intrinsic programming and extrinsic factors that control their longevity are still undefined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robinson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robinson et al., 2022</xref>). While the field has leaned toward a model that LLPCs arise from late GC B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Weisel et al., 2016</xref>), LLPCs can be generated by T-independent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bortnick et al., 2012</xref>) as well. Recent work using similar PC timestamping tools have demonstrated that NP-specific LLPCs can arise from pre-GC stages and accumulate at constant click during the immune response, showing no bias toward late stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robinson et al., 2022</xref>) nor requiring high affinity for longevity, at least in the NP immunization model. In ânaÃ¯veâ mice, which are not biased by immunization, we find clones selected into LLPCs pool bear fewer somatic mutations than bulk PCs, consistent with recent scRNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2022</xref>), and aforementioned findings that LLPC generation is not strictly dependent on late GC B cells following immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robinson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koike et al., 2023</xref>). We also find limited diversity in BCR repertoire, which may reflect unique clones or antigens are pre-programmed for LLPC or, merely that longer immune responses engender more clonal LLPC over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robinson et al., 2022</xref>). We also find LLPCs are enriched in public or shared clones, which have been recently shown to be microbial and self-reactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanc et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Racine et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, while some of our public clone lists have shared V regions with known self-reactive and microbial specificities, many are not found on any of these lists, suggesting variations in microbiome composition or diet may shift the LLPC clonal composition.</p><p>Within the BM, we found that IgA<sup>+</sup> LLPCs are the major subset, similar to the bulk BM PC composition, in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2022</xref>), and likely depend on microbial composition in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilmore et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, the majority of splenic LLPCs are a mix of IgM<sup>+</sup> and IgA<sup>+</sup> LLPCs, and particularly in young mice, IgM<sup>+</sup> LLPCs seem to be specified early and selectively retained in the splenic niche. While IgM<sup>+</sup> LLPCs can be generated by various pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanc et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Racine et al., 2011</xref>), and even persist in germ-free mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lino et al., 2018</xref>), this early wave of IgM<sup>+</sup> LLPCs is consistent with B-1-derived precursors that maintain natural antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumgarth, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumgarth, 2011</xref>). Indeed, LLPCs timestamped in young mice had more public clones, less diversity, and limited SHM. LLPC clones are shared across the BM and splenic compartment, suggesting these niches can be redundant and may accommodate LLPC recirculation between sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benet et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We find unique transcriptome and proteome expressed by endogenous LLPCs that underlie their intrinsic longevity. On the RNA level, these changes are modest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2018</xref>), and often below detection limits for standard fold change cut-offs, which may reflect LLPC heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). However, these small changes can reflect larger changes in protein levels, as we see for CXCR4, suggesting that proteomics may be a more appropriate way to study changes in PC to LLPC maturation changes. Among the GO terms and DEGs found, most are shared by LLPCs in the BM or spleen suggesting similar requirements for survival in both sites. One notable exception was cluster 1 of DEGs among splenic LLPCs, which were associated with IgM-specific factors such as complement receptors, consistent with recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bohannon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Higgins et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>A major goal here was to address how LLPCs maintain their survival. Mechanistically, is their lifetime intrinsically regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robinson et al., 2022</xref>) or by competition for a limited niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radbruch et al., 2006</xref>)? Our imaging data supports the later model, as LLPCs are preferentially arrested and are more enriched in PCsâ clusters. Previously, we reported that cluster formation is dependent on hematopoietic-derived APRIL, suggesting it may be enriched in these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benet et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, both LLPCs and bulk PC (containing short-lived cells) may share and compete for the same cell-extrinsic cues. However, as LLPCs do not express higher levels of APRIL receptors, changes in adhesion receptors may help LLPCs preferentially dock at these niches leading to advantages in survival over newly minted PCs. Additionally, as PCs express different levels of homing and adhesion molecules according to isotype, dynamics and positioning in the BM should vary leading to distinct decay rates.</p><p>Among these LLPC-intrinsic factors, we found CXCR4 plays a direct functional role in PC survival. Our model directly targets CXCR4 during the PC stage, in an inducible fashion, in contrast with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nie et al., 2004</xref>) that used a constitutive deletion of CXCR4 in B cell lineage and found no effect on humoral immunity. While it is tempting to simply conclude that increased CXCR4 expression by LLPCs directly leads to cell-intrinsic arrest in BM niches, we have also showed that CXCR4 promotes BM PC motility, and inhibitors quickly perturb PC motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benet et al., 2021</xref>). In vitro, LLPCs were unresponsive to CXCL12 chemotaxis (data not shown). Moreover, gain-of-function alleles of CXCR4 also lead to shortened humoral responses but more total PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biajoux et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, there may be more complexity to CXCR4 function on PCs in the BM to unravel.</p><p>With age, both the number and maturation of PCs increases within the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pioli et al., 2019</xref>), which likely affects competition. By intravital imaging, we see that overall polyclonal PC speeds increase in older mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benet et al., 2021</xref>), which is likely due to faster motility of short-lived PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koike et al., 2023</xref>) with no sites to dock. Moreover, with aging, decreases in survival factors like APRIL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pangrazzi et al., 2017</xref>) may further limit the survival of newly minted PC leading to weakened and shortened serological responses, correlating to what is seen in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wagner and Weinberger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fedele et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Prdm1-EYFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fooksman et al., 2010</xref>) (or Blimp1-YFP) BAC transgenic mice were generated previously and can also be obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (#8828). <italic>Rosa26<sup>CAG-LSL-tdTomato</sup></italic> (Ai14, #7914) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>Rosa26<sup>LSL-EYFP</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srinivas et al., 2001</xref>) (#6148), and <italic>Cxcr4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> <sup>18</sup> (#8767) C57BL/6 (CD45.2) and B6-Ly5.1/Cr (CD45.1) mice were purchased from Charles River.

Z-stack images for multiple regions of tibia were collected sequentially and stitched together either before or after long-term steady-state intravital imaging using Olympus software. All imaging was performed using an Olympus FVE-1200 upright microscope, 25Ã1.04 NA objective, and Deepsee MaiTai Ti-Sapphire pulsed laser (Spectra-Physics) tuned to 920 nm. To maintain mouse body temperature and limit room light exposure, the microscope was fitted with custom-built incubator chamber and heated 37Â°C platform.

A ratioed channel (YFP over TdTomato, ch2/ch3) was created together with background subtraction from infrared channel (ch4) to separate LLPCs from bulk PCs. A threshold of 1.02 in track intensity mean of the ratioed channel was used so that LLPC with higher TdTomato expression would exhibit lower value below the threshold whereas bulk PCs expressing lower TdTomato level would be higher value above the threshold.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Nearest neighbor analysis</title><p>LLPCs (YFP<sup>+</sup>TdTomato<sup>bright</sup>) and bulk PCs (YFP<sup>+</sup>TdTomato<sup>dim</sup>) in stitched Z-stack images were detected as described above.

In the last few years, several groups have independently generated new genetic tools or models and addressed how LLPCs are generated or maintained in homeostatic conditions or upon immunization or infection. Here, Jing et al. have also established a new PC time stamping system and tried to address the issues above. The authors have found that LLPCs accumulated in the BM PC pool, along with aging, and that LLPCs had unique sufacetome, transcriptome, and BCR clonality. These observations have already been made by other groups (Xu et al. 2020, Robinson et al. 2022, Liu et al. 2022, Koike et al. 2023, Robinson et al. 2023, plus Tellier et al., 2024), therefore it is hard to find significant conceptual advances there. In my opinion, however, genetic analysis of the role of CXCR4 on PC localization or survival in BM (Figure 4 and 5) provided new aspects which have not been addressed in previous studies. Importantly, CXCR4 was required for the maintenance of plasma cells in bone marrow survival niches, conditional loss of which led to rapid mobilization from the bone marrow, reduced plasma cell survival, and reduced antibody titer. Thus, these data suggest that CXCR4-CXCL12 axis is not only important for plasma cell recruitment to the bone marrow but also essential for their lodging on the niches. I think the study is of high quality and the findings should be widely shared in the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89712.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this study by Jing, Fooksman, and colleagues, a Blimp1-CreERT2-based genetic tracing study is employed to label plasma cells. Over the course of several months post-tamoxifen treatment, the only remaining labeled cells are long-lived plasma cells. This system provides a way to sort live long-lived plasma cells and compare them to unlabeled plasma cells, which contain a range of short-to-long-lived cells. From this analysis, several observations are made: (1) the turnover rate of plasma cells is greater in the spleen than in the bone marrow; (2) the turnover rate is highest early in life; (3) subtle transcriptional and cell surface marker differences distinguish long- from shorter-lived plasma cells; (4) long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow are sessile and localize in clusters with each other; (5) CXCR4 is required for plasma cell retention in these clusters and in the bone marrow; (6) Repertoire analysis hints that the selection of long-lived plasma cells is not random for any cell that lands in the bone marrow.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The genetic timestamping approach is a clever and functional way to separate plasma cells of differing longevities.</p><p>(2) This approach led to the identification of several markers that could help prospective separation of long-lived plasma cells from others.</p><p>(3) Functional labeling of long-lived plasma cells allowed for a higher resolution analysis of transcriptomes and motility than was previously possible.</p><p>(4) The genetic system allowed for a revisitation of the importance of CXCR4 in plasma cell retention and survival.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Most of the labeling studies, likely for practical reasons, were done on polyclonal rather than antigen-specific plasma cells. The triggers of these responses could vary based on age at the time of exposure, anatomical sites, etc. How these differences might influence markers and transcriptomes, independently of longevity, is not completely known.</p><p>(2) The fraction of long-lived plasma cells in the unlabeled fraction varies with age, potentially diluting differences between long- and short-lived plasma cells.</p><p>(3) The authors suggest their data favors a model by which plasma cells compete for niche space. Yet there is no evidence presented here that these niches are limiting. While a finite number of plasma cells may occupy a single niche (Figure 2), it may be that these niches overall are abundant in the bone marrow and do not restrict LLPC numbers. Robinson...Tarlinton and colleagues (Immunity, 2023) in fact provide experimental evidence against an extrinsic limit.</p><p>(4) The functional importance of the observed transcriptome differences between long- and shorter-lived plasma cells is unknown. An assessment as to whether these differences are conserved in human long- and short-lived bone marrow plasma cells might provide circumstantial supporting evidence that these changes are important for longevity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>Despite the importance of long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs), particularly in the vaccination field, their natures are still unclear. In this valuable manuscript, as a first step towards clarifying these natures, the authors used a solid genetic approach (time-stamping one) and successfully labelled only functional LLPCs. Although four groups have already published data by the same genetic approach, the authors' manuscript includes additional significant findings in the LLPC field.</p><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The mechanisms underlying the generation and maintenance of LLPCs have been one of the unresolved issues. Recently, four groups have independently generated new genetic tools that allow fate tracing of murine plasma cells and have addressed how LLPCs are generated or maintained in homeostatic conditions or upon antigen immunization or viral infection. Here, Jing et al. have established another, but essentially the same, PC time stamping system, and tried to address the issues above. The question is whether the findings reported here provide significant conceptual advances from what has already been published.</p><p>(1) Some of the observations in this manuscript have already been made by other studies (Xu et al. 2020, Robinson et al. 2022, Liu et al. 2022, Koike et al. 2023, Robinson et al. 2023). In my opinion, however, genetic analysis of the role of CXCR4 on PC localization or survival in BM (Figure 5) was well performed and provided some new aspects which have not been addressed in previous reports. The motility of CXCR4 cKO plasma cells in BM is not shown, but it could further support the idea that reduced mobility or increased clustering is required for longevity.</p><p>(2) The combination of the several surface markers shown in Figure 3&amp;4 doesn't seem to be practically applicable to identify or gate on LLPCs, because differential expression of CD81, CXCR4, CD326, CD44, or CD48 on LLPCs vs bulk PCs was very modest. EpCAMhi/CXCR3-, Ly6Ahi/Tigit- (Liu et al. 2022), B220lo/MHC-IIlo (Koike et al. 2023), or SLAMF6lo/MHC-IIlo (Robinson et al. 2023) has been reported as markers for LLPC population. It is unclear that the combination of surface markers presented here is superior to published markers. In addition, it is unclear why the authors did not use their own gene expression data (Fig.6), instead of using public datasets, for picking up candidate markers.</p></disp-quote><p>In terms of the utility of these markers, we agree they are not sufficient to distinguish bona fide LLPCs but they did enrich for LLPCs by 6-fold (Figure 3). In the other studies cited, LLPCs are enriched in those gates but not exclusively found in the gates, suggesting some plasticity. In terms of how they were chosen, we conducted the flow surface studies in parallel and prior to completing the gene expression studies, thus, they were not available in time to be useful for the longitudinal studies. As this was not the major findings of the paper, we have reduced emphasis on this section, and moved some of the data to Figure S2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study by Jing, Fooksman, and colleagues, a Blimp1-CreERT2-based genetic tracing study is employed to label plasma cells. Over the course of several months post-tamoxifen treatment, the only remaining labeled cells are long-lived plasma cells. This system provides a way to sort live long-lived plasma cells and compare them to unlabeled plasma cells, which contain a range of short-to-long-lived cells. From this analysis, several observations are made: (1) the turnover rate of plasma cells is greater in the spleen than in the bone marrow; (2) the turnover rate is highest early in life; (3) subtle transcriptional and cell surface marker differences distinguish long- from shorter-lived plasma cells; (4) long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow are sessile and localize in clusters with each other; (5) CXCR4 is required for plasma cell retention in these clusters and in the bone marrow; (6) Repertoire analysis hints that the selection of long-lived plasma cells is not random for any cell that lands in the bone marrow.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The genetic timestamping approach is a clever and functional way to separate plasma cells of differing longevities.</p><p>(2) This approach led to the identification of several markers that could help prospective separation of long-lived plasma cells from others.</p><p>(3) Functional labeling of long-lived plasma cells allowed for a higher resolution analysis of transcriptomes and motility than was previously possible.</p><p>(4) The genetic system allowed for a revisitation of the importance of CXCR4 in plasma cell retention and survival.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Most of the labeling studies, likely for practical reasons, were done on polyclonal rather than antigen-specific plasma cells. The triggers of these responses could vary based on age at the time of exposure, anatomical sites, etc. How these differences might influence markers and transcriptomes, independently of longevity, is not completely known.</p><p>(2) The fraction of long-lived plasma cells in the unlabeled fraction varies with age, potentially diluting differences between long- and short-lived plasma cells.</p><p>(3) The authors suggest their data favors a model by which plasma cells compete for niche space. Yet there is no evidence presented here that these niches are limiting.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2, we provide important evidence that LLPCs are enriched in PC clusters, and are less motile, suggesting they occupy a unique niche compared to bulk PCs in the bone marrow. But we agree it does not clarify if that niche is limited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The functional importance of the observed transcriptome differences between long- and shorter-lived plasma cells is unknown. An assessment as to whether these differences are conserved in human long- and short-lived bone marrow plasma cells might provide circumstantial supporting evidence that these changes are important for longevity.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The valuable work shows some unique characteristics of long-lived PCs in comparison with bulk PCs. In particular, the authors clearly indicated the dependency of CXCR4 in PC longevity and provided a deal of resource of PC transcriptomes. Though CD93 is known as a marker for long-lived PCs, the authors can provide more data related to CD93.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Long-lived PCs are maintained with low motility and in a CXCR4-dependent manner.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The reporter mice for fate-mapping can clearly distinguish long-lived PCs from total PCs and greatly contribute to the identification of long-lived PCs.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors are unable to find a unique marker for long-lived PCs</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Given the author's expertise, I suggest investigating the motility of CXCR4 cKO plasma cells in BM.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. This work would certainly fit in with the theme of the paper. We tried to measure this using the BEC Rosa-LSL-YFP Cxcr4f/f system after tamoxifen treatment but unfortunately, these PCs leave the BM concurrently as they turn on YFP expression from the Rosa26 locus, making it impossible to capture the change in motility. This is also evident in our data in updated Figure 5 which shows that intratibial injection of 4HO-Tamoxifen causes rapid mobilization of CXCR4KO PCs from the tibia within 1 day. We tried to breed other models that would allow us to visualize these early events, which were unsuccessful, and also responsible for the long delay in resubmission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Expression of CD81, CXCR4, CD326, CD44, or CD48 was not different enough to distinguish LLPCs from bulk PCs (Figure 3B). The caveat is that bulk PCs also contained a significant frequency of LLPCs, which would make the difference in expression levels smaller. I suggest looking at the expression of these molecules on newly generated PCs, soon after protein immunization, for example.</p></disp-quote><p>This would be a separate issue, when they begin to express the LLPC phenotype, and definitely worthwhile in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Related to the above public comment #4, I would recommend looking at Halliley et al., Immunity, 2015 to see if some of the same LLPC transcriptional and marker differences can be observed between CD19+ and CD19- plasma cells in the human marrow.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion to do a human correlation. It is unclear what conclusions we can draw from overlapping or non-overlapping patterns, on their own.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) For CD93, since it is bimodal, it may be better to express this as % positive rather than fold changes in MFI as in Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated Figure 3C to include %positive as suggested. Fold changes were moved to Figure S2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The valuable work shows some unique characteristics of long-lived PCs in comparison with bulk PCs. In particular, the authors clearly indicated the dependency of CXCR4 in PC longevity and provided a deal of resources of PC transcriptomes. Though CD93 is known as a marker for long-lived PCs, the authors can provide more data related to CD93.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>The authors show data that some bulk PCs express CD93 lower. Are CD93low bulk PCs are higher motile in the BM compared to CD93high? Are CD93low highly mutated in the Ig gene? Do CD93high bulk PCs have similar transcriptome to long-lived PCs on some representative genes?</p></disp-quote><p>Although we do not have data here, the difference between CD93high cells and CD93low cells are likely to be small since labeled PCs were observed to express higher CD93 surface level as early as day 5 in BM and SP shown in updated Figure 3C. Thus, while CD93 is strongly enriched in LLPCs, it cannot be used as a single marker to sufficiently isolate LLPCs, which would make it very difficult to detect changes in motility, mutation of Ig gene, and gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>(1) In the title, the authors describe that surface receptor expression support PC-intrinsic longevity. The surface receptor is only CXCR4. The ambiguous description confuses the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>While CXCR4 was shown functionally to be involved, we found multiple surface receptors are differentially expressed in LLPCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The abbreviations of 'bone marrow' and 'BM' should be unified.</p><p>(3) In Fig. 7C, the bars for comparison are unclear. What dots are compared?</p></disp-quote><p>Bars are comparing day 90 middle aged to day 5 controls, as there were only n=2 for some day 90 young mice samples for all internally pared comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The explanation about Fig.7I can't be understood. How are conclusions occurred from the panel?</p></disp-quote><p>Fig. 7I shows that of the most common public clones found (found in the most samples or mice), across all LLPC and Bulk 42 total samples, most of the hits came from LLPC samples (all colored) whereas few were from bulk PC samples (white bars), suggesting the shared repertoire is uniquely LLPC-like. These were observations drawn, but no statistical analysis was conducted here.</p></body></sub-article></article>
