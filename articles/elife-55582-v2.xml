(CB<sub>2</sub>) agonists are potential analgesics void of psychotropic effects. Peripheral immune cells, neurons and glia express CB<sub>2</sub>; however, the involvement of CB<sub>2</sub> from these cells in neuropathic pain remains unresolved. We explored spontaneous neuropathic pain through on-demand self-administration of the selective CB<sub>2</sub> agonist JWH133 in wild-type and knockout mice lacking CB<sub>2</sub> in neurons, monocytes or constitutively. Operant self-administration reflected drug-taking to alleviate spontaneous pain, nociceptive and affective manifestations. While constitutive deletion of CB<sub>2</sub> disrupted JWH133-taking behavior, this behavior was not modified in monocyte-specific CB<sub>2</sub> knockouts and was increased in mice defective in neuronal CB<sub>2</sub> knockouts suggestive of increased spontaneous pain. Interestingly, CB<sub>2</sub>-positive lymphocytes infiltrated the injured nerve and possible CB<sub>2</sub>transfer from immune cells to neurons was found. Lymphocyte CB<sub>2</sub>depletion also exacerbated JWH133 self-administration and inhibited antinociception. This work identifies a simultaneous activity of neuronal and lymphoid CB<sub>2</sub>that protects against spontaneous and evoked neuropathic pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuropathic pain</kwd><kwd>cannabinoid cb2 receptor</kwd><kwd>operant drug self-administration</kwd><kwd>spontaneous pain</kwd><kwd>neuroimmune interactions</kwd><kwd>neuronal and lymphocyte cannabinoid receptors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-602891-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maldonado</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004587</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RTA, RD16/0017/0020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maldonado</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2017-84060-R-AEI/FEDER-UE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maldonado</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002809</institution-id><institution>Generalitat de Catalunya</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SGR2017-669, ICREA Academia Award 2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maldonado</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002809</institution-id><institution>Generalitat de Catalunya</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018 FI_B 00207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramírez-López</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Polish Ministry of Science and Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3070/7.PR/2014/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Przewlocki</surname><given-names>Ryszard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Universidad Miguel Hernandez</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UMH-PAR2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferrer-Montiel</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RTI2018-097189-B-C21</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferrer-Montiel</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Operant drug self-administration in a mouse model of neuropathic pain reveals pain-relieving effects of a cannabinoid CB<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist that are mediated through CB<sub>2</sub> receptors of neurons and lymphocytes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cannabinoid CB<sub>2</sub> receptor (CB<sub>2</sub>) agonists show efficacy in animal models of chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain, suggesting that they may be effective inhibitors of persistent pain in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bie et al., 2018</xref>;

However, many preclinical studies assess reflexive-defensive reactions to evoked nociceptive stimuli and fail to take into account spontaneous pain, one of the most prevalent symptoms of chronic pain conditions in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Backonja and Stacey, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mogil et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rice et al., 2018</xref>) that triggers coping responses such as analgesic consumption. As a consequence, conclusions drawn from animal models relying on evoked nociception may not translate into efficient pharmacotherapy in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mogil, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Percie du Sert and Rice, 2014</xref>), which underlines the need to apply more sophisticated animal models with clear translational value. Operant paradigms in which animals voluntarily self-administer analgesic compounds can provide high translatability and also identify in the same experimental approach potential addictive properties of the drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mogil, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mogil et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Connor et al., 2011</xref>). In this line, a previous work using a CB<sub>2</sub> agonist, AM1241, showed drug-taking behavior in nerve-injured rats and not in sham-operated animals, suggesting spontaneous pain relief and lack of abuse potential of CB<sub>2</sub>agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gutierrez et al., 2011</xref>), although the possible cell populations and mechanisms involved remain unknown. In addition, a recent multicenter study demonstrated off-target effects of this compound on anandamide reuptake, calcium channels and serotonin, histamine and kappa opioid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soethoudt et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>CB<sub>2</sub>, the main cannabinoid receptors in peripheral immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmöle et al., 2015a</xref>), are found in monocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes, and their expression increases in conditions of active inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmöle et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shang and Tang, 2017</xref>). The presence of CB<sub>2 </sub>in the nervous system was thought to be restricted to microglia and limited to pathological conditions or intense neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Manzanares et al., 2018</xref>). However, recent studies using electrophysiological approaches and tissue-specific genetic deletion revealed functional CB<sub>2</sub> also in neurons, where they modulate dopamine-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) and basic neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Quraishi and Paladini, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stempel et al., 2016</xref>). Remarkably, the specific contribution of immune and neuronal CB<sub>2</sub> to the development of chronic pathological pain has not yet been established.</p><p>This work investigates the participation of neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations expressing CB<sub>2</sub> in the development and control of chronic neuropathic pain. We used a pharmacogenetic strategy combining tissue-specific CB<sub>2</sub> deletion and drug self-administration to investigate spontaneous neuropathic pain. Constitutive and conditional knockouts lacking CB<sub>2</sub> in neurons or monocytes were nerve-injured, subjected to operant self-administration of the specific CB<sub>2</sub> agonist JWH133 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soethoudt et al., 2017</xref>) and were evaluated for nociceptive and anxiety-like behavior. We also explored infiltration of CB<sub>2</sub>-positive immune cells in the injured nerve of mice receiving bone marrow transplants from CB<sub>2</sub>-GFP BAC mice. Finally, immunological blockade of lymphocyte extravasation was used to investigate the effect of this cell type on spontaneous neuropathic pain and its involvement on the pain-relieving effects of the cannabinoid CB<sub>2</sub> agonist.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Self-administration of a CB<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist to alleviate spontaneous pain and anxiety-associated behavior</title><p>CB<sub>2</sub> agonists have shown efficacy reducing evoked sensitivity and responses of negative affect in mouse models of chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maldonado et al., 2016</xref>). Although antinociception is a desirable characteristic for drugs targeting chronic neuropathic pain, it is unclear whether the pain-relieving effects of the CB<sub>2</sub> agonist would be sufficient to elicit drug-taking behavior in mice and the cell populations involved. To answer these questions, mice underwent a PSNL or a sham surgery and were placed in operant chambers where they had to nose poke on an active sensor to obtain i.v. self-administration of the CB<sub>2</sub> agonist JWH133 or vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Sham mice or nerve-injured animals receiving vehicle or the low dose of JWH133 (0.15 mg/kg/inf) did not show significant differences in active nose-poking during the last 3 days of the drug self-administration period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

As expected, the operant behavior of sham-operated mice exposed to JWH133 was not different from that of sham mice exposed to vehicle, suggesting absence of reinforcing effects of the CB<sub>2</sub> agonist in mice without pain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The number of nose pokes on the inactive sensor was similar among the groups, indicating absence of locomotor effects of the surgery or the pharmacological treatments. Thus, operant JWH133 self-administration was selectively associated to the neuropathic condition.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>C57BL/6J mice self-administer a CB<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist with antinociceptive and anxiolytic-like properties.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Timeline of the drug self-administration paradigm.

Hence, CB<sub>2</sub> KO mice showed reduced drug-taking behavior accompanied by blunted inhibition of JWH133 effects on mechanical nociception and anxiety-like behavior, confirming mediation of these effects by CB<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>JWH133 has shown effects interacting with the Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin1 (TRPA1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soethoudt et al., 2017</xref>), a receptor needed for thermal pain perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vandewauw et al., 2018</xref>), that could also participate in other nociceptive responses. In order to assess a possible effect of the CB2 agonist on TRPA1 receptors in vivo, we conducted an additional experiment in which we compared the antinociceptive efficacy of JWH133 in sham and nerve-injured TRPA1 knockout mice (TRPA1 KO) and wild-type mice. After 7 days of the nerve injury, vehicle or i.p. doses of JWH133 (5 and 10 mg/kg) were administered to nerve-injured and sham-operated mice, and mechanical and heat nociception were assessed 30 and 75 min later, respectively. We observed similar effects of JWH133 inhibiting mechanical hypersensitivity in TRPA1 KO and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Interestingly, TRPA1 KO mice showed a prominent inhibition of neuropathic thermal hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In spite of this lack of sensitivity, a significant general effect was observed in nerve-injured mice with the high dose of JWH133 (10 mg/kg), regardless of the genotype of the mice. Thus, the results on mechanical sensitivity suggest that these effects are not due to an interaction of the drug with the TRPA1 receptor. The lack of thermal hypersensitivity observed in the TRPA1 KO mice may occlude possible JWH133 effects on neuropathic thermal hyperalgesia through TRPA1; however, a significant effect of JWH133 was observed in both strains after the nerve injury, suggesting that at least the CB2 receptor is involved in the inhibitory effect on thermal hyperalgesia.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Participation of neuronal and monocyte CB<sub>2</sub> receptor in neuropathic pain symptomatology</title><p>CB<sub>2</sub> receptors were initially described in peripheral immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Munro et al., 1993</xref>), although they have been found in multiple tissues including the nervous system.

To answer this question, C57BL/6J mice were repeatedly treated with a control IgG or with an antibody targeting intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), a protein required for lymphocyte extravasation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Labuz et al., 2009</xref>). Mice under treatment with anti-ICAM1 or with the control IgG were exposed to JWH133 self-administration. Instead of reducing the intake of the CB<sub>2</sub> agonist, anti-ICAM1 significantly increased active nose poking to obtain i.v. JWH133 without altering the inactive nose poking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting increased spontaneous pain. This result is in agreement with previous works showing protection against chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain mediated by lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Labuz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baddack-Werncke et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, thermal and mechanical nociception before self-administration were similar in anti-ICAM1 and control IgG-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). After self-administration, the alleviation of thermal sensitivity was similar in control IgG and anti-ICAM1-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), but mice treated with anti-ICAM1 also showed an abolition of the antinociceptive effect of JWH133 on mechanical sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This was evident in spite of the increased drug-taking behavior shown by mice treated with anti-ICAM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which reveals decreased antinociceptive efficacy of JWH133 in these mice. On the contrary, anxiety-like behavior was similar in Control IgG and anti-ICAM1 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To confirm an effect of the antibody treatment on lymphocyte infiltration, RT-PCR for white blood cell markers was performed in the dorsal root ganglia of mice subjected to the behavioral paradigm. As expected, a significant decrease in T cell markers CD2 and CD4 was observed in mice treated with anti ICAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,T</xref> cell panel). Interestingly, anti ICAM-1 also showed a pronounced increase in B cell marker CD19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and no alteration of the macrophage marker C1q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Hence, our results reveal that lymphoid cells are involved in spontaneous neuropathic pain and are also necessary for the antinociceptive effect of JWH133 on mechanical sensitivity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Lymphocytes modulate the effects of JWH133 on spontaneous pain and mechanical nociception.</title><p>C57BL/6J mice were food-trained in Skinner boxes (Food training, 5 days), subjected to partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL, day 0), catheterized and exposed to high doses of the CB<sub>2</sub> agonist JWH133 (0.3 mg/kg/inf., days 7 to 18).

Previous works already demonstrated antinociceptive and emotional-like effects of CB<sub>2</sub> agonists in rodent models of acute and chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gutierrez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ibrahim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jafari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">La Porta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maldonado et al., 2016</xref>). Our results provide evidence that the effect of the CB<sub>2</sub> agonist is sufficient to promote drug-taking behavior in nerve-injured mice for alleviation of spontaneous pain, but it is void of reinforcing effects in animals without pain, suggesting the absence of abuse liability. This absence of reinforcement adds value to the modulation of pain through CB<sub>2</sub> agonists, since current available agents for neuropathic pain treatment have reduced efficacy and often show addictive properties in humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attal and Bouhassira, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonnet and Scherbaum, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Finnerup et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hipólito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Connor et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A previous work using the CB<sub>2</sub> agonist AM1241 showed drug-taking behavior and antinociception in nerve-injured rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gutierrez et al., 2011</xref>), although a recent multicenter study demonstrated off-target effects of this drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soethoudt et al., 2017</xref>). The disruption of JWH133 effects observed in constitutive knockout mice confirms that the relief of spontaneous pain and the effects reducing mechanical nociception and anxiety-like behavior are mediated by CB<sub>2</sub> stimulation. However, the CB<sub>2</sub> agonist partially preserved its effects promoting drug self-administration and relieving thermal hypersensitivity in CB2KO mice, suggesting that JWH133 may also act through other receptors. Our results with the nerve-injured TRPA1 knockout mice revealed that JWH133 preserves its efficacy inducing antinociception in the absence of this receptor. Therefore, TRPA1 does not seem to play a relevant role in the antinociceptive response induced by JWH133 in our model of neuropathic pain mice. Interestingly, TRPA1 deletion prevented the development of thermal hyperalgesia after the nerve injury in our study and formalin (0.5%) evoked nocifensive behaviors are also lost in the TRPA1 knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McNamara et al., 2007</xref>). Another possibility is a minor involvement of CB<sub>1</sub> receptor in JWH133 self-administration after the nerve injury, since this compound is a selective CB<sub>2</sub> agonist that exhibited 40-fold higher affinity for mouse CB<sub>2</sub> than for CB<sub>1</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soethoudt et al., 2017</xref>). Our experiments were not designed to rule out this possible minor participation. However, the inactive responding in the operant self-administration sessions was similar after JWH133 or vehicle in nerve-injured mice, indicating an absence of primary CB<sub>1</sub>-related side effects such as motor alteration that are classical effects observed in mice after the administration of CB<sub>1</sub> agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodríguez de Fonseca et al., 1998</xref>). Previous works using higher equivalent doses of a CB<sub>2</sub> agonist with similar potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soethoudt et al., 2017</xref>) showed also absence of motor impairment in nerve-injured rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gutierrez et al., 2011</xref>). Since JWH133 selectivity for human CB<sub>2</sub> vs. human CB<sub>1</sub> is higher (153-fold selectivity), we do not foresee any concern with CB1-related behavioral effects using similar molecules in humans.</p><p>Nerve-injured mice defective in neuronal CB<sub>2</sub> showed higher JWH133 intake than wild-type littermates, indicating persistence of drug effects and increased spontaneous pain when neurons do not express CB<sub>2</sub>. Thus, increased self-administration suggests an enhanced affective-motivational component of pain and not reduced drug efficacy on this aspect, since nerve-injured C57BL6/J mice exposed to the low JWH133 dose did not show compensatory increased self–administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Importantly, mechanical and thermal neuropathic hypersensitivity before drug self-administration were similar in neuronal knockouts and their wild-type littermates, which suggests different mechanisms of spontaneous pain and evoked nociception. In addition, mechanical nociception measured after JWH133 was more severe in neuronal CB<sub>2</sub> knockouts than in wild-type littermates, which indicates decreased JWH133 efficacy on mechanical antinociception. Several studies described the presence of CB<sub>2</sub> mRNA and functional CB<sub>2</sub> receptor in neuronal populations from different areas of the rain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stempel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). However, other works using targeted expression of fluorescent proteins under the control of the mouse gene <italic>Cnr2</italic> failed to describe CB<sub>2</sub> expression in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">López et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmöle et al., 2015a</xref>). Our results agree with a role of neuronal CB<sub>2</sub> during painful neuroinflammatory conditions, a setting that was not studied before in mice defective in neuronal CB<sub>2</sub>. Although we cannot provide a precise localization of the neurons involved in the increased spontaneous and evoked pain of neuronal knockout mice, the similar JWH133 response of CB<sub>2</sub> Nav1.8 Cre+ mice lacking CB<sub>2</sub> in primary afferent neurons (Nav1.8-Cre+) and wild-type mice could indicate involvement of a different set of neurons or increased relevance of CB<sub>2</sub> from immune sources. Thermal hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behavior measured after self-administration was similar in neuronal knockouts and wild-type mice, which indicates involvement of non-neuronal cell populations. However, it should also be considered that the neuronal knockout mice had higher JWH133 consumption. Thus, a possible lack of efficacy could also be present for thermal antinociception and inhibition of anxiety-like behavior. Although a neuronal involvement was found, CB<sub>2</sub> neuronal knockouts did not recapitulate the phenotype of mice constitutively lacking CB<sub>2</sub>, suggesting additional cell types involved in the effects of CB<sub>2</sub>agonists.</p><p>We investigated the effects of JWH133 promoting its own consumption and inducing antinociception and anxiolysis in CB<sub>2</sub> LysM-Cre+ mice, mainly lacking CB<sub>2</sub> in monocytes, the precursors of microglial cells. We did not observe a microglial participation in these pain-related phenotypes, which may be due to an incomplete deletion of CB<sub>2</sub> in microglia through LysM-driven Cre expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blank and Prinz, 2016</xref>). Previous studies in mice constitutively lacking CB<sub>2</sub> described an exacerbated spinal cord microgliosis after nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nozaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Racz et al., 2008</xref>), which suggested a relevant role of CB<sub>2</sub> controlling glial reactivity. Since spinal microgliosis participates in the increased pain sensitivity after a neuropathic insult and macrophages and microglia express CB<sub>2</sub>, blunted effects of JWH133 were expected in microglial CB<sub>2</sub> knockouts. However, monocyte-derived cells did not seem to be involved in the analgesic effects mediated by the exogenous activation of CB<sub>2</sub> in these experimental conditions.</p><p>The immunohistochemical analysis of dorsal root ganglia from mice transplanted with bone marrow cells of CB<sub>2</sub>GFP BAC mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmöle et al., 2015a</xref>) revealed a pronounced infiltration of immune cells expressing CB<sub>2</sub> in the dorsal root ganglia after nerve injury. Macrophages and lymphocytes expressing CB<sub>2</sub> were found at a time point in which nerve-injured mice present mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity and self-administer compounds with demonstrated analgesic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bura et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, GFP expression was also found in neurons, suggesting a transfer of CB<sub>2</sub> from peripheral immune cells to neurons. An explanation for this finding may come from processes of cellular fusion or transfer of cargo between peripheral blood cells and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez-Dolado et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ridder et al., 2014</xref>). Bone-marrow-derived cells fuse with different cell types in a process of cellular repair that increases after tissue damage. These events may be particularly important for the survival of neurons with complex structures that would otherwise be impossible to replace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giordano-Santini et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, extracellular vesicles drive intercellular transport between immune cells and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Budnik et al., 2016</xref>). Earlier studies showed incidence of fusion events between bone-marrow-derived cells and peripheral neurons in a model of diabetic neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Terashima et al., 2005</xref>), and similar processes were observed in central neurons after peripheral inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giordano-Santini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ridder et al., 2014</xref>). Functional contribution of these mechanisms to neuronal CB<sub>2</sub> expression has not yet been explored, although cargo transfer between immune cells and neurons could modify neuronal functionality and it could offer novel therapeutic approaches to modulate neuronal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Budnik et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, CB<sub>2</sub> coming from white blood cells and present in neurons could be significant modulators of spontaneous neuropathic pain and may be contributors to the analgesic effect of CB<sub>2</sub> agonists.</p><p>Our results suggest participation of lymphoid cells on spontaneous neuropathic pain, but not on basal neuropathic hypersensitivity, highlighting possible differences on the pathophysiology of these nociceptive manifestations. In addition, lymphoid cells were essential for the effects of JWH133 alleviating mechanical sensitivity after a nerve injury. These hypotheses were evaluated by using anti-ICAM1 antibodies that impair lymphocyte extravasation. Previous studies revealed that anti-ICAM1 treatment inhibited opioid-induced antinociception in a model of neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Celik et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Labuz et al., 2009</xref>). According to the authors, stimulation of opioid receptors from the immune cells infiltrating the injured nerve evoked the release of opioid peptides that attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity. Lymphocyte CB<sub>2</sub> could also be involved in the release of leukocyte-derived pain-modulating molecules. Experiments assessing the function of ICAM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Celik et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deane et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Labuz et al., 2009</xref>) showed the participation of this protein on lymphocyte extravasation. In agreement, we observed a decrease of T cell markers in the dorsal root ganglia of mice receiving anti-ICAM1. Anti-ICAM1 treatment also increased the mRNA levels of the B cell marker CD19 in the dorsal root ganglia. Since ICAM1-interacting T cells show activity limiting B cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deane et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>), it is likely that the absence of T cells in the nervous tissue increased infiltration of B lymphocytes. B cells are involved in the severity of neuroinflammatory processes and have been linked to pain hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, CB<sub>2</sub> receptors restrict glucose and energy supply of B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2017</xref>), which may alter their cytokine production as previously described for macrophages and T cells. However, the participation of CB<sub>2</sub> from B cells on neuropathic pain has not yet been established. Our results indicate an increase in JWH133 consumption that could be driven by an increased infiltration of B cells. Overall, the results with the ICAM-1 experiment suggest a relevant participation of lymphoid CB<sub>2</sub> on painful neuroinflammatory responses. Our data also underscore the interest of investigating the role of lymphoid cells in brain regions involved in pain, anxiety or negative reinforcement during chronic neuroinflammatory processes.</p><p>While we identify CB<sub>2</sub>-expressing neurons and lymphocytes as cellular entities involved in spontaneous and evoked neuropathic pain, the efficacy of the CB<sub>2</sub> agonist eliciting its own self-administration to alleviate pain was only disrupted in constitutive CB<sub>2</sub> knockout mice. These results indicate that the cell types involved in the negative reinforcement induced by JWH133 were suboptimally targeted in our experimental conditions, probably because different cell types expressing CB<sub>2</sub> are involved in this phenotype. Vascular cells may represent alternative participants of this behavior since JWH133 showed local vasodilatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McDougall et al., 2008</xref>) and endothelial functional CB<sub>2</sub> receptor was found in cerebral microvasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramirez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Onaivi et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the contribution of neurons and lymphocytes to the effects of CB<sub>2</sub> agonists on spontaneous and evoked pain suggests a coordinated response of both cell types after the nerve injury. CB<sub>2</sub>-expressing lymphocytes could participate in pain sensitization through release of pain-related molecules and the observed responses are also compatible with transfer of CB<sub>2</sub> between immune cells and neurons. Hence, bone-marrow-derived cells may provide a source of functional CB<sub>2</sub> that was not considered before and could clarify the controversial presence of these receptors in neurons. Nociceptive and affective manifestations of chronic neuropathic pain are therefore orchestrated through neuronal and immune sites expressing CB<sub>2</sub>, highlighting the functional relevance of this cannabinoid receptor in different cell populations.</p><p>Our results on operant JWH133 self-administration depict CB<sub>2</sub> agonists as candidate analgesics for neuropathic conditions, void of reinforcing effects in the absence of pain. These pain-relieving effects involve the participation of CB<sub>2</sub> from neurons and lymphocytes preventing the neuroinflammatory processes leading to neuropathic pain. Therefore, CB<sub>2</sub> agonists would be of interest for preventing neuropathic pain development and the potential trials to evaluate this effect should consider starting CB<sub>2</sub> agonist treatment before or shortly after the induction of neuropathic insults, as in our study, in contrast to the treatment strategies used in previous clinical trials. The identification of a cannabinoid agonist simultaneously targeting the behavioral traits and the multiple cell types involved in the pathophysiology of chronic neuropathic pain acquires special relevance in a moment in which the absence of efficient analgesics void of abuse liability has become a major burden for public health.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, male)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>Charles Rivers, France</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>CB<sub>2</sub> KO</td><td>Institute of Molecular Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Germany</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:2663848">MGI:2663848</ext-link></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buckley et al., 2000</xref> PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10822068">10822068</ext-link> (male)</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>SynCre+-Cnr2<sup>fl/fl</sup>:: Cnr2<sup>fl/fl</sup></td><td>Institute of Molecular Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Germany</td><td/><td>(C57BL/6J background, male)</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>LysMCre+-Cnr2<sup>fl/fl</sup>:: Cnr2<sup>fl/fl</sup></td><td>Institute of Molecular Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Germany</td><td/><td>(C57BL/6J background, male)</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Nav1.8Cre+-Cnr2<sup>fl/fl</sup>:: Cnr2<sup>fl/fl</sup></td><td>Institute of Molecular Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Germany</td><td/><td>(C57BL/6J background, male)</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>TRPA1 KO</td><td>Universidad Miguel Hernández, Spain</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3625358">MGI:3625358</ext-link></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kwan et al., 2006</xref>.

A fixed ratio 1 schedule of reinforcement (FR1) was used, that is 1 nose-poke on the active hole resulted in the delivery of 1 reinforcer together with a light-stimulus for 2 s (associated cue). Nose poking on the inactive hole had no consequence. Each session started with a priming delivery of 1 reinforcer and a timeout period of 10 s right after, where no cues and no reward were provided following active nose-pokes. Food sessions lasted 1 hr or until mice nose-poked 100 times on the active hole, whichever happened first. After the food training, mice underwent a partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL) or a sham surgery, and 4 days later an i.v. catheter was implanted in the right jugular vein to allow drug delivery. Mice started the drug self-administration sessions 7 days after the PSNL/sham surgery. In these sessions, the food reinforcer was substituted by drug/vehicle infusions.

Ipsilateral and contralateral hind paw withdrawal thresholds were evaluated the day before, 3 and 6 days after the nerve injury, as well as after the last self-medication session on day 18. Heat sensitivity was assessed by recording the hind paw withdrawal latency in response to radiant heat applied with the plantar test apparatus (Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hargreaves et al., 1988</xref>). Punctate mechanical sensitivity was quantified by measuring the withdrawal response to von Frey filament stimulation through the up–down paradigm, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chaplan et al., 1994</xref>).

The filaments were bent and held for 4–5 s against the plantar surface of the hind paws. Clear paw withdrawal, shaking or licking was considered a nociceptive-like response. Four additional filaments were applied since the first change of response (from negative to positive or from positive to negative), once each time.

Areas Under the Curve (AUCs) of time-courses for operant responding were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Active and inactive responses were analyzed taking into account surgery and dose effects in the dose-response experiments, and active/inactive and genotype or antibody treatment in the knockout and antibody experiments. Anxiety-like behavior was analyzed using two-way ANOVA (surgery and dose for dose-response experiments), one-way ANOVA (genotype of conditional knockouts) or t-tests (constitutive knockout and antibody treatment), followed by Bonferroni adjustments when required. Mechanical and thermal thresholds in Nav1.8 and TRPA1 knockout mice treated with JWH133 were analyzed using three-way repeated measures ANOVA with surgery and genotype as between-subject factors and treatment as within-subject factor, followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test when appropriate. Immunohistochemistry of bone marrow-transplanted mice was analyzed using the Bonferroni-Dunn’s test to adjust for multiple comparisons after multiple t-tests, and qPCR results after antibody treatments were compared with t-tests. IBM SPSS 19 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) and STATISTICA 6.0 (StatSoft, USA) software were used to analyze the data, and differences were considered statistically significant when p value was below 0.05. All experimental data and statistical analyses of this study are included in the manuscript and its supplementary files. Raw data and results of statistical analyses are provided in the respective Source Data Files and their containing data sheets.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Financial support of European Commission [NeuroPain, FP7-602891-2], Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Redes temáticas de investigación cooperativa en salud – Red de trastornos adictivos [#RD12/0028/0023/FEDER], ‘Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad-MINECO’ [#SAF2014-59648-P], ‘Generalitat de Catalunya- Agència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca-AGAUR’ [#2014-SGR-1547 and #2018 FI_B 00207] and ‘AGAUR’ [Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats Academia Award 2015] to RM, Polish Ministry of Science and Education [#3070/7.PR/2014/2], RTI2018-097189-B-C21 and UMH-PAR2019.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Büchel as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Both reviewers found many positive aspects to your manuscript. However, although reviewer #1 believes that the concerns could be addressed without providing additional experimental data, reviewer 2 has identified some significant concerns that do need additional information. The specific experiments that are indicated address the underlying mechanism, including the extent to which receptor expression on sensory neurons is involved and most importantly, the contribution of TRPA1. We appreciate that the present COVID-19 pandemic will make it impossible to complete the requested studies within the normal 2 month period, which will involve new mouse crosses, we are willing to accept a revised manuscript when you are able to return to the laboratory and complete the studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting paper. While demonstration of CB<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist self-administration in rodent models of chronic pain is not in itself novel, there is a sufficient body of additional novel and exciting work in this paper to set it apart from previously published work. In particular, the mechanistic dissection using tissue-specific KO mice, coupled with the demonstration of that CB<sub>2</sub> receptor-expressing lymphocytes infiltrate peripheral neurons, and to a greater degree in nerve-injured versus sham mice. The anxiety-related results are also very interesting. The paper is well-written and the results, for the most part, are clear.</p><p>1) While there are significant novel results and important conclusions that can be and have been drawn from the work, the mechanism underlying the increased self-administration of JWH133 in PSNL mice has still not been fully elucidated. The authors have shown it is CB<sub>2</sub> receptor-dependent, but not due to CB<sub>2</sub> receptors in neurons or monocyte-derived cells. Neither does it appear to be due to CB<sub>2</sub> receptors on infiltrating lymphocytes. So the question still remains as to what mechanism or target is mediating the effect. I think the Discussion should address this limitation in more detail, and put forward some potential mechanisms.</p><p>2) Is it possible that there could be some involvement for CB<sub>1</sub> receptors? JWH133 is relatively selective for CB<sub>2</sub> over CB<sub>1</sub>, but to my knowledge it does still have some affinity for (and potential activity at) CB<sub>1</sub>. How can the authors rule out a potential involvement of CB<sub>1</sub> in the self-administration of JWH133 after PSNL.</p><p>3) Given the anxiety-related aspect (and indeed the self-administration/pain aspect), why did the authors not look at whether lymphocytes expressing CB<sub>2</sub> also infiltrate brain neurons? It would be very interesting to know if they infiltrate neurons in brain regions such as the amygdala, PFC, PAG and other regions known to be important in pain, anxiety and drug self-administration in pain models.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting paper that addresses and important and timely subject, namely identification of novel non opioid approaches to pain management. The authors direct their attention the CB<sub>2</sub> receptor. Using perhaps the best characterized, and quite selective CB<sub>2</sub> ligand, the authors implicated CB<sub>2</sub> receptors in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the spontaneous pain that occurs in a partial nerve injury model in the mouse. The studies largely used either mice in which the CB<sub>2</sub> receptor was deleted in all cells only in neurons, or selectively in monocyte derived cells.</p><p>There are many intriguing findings in the paper, however, one is left with the feeling that there are hints at mechanisms, but nothing definitive is established. And major questions, which I believe could have been addressed with more selective Cre-mediated deletion of the receptor, are never answered. Hints here and there, but nothing definitive.</p><p>The authors focus on sensory neurons and the non-neuronal cells that surround the neuronal cell bodies in the DRG. How might the neurons in the DRG, which they appear to presume must be mediating the input that drives spontaneous pain, not be relevant to acute pain processing? The previous report of Soethoudt et al., 2017, which defined the specificity of JWH133, found that this compound is without effect on acute pain even at doses up to 100mg/kg. I am not sure how to translate that dose to the iv administration in the present paper, but my assumption is that the 100mg/kg dose is at least equivalent. Granted JWH133 is not potent, but then how does it affect spontaneous pain?</p><p>The most straightforward test of the DRG neurons is to delete the CB<sub>2</sub> receptor from neurons, using one of several selective Cre lines (e.g. NaV1.8-Cre). This is particularly important as the authors highlight the apparent translocation of the CB<sub>2</sub> receptor from non-neuronal cells around the DRG to neurons. But they only used peripherin to mark the neurons, so that any change in myelinated afferents would be missed. As neurons are the only structure that can get information into the spinal cord, do the authors propose that it is this small 4% of DRG neurons that is key?</p><p>Perhaps the most glaring piece missing as to mechanism is the fact, acknowledged by the authors, that JWH133 has a significant action at TRPA1, which is expressed by sensory neurons. Most importantly, the authors found that the CB2R null only had 50% reduced nose poke for JWH133. Clearly, JWH133 must exert its effect, at least in part, on another target. In their Abstract, the authors are very careful concerning this finding, writing that &quot;&quot;While constitutive deletion of CB2r disrupted JWH133-taking behavior….&quot;. In other words JWH133 disrupted, it did not prevent or eliminate the behavior. So clearly, there is something else mediating JWH133's effects. Studying JWH133 effects in the TRPA1 mutant, and ideally in the mouse in which TRPA1 is selectively deleted from sensory neurons, is critical to understanding this drug's actions. Results from that study would add greatly to the authors study.</p><p>Also, as TRPA1 is expressed in sensory neurons, are they now proposing that TRPA1 only contributes to spontaneous pain? That is certainly not the case. In fact, a previous study did report that JWH133 blocked pain behaviors provoked by AITC, a TRPA1 agonist. A simple experiment would be to test the effect of JWH133 against 0.5% formalin evoked nocifensive behaviors. As for AITC, 0.5% formalin evoked behaviors are lost in the TRPA1 ko.</p><p>Another simple experiments that would get at mechanism is to examine the effect of JWH133 on nerve injury provoked microglial activation in the dorsal horn. If a decreased activation were demonstrated, the case would be much stronger that the drug is acting on sensory neurons.</p><p>Concerns about the immunohistochemistry: First, the images presented are not all that convincing, and particularly difficult to read given that the percentage of double labeled neurons is small. It is also very odd that the authors had to use TSA amplification. Also there is no mention of controls for antibody specificity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55582.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) While there are significant novel results and important conclusions that can be and have been drawn from the work, the mechanism underlying the increased self-administration of JWH133 in PSNL mice has still not been fully elucidated.

However, peripheral CB<sub>2</sub> do not play an important role in acute pain processing (Hanus et al., 1999; Naguib et al., 2008). Indeed, CB<sub>2</sub> agonists have poor efficacy in the absence of ongoing inflammatory conditions (Bie et al., 2018), which emphasizes the relevance of the presence of pathological conditions for the effects of JWH133. Since the mouse cannabinoid triad in the Soethoudt paper was in principle conducted in naïve mice exposed to JWH133, a general lack of efficacy could be expected even considering the high doses used. In our experiments in nerve-injured mice, 5 and 10 mg/kg i.p. produced significant mechanical antinociception above 50% MPE, and we previously observed significant effects with 1 and 5 mg/kg i.p. during chronic knee inflammation (La Porta et al., Pain, 2015). Both inflammatory and neuropathic pain conditions are different to those used by Soethoudt et al., 2017, to evaluate acute pain in naïve mice. According to the Soethoudt paper, i.v. doses of 1.6 mg/kg have a half-life of 1.1 hour. The i.v. dose used in our work is lower (0.3 mg/kg) and should induce short half-life sub-maximal responses sufficient to promote contingent and repeated operant self-administration in order to relieve non-evoked pain under these neuropathic pain conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The most straightforward test of the DRG neurons is to delete the CB<sub>2</sub> receptor from neurons, using one of several selective Cre lines (e.g. NaV1.8-Cre).

Conditional knockout mice and their wild-type littermates were subjected to the partial sciatic nerve ligation or the sham procedure and tested for mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity after administration of vehicle or JWH133 at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg. We observed similar effects of JWH133 inhibiting mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity of Nav1.8-Cre+ and Cre Negative mice. Together with the results obtained in the Syn-Cre+ mice and the bone-marrow transplantation experiments, these results suggest the involvement of CB<sub>2</sub> receptor from central locations and/or of CB<sub>2</sub> receptor translocated from non-neuronal cells. The results are included in Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><p>The line of mice used to genetically disrupt CB<sub>2</sub> receptors in Nav1.8 cells was less sensitive than other mouse lines to promote thermal hyperalgesia after sciatic nerve injury and was therefore less sensitive to the anti-hyperalgesic effect of JWH133 in the plantar test under our experimental conditions, although a significant general effect of JWH133 was revealed at the dose of 10 mg/kg in both genotypes.

In the previous version of the manuscript, we included by mistake in the Materials and methods the anti-neurofilament heavy antibody and this mistake has been now corrected. The rationale of using both anti-peripherin and anti-β-III tubulin was to mark all myelinated and non-myelinated neurons, since this anti β-III tubulin is known to miss some percentage of unmyelinated neurons and peripherin only labels unmyelinated ones.
