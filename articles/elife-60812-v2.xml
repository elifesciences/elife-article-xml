We examined neural circuits underlying partially reinforced fear (PRF), whereby mice received tone-shock pairings on half of conditioning trials. Tone-elicited freezing was lower after PRF conditioning than fully reinforced fear (FRF) conditioning, despite an equivalent number of tone-shock pairings. PRF preferentially activated medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Chemogenetic inhibition of BNST-projecting mPFC neurons increased PRF, not FRF, freezing. Multiplexing chemogenetics with in vivo neuronal recordings showed elevated infralimbic cortex (IL) neuronal activity during CS onset and freezing cessation; these neural correlates were abolished by chemogenetic mPFC→BNST inhibition. These data suggest that mPFC→BNST neurons limit fear to threats with a history of partial association with an aversive stimulus, with potential implications for understanding the neural basis of trauma-related disorders.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>While walking home alone late one night, you hear footsteps behind you. Your heart starts to beat faster as you wonder whether someone might be following you. Being able to identify and evade threats is essential for survival. A key part of this process is learning to recognize signals that predict potential danger: the sound of footsteps behind you, for example. But many such cues are unreliable. The person behind you might simply be heading in the same general direction as you. And if you spend too much time and energy responding to such false alarms, you may struggle to complete other essential tasks.</p><p>To be useful, responses to cues that signal potential threats must thus be proportionate to the likelihood that danger is actually present. By studying threat detection in mice, Glover et al. have identified a brain circuit that helps ensure that this is the case. Two groups of mice learned to fear a tone that predicted the delivery of a mild footshock. In one group of animals, the tone was followed by a shock on every trial (it was said to be ‘fully reinforced’). But in the other group, the tone was followed by a shock on only 50% of trials (‘partially reinforced’).</p><p>After training, both groups of mice froze whenever they heard the tone – freezing being a typical fear response in rodents. But the animals trained with the partially reinforced tone showed less freezing than their counterparts in the fully reinforced group. Moreover, freezing in response to the partially reinforced tone was accompanied by activity in a specific neural pathway connecting the frontal part of the brain to an area called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Inhibiting this pathway made mice respond to the partially reinforced tone as though it had been reinforced on every trial. This suggests that activity in this pathway helps dampen responses to unpredictable threat cues.</p><p>In people with anxiety disorders, cues that become associated with unpleasant events can trigger anxiety symptoms, even if the association is unreliable. The findings of Glover et al. suggest that reduced activity of circuits that constrain excessive responses to threats might contribute to anxiety disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>ptsd</kwd><kwd>trauma</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIAAA-IRP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holmes</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A neural circuit between the prefrontal cortex and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis is shown to limit fear to cues that only partially associate with threat.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In many cases of psychological trauma, encounters with contexts and stimuli during aversive experience(s) are interleaved with occasions when the same stimuli are experienced without consequence. Most standard rodent assays of fear (i.e., threat) memory, however, present the subject with a conditioning stimulus (CS) that on each occasion is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fanselow and Poulos, 2005</xref>). This discrepancy is pertinent to modeling traumatic memories in rodents, via back translation from human to rodent.</p><p>Theoretical accounts of associative learning predict that conditioned responses to CSs with a mixed or partial reinforcement history, which render the CS uncertain or ambiguous with regard to its expected outcome, may differ in certain respects from those that are consistently reinforced. For example, as compared to fully reinforced CSs, partially reinforced CSs can be more difficult to extinguish and produce lesser conditioned responses, due to associative strength accruing to the conditioning context or through the endowment of the CS with inhibitory (CS = no US) properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Humphreys, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fitzgerald, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rawlins et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rescorla, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tsetsenis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Miguez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Harris et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Fear behavior that arises from partial reinforcement could involve neural circuits distinct from the well-described circuits implicated in standard (i.e., fully reinforced) fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pape and Pare, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bukalo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>). Two brain regions that could be important for the acquisition and expression of partially reinforced fear (PRF) are the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC, comprising, in the rodent, the prelimbic [PL], infralimbic [IL], and anterior cingulate [ACC] cortices) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lebow and Chen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goode et al., 2019</xref>). The mPFC is engaged in experimental situations requiring integration of higher-order cues or disambiguation between conflicting cues to gate a level of response appropriate to the value of outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sharpe and Killcross, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marek et al., 2019</xref>), while the BNST has been shown to support learning when a stimulus poorly predicts threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lebow and Chen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goode et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>These structures are also anatomically connected, with a particularly dense connection between the IL and the anterior regions of the BNST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hurley et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McDonald et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vertes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Radley and Sawchenko, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Radley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glangetas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tillman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, BNST-projecting IL cells are activated by ‘unpredictable’ threat in a backward conditioning paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goode et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, stimulation of glutamatergic mPFC inputs produces synaptic depression in the BNST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glangetas et al., 2013</xref>).

As we show here, the mPFC and BNST form a discrete neural circuit, through a direct anatomical connection, that serves to limit the expression of partially reinforced fear. This observation is reminiscent of a recent study showing that IL neurons projecting to the avBNST are activated (measured by c-Fos) by a measure of unpredictable threat (backward conditioning), in which US presentation precedes the CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goode and Maren, 2017</xref>). In conjunction with the current data, there is convergent evidence supporting a key role for the mPFC→BNST circuit in mediating fear across various measures of threat uncertainty, ambiguity, and unpredictability.</p><p>The precise nature of this role remains to be fully clarified, however. One possibility is that when discrete cues are relatively poor predictors of danger, other environmental stimuli, such as context, modulate the expression of fear in a manner that recruits the mPFC to exert top-down control over the BNST. In support of this possibility, the mPFC is posited to subserve higher-order modulation of conditioned responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sharpe and Killcross, 2018</xref>); indeed, a recent study in rats found that lesions of either the PL or IL impaired one measure of such modulation known as occasion setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roughley and Killcross, 2019</xref>). Another possible explanation for the increase in PRF caused by mPFC→BNST inhibition is that CS-alone presentations during conditioning imbues the CS with inhibitory properties that are gated by mPFC→BNST neurons during retrieval.</p><p>Learned inhibition is a function attributed to the mPFC and in particular the IL. For example, pharmacological, optogenetic, and chemogenetic inhibition of the IL impairs the formation and/or retrieval of fear extinction memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Laurent and Westbrook, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bukalo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Do-Monte et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bukalo et al., 2021</xref>) and the expression of learned safety acquired through explicit CS–US unpairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sangha et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, presentation of a safety signal during inescapable stress decreases activity (c-Fos) in a lateral area of BNST encompassing avBNST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christianson et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, lesioning this area reduces inappropriate fear to a non-reinforced CS in rats with high-trait anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duvarci et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, a growing number of lesion and functional neuroimaging studies in non-human primates and humans have implicated the BNST in the processing of uncertain threat (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goode et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miles and Maren, 2019</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that inhibitory properties of the partially reinforced CS could be signaled by the IL downstream to the BNST, thereby limiting the expression of CS-induced fear to a level appropriate to its partial reinforcement history.</p><p>It is important to note in this regard that while we targeted our virus infusions to the IL and avBNST – based on prior evidence of a dense anatomical connection between these subregions – the small size and ventral location of these areas meant that viral transfection encompassed parts of the PL and adBNST. The adBNST is engaged by challenges that produce negative affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Centanni et al., 2019</xref>), undergoes plastic changes in response to chronic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conrad et al., 2011</xref>), and, of particular relevance here, is a target of dorsal raphe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marcinkiewcz et al., 2016</xref>), BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lange et al., 2017</xref>), and central amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asok et al., 2018</xref>) neurons that sustain fear responses to predictable and unpredictable threats. As such, although the adBNST is a less densely innervated by the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hurley et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McDonald et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vertes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Radley and Sawchenko, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Radley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glangetas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tillman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>), and current as well as prior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goode et al., 2019</xref>) c-Fos data do not indicate adBNST activation with uncertain threat, it would be premature to exclude a contribution of this area to PRF.</p><p>The possible contribution of BNST-targeting PL neurons to PRF also should not be discounted. Precisely dissociating the roles of PL and IL inputs to BNST in PRF will be an interesting avenue for future work. While the PL has been ascribed a role in promoting FRF via its outputs to the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pape and Pare, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dias et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bukalo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>), recent work found that optogenetically silencing PL inputs to the avBNST <italic>increased</italic> immobility and associated stress hormone responses in the rat shock-probe burying and tail suspension tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Radley et al., 2009</xref>). These effects suggest a role for PL inputs in attenuating negative affect and as such are broadly congruent and potentially explanatory of the current data, despite important differences in methodology.</p><p>In the current study, we found neuronal correlates of PRF, specifically within the IL. As in our prior studies of FRF in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fitzgerald et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fitzgerald et al., 2015</xref>), a subset of IL neurons were phasically active to CS presentation during fear retrieval. Intriguingly, we also found a subset of IL neurons that displayed phasic activity during the cessation, but not onset, of freezing during fear retrieval, echoing recordings in rats that uncovered movement-related activity in IL units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Halladay and Blair, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Halladay and Blair, 2017</xref>). Inhibition of BNST-projecting mPFC neurons during fear retrieval essentially abolished the CS- and Freeze-OFF-associated neuronal activity in IL neurons and, in parallel, increased freezing in the PRF group. The ability of mPFC→BNST inhibition to ablate these neuronal correlates could have arisen from the chemogenetic inhibition of BNST-projecting IL neurons, resulting in a loss-of-function in this pathway and a selective increase in PRF mice. Two caveats to this interpretation are that, firstly, inhibition-induced increases in freezing in FRF mice may have been masked by a performance ‘ceiling’ in the FRF control group and, secondly, hM4Di expression in our recording experiment was not restricted to BNST-projections within the IL, and also encompassed neurons in the PL.</p><p>With regard to the broader neural circuitry in which the mPFC→BNST circuit operates to mediate PRF, using trans-synaptic tracing, we found evidence of a disynaptic mPFC→BNST→PVN circuit in mice, as has been reported in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Radley and Sawchenko, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>). The PVN contains a high density of cells expressing peptide hormones implicated in stress and fear, notably corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and oxytocin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Herman and Tasker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Triana-Del Río et al., 2019</xref>). Though CRH-expressing neurons in the PVN receive input from the BNST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colmers and Bains, 2018</xref>), it is unclear whether oxytocin-producing cells do so. Interesting nonetheless, we found that mouse PVN oxytocinergic neurons strongly innervate the freezing-regulating vl/PAG, replicating earlier work in cats and naked mole rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Holstege, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rosen et al., 2008</xref>). Given the vl/PAG also receives input from a population of avBNST neurons that is, in turn, innervated by the PL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>), these tracing results suggest that in addition to directly innervating the PVN, mPFC→avBNST neurons may also have both direct and indirect (via the PVN) access to the vl/PAG. This positions the circuit to modulate multiple behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to PRF.</p><p>In summary, the current study found that B6 mice expressed lower fear to a CS that is partially, rather than fully, reinforced with footshock. Lower PRF expression was not apparent in a mouse strain (S1) deficient in fear discrimination and learned inhibition. Furthermore, c-Fos mapping revealed PRF preferentially recruited the mPFC and BNST, and neuronal tracing showed direct neuronal projections from mPFC to the BNST, with downstream connections to stress- and fear-mediating regions. Demonstrating the causal importance of the mPFC→BNST neurons, inhibiting this pathway increased PRF and abolished neuronal correlates of CS presentation and freezing cessation in the IL. Collectively, these findings provide novel insight into the neural substrates of PRF, with potential translational relevance to anxiety and trauma- and stressor-related disorders in which threats are typically ambiguous and unpredictable.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were adult male C57BL/6J (B6), 129S1/SvImJ (S1), and B6;129S-<italic>Oxt<sup>tm1.1(cre)Dolsn</sup></italic>/J (JAX strain <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/024234">024234</ext-link>) (Oxt-Cre) mice obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and were at least 8 weeks old at the time of testing.

After the final pairing for all groups, there was a 120 s no-stimulus period before the mouse was returned to the home-cage.

Tissue was stained with DAPI (Sigma–Aldrich) and imaged using a Keyence BZ-X800 fluorescence microscope (Keyence Corporation of America, Itasca, IL, USA). Mice without viral (i.e., mCherry) expression in the mPFC or correct electrode placement in the IL were removed from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Differences in freezing and c-Fos counts were analyzed using ANOVA followed by Dunn’s post hoc tests. Differences in z scored single-unit values were analyzed using paired t-tests. Differences in the percentage of recorded units responsive to the CS onset, freezing onset, and freezing cessation were analyzed using non-parametric Fisher’s exact tests. The threshold for statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05; significance values are shown up to p&lt;0.0001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are very grateful to Dr. L Ostroff, Dr. N Justice, Dr. S Maren, and Dr. TL Kash for valuable discussions.

The authors first demonstrate that partially reinforced cues support lower fear levels than fully reinforced cues, this effect is context-specific and is dependent on mouse strain. Comprehensive c-fos mapping is used to show that differential activation of the prefrontal cortex (prelimbic [PL] and infralimbic regions [IL]) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in threat uncertainty. DREADD inhibition of BNST-projecting mPFC neurons increased freezing to the partially reinforced cue. Electrophysiological examination revealed that IL neurons are preferentially activated in the PRF group at CS-ON and the number of these neurons is greatly reduced when the mPFC-BNST pathway is inactive. All reviewers agreed that the data presented in the manuscript are exciting and of great importance in that it uncovered a novel role for the mPFC-BNST pathway in threat uncertainty. The multifaceted approach is also a major strength.</p><p>Through the review process a number of essential revisions were identified. These are specified below. None of the revision require additional data collection, but some do require additional analyses.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Some conceptual issues. These can be addressed in the text.</p><p>a) The role of context as a modulator. The claim that the context modulates the PRF effect is not strong so it would be best to modify this claim. Firstly, the order of testing is not counterbalanced (mice tested in B before tested in A). Because of the order and because the difference in freezing between PRF and FRF during the baseline (i.e. context) in context B in Figure 1D does not seem to be very reliable (we don't see it in Figure 1B), it is hard to know what role the context really plays. That is, this masks potential differences in fear to A and B, which could account for the lack of PRF effect in Context A (through summation). What happens if the baseline for each mouse is subtracted from its individual CS freezing score? Is the PRF effect still lacking in context A? It is important to check this to see if the contextual effect is robust.</p><p>b) The DREADDs pathway study. The mPFC-BNST hM4Di data show that freezing in the PRF group is increased, reaching the levels of the FRF group. Could the lack of effect on FRF be due to ceiling levels? The trial by trial data may speak to this provided a decline in fear is seen across trials in at least one of the groups. Further, Figure 3H is suggestive of a difference between the FRF hM4Di and the mCherry groups. This matters because it may shed light on potential ceiling effect in the mPFC-BNST hM4Di behavioural data in the FRF groups. Further, an exciting difference would be between the mCherry groups. Was this tested?</p><p>2) Statistics.</p><p>a) Only overall ANOVAs are reported for the Fos+ analyses for each brain region, but the figures show asterisks suggestive of pairwise comparison tests. These should be reported in the text for CON, PRE and FRE for each brain area. This is also the case for the CS test in the mPFC-BNST pathway study.</p><p>b) Figure 3H is suggestive of a difference between the FRF hM4Di and the mCherry groups. Were the data analyzed together? An ANOVA seems appropriate here. Unsure why a Fisher's exact test was chosen and how it was conducted – for the 2x2 factorial or for individual cells of the table.</p><p>c) Direct comparisons between the PRF and FRF in the recording study are necessary.</p><p>d) Individual data points should be included in all the figures where possible.</p><p>3) Additional neural analyses.</p><p>a) It would be more helpful (beyond the rasters provided in Figure 3F) to see a summary heat plot of all recorded units, in all conditions, with activity aligned to cue onset/offset as well as freezing onset/offset. This will give the reader a much better idea of the patterns of activity observed in all neurons in all conditions. An example would be a heat plot like that in Figure 5C of Beyeler et al., 2018 Organization of valence-encoding and projection-defined neurons in the BLA, Cell Reports. If single-unit activity was suppressed by DREADD inhibition a heat plot would nicely illustrate this.</p><p>b) What group/condition was used for population firing in Figures 3G and 3I. Were these the PRF/mCherry neurons? Or was this all PRF neurons combined? (moot point for 3J if that is the case). This should not only be specified but the population should be plotted for all groups/conditions. This would allow the reader to see if cue responses to PRF and FRF were equivalent in the mCherry conditions – a result that is interesting no matter the outcome. This approach would provide less info for the data in 3J, because no PRF/hM4Di neurons were observed, but plotting the observed populations would still be helpful. The insets for 3G and 3I were not informative and should be removed as these neurons were selected because they were responsive.</p><p>c) Please provide waveform and firing rate properties for the neurons recorded. Did they differ between the groups? This is borne out of the between-subjects design of the recording experiments as different neuron types could have been sampled in each condition.</p><p>d) Full histology for electrode placements for all mice from which neurons were obtained should be provided. It would also be helpful to include schematics showing viral spread for all subjects (e.g., overlaid traces).</p><p>4) Materials and methods. Specific information about the number of mice and neurons recorded from in each group/condition need to be reported. Ranges are provided in the Figure 3 caption (n=17-25 units/group, from 3 mice per group/virus). But considering that the main statistics are based on the % of numbers, specific details need to be provided.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A prefrontal-bed nucleus of the stria terminalis circuit limits fear to uncertain threat&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We would like to reiterate the interest and excitement in the paper, which uncovers key brain areas and pathways that are involved in partial reinforcement in fear. While we appreciate that the authors have addressed the majority of the comments, the requests for additional analyses of the recording data were not well addressed well. The single-unit results cannot be meaningfully interpreted without additional analyses and visualizations as requested in the previous decision letter.

The authors first demonstrate that partially reinforced cues support lower fear levels than fully reinforced cues. Comprehensive c-fos mapping is used to show that differential activation of the prefrontal cortex (prelimbic [PL] and infralimbic regions [IL]) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in threat uncertainty. DREADD inhibition of BNST-projecting mPFC neurons increased freezing to the partially reinforced cue. Electrophysiological examination show that mPFC neurons activated during PRF and FRF are reduced when the mPFC-BNST pathway is inactive. This is a second revision of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>We thank the authors for addressing all of the comments in the previous decision letter which pertained primarily to the analyses of the recording data. The reviewers have looked closely at the electrophysiology data and have noted that those data are rather preliminary in nature. Specifically, there are two main problems.</p><p>1) The data appeared underpowered: n=3 CS units in PRF/mCherry, n=6 units in PRF/hM4Di, n=1 units in FRF/mCherry, n=1 units in FRF/hM4Di.</p><p>2) The recording data only partially support the hypotheses of the paper. In some instances, the proportion of neurons do not support the hypotheses. For example, neither the heat plot nor the stats support the statement “Thus, IL cells were preferentially activated to the CS after PRF”. Further, the magnitude of the firing reveal a different pattern from the proportion. The former show</p><p>a) mPFC neurons show greatest CS onset firing to FRF</p><p>b) CS onset firing to FRF is diminished by hM4Di</p><p>c) mPFC neurons show equivalent firing increases to freezing cessation</p><p>d) Freezing cessation firing to FRF appears to be diminished by hM4Di</p><p>Other example of statements that are not supported by that data include, and therefore need to be revised:</p><p>&quot;Thus, IL cells were preferentially activated to the CS after PRF and this activation was abolished by inhibition of the mPFC→BNST pathway.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thus, IL cells not only respond to presentation of the CS after PRF, but also to the ongoing behavior of the mouse and specifically during the transition from freezing to movement.

These can be addressed in the text.</p><p>a) The role of context as a modulator. The claim that the context modulates the PRF effect is not strong so it would be best to modify this claim. Firstly, the order of testing is not counterbalanced (mice tested in B before tested in A). Because of the order and because the difference in freezing between PRF and FRF during the baseline (i.e. context) in context B in Figure 1D does not seem to be very reliable (we don't see it in Figure 1B), it is hard to know what role the context really plays. That is, this masks potential differences in fear to A and B, which could account for the lack of PRF effect in Context A (through summation). What happens if the baseline for each mouse is subtracted from its individual CS freezing score? Is the PRF effect still lacking in context A? It is important to check this to see if the contextual effect is robust.</p></disp-quote><p>On reflection, we share the concerns regarding the open questions posed by these data and the experimental design used to obtain them – clearly follow up experiments are needed. Given their preliminary nature, we have removed them from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The DREADDs pathway study. The mPFC-BNST hM4Di data show that freezing in the PRF group is increased, reaching the levels of the FRF group. Could the lack of effect on FRF be due to ceiling levels? The trial by trial data may speak to this provided a decline in fear is seen across trials in at least one of the groups. Further, Figure 3H is suggestive of a difference between the FRF hM4Di and the mCherry groups. This matters because it may shed light on potential ceiling effect in the mPFC-BNST hM4Di behavioural data in the FRF groups. Further, an exciting difference would be between the mCherry groups. Was this tested?</p></disp-quote><p>We have looked at the trial by trial data for CS retrieval and there is no group difference (2x2 ANOVA P<italic>&gt;</italic>.05) that would speak to the question of a potential ceiling effect in the FRF groups, as we now state as follows: “Examination of the trial by trial freezing during retrieval indicated no significant group differences, despite a trend for decreasing freezing across trials in the mCherry PRF group (ANOVA conditioning-type effect: P&gt;.05; virus: P&gt;.05; interaction: P&gt;.05)…” The trend for an across-trial reduction in the FRF mCherry group that would be interesting to follow-up, for example with formal multi-trial extinction procedures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Statistics.</p><p>a) Only overall ANOVAs are reported for the Fos+ analyses for each brain region, but the figures show asterisks suggestive of pairwise comparison tests. These should be reported in the text for CON, PRE and FRE for each brain area. This is also the case for the CS test in the mPFC-BNST pathway study.</p></disp-quote><p>We now indicate pairwise differences (performed via Newman Keuls post hoc tests, as indicated in the Statistical analysis section), for example as follows: “Notably, however, CS-evoked freezing was lower in the PRF, relative to FRF, group (ANOVA group-effect: F(2,17)=53.02, P&lt;.01; CS: F(1,17)=216.90, P&lt;.01; interaction: F(2,17)=25.51, P&lt;.01, followed by post hoc tests: CS vs PRF P&lt;.05, CS vs FRF P&lt;.05, PRF vs FRF P&lt;.05).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Figure 3H is suggestive of a difference between the FRF hM4Di and the mCherry groups. Were the data analyzed together? An ANOVA seems appropriate here. Unsure why a Fisher's exact test was chosen and how it was conducted – for the 2x2 factorial or for individual cells of the table.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed Fisher’s exact test to compare the percentage data in Figure 3H and 3J, rather than ANOVA, because these data are categorical and nonparametric – i.e., the percentage of cells with event-related activity in each of the 4 groups (meaning there is no variability). We do, however, now report an overall Fisher’s exact when all 4 groups are considered, as follows: “This revealed a higher proportion of CS-ON units in the mCherry than hM4Di groups for PRF mice (Fisher’s exact test: <italic>P</italic>&lt;.05) but no differences for FRF mice (Fisher’s exact test: <italic>P</italic>&gt;.05)…” and “When the percentage of these cell-types were compared across groups (Fisher’s exact test: <italic>P</italic>&lt;.05), there was a higher percentage of Freeze-OFF units in the mCherry PRF group than in the hM4Di PRF group (Fisher’s exact test: <italic>P</italic>&lt;.01), whereas there was no group difference in FRF mice (Fisher’s exact test: <italic>P</italic>&gt;.05)…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Direct comparisons between the PRF and FRF in the recording study are necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We do, however, now report the Fisher’s exact comparing the PRF and FFR groups, as follows: “…and no difference between PRF and FRF groups, irrespective or virus group, despite a trend for (Fisher’s exact test in mCherry: <italic>P</italic>&gt;.05; in hM4Di: <italic>P</italic>&gt;.05) (Figure 3H)…” and “…and no difference between PRF and FRF groups in either the mCherry (Fisher’s exact test: <italic>P</italic>&gt;.05) or hM4Di (Fisher’s exact test: <italic>P</italic>&gt;.05) virus conditions (Figure 3J).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Individual data points should be included in all the figures where possible.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, individual data points are now included for the main figures, where possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Additional neural analyses.</p><p>a) It would be more helpful (beyond the rasters provided in Figure 3F) to see a summary heat plot of all recorded units, in all conditions, with activity aligned to cue onset/offset as well as freezing onset/offset. This will give the reader a much better idea of the patterns of activity observed in all neurons in all conditions. An example would be a heat plot like that in Figure 5C of Beyeler et al., 2018 Organization of valence-encoding and projection-defined neurons in the BLA, Cell Reports. If single-unit activity was suppressed by DREADD inhibition a heat plot would nicely illustrate this.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that heat maps can provide a nice visual illustration of the temporal dynamics of unit activity, especially when driven by a temporally precise artificial stimulus as in the Beyeler et al. example, but we feel that showing these for all neurons is somewhat redundant to the example raster plot (Figure 3F) and peri-event histograms we already now show for all groups (Figure 3G,I), as requested (point #4 above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) What group/condition was used for population firing in Figures 3G and 3I. Were these the PRF/mCherry neurons? Or was this all PRF neurons combined? (moot point for 3J if that is the case). This should not only be specified but the population should be plotted for all groups/conditions. This would allow the reader to see if cue responses to PRF and FRF were equivalent in the mCherry conditions – a result that is interesting no matter the outcome. This approach would provide less info for the data in 3J, because no PRF/hM4Di neurons were observed, but plotting the observed populations would still be helpful. The insets for 3G and 3I were not informative and should be removed as these neurons were selected because they were responsive.</p></disp-quote><p>The data depicted in Figures 3G and 3I were all mice (PRF and FRF, mCherry and hM4Di) combined – the purpose to show the whole recorded population to first illustrate that IL neurons signal CS onset and freezing offset, and then subsequently show how this signaling varies between groups (Figures 3H and 3J). For this reason and because there are no differences between the percentage of phasic neurons in the mCherry groups (see point #5 above), we feel retain showing all groups combined and note this in the figure and figure legends. We maintain that even though they show event-responsive cells, the insets provided valuable information because they confirm that the event related activity is statistically robust (which does not necessarily follow from simply selecting cells that are event-responsive). Nonetheless, we have removed these and now report the values in the text, as follows: “Overall, CS-ON units showed a significant change in neuronal activity in response to the CS (baseline: 0.15±0.35, post-CS: 1.43±0.55, paired t-test: t(10)=6.51, P&lt;.01) (Figure 3G).” And “These units, classified as Freeze-ON and Freeze-OFF, respectively, showed a significant change in baseline-normalized activity (Freeze-ON baseline: -0.81±0.47, post-event: -2.12±0.52, paired t-test: t(10)=4.60, P&lt;.01, Freeze-OFF baseline: 0.73±0.43, post-event: 1.67±0.40, paired t-test: t(12)=8.54, P&lt;.01) (Figure 3I).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Please provide waveform and firing rate properties for the neurons recorded. Did they differ between the groups? This is borne out of the between-subjects design of the recording experiments as different neuron types could have been sampled in each condition.</p></disp-quote><p>The firing rates were given in the original manuscript, as follows “The average firing rate units did not differ between groups (FRF mCherry: 4.10±0.64, FRF hM4Di: 3.45±0.49, FRF mCherry: 2.67±0.66, FRF hM4Di: 1.67±0.34).”</p><p>While we agree that examining waveform in an effort to parse the molecular identity of the recorded cells would be of potential interest, but we do not feel confident that our data allow us to confidently explore this question given the small fraction of cells that would be putatively identifiable interneurons; i.e., it would be unlikely that we have sufficient numbers of interneurons recorded to make any strong inferences about their patterns of activity in this task. And though we recognize it is done in some studies, we did not perform waveforms analysis to categorize neurons as principal versus interneurons because we are not confident categorizing firing rate and waveform <italic>per se</italic> provides a reliable indicator of cortical cell type and would instead want to apply the current standard for categorization – optogenetic phototagging in an, e.g., parvalbumin-positive, interneuron Cre-driver line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Full histology for electrode placements for all mice from which neurons were obtained should be provided. It would also be helpful to include schematics showing viral spread for all subjects (e.g., overlaid traces).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we now show schematics for electrode placements and viral spread.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Materials and methods. Specific information about the number of mice and neurons recorded from in each group/condition need to be reported. Ranges are provided in the Figure 3 caption (n=17-25 units/group, from 3 mice per group/virus). But considering that the main statistics are based on the % of numbers, specific details need to be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>The number of units and mice per group is now specified, as follows: “(n=17 units in PRF/mCherry, n=25 units in PRF/hM4Di, n=20 units in FRF/mCherry, n=17 units in FRF/hM4Di, from 3 mice per group/virus).”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide a summary heat plot of all recorded units, in all conditions, with activity aligned to cue onset/offset as well as freezing onset/offset. An example would be a heat plot like that in Figure 5C of Beyeler et al., 2018 Organization of valence-encoding and projection-defined neurons in the BLA, Cell Reports. This will give the reader a much better idea of the patterns of activity observed in all neurons in all conditions. If single-unit activity was suppressed by DREADD inhibition a heat plot would nicely illustrate this.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide a summary heat plot of all recorded units, in all conditions, with activity aligned to cue onset as well as freezing onset/offset in Figure 3—figure supplement 3. These provide a further visual demonstration of how DREADD inhibition suppresses CS and Freeze-OFF related activity, selectively in the PRF group – thank you for the useful suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Population line graphs must be separately plotted for all groups/conditions when it is possible. This is necessary for the reader to see if cue responses to PRF and FRF were equivalent in the mCherry conditions – a result that is interesting no matter the outcome.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, line graphs are now separately plotted for all groups/conditions in Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 7. We present these along with the original all-group averages and discuss the graphs as follows: “Peak responses occurred withing 200-300 seconds of CS onset and were highest in the mCherry FRF group (Figure 3H). However, when the percentage of CS-ON units was calculated and compared across the conditioning and virus groups (Fisher’s exact test: <italic>P</italic>&lt;.05), this revealed a higher proportion of CS-ON units in the mCherry than hM4Di groups for PRF mice (Fisher’s exact test: <italic>P</italic>=.0122), but no differences between virus groups in the FRF mice (Fisher’s exact test: <italic>P</italic>=.6090), and no difference between PRF and FRF groups, irrespective or virus group (Fisher’s exact test in mCherry: <italic>P</italic>=.2510; in hM4Di: <italic>P</italic>=1.000) (Figure 3I),” and “Freeze-ON units displayed a decreased firing rate at freezing onset, which was most evident in both of the mCherry groups, while Freeze-OFF units increased firing rate at the cessation of freezing in both groups. (Figure 3K, Figure 3—figure supplement 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) One other concern that remains is the possible ceiling levels in the DREADDs experiment. Ceiling in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 panel C and Figure 3—figure supplement 2 in panel C – Does Figure 3—figure supplement 2C show the trial data for Figure 3—figure supplement 1C? This suggests ceiling across the board for all groups except PRF mCherry. This possibility needs to be reflected in the text as the possibility that the mPFC-BNST pathway could regulate fear in both cases remains.</p></disp-quote><p>That is correct, Figure 3—figure supplement 2C shows the trial data for Figure 3—figure supplement 1C. In the text, we now refer to the figure, as follows: “Examination of the trial-by-trial freezing during retrieval indicated no significant trial-related differences in freezing, despite a trend for decreasing freezing across trials in the mCherry PRF group (ANOVA trial-effect: F(5,145)=1.83, <italic>P</italic>=.1098; group-effect: F(3,29)=14.15, <italic>P</italic>&lt;.0001; trial x group interaction: F(15,145)=1.04, <italic>P</italic>=.4213) (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).” We also now discuss the possibility of a ceiling effect, as follows: “These data show that inhibition of mPFC→BNST neurons increases freezing to a PRF CS. This finding suggests engagement of these mPFC→BNST neurons limits the expression of PRF, though it remains possible that inhibition of these neurons also produces an increase in PRF expression which may have been masked due to high (“ceiling”) levels of freezing.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please report exact p values in all instances.</p></disp-quote><p>All p values are now reported, up to a threshold of <italic>P</italic>=.0001, as stated under “Statistical analysis,” as follows: “The threshold for statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05; significance values are shown up to <italic>P</italic>&lt;.0001.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>We thank the authors for addressing all of the comments in the previous decision letter which pertained primarily to the analyses of the recording data.
