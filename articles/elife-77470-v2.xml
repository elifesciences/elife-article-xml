cortical neurons, found in spontaneous and evoked activity, that can mediate perception and behavior. To understand the mechanisms that lead to the formation of ensembles, we co-activated layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in brain slices from mouse visual cortex, in animals of both sexes, replicating in vitro an optogenetic protocol to generate ensembles in vivo. Using whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp pair recordings we found that, after optogenetic or electrical stimulation, coactivated neurons increased their correlated activity, a hallmark of ensemble formation. Coactivated neurons showed small biphasic changes in presynaptic plasticity, with an initial depression followed by a potentiation after a recovery period. Optogenetic and electrical stimulation also induced significant increases in frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSPs, even after single-cell stimulation. In addition, we observed unexpected strong and persistent increases in neuronal excitability after stimulation, with increases in membrane resistance and reductions in spike threshold. A pharmacological agent that blocks changes in membrane resistance reverted this effect. These significant increases in excitability can explain the observed biphasic synaptic plasticity. We conclude that cell-intrinsic changes in excitability are involved in the formation of neuronal ensembles. We propose an ‘iceberg’ model, by which increased neuronal excitability makes subthreshold connections suprathreshold, enhancing the effect of already existing synapses, and generating a new neuronal ensemble.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the brain, groups of neurons that are activated together – also known as neuronal ensembles – are the basic units that underpin perception and behavior. Yet, exactly how these coactive circuits are established remains under investigation.</p><p>In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb proposed that, when brains learn something new, the neurons which are activated together connect to form ensembles, and their connections become stronger each time this specific piece of knowledge is recalled. This idea that ‘neurons that fire together, wire together’ can explain how memories are acquired and recalled, by strengthening their wiring.</p><p>However, recent studies have questioned whether strengthening connections is the only mechanism by which neural ensembles can be created. Changes in the excitability of neurons (how easily they are to fire and become activated) may also play a role. In other words, ensembles could emerge because certain neurons become more excitable and fire more readily.</p><p>To solve this conundrum, Alejandre-García et al. examined both hypotheses in the same system. Neurons in slices of the mouse visual cortex were stimulated electrically or optically, via a technique that controls neural activity with light. The activity of individual neurons and their connections was then measured with electrodes.</p><p>Spontaneous activity among connected neurons increased after stimulation, indicative of the formation of neuronal ensembles. Connected neurons also showed small changes in the strength of their connections, which first decreased and then rebounded after an initial recovery period.</p><p>Intriguingly, cells also showed unexpected strong and persistent increases in neuronal excitability after stimulation, such that neurons fired more readily to the same stimulus. In other words, neurons maintained a cellular memory of having been stimulated. The authors conclude that ensembles form because connected neurons become more excitable, which in turn, may strengthen connections of the circuit at a later stage.</p><p>These results provide fresh insights about the neural circuits underpinning learning and memory. In time, the findings could also help to understand disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia, which are characterised by memory impairments and disordered thinking.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ensembles</kwd><kwd>intrinsic excitability</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>visual cortex</kwd><kwd>Hebbian plasticity</kwd><kwd>synaptic connection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY011787</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuste</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH115900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuste</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003141</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>287725</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alejandre-García</surname><given-names>Tzitzitlini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003141</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CVU365863</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pérez-Ortega</surname><given-names>Jesús</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Optogenetic and electrical stimulation of primary visual cortex neurons reveals synaptic and cell-intrinsic mechanisms that underlie neuronal ensemble formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The function of the brain is anchored on the activity of groups of connected neurons, forming microcircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schüz and Braitenberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shepherd, 2004</xref>). In such circuits, groups of coactive neurons, or ensembles (also known as assemblies, synfire chains, or attractors), found in both spontaneous and evoked activity, exhibit synchronous or correlated activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeles, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsáki, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carrillo-Reid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cossart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Morris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hopfield, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lorente De Nó, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Marshel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yuste, 2015</xref>) and could mediate memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Morris, 1999</xref>), and functional brain states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hoshiba et al., 2017</xref>). In the cerebral cortex, ensembles could arise from reverberating patterns of multineural activity, generated by recurrent connectivity, and occur spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Churchland and Sejnowski, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lorente De Nó, 1933</xref>). In mouse visual cortex, cortical ensembles are causally related to memory storage and percepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carrillo-Reid et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Marshel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miller et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, disorganized neuronal ensembles are observed in mouse models of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hamm et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A hypothesis of how a neuronal ensemble (i.e. a neuronal assembly) could be formed was initially proposed by Hebb in 1949. Ensembles could be formed by synaptic plasticity among coactive neurons, as a consequence of the Hebbian rule, whereby the “persistent and repeated activation of connected neurons induce metabolic changes or growth of processes in one or both cells that strengthen those connections”. One synaptic mechanism that fulfills Hebb’s rule is long-term potentiation (LTP), a long-lasting increase in synaptic efficacy after a high frequency burst electrical stimulation, which is postulated to be the cellular correlate of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bliss and Gardner-Medwin, 1973</xref>). With LTP, increased synaptic weights enhances preferential connectivity that leads to an increased recurrent activity within ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hoshiba et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this, synchronous stimulation of groups of neurons 50–100 times in vivo, using two-photon optogenetics, bound them together into an ‘imprinted’ ensemble that became spontaneously coactive after the optogenetic imprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carrillo-Reid et al., 2016</xref>). However, no direct evidence has yet demonstrated that the formation of ensembles depends on changes in synaptic connections.</p><p>As an alternative hypothesis, recent experiments have revealed widespread activity-dependent mechanisms in cortical neurons, suggesting that the formation and stability of an ensemble, or a memory engram, could be due to cell-autonomous intrinsic mechanisms, such as changes in neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Debanne and Poo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gallistel and Balsam, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hansel and Disterhoft, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lisman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Titley et al., 2017</xref>). This hypothesis is consistent with experiments where specific patterns of activity in the hippocampus recalls stored memories, under protein synthesis inhibitors, which should prevent LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pignatelli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tonegawa et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, individual Purkinje cells can acquire and represent temporal pattern of inputs in a cell intrinsic manner, without synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Johansson et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, ensemble formation could be due to intrinsic changes in the excitability state of the neurons, instead of, or in addition to, strengthening of its synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Disterhoft and Oh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ganguly et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pignatelli et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To explore mechanisms of ensemble formation, we optogenetic and electrically stimulated neurons in mouse neocortical slices, replicating in vitro the optogenetic protocol used to imprint ensembles in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carrillo-Reid et al., 2016</xref>). We then used whole-cell and perforated patch recordings, from individual neurons and connected pairs, to electrophysiologically characterize the stimulated neurons. We find moderate biphasic changes in synaptic strength, in the midst of major and generalized increases in cell-intrinsic excitability, that can, at least partly, explain the synaptic changes observed. We conclude that changes in excitability play a major role in ensemble formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spontaneous activity becomes correlated in simultaneously stimulated neurons</title><p>A neuronal ensemble can be defined as a group of neurons with correlated spontaneous and evoked activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsáki, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cossart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ikegaya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sasaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shepherd and Grillner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yuste, 2015</xref>).

To explore if our in vitro stimulation protocols were effective in generating ensembles, we used paired recordings to explore whether simultaneous and repeated optogenetic or electrical activation neurons also induced changes in the correlation of spontaneous activity. We recorded pairs of closely located pyramidal neurons and found that 25% of recorded pairs, at distances of 20–30 µm, were monosynaptically connected (7/28 pairs), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cossell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Holmgren et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Levy and Reyes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Markram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Also, in agreement with previous studies, we found higher values of correlation of spontaneous activity between connected neuronal pairs (0.31±0.16; n=7) than between unconnected neuronal pairs (–0.04±0.37; n=21; p=0.049 by Mann-Whitney test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cossell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>).

To explore this, we performed dual whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp recordings of connected neurons, and examined whether persistent and repeated optogenetic or electrical activation induced synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cossell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Morris, 1999</xref>). Action potentials were induced in the presynaptic neuron with depolarizing currents (10 pulses; 400–600 pA, 5ms, 20 Hz trains). For measuring synaptic currents, postsynaptic neurons were recorded in voltage-clamp, without current injection. We classified connections as monosynaptic if EPSC latency was 2±1 ms, relative to the presynaptic spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; n=7). To normalize EPSC amplitudes, postsynaptic current values in the action potential start time were considered baseline.

Therefore, the same unchanged synaptic inputs could bring neurons to threshold and induce increased output firing after repetitive stimulation, improving the synaptic efficiency in pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Debanne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lisman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nicoll et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Titley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang and Linden, 2003</xref>). Thus, neuronal optogenetic and electrical stimulation might alter the circuit without changing the synapses themselves, and this phenomenon could occur quickly.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanisms of increased excitability in ensemble formation</title><p>Modifications in sub- and suprathreshold membrane conductances that initiate an action potential could underlie increased excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brumberg et al., 2000</xref>). In terms of passive properties, our results coincide with many studies that have shown alterations in input resistance as the mechanism responsible for increases in excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aizenman and Linden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aou et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Armano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Disterhoft et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Woody et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). Activity-dependent increases in input resistance have been shown in hippocampal neurons. There, the increase in excitability could be generated by suppression of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels (GIRK channels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Valero-Aracama et al., 2015</xref>); or by cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-dependent control of excitability by reducing K<sup>+</sup> conductance. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lisman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yu et al., 2017</xref>) or potassium and sodium voltage gate conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campanac and Debanne, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ganguly et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, the contribution of H-channels in intrinsic membrane properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campanac et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fan et al., 2005</xref>). However, that voltage sag, which corresponds to current-H, is largely absent in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kalmbach et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van Aerde and Feldmeyer, 2015</xref>). Our experiment showed only a few neurons that displayed a modest current-H, but it was not affected by optogenetic or electrical stimulation (not shown).</p><p>Moreover, recent studies show that persisting firing could be mediated by an Ether-à-gogo Related Gene (ERG) K<sup>+</sup> channel in neocortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cui and Strowbridge, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Debanne et al., 2019</xref>). In this view, calcium entry induced by repetitive neuronal action potential could modulate leak potassium currents in the neurons, which will generate persistent activity. Consistent with this, in our experiments, the blockage of ERG channels by terfenadine returned the firing rate and the increased input resistance induced by optogenetic and electrical stimulation to basal conditions. Thus, ERG channels appear to have a tonic activity in pyramidal layer 2/3 neurons.</p><p>The cell-intrinsic mechanisms that induce excitability are cell-type and also, stimulation protocol-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angelo et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, different changes in action potential firing have been identified. One of the most common changes is a reduction in after-hyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude, described in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Disterhoft et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Disterhoft and Oh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Malik and Chattarji, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pignatelli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang and Linden, 2003</xref>). In our experiments, we found a significant decrease in spike threshold as the most robust change in optogenetic and electrical stimulated neurons. This parameter also determines the firing frequency of neurons associated with voltage-dependent sodium or calcium currents. Changes in threshold appear to be usual in cortical neurons after intrinsic plasticity induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brumberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cudmore and Turrigiano, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mahon and Charpier, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Paz et al., 2009</xref>), hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Malik and Chattarji, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Valero-Aracama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xu et al., 2005</xref>), and cerebellar Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aizenman and Linden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Armano et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with this, visual deprivation increases spike threshold in pyramidal neurons of visual cortex, as an example of a mechanism that reduces neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2019</xref>). Also, the persistent sodium current could underlie the lowering of spike threshold, throughout the modulation of protein kinase C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Astman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ganguly et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Valero-Aracama et al., 2015</xref>); or protein kinase A activation-dependent on calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cudmore and Turrigiano, 2004</xref>). Finally, potassium channels Kv1 can regulate the action potential threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Feria Pliego and Pedroarena, 2020</xref>). Therefore, the intrinsic plasticity that we report could result from modifications of voltage-gated ion channels and inward rectification by potassium channels. Future studies will examine the exact molecular mechanisms that underlying these increases in excitability.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Contribution of intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity to circuit plasticity</title><p>The apparently contradictory evidence supporting Hebbian synaptic plasticity or intrinsic mechanisms of circuit modification and ensemble formation could be reconciled if one considers the experimental protocol used, as well as temporal and mechanistic factors. As a note of caution, we should mention that the stimulation protocols we used are artificial, and the imprinting of ensembles with optogenetics or electrical stimulation may not be representative of the natural ensembles found and created in the cortex under physiological conditions. Thus, the balance of mechanisms we find may differ with in vivo ensembles, under naturalistic plasticity conditions. In particular, the optogenetic imprinting model for ensemble formation we used occurs quickly in vivo, as soon as we can measure it, within a few minutes. We also see fast changes in neuronal correlations in vitro after optogenetic and electrical stimulation. Although these fast changes are explained by fast intrinsic modifications in excitability, imprinted ensembles could be different from the circuit modification that occur during learning, which, for visual tasks, can take several days or weeks in the same circuit we study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carrillo-Reid et al., 2019</xref>), and which could engage long-term plasticity, Hebbian or not Hebbian.</p><p>In addition, intrinsic plasticity can underlie or contribute to Hebbian plasticity by enhancing the probability for subsequent LTP induction and form or stabilize ensembles/engrams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Debanne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lisman et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, intrinsic plasticity could add neurons into ensembles, even when synaptic weights do not change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hansel and Disterhoft, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Titley et al., 2017</xref>). A third possibility is that behavioral training could engage Hebbian mechanisms that would then induce increases in neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Disterhoft et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Malik and Chattarji, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Valero-Aracama et al., 2015</xref>). So, circuit plasticity could be due to the interplay of synaptic and intrinsic mechanisms and this balance could be different for short and long-term plasticity. In this view, ensembles could be quickly formed by fast intrinsic mechanisms but then be modified by slower synaptic plasticity, perhaps in relation with learning.</p><p>To conclude, our work demonstrates that significant and generalized increases in cellular excitability by intrinsic mechanisms are found during ensemble formation, induced by optogenetic and electrical stimulation. The possibility of modifying input and output patterns of neurons through changes in its firing properties could increase synaptic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brumberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lisman, 1997</xref>) and the correlation between neurons, as we have demonstrated. This could provide an ideal setting for follow-up Hebbian synaptic plasticity than could occur more slowly. As a form of cellular memory, intrinsic excitability could also implement temporary stimulus-response mappings and might play a role in rapid cognitive flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pang and Fairhall, 2019</xref>). Faster ‘online’ plasticity via intrinsic excitability could have a broad impact on network dynamics and could serve as a critical information-storage mechanism that may contribute to memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lisman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pérez-Ortega et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pignatelli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xu et al., 2005</xref>) and to the generation of intrinsic circuit states, such as ensembles and circuit attractors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsáki, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carrillo-Reid et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carrillo-Reid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hopfield, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miller et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All procedures were performed by following the U.S. National Institutes of Health and Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines (IACUC, Protocol #AC-AAAV3464).

The optogenetically-stimulated group revealed trend towards depression right after the stimulation, followed with a trend towards potentiation after 20 minutes of rest. These trends occurred in 6 to 7 neurons but were non-significant. These experiments are very challenging, since they involve patch-clamp recordings from connected, opsin-expressing neurons in adult animals. Moreover, based on our electrically stimulation experiments, perforated patch is necessary, making these experiments even more challenging. In 2 of 2 connected pairs with perforated patch from opsin expressing neurons, we observe depression, recovery and potentiation in evoked EPSC after 20 min post-stimulation, similar to electrically stimulated connected pairs and similar to the optogenetic stimulation of the local circuitry. Thus, we strongly suspect that adding more optogenetically stimulated neurons would reveal identical changes in synaptic plasticity as in the electrically stimulated cells. At the same time, finding pairs of healthy connected neurons with opsin expression and record for long periods of time, reduces the probability to success this specific experimental procedure. This is different to electrically stimulated connected pairs and optogenetic stimulation of the local circuit, where the opsin expression in the recorded neuron was not necessary. That is the reason why we buttress our claim on the larger n from electrical stimulated cells, but would still like to include the optogenetically stimulated neurons, with these caveats.</p><p>We include these caveats this in the Result section:</p><p>&quot;Although average EPSC<sub>1</sub> peak currents of optogenetically stimulated neurons did not show significant changes with simulation, they revealed a trend towards amplitude depression after the stimulation, followed with a tendency towards potentiation, after a 20 minutes rest period…&quot;</p><p>&quot;We conclude that electrical coactivation leads to a moderate biphasic change in monosynaptic currents, with an initial depression followed by a potentiation. These results are consistent with the trends found in pairs of optogenetic stimulated neurons, where EPSC<sub>1</sub> amplitude after a post-stimulation recovery period increased from 9 ± 7 pA to 19 ± 3 pA, although no statistical comparison was possible due to the low n (Figure 2C). The difficulty in obtaining perforated whole cell recordings from connected pairs of neurons in opsin expressing cells from adult brain slices precluded us from increasing the n after many attempts. These difficulties were ameliorated in the electrical stimulation experiments.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Thus, one of the main roles of V1 neurons is to integrate sensory inputs (Buonomano and Merzenich, 1998; Mountcastle, 1997) (Figure 8). Unitary EPSP, i.e., pyramidal to pyramidal monosynaptic connections, would not be expected to increase the firing probability of postsynaptic neurons, in vitro or in vivo (Holmgren et al., 2003; Jouhanneau et al., 2018). However, the joint activation of several neurons in the local circuit (in our case: neighbour neurons with opsin expression), could evoked compound EPSC and EPSP with amplitudes larger than unitary EPSC or EPSP, and could generate synfire chains of activity that propagate through the cortex (Abeles, 1991). Thus, increases in synaptic efficacy, mediated by an increase in neuronal excitability of connected neurons, could play a significant role in the local circuit, improving the efficiency of the flow of the information during visual stimulation and during the recall of neurons associated with a memory.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I believe that this is a strong paper with a lot of potential for very high impact, but it all depends on whether it can be demonstrated that in the true absence of synaptic gain changes (or with those being at least reduced) the observed ensemble effect persists -- only with intrinsic plasticity as an available cellular mechanism.</p><p>This will take a bit of time and work, but it could make the paper a game-changer for plasticity research.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the final dissection of synaptic plasticity vs. excitability could be a game changer.
