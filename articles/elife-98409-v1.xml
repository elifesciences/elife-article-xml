It differentiates between two functional and morphological forms: the elementary body (EB) and the reticulate body (RB). The signals that trigger differentiation from one form to the other are unknown. EBs and RBs have distinctive characteristics that distinguish them, including their size, infectivity, proteome, and transcriptome. Intriguingly, they also differ in their overall redox status as EBs are oxidized and RBs are reduced. We hypothesize that alterations in redox may serve as a trigger for secondary differentiation. To test this, we examined the function of the primary antioxidant enzyme alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC), a well-known member of the peroxiredoxins family, in chlamydial growth and development. Based on our hypothesis, we predicted that altering the expression of <italic>ahpC</italic> would modulate chlamydial redox status and trigger earlier or delayed secondary differentiation. Therefore, we created <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression and knockdown strains. During <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown, ROS levels were elevated, and the bacteria were sensitive to a broad set of peroxide stresses. Interestingly, we observed increased expression of EB-associated genes and concurrent higher production of EBs at an earlier time in the developmental cycle, indicating earlier secondary differentiation occurs under elevated oxidation conditions. In contrast, overexpression of AhpC created a resistant phenotype against oxidizing agents and delayed secondary differentiation. Together, these results indicate that redox potential is a critical factor in developmental cycle progression. For the first time, our study provides a mechanism of chlamydial secondary differentiation dependent on redox status.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Chlamydia</kwd><kwd>developmental cycle</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>redox</kwd><kwd>AhpC</kwd><kwd>CRISPRi</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI170688</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouellette</surname><given-names>Scot P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI178150</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouellette</surname><given-names>Scot P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Differentiation of the pathogenic bacterium, <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, from its non-infectious to infectious form is linked to the redox state of the organism.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All organisms that are exposed to oxygen are necessarily subjected to oxidative stress. Specifically, the process of metabolizing substrates in the presence of oxygen can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are toxic at high enough concentrations. Thus, from bacteria to humans, systems have evolved to mitigate the accumulation of ROS. At the same time, host immune defense mechanisms have evolved to leverage ROS production as a means of limiting pathogen growth and survival. Not surprisingly, pathogens have co-evolved to resist these defense mechanisms. For example, many pathogens possess a variety of antioxidant enzymes, such as catalases, glutathione peroxidases, and peroxiredoxins, that help them both subvert ROS-mediated immune system assaults and mitigate metabolic ROS byproducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Staerck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p><italic>Chlamydia</italic> is an obligate intracellular bacterium that has significantly reduced its genome size and content in adapting to obligate host dependence. <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases and preventable infectious blindness, lacks homologs to catalases or glutathione peroxidases but does possess a homolog of AhpC. AhpC is a 2-cys peroxiredoxin that is widely conserved in prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Oliveira et al., 2021</xref>). Peroxiredoxins scavenge hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, and organic hydroperoxides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Parsonage et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Poole and Ellis, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seaver and Imlay, 2001</xref>) and act as the primary scavenger in pathogens that lack both catalase and glutathione peroxidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mastronicola et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Richard et al., 2011</xref>). Several studies from other bacterial systems have shown that AhpC has a significant role in ROS and RNI scavenging, virulence, and persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cosgrove et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oh and Jeon, 2014</xref>), and deletion of AhpC results in elevated levels of ROS within the bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Though <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is dependent on its host for most of its energy requirements, it has some metabolic activities, such as a partial TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">GÃ©rard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iliffe-Lee and McClarty, 1999</xref>), which can be a possible source of intracellular ROS to which the bacteria must adapt. There is a paucity of knowledge on how <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> modulates oxidative stress. However, some studies explored the effects of redox changes on chlamydial growth. Boncompain et al. reported that infection of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> induced the transient production of ROS by the host cell at a moderate level for the initial few hours of infection only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boncompain et al., 2010</xref>). Another study also found a similar observation about ROS during infection, reporting that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> requires host-derived ROS for its growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abdul-Sater et al., 2010</xref>). However, the key mechanisms <italic>Chlamydia</italic> employs to manage ROS-mediated stress have not been characterized.</p><p><italic>Chlamydia</italic> undergoes a complex developmental cycle that comprises two distinct morphological forms, the EB and the RB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelrahman and Belland, 2005</xref>). The EB is the smaller (~0.3 Âµm), infectious, and nondividing form capable of infecting susceptible host cells. Once internalized into a host-derived vacuole termed an inclusion, the EB differentiates into the non-infectious, larger (~1 Âµm), and replicating RB - this process is known as primary differentiation and represents the early phase of the developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clifton et al., 2005</xref>). RBs replicate within the inclusion in the midcycle phase using an asymmetric, MreB-dependent polarized division process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdelrahman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ouellette et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ouellette et al., 2020</xref>). In the late phase of the developmental cycle, RBs asynchronously condense into EBs, and this process is termed secondary differentiation. Despite these well-defined differences between chlamydial morphological forms, how <italic>Chlamydia</italic> mechanistically differentiates between functional forms remains unclear.</p><p>Intriguingly, a recent study evaluated the redox potential of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and demonstrated that RBs are reduced whereas EBs are oxidized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This is consistent with earlier studies that revealed differences in the crosslinking of outer membrane proteins and type III secretion-related proteins in chlamydial developmental forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Betts-Hampikian and Fields, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caldwell et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Everett and Hatch, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, these observations indicate that, during the developmental cycle, the redox potential of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is changing. However, whether redox changes in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> directly affect developmental cycle progression is not characterized.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Alterations in the redox status of key proteins regulate and drive chlamydial differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Key characteristics of chlamydial developmental forms.

We named this the âredox threshold hypothesis.â In this scenario, as soon as a given RB has crossed an oxidative threshold, the activity of critical proteins is modified to trigger differentiation to the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We used chlamydial transformants designed to overexpress or reduce AhpC levels to explore the effects of altered redox potential on chlamydial growth and development to test this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This study establishes the role of AhpC as an antioxidant in <italic>Chlamydia,</italic> as demonstrated by its ability to counteract different peroxide stresses when overexpressed. Overexpression of AhpC had no negative effect on bacterial replication but delayed the differentiation of RBs to EBs. In contrast, under conditions of <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown, the organism was highly sensitive to oxidizing conditions. Interestingly, this change in redox status caused earlier expression of EB-associated (late) genes and production of EBs, leading to a shift in developmental cycle progression. This earlier activation of gene expression related to secondary differentiation in <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown was also observed when developmental cycle progression was blocked by penicillin treatment. Taken together these data provide mechanistic insight into chlamydial secondary differentiation and are the first to demonstrate redox-regulated differentiation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> favors RB replication over EB production</title><p>To study the effect of AhpC on chlamydial developmental cycle progression, we first generated an <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression (OE) strain using a plasmid encoding an anhydrotetracycline (aTc) inducible <italic>ahpC</italic> (untagged) and transformed it into a <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2 strain lacking its endogenous plasmid (-pL2). The same plasmid vector backbone (i.e., encoding mCherry in place of <italic>ahpC</italic>) was used as an empty vector plasmid control (EV). HeLa cells were infected with these transformants, and, at 10 hpi, expression of the construct was induced or not. Lacking an antibody against AhpC, overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> was validated by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Here, an approximate 1-log increase in transcripts of <italic>ahpC</italic> was detected at 14 and 24 hpi in the induced strain in comparison to the uninduced strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) was performed at 14 and 24 hpi to examine the organismsâ morphology and overall inclusion growth. For IFA, individual bacteria were labeled with an anti-major outer membrane protein (MOMP) antibody, and DAPI was used to stain for DNA. IFA imaging revealed that there was no observable impact on the morphology of the EV control strain under the conditions tested. In contrast, we did note that overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> increased the overall inclusion area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). We next quantified the total number of bacteria (i.e., both RBs and EBs) by measuring genomic DNA and observed a significant increase in gDNA levels at 24 hpi in response to increased <italic>ahpC</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Although inclusions were larger in area and contained more total bacteria as assessed by gDNA levels when overexpressing <italic>ahpC</italic>, recoverable inclusion forming units (IFUs: a measure of infectious EBs) were significantly lower under these conditions at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, by 48 hpi, the difference between the induced and uninduced conditions, although still reduced, was not statistically significant. The average number of IFUs was 5.30Ã10<sup>7</sup> and 1.56Ã10<sup>9</sup> for the <italic>ahpC</italic> OE strain in the uninduced condition at 24 and 48 hpi, respectively. For the EV strain, the average number of IFUs was 7.07Ã10<sup>6</sup> and 1.90Ã10<sup>8</sup> in the uninduced condition at 24 and 48 hpi, respectively. The inclusion forming unit analysis only measures viable EBs from a population, suggesting that AhpC overexpression skews the ratio of RBs to EBs. To test this, we calculated the ratio of IFUs to gDNA at 24 hpi, which revealed that the relative number of RBs is higher (and EBs lower) as a result of overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Overall, these data support the hypothesis that overexpressing <italic>ahpC</italic> delays production of infectious EBs.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Overexpression of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (<italic>ahpC</italic>) affects chlamydial growth and differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transcriptional analysis of <italic>ahpC</italic> in <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression (<italic>ahpC</italic>) and empty vector (EV) control using RT-qPCR following induction at 10 hpi with 1 nM aTc.

Before determining whether increased <italic>ahpC</italic> expression impacts chlamydial sensitivity to oxidizing agents, we first sought to determine the response of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> to inorganic or organic hydroperoxides such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as well as peroxynitrite (PN). To do this, we evaluated the sensitivity of HeLa cells, infected or not with the EV control strain, to different concentrations of oxidizing agents using a viability assay. Both uninfected and EV-infected HeLa cells tolerated up to 1 mM oxidizing agents for 30 min, retaining more than 90% viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Next, different concentrations (lower than 1 mM) of these oxidants were tested on wild-type (WT) <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2/434/Bu (<italic>Ctr</italic> L2). HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ctr</italic> L2 and, at 16 hpi, were exposed to different concentrations of exogenous oxidizing agents for 30 min only, before washing out the oxidizing agents and replacing the media. Samples for IFU and IFA assays were then collected at 24 hpi to assess the effects of the oxidizing agents on WT <italic>Ctr</italic> L2 IFU recovery. 62.5 ÂµM concentration of all three inorganic and organic peroxides had no appreciable effect on IFUs, and inclusion size and morphology also remained unaffected at this sublethal concentration. The concentrations of inorganic and organic peroxides that resulted in a decrease in IFUs to ~50% of the untreated culture were 500 ÂµM (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and 250 ÂµM (CHP and TBHP), respectively, with a concurrent decrease in inclusion size. 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CHP, and TBHP caused &gt;90% reduction in IFUs and small inclusions. PN at 1 mM concentration was less effective than other oxidizing agents and showed only a ~30% decline in IFUs compared to the untreated culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To further examine the antioxidant functions of AhpC, we next exploited our <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression strain to explore its capacity to protect chlamydiae from oxidizing agents. Both <italic>ahpC</italic> OE and EV strains were used to infect HeLa cells and, at 10 hpi, expression of the constructs was induced or not with 1 nM aTc. At 16 hpi, infected cells were exposed to various concentrations of exogenous oxidizing agents for 30 min. At 24 hpi, IFU and IFA samples were collected to measure infectious EB production and assess chlamydial morphology, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, and Supplement 3, the <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression strain showed increased resistance to all oxidants tested as the mean IFUs and the size of inclusions were greater than that of the uninduced but treated control. There was no change in bacterial growth and morphology in the case of 62.5 ÂµM concentrations of oxidizing agents, which was anticipated since we determined this was a sublethal concentration. The resistant phenotype was more evident at the higher concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CHP, and TBHP. Overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> also contributed to higher resistance against PN. Conversely, the empty vector control strain behaved as expected (i.e., like WT) in the presence of oxidizing agents, with similar results observed in the presence or absence of aTc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

To confirm the knockdown of <italic>ahpC</italic>, RT-qPCR was employed. Here, we infected HeLa cells with the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown (<italic>ahpC</italic> KD) or NT strains and induced dCas12 expression or not at 10 hpi using 1 nM aTc. Nucleic acid samples were harvested at 14 hpi and 24 hpi.

In the case of the NT control, there was no effect on <italic>ahpC</italic> transcripts. IFA of these strains revealed noticeably smaller inclusions after blocking expression of <italic>ahpC</italic> as compared to the uninduced sample or the NT conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

This assay revealed that 10 mM DMTU and 100 ÂµM Î±-tocopherol had no adverse effects on uninfected or EV-infected HeLa cells (data not shown). These same concentrations were tested on WT <italic>Ctr</italic> L2 infected HeLa cells in untreated and 500 ÂµM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treated conditions to test the potency of these scavengers to rescue growth defects associated with this concentration of oxidizing agent. Scavengers were added at 9.5 hpi and washed away at 16 hpi - the time of addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the respective samples. At 16.5 hpi, after 3 wash steps, scavengers were added again with fresh media, and, at 24 hpi, bacterial growth and morphology were assessed using IFU and IFA assays. Neither scavenger had a significant impact on chlamydial morphology or infectious progeny. In the case of peroxide (500 ÂµM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) treated samples, scavengers restored IFUs from ~50% to ~100%, and inclusion size was also recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Next, the effect of the ROS scavengers under <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown conditions was assessed. In this experiment, scavengers were added at 9.5 hpi to provide the protective effect of scavengers before reducing the activity of <italic>ahpC</italic>. At 10 hpi, knockdown was induced or not with 1 nM aTc, and, at 14 hpi, scavengers were added again. At 24 hpi, IFU and IFA samples were collected to examine bacterial growth and morphology to assess the effect of ROS scavenging on the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown phenotype. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>, both ROS scavengers had a positive impact on restoring the growth of the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown strain; inclusions were larger, and IFUs were increased from &lt;10% to &gt;90% in the presence of scavengers in the induced samples. These data provide compelling evidence that the adverse effects of <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown are due to increased ROS accumulation in this strain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Chlamydial developmental cycle progression is altered by <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown/overexpression</title><p>Whereas the overexpression of AhpC delayed overall developmental progression and was consistent with our hypothesis, the results with the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown strain appeared to refute our hypothesis given the apparent decrease in IFUs and smaller inclusion sizes after knockdown.

However, complicating such an analysis is that fewer RBs are present to convert to EBs, which would result in overall lower IFU yields as we had measured at 24 and 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Nonetheless, to assess EB production more rigorously at earlier time points in the developmental cycle, we performed a growth curve analysis to precisely measure IFUs at 2 hr intervals from 16 to 24 hpi. HeLa cells were infected, and knockdown was induced or not at 10 hpi with 1 nM aTc. At the indicated time points, IFU samples were collected and quantified. Consistent with our prediction, this experiment revealed higher IFUs (i.e. EBs) at 16 and 18 hpi during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown compared to the uninduced samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This difference was statistically significant at 18 hpi. However, further, EB production was stalled, with the uninduced strain continuing to produce EBs such that, by 24 hpi, there were significantly higher EB yields under these conditions (as noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These data show that the phenotypic consequence of higher expression at 14 hpi of genes functionally related to EBs is the concomitant earlier production of EBs.

This new strain, <italic>ahpC</italic> KD-spec, was used to infect HeLa cells, and knockdown was induced or not at 10 hpi with 1 nM aTc. At the same time, samples were treated or not with 1 unit per mL of penicillin (Pen). IFA controls from these different conditions demonstrated the expected phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). RNA samples were harvested at 16 and 24 hpi and processed for RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2B-D</xref>).

Similarly, <italic>ahpC</italic> KD resulted in reduced <italic>ahpC</italic> transcripts in the induced conditions irrespective of the presence of Pen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2B</xref>).

Consistent with prior observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ouellette et al., 2006</xref>), levels of these genes in uninduced + Pen conditions were low. As we previously noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), the transcripts of <italic>hctA</italic> and <italic>hctB</italic> are higher in the induced than uninduced samples at 16 hpi in the absence of Pen. Interestingly, in the induced + Pen condition, these genes had higher expression at 24 hpi than the uninduced + Pen control. At 16 hpi, their expression was either higher or similar between both samples (i.e., induced + Pen and uninduced + Pen).

In the process of detoxification of peroxides and peroxynitrite, AhpC is converted into an oxidized dimer, requiring alkyl hydroperoxide reductase AhpF or AhpD to regenerate its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koshkin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Poole and Ellis, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wong et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> encodes AhpC (Ct603/CTL0866) but lacks any annotated homologs of AhpF or AhpD.

Contrary to studies from other bacterial systems, we did not observe significant effects of PN with altered AhpC expression. One possible explanation may be our studyâs concentration (1 mM) of PN. Higher concentrations of PN could not be used due to toxic effects on the host cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The other possibility may be the presence of some other unknown mechanism(s) to detoxify PN. For example, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> also encodes a superoxide dismutase (SOD) that may prevent the accumulation of the necessary precursors that are needed for PN production. We are currently investigating the function of the chlamydial SOD enzyme.</p><p>Resistance to different oxidants as a result of overexpression of <italic>ahpC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>) is consistent with studies in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sherman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zuo et al., 2014</xref>), signifying that AhpC is the principal defense mechanism against oxidative stress in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. During <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown, the attenuated activity of AhpC severely affected the growth of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Notably, the observed morphology of inclusions during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown is strikingly similar to <italic>Chlamydia</italic> treated with a high concentration (1 mM) of oxidizing agents used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting both conditions result in increased oxidative stress to the organism. This was further supported by the increased sensitivity of <italic>ahpC</italic> KD to sublethal concentrations of oxidants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with previous data from other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cosgrove et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seaver and Imlay, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Storz et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>ahpC</italic> KD, the ROS level was dramatically higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>), as observed in other bacterial systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Further, the addition of ROS scavengers to the culture medium rescued the negative phenotypes associated with <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>). This strongly suggests that, in the absence of AhpC, higher amounts of reactive oxygen species accumulate in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and that the negative impact on growth during <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown is due to highly oxidized conditions in the organism. Moreover, for the complete restoration of inclusion size, multiple doses of scavengers were required throughout the experiment, further emphasizing that the internal chlamydial environment is increasingly oxidized and/or susceptible to oxidation in the absence of AhpC. These findings suggest that AhpC in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is essential, having a functional role even more extensive than previously reported in other bacteria.</p><p>In further support of this observation, we noticed upregulated transcripts of late-cycle genes such as <italic>hctA</italic>, <italic>hctB</italic>, <italic>glgA, omcA, omcB</italic>, <italic>dsbA</italic>, and <italic>tsp</italic> at an earlier time (14 hpi) in the chlamydial developmental cycle as a result of reduced AhpC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Notably, in the developmental cycle of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, only RBs are present at 14 hpi, and secondary differentiation starts after 16 hpi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelrahman and Belland, 2005</xref>). Expression of most of the late-cycle genes occurs after this time in the developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belland et al., 2003</xref>). These late-cycle genes are well characterized for their association with EBs. The <italic>hctA</italic> and <italic>hctB</italic> genes encode histone-like proteins responsible for chromosomal condensation during the differentiation of RBs into EBs. The <italic>hctA</italic> gene is among the first to be transcribed in the late stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiarelli et al., 2020</xref>). Tsp is a periplasmic protease thought to be crucial in the degradation of RB-specific periplasmic proteins during secondary differentiation in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Swoboda et al., 2023</xref>). OmcA, OmcB, and DsbA are responsible for the rigid cell wall and osmotic stability of the EBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Christensen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hatch, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Newhall, 1987</xref>). GlgA is a key enzyme for glycogen accumulation in the inclusion lumen at late stages of the developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gehre et al., 2016</xref>). One crucial point to consider is the redox status of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>; 14 hpi is the time when reduced RBs predominate with virtually no oxidized EBs detectable. However, we established that <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown shifts the redox status of the bacteria towards oxidation. Hence, the earlier and significantly higher detection of transcripts for these late-cycle genes indicates earlier secondary differentiation in the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown. Importantly, <italic>ahpC</italic> complementation during knockdown restored the regular developmental expression of these late-cycle genes, further supporting that this phenotype was due to the highly oxidized conditions created by reduced AhpC activity. The conclusion of these data is that AhpC levels, and presumably activity, have a direct effect on secondary differentiation.</p><p>Secondary differentiation (differentiation from RBs to EBs) is an essential step for chlamydial growth and survival, but there is a dearth of information regarding the mechanisms of its regulation. EBs and RBs have significantly different proteomic repertoires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Skipp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Skipp et al., 2016</xref>), and our group has identified critical functions for the cytoplasmic ClpXP and ClpCP and periplasmic Tsp proteases during secondary differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jensen et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Swoboda et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wood et al., 2022</xref>).The <italic>tsp</italic> gene, in addition to another late-cycle gene, <italic>hctB</italic>, is transcriptionally regulated by sigma factor 28 (Ï<sup>28</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Douglas and Hatch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hatch and Ouellette, 2023</xref>). Another sigma factor, Ï<sup>54</sup> has been linked to the regulation of outer membrane components, type III secretion system components, and other genes typically expressed late in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hatch and Ouellette, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soules et al., 2020b</xref>). In addition to the two minor sigma factors, Ï<sup>28</sup> and Ï<sup>54</sup>, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> encodes one major sigma factor, Ï<sup>66</sup>, which is post-translationally regulated by the relative levels of RsbV1 (antagonist) and RsbW (anti-sigma factor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thompson et al., 2015</xref>). This Rsb system senses ATP availability and has been proposed to regulate Ï<sup>66</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thompson et al., 2015</xref>). A related study from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Soules et al., 2020a</xref> showed that TCA intermediates act as ligands for RsbU, thereby linking the Rsb system to the TCA cycle and ATP synthesis. Collectively, these data show that post-translational mechanisms drive secondary differentiation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. However, no definitive âswitchâ that triggers this step has been identified.</p><p>How might increasing oxidation regulate secondary differentiation? <italic>Chlamydia</italic> lacks an identifiable ortholog of OxyR so some other mechanism must be employed. We speculate that increasing ROS production from the metabolic activity of the RB will overcome the innate and stochastic activity of AhpC to detoxify ROS. This could either directly alter the activity of specific proteins or lead to the accumulation of damaged proteins that in turn trigger secondary differentiation. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive. We propose a simple model to explain this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). As secondary differentiation is asynchronous and RBs divide through an asymmetric budding mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ouellette et al., 2020</xref>), AhpC as well as proteins impacted by ROS levels are unevenly distributed between mother and daughter cell. This difference will lead some RBs to breach an oxidative threshold sooner, allowing activation of late genes and secondary differentiation earlier than other RBs. Consistent with this, the higher expression of genes functionally related to EBs and EB production during <italic>ahpC</italic> KD at an early stage of the chlamydial developmental cycle indicates earlier secondary differentiation as an outcome of diminished activity of <italic>ahpC</italic> in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>. Consequently, increased late gene transcription should have the phenotypic effect of causing earlier production of EBs. Indeed, we quantified more IFUs in the <italic>ahpC</italic> knockdown at 16 and 18 hpi compared to the uninduced control condition. During <italic>ahpC</italic> KD, higher amounts of ROS accumulation in the bacterium create highly oxidized conditions. In contrast, <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression scavenges ROS at a greater level leading to a more reducing environment. For the AhpC overexpression strain, the expression of late-cycle genes in the induced conditions compared to the uninduced control at 24 hpi is significantly lower with reduced production of EBs. These data support our hypothesis that the developmental cycle is delayed in these conditions with a concomitant delay in achieving the oxidative threshold, thus allowing RBs to continue to divide before committing to secondary differentiation. Taken together, our data directly link oxidation state and secondary differentiation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Ongoing studies are focused on characterizing redox-sensitive chlamydial proteins to understand which specific factors drive the shift from RBs to EBs (or EBs to RBs) in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Altering the activity of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC) in <italic>Ctr</italic> L2 impacts its developmental cycle progression.</title><p>(Top) In <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, secondary differentiation is asynchronous and reticulate bodies (RBs) divide through an asymmetric budding mechanism.

At 16 hpi, wells were washed three times with HBSS, and fresh DMEM containing 500 Î¼M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or not was added. After 30 min, wells were washed three times with HBSS, and fresh DMEM containing scavengers or not was added back in the respective wells, which were incubated until 24 hpi prior to collecting samples for IFU assay and IFA analysis. The effect of these scavengers was further tested in <italic>ahpC</italic> KD. HeLa cells were infected with <italic>ahpC</italic> KD, scavengers were added or not at 9.5 hpi before induction at 10 hpi with 1 nM aTc. At 14 hpi, scavengers were added again in the respective wells, and, at 24 hpi, samples were collected for IFU assay and IFA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>ROS detection by CellROX Deep Red</title><p>Intracellular ROS levels were measured in uninfected and <italic>ahpC</italic> KD-infected HeLa cells using CellROX Deep Red dye (Invitrogen, #C10422). Samples were induced or not at 10 hpi with 1 nM aTc. Medium without cells was used as the blank control. At the end point, media was removed, and samples were washed three times with DPBS and incubated with CellROX Deep Red dye for 30 min in the dark at 37Â°C. Fluorescence was read at excitation 644 nm and emission 665 nm using an Infinite M200 Pro (Tecan). Microscopic images were captured using live cells at 24 or 40 hpi. Experimental conditions were the same as mentioned above. All experiments were performed three times for three biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Materials availability</title><p>Any unique resources developed in this study will be made available upon request.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (<italic>ahpC</italic>) knockdown RNA-seq results.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-98409-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>List of plasmids, strains, and primers used in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-98409-supp2-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-98409-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The raw and processed RNA sequencing reads in fastq format have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">GEO</ext-link>) under Accession number GSE278846.

Our data and those of others have shown that <italic>ahpC</italic> is expressed as a mid-developmental cycle gene (i.e., when RBs predominate in the population). This is true of most chlamydial genes, and the factors that determine developmental expression are not fully understood. As we noted in the Discussion, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> lacks AhpF/D orthologs, so it is not clear how AhpC activity is regulated. Related to determining environmental signals that trigger activity of AhpC, then this is a non-trivial issue in an obligate intracellular bacterium. Our assumption is that AhpC is constitutively active and that the increasing metabolic production of ROS eventually overcomes the innate (and stochastic) activity of AhpC to handle it, hence the threshold hypothesis. Importantly, the stochasticity is consistent with what we know about secondary differentiation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. We have tried to clarify these points in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The factors that influence the differentiation of EBs and RBs during Chlamydial development are not clearly understood.

Direct redox potential measurement in the <italic>ahpC</italic> overexpression and knock-down cells is required to support the model. This can be done using the roGFP-based measurements mentioned in the Wang et al. 2014 study cited by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. It is definitely something that we are looking to implement. However, our current vectors donât allow for roGFP2 in combination with inducible expression of a gene of interest. We will need to completely redesign our vectors, and, in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, the validation of such new vectors together with <italic>ahpC</italic> OE or KD may literally take a year or longer.</p><p>In lieu of this, we used the CellRox redox reactive dye to image live chlamydiae during normal growth or <italic>ahpC</italic> KD. During <italic>ahpC</italic> KD, these organisms are clearly much brighter than the control, uninduced conditions. These data are included as new Figure 5 to go along with the data we previously reported from the plate reader measurements. These data also clearly indicate that the readings we observed are from <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and not the host cell.</p><p>As far as a general oxidative stress response, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> lacks any transcriptional regulators akin to OxyR. The response weâve measured, earlier expression of genes associated with secondary differentiation, would be an odd stress response not consistent with a focused program to respond to oxidative stress. We added new RNAseq data further showing this effect of a global earlier increase in late gene transcripts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study reports clearly on the role of the AhpC protein as an antioxidant factor in <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> and speculates on the role of AhpC as an indirect regulator of developmental transcription induced by redox stress in this differentiating obligate intracellular bacterium.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The question posed and the concluding model about redox-dependent differentiation in chlamydia is interesting and highly relevant. This work fits with other propositions in which redox changes have been reported during bacterial developmental cycles, potentially as triggers, but have not been cited (examples PMID: 2865432, PMID: 32090198, PMID: 26063575). Here, AhpC over-expression is shown to protect Chlamydia towards redox stress imposed by H2O2, CHP, TBHP, and PN, while CRISPRi-mediated depletion of AhpC curbed intracellular replication and resulted in increased ROS levels and sensitivity to oxidizing agents. Importantly, the addition of ROS scavengers mitigated the growth defect caused by AhpC depletion. These results clearly establish the role of AhpC affects the redox state and growth in Ct (with the complicated KO genetics and complementation that are very nicely done).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>However, with respect to the most important implication and claims of this work, the role of redox in controlling the chlamydial developmental cycle rather than simply being a correlation/passenger effect, I am less convinced about the impact of this work. First, the study is largely observational and does not resolve how this redox control of the cell cycle could be achieved, whereas in the case of _Caulobacte_r, a clear molecular link between DNA replication and redox has been proposed. How would progressive oxidation in RBs eventually trigger the secondary developmental genes to induce EB differentiation? Is there an OxyR homolog that could elicit this change and why would the oxidation stress in RBs gradually accumulate during growth despite the presence of AhpC? In other words, the role of AhpC is simply to delay or dampen the redox stress response until the trigger kicks in, again, what is the trigger? Is this caused by increasing oxidative respiration of RBs in the inclusion? But what determines the redox threshold?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. As the reviewer notes, our work clearly demonstrates that AhpC acts as an antioxidant in <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis.</italic> Further, we have shown that transcription of the late cycle genes is altered upon altered activity of AhpC, which acts as a proof of concept that redox is (one of) the key factor(s) controlling developmental cycle progression in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Our new RNAseq data indicate that a broad swath of well characterized late genes is activated, which contradicts the argument that what weâve measured is a stress response (unless activation of late genes in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is generally a stress response (not the case based on other models of stress) â in which case we would not be able to differentiate between these effects). We hypothesize that ROS production from the metabolic activities of RBs serves as a signal to trigger secondary differentiation from RBs to EBs. How this exact threshold is determined is currently unknown as <italic>Chlamydia</italic> does not have any annotated homolog for OxyR. It is beyond the scope of the present manuscript to identify and then characterize what specific factor(s) control(s) this response. We fully anticipate that multiple factors are likely impacted by increasing oxidation, so dissecting the exact contributions of any one factor will represent (a) potential separate manuscript(s). Nonetheless, this remains an overarching goal of the lab yet remains challenging given the obligate intracellular nature of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Strategies that would work in a model system, like <italic>Caulobacter</italic>, that can be grown in axenic media are not easily implemented in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p><p>As we noted above in another response, <italic>ahpC</italic> is transcribed as a mid-cycle gene with a peak of transcription corresponding to the RB phase of growth. We hypothesize that the gradual accumulation of ROS from metabolic activity will eventually supercede the ability of AhpC to detoxify it. This would result in any given RB asynchronously and stochastically passing this threshold (and triggering EB formation), which is consistent with what we know about secondary differentiation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also find the experiment with Pen treatment to have little predictive power. The fact that transcription just proceeds when division is blocked is not unprecedented. This also happens during the Caulobacter cell cycle when FtsZ is depleted for most developmental genes, except for those that are activated upon completion of the asymmetric cell division and that is dependent on the completion of compartmentalization. This is a smaller subset of developmental genes in caulobacter, but if there is a similar subset that depends on division on chlamydia and if these are affected by redox as well, then the argument about the interplay between developmental transcription and redox becomes much stronger and the link more intriguing. Another possibility to strengthen the study is to show that redox-regulated genes are under the direct control of chlamydial developmental regulators such as Euo, HctA, or others and at least show dual regulation by these inputs -perhaps the feed occurs through the same path.</p></disp-quote><p>Comparisons to other model systems are generally of limited value with <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. All chlamydial cell division genes are mid-cycle (RB-specific) genes, just like <italic>ahpC</italic>. There is no evidence of a redox-responsive transcription factor (whether EUO, HctA, or another) that activates or represses a subset of genes in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Similarly, there is no evidence that redox directly and specifically impacts transcription of cell division genes based on our new RNAseq data. The types of experiments suggested are not easily implemented in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, but we would certainly like to be able to do them.</p><p>As it pertains to penicillin specifically, we and others have shown that treating chlamydiae with Pen blocks secondary differentiation (meaning late genes are not transcribed). Effectively, Pen treatment freezes the organism in an RB state with continued transcription of RB genes. What we have shown is that, even during Pen treatment (which blocks late gene transcription), <italic>ahpC</italic> KD can overcome this block, which shows that elevated oxidation is able to trigger late gene expression even when the organisms are phenotypically blocked from progressing to EBs. The comparison from our perspective to <italic>Caulobacter</italic> is of limited value.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This redox-transcription shortcoming is also reflected in the discussion where most are about the effects and molecular mitigation of redox stress in various systems, but there is little discussion on its link with developmental transcription in bacteria in general and chlamydia.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the Discussion to include a broader description of the results and included additional citations as suggested by the reviewer (PMID: 32090198, PMID: 26063575). However, we found one suggested article (PMID: 2865432) is not relevant to our study, so we didnât cite it in our present manuscript.
