Fluorescence microscopy can localize biomolecules inside whole cells and tissues, but its ability to count biomolecules and accuracy of the spatial coordinates is limited by the wavelength of visible light. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) provides highly accurate position and orientation information of biomolecules but is often confined to small fields of view inside a cell, limiting biological context. In this study, we use a new data-acquisition scheme called Defocus-Corrected Large-Area cryo-EM (DeCo-LACE) to collect high-resolution images of entire sections (100- to 250-nm-thick lamellae) of neutrophil-like mouse cells, representing 1–2% of the total cellular volume. We use 2D template matching (2DTM) to determine localization and orientation of the large ribosomal subunit in these sections. These data provide maps of ribosomes across entire sections of mammalian cells. This high-throughput cryo-EM data collection approach together with 2DTM will advance visual proteomics and provide biological insight that cannot be obtained by other methods.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>neutrophil</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HHMI Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grigorieff</surname><given-names>Nikolaus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01HL131477</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scadden</surname><given-names>David T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 743-2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schiroli</surname><given-names>Giulia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-electron microscopy can be used to detect biomolecules in entire 100- to 250-nm-thick cell slices when using a method to collect montages that prevents radiation damage in areas that have not been imaged yet.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A major goal in understanding cellular processes is the knowledge of the amounts, location, interactions, and conformations of biomolecules inside the cell. This knowledge can be obtained by approaches broadly divided into label- and label-free techniques. In label-dependent techniques a probe is physically attached to a molecule of interest that is able to be detected by its strong signal, such as a fluorescent molecule. In label-free techniques, the physical properties of molecules themselves are used for detection. An example for this is proteomics using mass-spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Griffin et al., 2010</xref>). The advantage of label-free techniques is that they can provide information over thousands of molecules, while label-dependent techniques offer highly specific information for a few molecules. In particular, spatial information is primarily achieved using label-dependent techniques, such as fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lichtman and Conchello, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has the potential to directly visualize the arrangement of atoms that compose biomolecules inside of cells, thereby allowing label-free detection with high spatial accuracy. This has been called visual proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nickell et al., 2006</xref>). Since cryo-EM requires thin samples (&lt;500 nm), imaging of biomolecules inside cells is restricted to small organisms, thin regions of cells, or samples that have been suitably thinned. Thinning can be achieved either by mechanical sectioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McDowall et al., 1983</xref>) or by milling using a focused ion beam (FIB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Villa et al., 2013</xref>). This complex workflow leads to a low throughput of cryo-EM imaging of cells and is further limited by the fact that at the required magnifications, typical fields of view (FOV) are very small compared to mammalian cells, and the FOV achieved by label-dependent techniques such as fluorescence light microscopy. The predominant cryo-EM technique for the localization of biomolecules of defined size and shape inside cells is cryo-electron tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gan and Jensen, 2012</xref>). However, the requirement of a tilt series at every imaged location and subsequent image alignment, severely limits the throughput for molecular localization.</p><p>An alternative approach is to identify molecules by their structural fingerprint in single projections using 2D template-matching (2DTM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rickgauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rickgauer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lucas et al., 2021</xref>). In this method, a 3D model of a biomolecule is used as a template to find 2D projections that match the molecules visible in the electron micrographs. This method requires a projection search on a fine angular grid, and the projections are used to find local cross-correlation peaks with the micrograph. Since the location of a biomolecule in the z-direction causes predictable aberrations to the projection image, this method can be used to calculate complete 3D coordinates and orientations of a biomolecule in a cellular sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rickgauer et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here we apply 2DTM of the ribosome large subunit (LSU) to a conditionally immortalized <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (mouse) cell line that gives rise to functional mature neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sykes et al., 2016</xref>). We chose these cells because genetic defects in the ribosome machinery often lead to hematopoietic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kampen et al., 2020</xref>) and direct quantification of ribosome location, number and conformational states in hematopoietic cells could lead to new insight into hematopoietic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dolezal et al., 2018</xref>). To increase the amount of collected data and to provide unbiased sampling of the whole lamella, we devised a new data-acquisition scheme, Defocus-Corrected Large Area Cryo-Electron microscopy (DeCo-LACE). 2DTM allows us to test whether aberrations caused by large beam-image shifts and highly condensed beams deteriorate the high-resolution signal. We find that these aberrations do not impede LSU detection by 2DTM. The resulting data provide a description of ribosome distribution in an entire lamella, which represent 1–2% of the cellular volume. We find a highly heterogeneous density of ribosomes within the cell. Analysis of the throughput in this method suggests that for the foreseeable future computation will be the bottleneck for visual proteomics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2DTM detects large ribosomal subunits in cryo-FIB lamellae of mammalian cells</title><p>FIB-milled <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (yeast) cells are sufficiently well preserved to permit localization of 60S ribosomal subunits with 2DTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lucas et al., 2022</xref>). Due to the larger size of mammalian cells compared to yeast cells, it was unclear whether plunge freezing would be adequate to produce vitreous ice across the whole volume of the cell. To test this we prepared cryo-lamellae of mouse neutrophil cells. A low magnification image of a representative lamella clearly shows cellular features consistent with a neutrophile-like phenotype, mainly a segmented nucleus and a plethora of membrane-organelles, corresponding to the granules and secretory vesicles of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then proceeded to acquire micrographs on this lamella with a defocus of 0.5–1.0 μm, 30 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>/s exposure and 1.76 Å pixel size. We manually selected multiple locations in the lamella and acquired micrographs using standard low-dose techniques where focusing is performed on a sacrificial area. The resulting micrographs showed smooth bilayered membranes and no signs of crystalline ice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), indicating successful vitrification throughout the lamella.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>2D template matching of the large subunit of the ribosome in fib-milled neutrophil-like cells (<bold>A</bold>) Overview image of the lamella.</title><p>Major cellular regions are labeled, as Nucleus (Nuc), Mitochondria (M), and granular cytoplasm (GrCyt).

In a subset of images, the distribution of cross-correlation scores significantly exceeded the distribution expected from images devoid of detectable targets. In the resulting scaled maximum-intensity projections (MIPs), clear peaks with SNR values up to 10 were apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Using a threshold criterion to select significant targets (see Methods), we found that in images of cytosolic compartments there were 10–500 ribosomes within one micrograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>). Notably, we found no targets in areas corresponding to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In the cytoplasm, we found a highly variable number of targets, only ~50 in some exposures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and up to 500 in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, it is unclear whether this ten-fold difference in local ribosome concentration is due to technical variation, such as sample thickness, or biological variation. To differentiate between the two we reasoned it was important to not manually choose imaging regions and to collect larger amounts of data. We therefore set out to collect cryo-EM data for 2DTM from mammalian cell lamellae in a high-throughput unbiased fashion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>DeCo-LACE for 2D imaging of whole lamellae</title><p>In order to obtain high-resolution data from complete lamellae, we developed a new approach for data collection.

During canonical low-dose imaging, the microscope is configured so that the focal plane is identical to the eucentric plane of the specimen stage. This leaves the C2 aperture out of focus, resulting in ripples at the edge of the beam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). While these ripples are low-resolution features that likely do not interfere with 2DTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rickgauer et al., 2017</xref>), we also tested data collection under conditions where the C2 aperture is in focus (fringe-free, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Konings et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We then centered a lamella on the optical axis of the microscope and used the image shift controls of the microscope to systematically scan the whole surface of the lamella in a hexagonal pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). Instead of focusing on a sacrificial area, we determined the defocus from every exposure after it was taken. The defocus was then adjusted based on the difference between desired and measured defocus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Since we used a serpentine pattern for data collection, every exposure was close to the previous exposure, making large changes in the defocus unlikely. Furthermore, we started our acquisition pattern on the platinum deposition edge to make sure that the initial exposure where the defocus was not yet adjusted did not contain any biologically relevant information.</p><p>We used this strategy to collect data on eight lamellae, four using the eucentric focus condition, hereafter referred to as Lamella<sub>EUC</sub>, and four using the fringe-free condition, hereafter referred to as Lamella<sub>FFF</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). We were able to collect data with a highly consistent defocus of 800 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), both in the eucentric focus and fringe-free focus condition. To ensure that data were collected consistently, we mapped defocus values as a function of the applied image shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This demonstrated that the defocus was consistent across a lamella, except for rare outliers and in images containing contamination. We also plotted the measured objective astigmatism of each lamella and found that it varies with the applied image shift, becoming more astigmatic mostly due to image shift in the x direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). While approaches exist to correct for this during the data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), we opted to not use these approaches in our initial experiments. We reasoned that because 2DTM depends on high-resolution information, this would be an excellent test of how much these aberration affect imaging.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Assembling DeCo-LACE exposures into montages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview image of Lamella<sub>EUC</sub> 1 taken at low magnification.

In the resulting montages, the same cellular features visible in the overview images are apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B+E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>), however due to the high magnification and low defocus many more details, such as the membrane bilayer separation, can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C+F</xref>). For montages collected using the eucentric condition, there are clearly visible fringes at the edges between the tiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which are absent in the fringe-free focus montages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In our analysis below, we show that these fringes do not impede target detection by 2DTM, making them primarily an aesthetic issue. We also note that the tiling pattern is visible in the montages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B+E</xref>), which we believe is due to the non-linear behavior of the K3 camera since we can observe these shading artifacts in images of a condensed beam over vacuum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The montages show membrane vesicles and granules with highly variable sizes and density. We found that a substantial number of granules, which are characterized by higher density inside the surrounding cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bainton et al., 1971</xref>), seemed to contain a membrane-enclosed inclusion with density similar to the surrounding cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>) and could therefore be formed by inward budding of the granule membrane. These granules were 150–300 nm in diameter and the inclusions were 100–200 nm in diameter. Based on these dimensions the granules are either azurophil or specific granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bainton et al., 1971</xref>). To our knowledge, these inclusions have not been described in granulocytes and are further described and discussed below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>2DTM of DeCo-LACE data reveals large ribosomal subunit distribution in cellular cross-sections</title><p>In our initial attempts of using 2DTM on micrographs acquired with the DeCo-LACE protocol, we did not observe any SNR peaks above threshold using the large subunit of the mouse ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We reasoned that the edges of the beam might interfere with motion-correction of the movies as they represent strong low-resolution features that do not move with the sample. When we cropped the movie frames to exclude the beam edges, the estimated amount of motion increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), consistent with successful tracking of sample motion. Furthermore, in the motion-corrected average we could identify significant SNR peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), confirming the high sensitivity of 2DTM to the presence of high-resolution signal preserved in the images by the motion correction. To streamline data processing, we implemented a function in unblur to consider only a defined central area of a movie for estimation of sample motion, while still averaging the complete movie frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Using this approach, we motion-corrected all tiles in the eight lamellae and found consistently total motion below 1 Å per frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In some lamellae, we found increased motion in the lamella center, which indicates areas of variable mechanical stability within FIB-milled lamellae. In some micrographs, we also observed that the beam edges gave rise to artifacts in the MIP and numerous false-positive detections at the edge of the illuminated area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). A similar phenomenon was observed on isolated hot pixels in unilluminated areas. To overcome this issue, we implemented a function in the program unblur to replace dark areas in the micrograph with Gaussian noise (see Materials and methods), with mean and standard deviation matching the illuminated portion of the micrograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>+E). Together, these pre-processing steps enabled us to perform 2DTM on all tiles of the eight lamellae.</p><p>We used the tile positions to calculate the positions of the detected LSUs in the lamellae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>). Overlaying these positions of the lamella montages reveals the LSU distribution throughout the FIB-milled slices of individual cells. Consistent with prior observations imaging selected views in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lucas et al., 2022</xref>), organelles like the nucleus and mitochondria only showed sporadic targets detected with low SNRs, consistent with the estimated false-positive rate of one per tile. For each detected target, we also calculated the Z positions from the individual estimated defocus and defocus offset for each tile. When viewed from the side, the ribosome positions therefore show the slight tilts of the lamellae relative to the microscope frame of reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>). Furthermore, the side views indicated that lamellae were thinner at the leading edge. To confirm this we estimated the ice thickness in individual tiles using the Beer-Lambert law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rice et al., 2018</xref>) with 322 nm as coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rice et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We found that the thickness of the lamellae varied between 100 and 250 nm, with consistently thinner ice at the leading edge even though we prepared the lamellae with the overtilt approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schaffer et al., 2017</xref>). To further confirm the relationship of the range in Z-positions of detections and sample thickness we plotted the range in Z-positions as a function of the estimated sample thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). For most tiles, the apparent thickness of LSU detections was at least 70 nm less than the estimated sample thickness, indicating that no detections were being made within 35 nm of the lamella edge. It is possible that this is caused by sample damage during FIB-milling as similar values for damaged areas in FIB-milled lamellae have been estimated from sub-tomogram averaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berger et al., 2022</xref>). This means that LSU detections across the lamellae can be skewed by a change in thickness and sample damage. Therefore, better sample preparation methods together with a better understanding of the damage to the sample during FIB-milling are needed to accurately quantify molecular concentrations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Template matching in a lamella imaged using the DeCo-LACE approach at eucentric focus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Montage of Lamella<sub>EUC</sub>1 overlaid with detected targets colored in orange.

We would therefore expect to find one false positive detection per tile. We reasoned that the large nuclear area imaged by DeCo-LACE could be used to test whether this assumption is true. In the 670 tiles containing exclusively nucleus (as manually annotated from the overview image) we detected 247 targets, making the false-positive rate more than twofold lower than expected. Since earlier work shows that 2DTM with the LSU can produce matches to nuclear ribosome biogenesis intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lucas et al., 2022</xref>), this could even be an overestimate of the false-positive rate. This suggests that the detection threshold could be even lower, which is an area of ongoing research.</p><p>Close inspection of the LSU positions in the lamellae revealed several interesting features. LSUs could be seen associating with membranes, in patterns reminiscent of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) or the outer nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We also observed LSUs forming ring-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), potentially indicating circularized mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wells et al., 1998</xref>). While ribosomes were for the most part excluded from the numerous granules observed in the cytoplasm, in some cases we observed clusters of LSUs in the inclusions of double-membraned granules described earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). It is, in principle, possible that these targets are situated above or below the imaged granules, since the granule positions in z cannot be determined using 2D projections. However, in the case of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, the detected LSUs span the whole lamella in the z direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), while positions above or below a granule would result in LSUs situated exclusively at the top or bottom of the lamella. This is consistent with the earlier hypothesis that the inclusions are of cytoplasmic origin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Does DeCo-LACE induce aberrations that affect 2DTM?</title><p>Within the eight lamellae we found different numbers of detected targets, ranging from 1089–6,433 per lamella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Lamella<sub>EUC</sub> 1 had the most detected targets, but also had the largest surface area and contained cytoplasm from two cells. Lamella<sub>FFF</sub> 4 had the fewest detected targets, but this particular lamella was dominated by a circular section of the nucleus, with only small pockets of cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). In an attempt to normalize for these differences in area containing cytoplasm, we compared the number of detected targets per tile in tiles that contained more than one target, which should exclude tiles with non-cytosolic content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). While this measure had less variability, there were still differences. Lamella<sub>EUC</sub> 4 had not only the fewest targets, but also the lowest density, which could be due to this lamella being the thinnest, or due to it sectioning the cell in an area with a lower concentration of ribosomes. Lamella<sub>FFF</sub> 3 had a substantially higher number of ribosomes per tile. Since all of these lamellae were made from a cell-line under identical conditions, this underscores the necessity to collect data from large numbers of lamellae to overcome the inherent variability. When comparing the distribution of scores between lamellae, we found them to be fairly comparable with median SNRs ranging from 8.7 to 9.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Lamella<sub>EUC</sub> 1 had slightly lower scores compared to the rest, potentially due to its large size and connected mechanical instability during imaging. Overall, we did not observe differences in the number or SNR of detected targets between eucentric or fringe-free illumination conditions that were bigger than the observed inter-lamella variability.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Statistics of 2DTM on a lamella imaged using DeCo-LACE.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Number of detected targets in each lamella.

We considered non-parallel illumination introduced by the unusually condensed beam and uncharacterized aberrations near the beam periphery. When plotting the SNR values of detected targets in all eight lamellae as a function of their location in the tiles, we found uniformly high SNR values throughout the illuminated areas for both eucentric and fringe-free focus illumination, demonstrating that both illumination schemes are suitable for DeCo-LACE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>We also wondered whether large image shifts would lead to aberrations due to astigmatism or beam tilt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). We reasoned that if that was the case the number of detected targets should be highest in the center of the lamella where the applied beam image-shift is 0. Instead, we observed that in both eucentric and fringe-free focus conditions more targets were detected at the back edge of the lamella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This may be due to the center of the cell being predominantly occupied by the nucleus, despite its segmentation in neutrophil-like cells. The increase in matches at the back of the lamellae compared to the front can also be explained by the thickness gradient of the lamellae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In addition, aberrations would be expected to cause average 2DTM SNRs to be higher when beam-image shift values are small. Instead, we found that SNRs where on average the highest at the front edge of the lamellae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), presumably due to the reduced sample thickness. We therefore conclude that factors other that beam image-shift or beam condensation aberrations are limiting 2DTM SNRS, predominantly the thickness of the lamellae.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Computation is the bottleneck of visual proteomics</title><p>All lamellae described above were derived from a clonal cell line under identical condition and thinned with the same parameters. This means that the substantial variability of detected targets between the lamellae must be due to sample preparation variability, including area, thickness, mechanical stability, and location of the section within the cell. We therefore predict that further studies that want to draw quantitative and statistically relevant conclusions about the number and location of molecules under different experimental conditions, will require collection of orders of magnitude more data than in this study to gain enough statistical power given this variability. The samples used were prepared in two 24 hr sessions on a FIB/SEM instrument, and imaging was performed during another two 24 hr session on the TEM microscope. Inspections of the timestamps of the raw data files revealed that the milling time per lamella was ~30 min and TEM imaging was accomplished in ~10 s per tile or 90 min for a~6 × 6 μm lamella. Processing of the data, however, took substantially longer. Specifically, 2DTM of all tiles took approximately one week per lamella on 32 Nvidia A6000 GPUs. Computation is therefore a bottleneck in our current workflow, and further optimizations of the algorithm may be necessary to increase throughput. Alternatively, this bottleneck could be reduced by increasing the number of processing units.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we developed an approach to image entire cellular cross-section using cryo-EM at high enough resolution to allow for 2DTM detection of the LSU. The two main advantages compared to previous approaches are high throughput of imaging and biological context for detected molecules. The requirement to increase throughput in cryo-EM data collection of cellular samples has been recognized in the recent literature. Most approaches described so far are tailored towards tomography. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peck et al., 2022</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2022</xref> developed approaches to increase the FOV of tomogram data-collection by using a montaging technique. Peck et al. used a similar condensed-beam approach as described here. However, the montages are substantially smaller in scope, covering carbon film holes of 2 m diameter. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bouvette et al., 2021</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eisenstein et al., 2022</xref> are using beam image-shift to collect tilt-series in multiple locations in parallel to increase throughput. However, none of these approaches provide the full coverage of a cellular cross-section that can be achieved using DeCo-LACE.</p><p>We observed granules containing a vesicle of putative cytosolic origin. We speculate that upon degranulation, the process in which granules fuse with the plasma membrane, these vesicles would be released into the extracelullar space. The main types of extracellular vesicles of this size are exosomes, up to 100 nm large vesicles derived from fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane, and microvesicles, which are derived from direct budding of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>). We suggest that granulocytes could release a third type of extracellular vesicle, granule-derived vesicles (GDV), into the extracellular space. 2DTM showed that a subset of GDVs can contain ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). This could indicate that these vesicles are transporting translation-capable mRNAs, as has been described for exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Valadi et al., 2007</xref>). Further studies will be necessary to confirm the existence of GDVs in granulocytes isolated from mammals and to understand their functional significance.</p><p>As mentioned in the results, we found a consistent shading artifact pattern in our montages, that we believe is the result of non-linear behavior of the K3 camera. Indeed, when we average images with a condensed beam taken over vacuum we found in both focus conditions a consistent background pattern with a brighter region on the periphery of the illuminated area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This might be caused by dynamic adjustment of the internal camera counting threshold which expects columns of the sensor to be evenly illuminated as is the case for SPA applications. Since the signal of this pattern has mainly low-resolution components it is unlikely to affect 2DTM. However, it highlights that the non-linear behavior of the camera has to be taken into account when imaging samples with strongly varying density and unusual illumination schemes.</p><p>We found that even though we used beam image-shift extensively (up to 7 µm), we did not see substantially reduced 2DTM SNR values in tiles acquired at high beam image-shift compared to tiles acquired with low or no beam image-shift. This is unexpected because beam image-shift is thought to degrade the high-resolution signal due to the introduction of beam-tilt, as has been observed in single particle analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cash et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>). The signal detected by 2DTM is target and sample dependent and has been shown to be sensitive to a resolution up to 3 Å, but in practice is limited by the B-factor applied to the template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rickgauer et al., 2017</xref>). In our case, we used a structure of the mouse LSU that was deposited into the PDB with atoms having a median B-factor of ~80 Å<sup>2</sup>, which we multiplied by 1.5 before generating the density map. This value was chosen empirically early in the study to optimize the number of detections. The resulting median B-factor of 120 Å<sup>2</sup> is equivalent to a Gaussian lowpass filter with a filter constant of 7.7 Å. We did not measure the beam-tilt caused by beam-image shift on the microscope to acquire our data. However, Cheng et. al. report that in their measurements Krios Titan columns exhibited a beam-tilt of 0.17–0.25 mrad per μm of beam image-shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore expect a worst-case beam-tilt of 1.75 mrad. At this beam-tilt we expect a phase error of larger than π/4 at resolutions higher than 5.75 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>), which exceeds the effective resolution of our 2DTM template. We conclude that the beam-tilt caused by beam-image shift did not strongly affect detections in the present study, but it might be important to consider when imaging at even higher beam-image shift values or when using higher resolution signal in 2DTM.</p><p>We used 2DTM of the ribosome LSU to verify the image quality of DeCo-LACE data. However, 2DTM has the potential to detect many other protein complexes. The model of the ribosomal LSU used in this manuscript has a molecular weight of ~2 MDa, ~1.3 MDa of which is nucleic acid. The higher scattering density of nucleic acid compared to protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spahn et al., 2000</xref>) may mean that a biomolecular complex of equal size consisting of only protein would result in lower SNR values. Many biological complexes are smaller and do not contain nucleic acid, but simulations of 2DTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rickgauer et al., 2017</xref>) suggest that it should be possible to detect protein molecules as small as 300 kDa in an crowded environment. Besides the molecular weight we expect that the conformational homogeneity of a protein complex will affect the ability to detect it and note that for complexes that occur at low concentrations inside the cell a higher detection threshold might be necessary to reduce the number of false positives among the few true targets that can be detected.</p><p>Since we observed substantial variation in LSU density within and between lamellae, visual proteomics studies that use cryo-EM to establish changes in molecular organization within cells will require orders of magnitude more data than used in this study. One milestone would be to image enough data to represent one cellular volume, which for a small eukaryotic cells requires imaging approximately 100 lamellae. While data collection throughput on the TEM is fundamentally limited by the exposure time, this amount of data could be collected within 12 hr by improving the data acquisition scheme to perform all necessary calculations in parallel with actual exposure of the camera. Sample preparation using a FIB/SEM is also currently a bottleneck, but preparation of large lamellae with multiple cellular cross-sections using methods like WAFFLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kelley et al., 2022</xref>) might allow sufficient throughput. As stated in the results, at least for 2DTM computation will remain challenging and approximately 17,000 GPU hours would be required for a 100 lamellae dataset. It might be possible to increase the performance of 2DTM by improving the implementation of GPU-based fast Fourier transforms. Alternatively, strategies that initially search images at lower resolution and sparser rotational sampling, followed by refinement at higher resolution, could be more efficient, but it is yet unclear whether this is feasible in cellular samples with strong low-resolution background.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ER-HoxB8</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sykes et al., 2016</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Generated from mouse bone marrow as described</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCF</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sykes et al., 2016</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Generated from CHO-SCF cell line as described</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Estrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">E8875</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Grid preparation</title><p>ER-HoxB8 cells were generated as described by Wang et. al.

The microscope was aligned using a cross-grating grid on the stage. Prior to each session, we carefully performed the Image/Beam calibration in nanoprobe. We set the magnification to a pixel size of 1.76 Å and condensed the beam to ~900 nm diameter, resulting in the beam being completely visible on the camera. To establish fringe-free conditions, the Fine eucentric procedure of SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>) was used to move a square of the cross-grating grid to the eucentric position of the microscope. The effective defocus was then set to 2 µm, using the autofocus routine of SerialEM. The objective focus of the microscope was changed until no fringes were visible. The stage was then moved in Z until images had an apparent defocus of 2 µm. The difference in stage Z-position between the eucentric and fringe-free conditions was used to move other areas into fringe-free condition.</p><p>Low magnification montages were used to find lamellae and lamellae that were sufficiently thin and free of contamination were selected for automated data collection. Overview images of each lamella were taken at ×2250 magnification (38 Å pixel size). The corners of the lamella in the overview image were manually annotated in SerialEM and translated into beam image-shift values using SerialEMs calibration. A hexagonal pattern of beam image-shift positions was calculated that covered the area between the four corners in a serpentine way, with a <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msqrt><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.95</mml:mn><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> horizontal spacing and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.95</mml:mn><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> vertical spacing, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the radius of the illuminated area. For the fringe-free focus condition <italic>r</italic> was 250 nm and for the eucentric focus <italic>r</italic> was 230 nm. This resulted in a fractional overlap of adjacent tiles of 10.3% for the fringe-free focus condition and 12.9% for the eucentric focus condition. Exposures were taken at each position with a 30 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> total dose. After each exposure, the defocus was estimated using the ctffind function of SerialEM and the focus for the next exposure was corrected by the difference between the estimated defocus and the desired defocus of 800 nm. Furthermore, after each exposure the deviation of the beam from the center of the camera was measured and corrected using the CenterBeamFromImage command of SerialEM.</p><p>After data collection, a 20 s exposure at ×2250 magnification of the lamella at 200 μm defocus was taken for visualization purposes.

To avoid influence of the beam-edge on motion-correction, only a quarter of the movie in the center of the camera was considered for calculation of the estimated motion. After movie frames were aligned and summed, a mask for the illuminated area was calculated by lowpass filtering the image with a 100 Å resolution cutoff, thresholding the image at 10% of the maximal value and then lowpass filtering the mask again with a 100 Å resolution cutoff to smooth the mask edges. This mask was then used to select dark areas in the image and fill the pixels with Gaussian noise, with the same mean and standard deviation as the illuminated area.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas G Laughlin (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors have developed a method aimed at characterizing particles found in wide-view image montages from cellular sections. While it might be seen as an incremental advance over their previous publication on template-matching, enabling users to be able to examine wide fields of view has importance and significance for addressing cell biological questions. There are several limitations to the present study, however, that should be addressed in a revised paper:</p><p>(1) They have only used the large ribosomal subunit for this study. They should discuss the MW of this object and the fact that it has a significant fraction of nucleic acid, increasing the contrast. They might speculate how the method would work for objects with lower MW and no nucleic acid content.</p><p>(2) While the method is proposed as a faster alternative to cryo-ET, the computational demands seem prohibitive. Can they speculate on how the method could be accelerated (and not just by adding more processors)? Given the computational bottleneck, can they provide recommendations to readers on when the presented approach is appropriate?</p><p>(3) The manuscript could potentially be improved by a more thorough explanation of the resolution regime to which the 2DTM signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values are most sensitive. When would one anticipate aberrations like a coma to become problematic?</p><p>(4) Fitting of particle defocus allows detection of the Z-height for each large ribosomal subunit. Could the authors estimate what is the precision of the detection of Z-height in their experiment and how it depends on the thickness of the lamella (˜150…250 nm in this case).</p><p>(5) How close to the top or the bottom end of the lamella can a ribosome subunit be detected? Can it be detected when it is partially milled away? Do the molecules in the &quot;middle&quot; of the lamella correspond to higher SNR?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript could potentially be improved by a more thorough explanation of the resolution regime to which the 2DTM signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values are most sensitive. When would one anticipate aberrations like a coma to become problematic?</p><p>Lines 156-158: How does the inclusion of the non-illuminated areas, even when filled with Gaussian noise, impact the estimate of the false-positive rate? Could this be the source of the apparent overestimation of the false-positive rate?</p><p>Ln 189: &quot;exclusively&quot;.</p><p>Lines 220-224: Are the authors able to incorporate the effect of coma in the 2DTM routine to see its effect on results or perform simulations on the effect coma has on the SNR values? When would one expect a coma to become limiting/negatively affect the SNR?

While it might be seen as an incremental advance over their previous publication on template-matching, enabling users to be able to examine wide fields of view has importance and significance for addressing cell biological questions. There are several limitations to the present study, however, that should be addressed in a revised paper:</p><p>(1) They have only used the large ribosomal subunit for this study. They should discuss the MW of this object and the fact that it has a significant fraction of nucleic acid, increasing the contrast. They might speculate how the method would work for objects with lower MW and no nucleic acid content.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a paragraph to the discussion (lines 295-300). The paragraph includes the MW of the template used to detect the large ribosomal subunit (2MDa) and the fraction of RNA. Regarding the amount of included nucleic acid, we refer to Spahn et al. Structure 2000 to discuss the possibility that nucleic acid contribute more the signal in cryo-EM micrographs compared to protein occupying the same volume. Regarding the question about objects with lower MW, we cite Rickgauer et.al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2017, which contains data regarding the MW of proteins that are expected to be detectable. We note that MW might not only be the only criterion that determines detectability, but that the conformational homogeneity and abundance within the cell also play important roles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) While the method is proposed as a faster alternative to cryo-ET, the computational demands seem prohibitive. Can they speculate on how the method could be accelerated (and not just by adding more processors)? Given the computational bottleneck, can they provide recommendations to readers on when the presented approach is appropriate?</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the paragraph in the discussion with speculation about approaches to accelerate 2DTM (lines 310-313). It is unclear to us whether cryo-ET of a similar sized area would be computationally more efficient, especially given the complex nature and rapid change in processing pipelines. We note that while 2DTM is computationally demanding, there are few steps and little user interaction is required. For the discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of 2DTM compared to cryo-ET we refer to Lucas et.al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2021.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The manuscript could potentially be improved by a more thorough explanation of the resolution regime to which the 2DTM signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values are most sensitive. When would one anticipate aberrations like a coma to become problematic?</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the discussion paragraph in lines 279-294 with an explanation of the expected resolution ranges compared with the expected coma aberrations as discussed in Cheng et.al. JSB 2018. In summary, we assume that the resolution range being used for 2DTM is lower than the resolution at which coma aberrations are expected to be problematic.

The median difference in the Z-direction between 2DTM and tomography was found to 59 A, roughly a third of the LSU diameter. While we have not yet sufficient data from 2DTM+tomography to perform such an analysis as a function of sample thickness, we note that Lucas et al. used samples with a thickness ranging from 80-220 nm, so we don’t expect uncertainties to be substantialy higher in our present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) How close to the top or the bottom end of the lamella can a ribosome subunit be detected? Can it be detected when it is partially milled away? Do the molecules in the &quot;middle&quot; of the lamella correspond to higher SNR?</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot detect edges of the lamella using a single exposure and therefore cannot directly measure the distance of a detection from the lamella edge. In order to address this question we have estimated the lamella thickness in every tile using the Beer-Lambert law as described in Rice et al., JSB 2018 and compared it to the range of ribosome detections in the beam direction. This analysis suggests that ribosomes are only detected in a slice that is ~70 nm thinner than the lamella, suggesting that we could not detect ribosome ~35nm from the lamella edge, potentially due to damage during the milling process. Our lab is currently performing a more through investigation of this phenomenon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript could potentially be improved by a more thorough explanation of the resolution regime to which the 2DTM signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values are most sensitive.

Instead we chose 1.5 Å initially since we were expecting information up to 3 Å to contribute to 2DTM and wanted to slightly lower the magnification compared to the ~ 1.0 Å pixelsize use previously, to reduce the number of tiles that have to be acquired. We then chose the first magnification at our Krios that was closest to 1.5 Å physical pixelsize and binned to 1.5 Å, with the idea that this would simplify combining data from different instruments, which we did not do in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure-4 supplement-1:</p><p>Panels D and E are not described in the legend.
