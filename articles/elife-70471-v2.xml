tumor margins. However, during one operation, multiple biopsies may be sent for examination, but only few of them are made into cryosections because of the complex preparation protocols and time-consuming pathological analysis, which potentially increases the risk of overlooking tumor involvement. Here, we propose a fluorescence-based pre-screening strategy that allows high-throughput, convenient, and fast gross assessment of resected tumor margins. A dual-activatable cationic fluorescent molecular rotor was developed to specifically illuminate live tumor cells’ cytoplasm by emitting two different fluorescence signals in response to elevations in hypoxia-induced nitroreductase (a biochemical marker) and cytoplasmic viscosity (a biophysical marker), two characteristics of cancer cells. The ability of the fluorescent molecular rotor in detecting tumor cells was evaluated in mouse and human specimens of multiple tissues by comparing with hematoxylin and eosin staining. Importantly, the fluorescent molecular rotor achieved 100 % specificity in discriminating lung and liver cancers from normal tissue, allowing pre-screening of the tumor-free surgical margins and promoting clinical decision. Altogether, this type of fluorescent molecular rotor and the proposed strategy may serve as a new option to facilitate intraoperative assessment of resected tumor margins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pre-screening strategy</kwd><kwd>fluorescent molecular rotor</kwd><kwd>dual-activatable</kwd><kwd>cytoplasmic viscosity</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFC1005002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Weijia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82070482 81772007 21734003 51927805</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Weijia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003395</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Municipal Education Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017-01-07-00-07-E00027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Weijia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017SHZDZX01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Weijia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A fluorescence-based pre-screening strategy allows high-throughput, convenient, and fast gross assessment of resected tumor margins by imaging cytoplasmic viscosity and hypoxia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During a tumor resection operation, a pathologist examines the removed tissues to determine whether the resected margins are clear of tumor involvement. The results should be immediately returned to the operating surgeon to guide further treatment such as extended resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marszalek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hinni et al., 2013</xref>). Over the past 30 years, the strategy of frozen section and microscopic examination has been the first-line intraoperative assessment of tumor margins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cendán et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Algaba et al., 2005</xref>). Despite its high specificity, frozen section-based pathological assessment is limited by inadequate sampling and complex protocols, which precludes comprehensive analysis of all biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Olson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Black et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">St John et al., 2017</xref>). Improvement of the current method or alternative options are required to provide an overall view of the resected tissue with simple and fast preparation.</p><p>Recently, fluorescence-guided imaging has emerged as a promising tool in cancer surgery, owing to its simple implementation, excellent selectivity and favorable biocompatibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vahrmeijer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hussain and Nguyen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hernot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Low et al., 2018</xref>). Targeting the tumor markers on the cell membrane, fluorescent probes have also been developed to assess the resected surgical margins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoogstins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">van Keulen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Voskuil et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, abnormal intracellular microenvironment has been characterized as a universal hallmark of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gillies and Gatenby, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hui and Chen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Catalano et al., 2013</xref>). Hypoxia, which is partly caused by exaggerated growth of tumor cells, can induce the overexpressions of biochemical endogenous reductases such as nitroreductase, azoreductase, quinone reductase, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and Wilson, 2004</xref>). From the biophysical viewpoint, a relatively higher cytoplasmic viscosity is another distinctive feature of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalwarczyk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Claus, 1942</xref>), where changes in viscosity of the mitochondrial matrix are reported to correlate with abnormality of mitochondrial respiration and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Singer and Nicolson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuimova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). To date, different types of fluorescent probes have been developed to visualize either intracellular hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>) or change in cytoplasmic viscosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuimova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hao et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ye et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wolstenholme et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>), which might be susceptible to fluctuations in the intracellular microenvironment. Given this, we postulate that an integrated evaluation of the biochemical (hypoxia) and biophysical (viscosity) features of tumor cells might enhance the accuracy of fluorescence-based assessment of surgical specimens.</p><p>Here, we reported the design, synthesis, and application of a dual-activatable fluorescent molecular rotor, IBS440. It consists of one pyridium derivative and one dimethylaniline group, both of which can intramolecularly rotate around the conjugate domain and cause non-radiative decay that quenches fluorescence emission. A higher viscosity of solution can restrict this intramolecular rotation and emit strong fluorescence signals in the 580–640 nm wavelength range. Meanwhile, the nitro group of IBS440 can be reduced in the presence of nitroreductase, a hypoxia-induced endogenous enzyme, thereby triggering elimination reaction to form a new compound termed IBS224 with fluorescence emission at 500–550 nm. Further, we evaluated the activability of this fluorescent molecular rotor in liquid solutions, live cells and tumor-bearing mice tissues in vivo and ex vivo. Tumor involvement in surgical specimens of four cancer types was assessed and compared between fluorescence and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of permanent sections. Finally, exploiting the 100 % specificity of this molecule in screening tumor-free tissues, we proposed a fluorescence-based strategy to pre-screen biopsies in a rapid, high-throughput manner, which may facilitate clinical decision.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design and synthesis of IBS440</title><p>First, we developed a dual-activatable fluorescent molecular rotor IBS440 to monitor the increased cytoplasmic viscosity and hypoxia-induced nitroreductase. Based on the principle of twisting intramolecular charge transfer, we designed a molecular rotor to monitor viscosity. The rotor showed a weak ﬂuorescence intensity in low-viscosity situation, which was ascribed to the free intramolecular rotation between pyridium derivative and dimethylaniline. With increasing viscosity, the intramolecular rotation was restricted, releasing a strong red fluorescence. Meanwhile, nitrobenzene was introduced into the chemical structure as an alternative to nitroreductase substrate, which interacted with nitroreductase under the existence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as electron donor; and then the nitro group of IBS440 was reduced to amine group triggering elimination reaction to obtain a new compound, named IBS224. Due to the mechanism of intramolecular charge transfer, a strong green fluorescence signal was emitted from IBS224. Chemical structures of IBS440 and IBS224 were characterized by <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, and HRMS spectra (see Appendix 1: the <sup>1</sup> H NMR, <sup>13</sup> C NMR, and HRMS spectra.).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Fluorescence emission and absorption profiles of IBS440</title><p>The fluorescence and Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectrums of IBS440 were measured to evaluate its photophysical features in response to viscosity and nitroreductase. Recombinant <italic>E. coli</italic> nitroreductase was expressed and purified as a fusion protein with a His tag. The protein molecular weight was 27 kD and its purity were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The fluorescence intensity of IBS440 in different ratios of ethanol and glycerol mixtures was investigated. With an increase in the proportion of glycerol, accompanied with an increased viscosity, the corresponding emission intensity of IBS440 was significantly enhanced compared with in pure ethanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). There was an approximately 18-fold enhancement of intensity from ethanol to glycerol. A good linear relationship existed between fluorescent intensity (lgI) and viscosity (lgη), with a correlation coefficient of 0.994 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating it enabled quantitative determination of viscosity. To test the recognition of nitroreductase, the spectral response of IBS440 to nitroreductase was assessed in reaction buffer with 500 μM NADPH as cofactor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Upon the addition of nitroreductase (0–9.0 μg/mL), the nitro group of IBS440 was reduced to amine group, thereby triggering an elimination reaction to produce a new compound IBS224. The blue-shifts in wavelength were observed in the UV-vis absorption spectra of IBS440 and IBS224 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity of IBS440 was found to be linearly proportional to nitroreductase concentration within the range 0–9.0 μg/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated using the equation of LOD = 3σ/k, wherein σ was the standard deviation, and k was the slope of the linear line. According to the linear correlation, k was determined to be 11166.424, and σ was set to 77.883, leading to a sensitive detection limit of 20.9 ng/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, IBS440 exhibited a strong fluorescence emission in glycerol, in contrast, it showed much weaker fluorescence in other solvents. To examine the nitroreductase selectivity of IBS440, its fluorescence intensity was measured upon addition of various biologically relevant cations.

These results illustrated that IBS440 was insensitive to the polarity of the solvents and highly selective to nitroreductase, suggesting it can be used to detect viscosity and nitroreductase changes in complex microenvironments.</p><p>In addition, as the pH across organelles varies, it is important that the fluorescence feature of IBS440 is not affected by pH variation. We measured the effects of pH (4.0–9.0) on the fluorescence of IBS440 in pure ethanol and 50 % glycerol-ethanol mixture as well as the fluorescence of IBS440 and IBS224 in reaction buffer. The emission values of IBS440 at 610 nm in ethanol and at 520 nm in reaction buffer had almost no change, while weak change of IBS440 in 50 % glycerol media over the range of pH 4.0–9.0 and optimum value of IBS224 in pH 7.0 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>), demonstrating that IBS440 was stable at the physiological pH conditions and may promote its application in biological systems. Notably, the fluorescence intensity at 610 nm was decreased about 0.6 % when IBS440 was exposed to 500 nm excitation laser for 10 min and decreased 2 % after 1 hr, showing good photostability of IBS440 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, these data exhibited the sensitivity and specificity of IBS440 respond to viscosity and hypoxia-induced nitroreductase in liquid solutions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Fluorescence localization of IBS440 in live cells and ex vivo tumor tissues</title><p>To explore the feasibility of applying IBS440 into live cell system, we first evaluated its cytotoxicity by a standard CCK8 assay in three different cell lines including MHCC97H, A549 and FaDu cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We incubated the cells with IBS440 at a gradient concentration from 5 μM to 50 μM for 12 hr or 24 hr. The cell viabilities were higher than 70 % even the concentration was increased to 50 μM and the incubation time was 24 hr. The following experimental concentration we chose was 5 μM considering that its cell viability was above 90 %. We then tested the subcellular localization of IBS440. Cells were co-stained with a commercially available green fluorescent mitochondrial dye (Mito-Tracker Green) and IBS440. The merged image of red channel was well overlaid with the green channel leading to colocalization coefficient (Pearson’s correlation) of 0.9363 for MHCC97H cells, 0.9386 for FaDu cells and 0.9257 for A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), implying that IBS440 mainly localized in mitochondria of live cells. To further measure the ability of IBS440 to illuminate tumor tissues, we incubated the fresh mice tumor slices with IBS440 and imaged on microscopic level. Freshly excised tissue represents the best in vivo situation for the determination of localization. Hoechst 33,342 is a specific dye for AT-rich regions of double-stranded DNA and suitable for DNA, chromosome and nuclear staining. We found that the red fluorescence of the molecule mainly occurred around the cell nuclear (blue fluorescence) in tumor slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating IBS440 enabled to light up tumor cells in fresh tumor tissues.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Fluorescence localization of IBS440 in live cells and ex vivo tumor tissues.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The cells were treated with IBS440 (5 μM) for 20 min and then stained with Hoechst 33,342 (1x) and Mito Tracker Green (10 μM) for 10 min.

On other hand, it has been well known that hypoxia and nitroreductase induced by hypoxia are recognized as characteristics of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and Wilson, 2004</xref>). Promisingly, the abnormal intracellular changes in viscosity and nitroreductase in tumor cells could be exploited as biomarkers for evaluation of the resected margins of multiple distinct tumors. In this study, we developed a new dual-activatable fluorescent molecular rotor IBS440 enabling visualization of cytoplasmic viscosity and hypoxia of live cells in ex vivo tissues, which, in a rapid and high-throughput manner, distinguishes between tumor and normal tissue in unsectioned surgical specimens.</p><p>Fluorescence imaging has been recognized advantageous and clinically exploited to visualize tumor tissues during image-guided open and endoscopic surgery, and pathological assessment, based on the recognition of tumor-specific markers. Abnormal intracellular microenvironment has been described as characteristic of cancer cells for decades, including biophysical and biochemical aspects. Thus, we utilized the abnormal increases in biophysical cytoplasmic viscosity and biochemical endogenous nitroreductase of cancer cells, as two different reactive sites to design our dual-activatable fluorescent rotor. This molecule emits two non-interfering ﬂuorescence signals by activating two different modes, one specifically responses to higher viscosity (emitting red fluorescence) and the other to abundant nitroreductase (emitting green fluorescence). We demonstrated its availability to discriminate tumor-involved margins in surgical specimens of four cancer types including lung, renal, hepatocellular, and oral carcinoma. As a result, the increases in cytoplasmic viscosity and hypoxia of cancer cells were imaged by this dual-activatable fluorescent molecular rotor, indicating its potential feasibility to be used in pre-screening multiple resected tumor margins.</p><p>During or after surgery, pathologists rapidly diagnose a few of tissue samples of one patient and immediately convey the results to surgeons while the patient is still in the operating room; and prioritizing specimens for pathological analysis exclusively relies on visual inspection and palpation of the fresh specimen by the surgeons and pathologists, for example color, texture, consistency, nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hinni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In practice, it is impractical to implement the thorough frozen-section of the entire specimens and complete microscopic examination on every tissue slice, constrained by limited resource. Sometimes, tumor-involved margins may not be included in the prioritized section blocks, thus causing an inadequate sampling and examination. Therefore, we propose a strategy to pre-screen and prioritize the specimens with integral fluorescence visualization, which might optimize current intraoperative pathological procedures and minimize inadequate sampling. As described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, immediately after resection, all sampled specimens are trimmed and simultaneously incubated in a phosphate buffer saline solution of fluorescent molecule. Afterwards, tissues are directly imaged and reviewed on a back-table instrument. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> (i), a negative result, which is characterized by low fluorescence intensity of all specimens, can be rapidly conveyed to the operating surgeon to close the surgery case. If any specimens display high fluorescence, they are considered as suspiciously positive ones and prioritized for further review (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> (ii)). The fluorescence signal can be visualized by many types of commercial imaging instruments, such as a multifunctional laser scanner as well as a small animal in vivo imaging machine, which can rapidly screen as many as tens and hundreds of tissue fragments at one time. Even an automated high-content fluorescence or confocal fluorescence microscopy can be used upon request, which provides a very high sensitivity and more detailed intracellular information for in-depth assessment. Hopefully, this strategy may reduce the waiting time for intraoperative pathological assessment, thereby shortening operation time, promoting patient recovery, and reducing pathologists’ workload.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic presentation of intraoperative pathological assessment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The current strategy used during a tumor operation. Based on surgeon’s gross examination, multiple resected tissues are prioritized for frozen-section analysis. Occasionally, an extended resection is indicated with positive feedback to avoid unnecessary re-operations. In principle, frozen section analysis takes minimally 30 min to 1 hr; while in practice, such procedure requires more time to complete due to a large number of samples received in overloaded pathological laboratories.

First, the fluorescence threshold was slightly different among different types of cancer in this study, this might arise from the differences of organ and cancer types, as well as the sampling numbers. It’s worth noting that the fluorescence intensity is highly instrument-specific. Different imaging instruments (cameras) have their different sensitivities. Thus, the threshold is also dependent on the specific instrument and the setting of measuring parameters, calling for further clinical trials on other commercial imaging instruments. Second, the molecule IBS440 is a demonstrative probe, while the performance is still on demand to be improved for potential clinical applications, such as the higher fluorescence sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuimova et al., 2009</xref>) and redshift toward longer wavelength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vahrmeijer et al., 2013</xref>). The future efforts of chemical biologists could be exerted on the invention of more fluorescent molecules with modified fluorescence features.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Elution buffer was exchanged to storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 8.0, 10 % glycerol (v/v)). Protein concentration was determined by using BCA protein assay kit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescence and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy</title><p>The solutions for viscosity were prepared by mixing EtOH and glycerol in different proportions. The solutions of IBS440 in different viscosities were prepared by adding the stock solution of IBS440 (1 mM, 50 μL) to EtOH-glycerol mix solution (5 mL) to obtain the final concentration of IBS440 (10 μM). These solutions were sonicated for 30 min to eliminate air bubbles. Then, the fluorescence spectra were recorded at excitation of 500 nm with both the excitation and emission slit widths set at 1 nm. The relationship between the fluorescence emission intensity of IBS440 and the viscosity of the solvent was well expressed by the Forster-Hoffmann equation: log(I<sub>f</sub>) = c + x log η, where I<sub>f</sub> was the fluorescence intensity, η was the viscosity of solution, x and c were constant.</p><p>In a reaction buffer solution (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), IBS440 and NADPH at a final working concentration of 10 μM and 500 μM were added. The stock solution of IBS440 was 1 mM in DMSO and NADPH was 5 mM in NaOH (50 mM) solution, respectively. Then, nitroreductase with different concentration was added and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. After that, the mixture was incubated at 80 °C for 5 min to inactivate the enzymes and added with DMSO to increase the solubility of IBS224. Fluorescence spectra were recorded at the excitation wavelength of 400 nm with both the excitation and emission slit widths set at 1 nm. Absorption spectra of IBS440 (10 μM), IBS440 (10 μM)+ NADPH (500 μM)+ NTR (9 μg/mL), IBS224 (10 μM) in reaction buffer, containing 20 % DMSO as a co-solvent were recorded, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cytotoxicity assay</title><p>Cell suspension was seeded in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h (at 37 °C, 5 % CO<sub>2</sub>). IBS440 and IBS224 of different concentrations (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 μM) were added to the culture plate and incubate for 12 hr and 24 hr. Then the cells were replaced with fresh medium, added with 10 μL CCK8 solution and incubated for 45 min, the absorbance of each plate at 450 nm was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cellular imaging</title><p>Three cell lines including MHCC97H cells, FaDu cells and A549 cells were used for cell imaging experiment. To determine the cellular colocalization of IBS440, the cells were treated with IBS440 for 30 min and further stained with 1 μM Mito-Tracker Green for 15 min. The signal of Mito-Tracker Green was collected in a range of 500–550 nm using 488 nm laser. To detect intracellular nitroreductase, cells were grown at 37 °C under normoxic conditions (20 % O<sub>2</sub>) for 12 hr after being seeded into confocal dishes. Then cells were devided into two groups and incubated under normoxia and hypoxia conditions (2 % O<sub>2</sub>) for another 12 hr, respectively. After that, the cell medium was then replaced with 5 μM IBS440 in DMEM media and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The cells were washed with PBS twice to remove the free IBS440. All cell images were obtained with excitation at 405 nm and emission in a range of 480–530 nm. Hoechst 33,342 (blue channel) was also used to stain the cell nuclei to improve image visualization.</p><p>To detect cellular viscosity, the cancerous cells (MHCC97H, A549 and FaDu) and noncancerous cells (RAW264.7, A7r5) were stained with IBS440 (5 μM) for 20 min, then the cells were washed with PBS twice to remove the free IBS440 and taken confocal fluorescence image. The viscosity detection channel was obtained with excitation at 488 nm and emission in a range of 580–630 nm. Hoechst 33,342 fluorescence was collected with excitation at 405 nm and emission at 430–480 nm.</p><p>To test the uptake of Mito-Tracker Green in different cells, the cancerous cells (MHCC97H, A549 and FaDu) and noncancerous cells (RAW264.7, A7r5) were incubated with a commercial lipophilic mitochondrial dye Mito-Tracker Green (1 μM) for 20 min, then the cells were washed with PBS twice and taken image.

The data are well presented, but the manuscript needs more details of clinical application, more clinical cases added for the same type of cancer, and standardization of BLI thresholds for the same type of cancer to ensure the stability of experimental results, and if not, the reasons should be explained.</p><p>Considering that pathological diagnosis is the gold standard for cancer diagnosis, relying solely on fluorescence-negative results cannot replace traditional pathological diagnosis, the authors should discuss the clinical application process of IBS440 in detail.</p><p>1. The experimental methodology should clearly clarify the incubation time and conditions, the catalog number and manufacturer of the filming equipment, including cytology, in vivo, and ex vivo tumors, as well as the catalog number and manufacturer of the reagents, and the source of the cells.

In this manuscript, the probe IBS400 in tumors demonstrates apparently stronger fluorescence signals of two spectral regions, than those in normal tissues, which qualifies it as a practical probe.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70471.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The BLI threshold determined across different cancer types is required for detailed research and analysis, so as the consistency between the same cancer type.</p></disp-quote><p>To address editors’ and reviewers’ concerns, we reconsidered the threshold issue and analyzed more sample tissues derived from 21 individual patients. All samples were divided into training datasets and test datasets for determining the thresholds.</p><p>Taking hepatocellular cancer as an example, we used 9 pairs of cancerous/noncancerous tissues derived from 9 individual patients as a training dataset. As shown in Figure 4, the centroid of the signal intensities (gray-scales of images), computed by K-means clustering algorithm, were determined as the threshold. According to the threshold point, any sample would be located into 1 of the 3 divided groups:</p><p>i. The definitely positive (++) group showing two HIGH intensities in both x AND y axis;</p><p>ii. The suspiciously positive (+) group showing a high intensity in x OR y axis;</p><p>iii. The negative (-) group showing two LOW intensities in both x AND y axis.</p><p>In the test dataset, 35 pieces of random resection margin tissues derived from one patient were categorized in three groups respectively, as shown in Figure 6.</p><p>The same validation of training-and-test model was done on the lung cancer samples (Figure 5 and Figure 7). In the cases of oral and renal cancers, due to the small tumor volume and insufficient sampling numbers, we only included training datasets but not test datasets (Supplementary file 5a and 5b). The calculated thresholds of fluorescence intensity were slightly different (&lt;1% in grayscale, as show in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Supplementary file 5c and Supplementary file 5d) across different cancer types. This might arise from the differences of organ and cancer types, as well as the sampling numbers.</p><p>It's worth noting that the fluorescence intensity is highly instrument-specific. Different imaging instruments (cameras) have their different sensitivities. Thus, the threshold is also dependent on the specific instrument and the setting of measuring parameters. The above statement is added in the discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><p>In the revised manuscript:</p><p>1. We added new sample analyses and re-arranged Figure 4, Figure 5. The original Figure 5 and Figure 6 was re-arranged as Figure 6 and Figure 7.</p><p>2. We revised the “Ex vivo imaging of patients’ resected tumor specimens” part in the Results section<italic>,</italic> Page 12, Line 325-360:</p><p>“The primary aim of our study was to provide assessments of tumor-involved margins in surgical specimens, thus we measured four types of patients’ resected specimens including hepatocellular cancer, lung cancer, oral cancer and renal cancer. […] There was no test dataset of oral and renal cancer samples due to the small tumor volume and insufficient sampling numbers.”</p><p>We discussed the limitation in the Discussion section, Page 18, Line 486-496:</p><p>“This study has a few limitations. First, the fluorescence threshold was slightly different among different types of cancer in this study, this might arise from the differences of organ and cancer types, as well as the sampling numbers. […] The future efforts of chemical biologists could be exerted on the invention of more fluorescent molecules with modified fluorescence features.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is necessary to demonstrate briefly the cause for difference in fluorescent intensity between normal and malignant cells, and exclude other factors contributing to this difference.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify it, we performed more cell and tissue testing and compared the fluorescence of cancerous <italic>vs.</italic> noncancerous cells and tumor <italic>vs.</italic> nontumor tissues, incubated with IBS440, or, a commercial mitochondrial dye Mito-Tracker Green, which is the same kind of lipophilic molecules to target mitochondria.</p><p>(1) To demonstrate the different fluorescence intensity between cancerous and noncancerous cells in viscosity detection channel, we performed the fluorescence imaging with IBS440. We added a new paragraph “Fluorescence imaging of viscosity in live cells” in Results section, Page 8, Line 241-252:</p><p>“We further studied the fluorescence of IBS440 in viscosity detection channel of cancerous and noncancerous cells. MHCC97H, A549, FaDu, RAW264.7 and A7r5 cells were chosen for fluorescence imaging by confocal microscopy. As shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 6, the cancerous cells (MHCC97H, A549 and FaDu) and noncancerous cells (RAW264.7, A7r5) were stained with IBS440, the fluorescence intensity of the cancerous cells was stronger than that of the noncancerous cells. Specifically, the normal tissues of mice (including heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, muscle, fat and brain) and MHCC97H tumor tissue were treated with IBS440, respectively. In comparison with the dim fluorescence signals from normal tissues, the tumor tissue exhibited significantly enhanced fluorescence (Figure 2—figure supplement 7), implying the increased viscosity of tumor tissue.”</p><p>(2) To exclude other factors that might affect the fluorescence intensity, such as cellular uptake capacity, we performed the imaging experiment of cells and tissues with a fluorescent dye Mito-Tracker Green. The commercial lipophilic mitochondrial dye Mito-Tracker Green and our IBS440 have the same mechanism of cellular uptake and mitochondrial targeting. We added a new paragraph “Fluorescence imaging of Mito-Tracker Green in live cells and tissues” in Results section, Page 7, Line 216-228:</p><p>“Fluorescent small molecules are effectively used in imaging fields because of simple synthesis, high sensitivity and noninvasiveness. Because of their lipophilicity and small molecular weight, the way that they enter cells mainly depends on passive diffusion, which is one of the most common and important transportation methods in lipophilic molecule transportation (Bressloff and Newby, 2013). As shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, the cancerous cells (MHCC97H, A549 and FaDu) and noncancerous cells (RAW264.7, A7r5) were incubated with a commercial lipophilic mitochondrial dye Mito-Tracker Green, the result shows the fluorescence intensity in these cells have no significant difference. As shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3, hepatocellular cancer and normal tissues were incubated with Mito-Tracker Green, and there was also no significant difference in fluorescence intensity. These results showed that the uptake of lipophilic small molecules by cancerous cells and noncancerous cells is at the very similar level.”</p><p>(3) We added some other pioneering works on viscosity probes to demonstrate the higher intracellular viscosity in tumor cells than normal cells in Discussion section, Page 17, Line 434-436:</p><p>“As early as in 1940s, a study found that the cytoplasm of tumor cells became more viscous than normal cells (P.E.Claus, 1942), followed by many researches validating its high viscosity (Yang et al., 2014, Ren et al., 2020, Song et al., 2021, Zhou et al., 2021).”</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Ren M, Xu Q, Wang S, Liu L, and Kong F. 2020.
