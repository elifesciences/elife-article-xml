(ROS) is a ubiquitous defense response in plants. Adapted pathogens evolved mechanisms to counteract the deleterious effects of host-derived ROS and promote infection. How plant pathogens regulate this elaborate response against ROS burst remains unclear. Using the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, we uncovered a self-balancing circuit controlling response to ROS in planta and virulence. During infection, ROS induces phosphorylation of the high osmolarity glycerol pathway kinase MoOsm1 and its nuclear translocation. There, MoOsm1 phosphorylates transcription factor MoAtf1 and dissociates MoAtf1-MoTup1 complex. This releases MoTup1-mediated transcriptional repression on oxidoreduction-pathway genes and activates the transcription of MoPtp1/2 protein phosphatases. In turn, MoPtp1/2 dephosphorylate MoOsm1, restoring the circuit to its initial state. Balanced interactions among proteins centered on MoOsm1 provide a means to counter host-derived ROS. Our findings thereby reveal new insights into how <italic>M. oryzae</italic> utilizes a phosphor-regulatory circuitry to face plant immunity during infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>M. oryzae</kwd><kwd>pathogenicity</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31972979</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xinyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mobility program of NSFC and DFG</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31861133017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhengguang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31671979</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Xiaobo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>InnovationTeam Program for NSFC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhengguang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A phosphorylation circuitry balancing among kinase, transcription factor, transcription repressor, and phosphatase in response against host immunity during <italic>M. oryzae</italic>ârice interaction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During co-evolution with pathogens, plants have developed an innate immune system by sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as flagellin and chitin produced, respectively, by bacteria and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Upon recognition, pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) transduce the signals to the downstream components that initiate the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boutrot and Zipfel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zipfel, 2014</xref>), which was referred to as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boutrot and Zipfel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>). This PRR to PTI processes often involves components of MAP kinase signaling pathways, callose deposition, ROS burst, and pathogenesis related (PR) gene expression.</p><p>The NADPH oxidase-mediated production of ROS is one of the earliest PTI responses restricting pathogen invasion. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, phosphorylated BIK1 activates the NADPH oxidase RBOHD through protein phosphorylation to trigger ROS burst. In rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>), the LysM domain of the chitin-elicitor binding protein (CEBiP) binds to chitin and associates with the bifunctional plant receptor OsCERK1 that phosphorylates the downstream receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase 185 (OsRLCK185) for the activation of PTI by causing the ROS burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, Rac1, the Rac/ROP small G-protein, which interacts with a defense-related NADPH oxidase RbohB that response to chitin elicitor for ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nagano et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>During host infection, pathogens secrete numerous antimicrobial proteins, including superoxide dismutase, catalases, and peroxidases, to evade host immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kawasaki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lanfranco et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Molina and Kahmann, 2007</xref>). In the corn smut fungus <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>, the Protein Essential During Penetration 1 (Pep1) protein directly interferes with ROS generation by inhibiting peroxidase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hemetsberger et al., 2012</xref>). In the tomato leaf mold fungus <italic>Cladosporium fulvum</italic>, the LysM domain-containing Effector Extracellular Protein 6 (Ecp6) circumvents chitin-induced immunity by sequestering host chitin oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Jonge et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, <italic>M. oryzae</italic> secreted LysM Protein 1 (MoSlp1) competes with OsCEBiP for chitin binding, thereby preventing the activation of rice PTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mentlak et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, the rice tetratricopeptide repeat protein OsTPR1 was shown to interact with <italic>M. oryzae</italic> chitinase MoChia1 in the apoplast. In addition, the competitive binding of OsTPR1 by MoChia1 allows the accumulation of free chitin to reestablish the host immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p><italic>M. oryzae</italic> causes rice blast and is also a hemibiotrophic fungus in need of host nutrients for propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson and Talbot, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). How <italic>M. oryzae</italic> response to host-derived signals to circumvent plant immunity during infection remain a much-debated question. In <italic>M. oryzae</italic> and other fungal pathogens, G-protein/cAMP signaling plays an important role in the perception of host surface cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi and Dean, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). The non-canonical G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) Pth11 that functions upstream of G-protein/cAMP signaling is also important for surface perception in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeZwaan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kou et al., 2017</xref>). A previous study identified that the sensor kinase protein MoSln1 functions to sense glycerol and facilitates host penetration of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ryder et al., 2019</xref>). In spite of any ROS receptor remaining to be identified, <italic>M. oryzae</italic> is known to contain several conserved MAP kinase pathways, including MoMst11-MoMst7-MoPmk1, MoMck1-MoMkk1-MoMps1, and MoSsk2-MoPbs2-MoOsm1 in conferring signal transduction during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Among them, the Hog1 homolog, MoOsm1, which mediated the osmoregulation pathway is essential for the response to hyperosmotic stress through transcription factor MoMsn2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dixon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Additional studies also found that the osmoregulation pathway is important for the response to oxidative species and resistance to fungicides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated that the bZIP transcription factor MoAp1 is important in response to oxidative stress by activating a suite of antioxidant genes during ROS stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2011</xref>), and MoAtf1 is also important in response to hyperosmotic stress and ROS stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2010</xref>). The Î<italic>Moatf1</italic> mutant was hypersensitive to oxidative stress, exhibited the reduced expression of several extracellular peroxidase and laccase genes, and failed to suppress the accumulation of ROS around the infection sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2010</xref>). To understand how <italic>M. oryzae</italic> responds to the ROS-mediated stress and triggered the downstream signaling pathway for ROS tolerance, we sought upstream to identify kinase which regulates MoAtf1 in response to ROS stress. We found that host-derived ROS induces the MoOsm1-mediated MAPK pathway to activate MoAtf1 phosphorylation. In addition, we identified phosphorylated MoAtf1 initiates the transcription of <italic>MoPTP1/MoPTP2</italic> under ROS stress which function on the dephosphorylation of MoOsm1. The process of MoOsm1/MoPtps-mediated phosphor-regulatory feedback loop function as a switch which not only enhanced virulence of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> under ROS stress but also control the virulence that keep the rice cells alive during hemibiotrophic growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>M. oryzae</italic> infection induces ROS accumulation in rice</title><p>During <italic>M. oryzae</italic> infection, the pathogen and rice interaction results in either disease or host immunity. In infection of rice cultivar LTH by <italic>M. oryzae</italic> wild-type strain Guy11, the sequences of various developmental stages are as follows: primary hyphae to appressorium differentiation (&lt;20 hpi), the penetration of epidermis (20 hpi), formation of the bulbous infection hyphae (IH) inside the host cell (24 hpi), and spreading into the neighboring cells (36 hpi) for further infection (48â72 hpi). In a moderate resistance cultivar-strain interaction, such as between K23 and Guy11, few and restricted lesions were present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yin et al., 2020</xref>). The hyphae grew poorly in the leaf-sheath cells (24 and 36 hpi) and were restricted to the primary infected cells at 48 hpi until eventual spreading into adjacent cells (60 and 72 hpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Time-course images of ROS accumulation during rice sheath infection by <italic>M.Â oryzae</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The conidial suspension of Guy11 (1 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> spores/ml) was inoculated in the excised rice sheath of 4-weeks-old rice seedlings LTH and K23.

Rice cultivar K23 infected with Guy11 yielded reddish-brown precipitates around the appressoria and infected hypha at 24, 36, 48, and 60 hpi. Over 40% of the infected cells were stained brown at 24 hpi and/or 36 hpi. When observation was made at 60 hpi, nearly 10% of infected cells were still filled with ROS. In contrast, the accumulation of ROS was barely detectable in the susceptible LTH cultivar infected by Guy11. The rate of cells stained with DAB was no more than 20% at 24, 36, and 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). These results indicated that rice elaborates ROS as a barrier to infection as early as 24 hpi, and scavenging of host ROS may be necessary for further expansion of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> during infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MoOsm1 phosphorylation in response to oxidative stress</title><p>MoOsm1 is an essential component of the osmoregulation pathway, and a previous study indicated that the deletion of the <italic>MoOSM1</italic> gene resulted in hypersensitivity to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dixon et al., 1999</xref>). To understand this MoOsm1-mediated ROS response, we constructed the strain expressing MoOsm1-GFP, in which the expression of the C-terminal GFP fusion protein is under the control of the native <italic>MoOSM1</italic> promoter, and we tested phosphorylation of MoOsm1 using rice seedlings of both compatible pair (Guy11 and LTH) and the relative resistance pair (K23 and LTH). Total proteins were extracted at 0, 8,Â 20,Â 24, 48, and 72 hpi and the proteins bound to the anti-GFP beads were eluted and analyzed by anti-p38 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cst-c.com.cn/products/primary-antibodies/phospho-p38-mapk-thr180-tyr182-28b10-mouse-mab/9216?site-search-type=Products">MAPK</ext-link> (Figureure 2A and 2B).

Given the time of 24 and 48 hpi correlates with ROS levels, we speculated that ROS burst might have a role in MoOsm1 phosphorylation. When K23 was treated with 0.5 Î¼M diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) that inhibits the activity of plant NADPH oxidases and thereby ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bolwell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grant et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), MoOsm1 phosphorylation was significantly reduced at 24 hpi and 36 hpi (Figureure 2C). OsRbohA, an important NADPH oxidase, is critical for the ROS generation in rice, and OsRbohA-overexpressing transgenic plants exhibited higher ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). To further understand the function of MoOsm1 in response to host-produced ROS, we detected the phosphorylation level of MoOsm1 on the OsRbohA-ox line during the infection. The results showed that the phosphorylation of MoOsm1 was induced in the OsRbohA-ox line compared with the NPB lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To confirm that ROS levels were correlated with MoOsm1 phosphorylation, an in vitro assay was carried out, showing a similar result.

Meanwhile, pathogens secrete numerous extracellular proteins into the plant to circumvent host immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doehlemann and Hemetsberger, 2013</xref>). Previous studies have identified several effector proteins, including those involved in oxidation-related functions; however, how these factors initiate their function to counter host immunity remains not fully understood. In this study, we discovered that MoOsm1 phosphorylates MoAtf1 that in turn dissociates from MoTup1 to regulate oxidation stress response pathways. We further revealed that phosphorylated MoAtf1 promotes the expression of MoPtp1/2 that could dephosphorylate MoOsm1, completing a feedback loop that controls the virulence of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. Our results demonstrated MoOsm1-MoPtps-mediated feedback loop represents a previously unknown mechanism that balances the response to ROS stress and the hemibiotrophic growth of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>.</p><p>For the pathogen, ROS seems like a double-edged sword. During appressorial penetration, <italic>M. oryzae</italic> accumulates high levels of endogenous ROS to strengthen the appressorium cell wall. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Egan et al., 2007</xref>). Here, ROS accumulation is regulated by two fungal NADPH oxidases, which themselves are important for appressorium-mediated cuticle penetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dagdas et al., 2012</xref>). However, ROS is also one of the earliest responses by plants to microbial colonization and function a potent defense mechanism that limits fungal biotrophic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Torres, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Torres et al., 2006</xref>). Rboh, which encodes NADPH oxidase, plays a key role in generating ROS upon pathogen challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wong et al., 2007</xref>). Among them, both OsrbohA and OsrbohB are important for the production of ROS when rice are subjected to stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wong et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, during <italic>M.oryzae</italic> infection, <italic>OsRBOHA</italic> and <italic>OsRBOHB</italic> were significantly induced in WT plants at 24 hpi, but decreased afterward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). As the oxidative burst reaction occurs rapidly, how can the pathogen quickly respond to this stress? In <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, the MoOsm1-mediated osmoregulation pathway is essential for responding to oxidative stress, in addition to the previously demonstrated hyperosmotic stress. The deletion of <italic>MoOSM1</italic> was shown to result in high sensitivity to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dixon et al., 1999</xref>). We here showed that MoOsm1 phosphorylation also increases during the early stage of infection. Given that ROS burst is one of the earliest PTI responses during infection, ROS burst may activate osmoregulation MAPK signaling through MoOsm1 phosphorylation. Intriguingly, oxidative stress was also found to result in MoOsm1 cytoplasm to nucleus translocation.</p><p>How MoOsm1 translocated into the nucleus in response to oxidative stress? Previous studies showed that the dephosphorylation of MoHat1 led to its interaction with MoSsb1, causing a nucleus to cytoplasm translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yin et al., 2019</xref>). Studies also showed that MoAp1 accumulated in the nucleus under oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Ap1 protein forms disulfide bonds that dampen the recognition of the nuclear export protein Crm1, leading to its accumulation in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuge et al., 2001</xref>) which prompted us to suggest a relevance between MoAtf1 phosphorylation and its nuclear localization. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> regulatory protein NPR1 is involved in salicylic acid (SA)-mediated defense response in which SA triggers cytoplasmic NPR1 oligomer release that is required for its nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mou et al., 2003</xref>). The SNF1-related protein kinase SnRK2.8 phosphorylate NPR1 prior to its nuclear trans-localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the nitric oxide-induced S-nitrosoglutathione also causes NPR1 nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lindermayr et al., 2010</xref>). Given these findings, we hypothesized and demonstrated that (1) phosphorylation of MoOsm1 inhibits the recognition of the nuclear export proteins causing its retention in the nucleus; (2) MoOsm1 forms homodimers in the cytoplasm, but MoOsm1 oligomers are released and imported into the nucleus when MoOsm1 was phosphorylated. We also showed that MoOsm1 forms homodimers that disintegrate upon phosphorylation of Y173 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3DâF</xref>). Further combined with the results that protein dimerization occurs only in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) and MoOsm1 phosphorylation on Y173 leads to monomerization and nuclear localization, we thus considered that phosphorylation happening prior to nuclear import instead of the misrecognition of phosphorylated MoOsm1 in the nucleus that caused the nuclear accumulation of MoOsm1. Collectively, we concluded that the monomerization of MoOsm1 is important for its nuclear accumulation and Y173 phosphorylation is important for monomerization. Given the evidence indicating that the nuclear localization of MoOsm1 was more stable in the Î<italic>Moptps</italic> mutant than Guy11 under ROS stress, it is plausibly that MoPtps function in the recycling of MoOsm1 to the cytoplasm. MoOsm1 recycling may have two benefits: (1) shutdown of phosphorylated MoOsm1 mediates signaling pathways that switch off virulence attack. (2) recycled MoOsm1 in the cytoplasm might respond quickly to external stress as there is no need for protein re-synthesing.</p><p>MoOsm1 co-localizes with and activates the transcription factor MoAtf1 through protein phosphorylation in the nucleus. MoAtf1 is one of the bZIP transcription factors control gene expression during plant infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Proft et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we found that MoAtf1 positively regulates genes involved in oxidation response pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). During infection, the expression of the oxidation responsive genes was significantly upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This led us to identify MoTup1 as one of the proteins interacting with MoAtf1. MoTup1 was recently characterized in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, and its deletion caused decreased pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). This study, together with those of other model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MalavÃ© and Dent, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith and Johnson, 2000</xref>), suggests that Tup1 proteins do not bind directly to DNA but rather are brought to the promoters <italic>via</italic> interactions with sequence-specific regulatory proteins. We speculate that MoAtf1 recruits MoTup1 to repress transcription. Once MoAtf1 phosphorylates and no longer binds with MoTup1, MoAtf1 up-regulates or initiates the transcription of target genes, including those involved in oxidation regulated pathways.</p><p>During the interaction between <italic>M. oryzae</italic> and the host, the host induces ROS burst during the biotrophic growth stage of the fungus. Under ROS stress, the pathogen activates MoOsm1-mediated pathways that in turn activates the transcription factor MoAtf1. The phosphorylation of MoAtf1 causes the disintegration of the MoAtf1-MoTup1 complex to induce the expression of oxidation regulation pathway genes to further enhance virulence of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. Phosphorylated MoAtf1 also initiates the transcription of the <italic>MoPTP1/2</italic> genes to further dephosphorylate MoOsm1. Once the ROS stress was circumvented, such as that at the necrotrophic growth stage, MoPtps- mediated dephosphorylation of MoOsm1 shut off phosphor-regulatory circuitry to control the virulence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>A proposed model depicting MoOsm1/MoAtf1/MoTup1/MoPtp1/2 mediated ROS signaling and responses to host immunity.</title><p>Rice generates immunity, including ROS burst during its interaction with <italic>M. oryzae</italic>.

The eluants were precipitated by ethanol after washing and digested with proteinase K, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 (Genergy Bio, Shanghai, China). The accession number for RNA-seq data reported in this paper is GSE144389 in GEO datasets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Mass spectrometric analysis</title><p>Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE To identify phosphorylation sites. The gel bands corresponding to the targeted protein were excised, reduced with 10 mM of DTT and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide. In-gel digestion (or elution digestion) was carried out with the trypsin (Promega, V5113), GLU-C (Wako, 050â05941), or chymotrypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, C6423) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 37Â°C overnight. The peptides were extracted using ultrasonic processing with 50% acetonitrile aqueous solution for 5 min and with 100% acetonitrile for 5 min. The extractions were reduced in the volume by centrifugation. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCâMS) system consisting of a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nano-LC system (nano UHPLC, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), connected to a linear quadrupole ion trap Orbitrap (LTQ Orbitrap XL) mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron, Bremen, Germany) and equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source, was used for our analysis. For LC separation, an Acclaim PepMap 100 column (C18.3 Î¼m, 100 Ã) (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) capillary with a 15 cm bed length was used with a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Two solvents, A (0.1% formic acid) and B (aqueous 90% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid), were used to elute the peptides from the nanocolumn. The gradient ranged from 5% to 40% B in 80 min and from 40% to 95% B in 5 min, with a total run time of 120 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode to automatically switch between Orbitrap-MS and LTQ-MS/MS acquisition. Survey full-scan MS spectra (from m/z 350 to 1800) were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution rÂ =Â 60,000 at m/z 400, allowing the sequential isolation of the top ten ions, depending on signal intensity. The linear ion trap fragmentation used collision-induced dissociation at a collision energy of 35 V. Protein identification and database construction were processed using Proteome Discoverer software (1.2 version, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with the SEQUEST model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) assays</title><p>The GST-MoAtf1 protein was expressed and purified from <italic>E.Â coli</italic> strain BL21 using the pGEX4T-2 construct.

response in plants. How adapted pathogens overcome this defense response is a fascinating question given that maintaining an appropriate redox balance is critical for pathogen survival throughout infection. Through an extensive set of molecular biology and genetics experiments on the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, this study uncovers a complete regulatory loop balancing the fungal response to ROS. A cascade of reversible phosphorylation reactions and protein complexes remodeling enable a dynamic response to the redox environment, each step of which contributes to the successful colonization of rice plants by this pathogen.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

In some cases, important controls are missing or assumptions are made without justification.

This could represent a major advance but substantial revision would be necessary for this to be so. Overall, I felt that evidence was largely correlative rather than causative, conclusions often drawn from what appear to be rather minor differences, and that due-diligence has not been performed for a lot of experiments. This article needs to be revised by an English copy-editor, as the vast number of grammatical errors makes the article difficult to follow. A lot of information is missing from experimental design as described in the text and in figure legends. P-values are mentioned in figure legends but the statistical test is not described.</p><p>The Introduction and Discussion are difficult to follow, as many concepts are inadequately described or synthesized.</p><p>Are ROS mutants (rbohd or similar) available in the rice cultivars that can be used to validate the conclusion that it is host-derived ROS being detected by the fungus?</p><p>Has it been demonstrated that anti-pp38 and anti-p38 are able to recognize MoOSM1? If so please cite. If not, please demonstrate.</p><p>Enhanced phosphorylation in Figure 2A is not clear. Perhaps the authors can provide quantification from multiple blots.</p><p>Quantification of nuclear:cytoplasmic OsmI1 in Figure 2C-E, and later in Figure 3 is not overly convincing to me. The biological relevance of this sub-cellular movement should be assessed using NES and/or NLS localization/mutant constructs.</p><p>Phospho-memetic D/E mutations are not guaranteed to actually mimic phosphorylation. Did the authors also test phospho-ablative A/F mutations? What data support Osm1-Y173D is phosphomimetic? Same is true for Atf1-<sup>S124D</sup> presented in Figure 5.</p><p>The Phostag gel in Figure 4C is not clear, especially when compared to 4F.</p><p>In Figure 4E the authors describe âphosphorylation sitesâ upstream of the NLS: are these just serines, or have they been shown to be phosphorylated? If so, please cite. If not, rephrase.</p><p>It is clear that S124 is important for phosphostatus, but there is no evidence that this is due to phosphorylation by Osm1.</p><p>IP controls are lacking, and protein expression should be confirmed for the Y2H assays shown in Figure 5. It is possible that the mutant variants are not expressed.</p><p>The authors describe âhemibiotrophic fungiâ as having a âsymbioticâ stage with their plant host. I do not think this is accurate.</p><p>The authors demonstrate that ptp1/2 mutants are similar to ptp2 mutants and make the conclusion that PTP1 and PTP2 have differential functions. Are they expressed similarly?</p><p>In Figure 7E the legend describes âin vivoâ phosphorylation but this described as being performed on protein extracts in the text. Is this really âin vivoâ?</p><p>What makes a protein/residue hyper-phosphorylated? How can one tell this based on mass spec data without controls? The authors should provide more details about how this MS was performed, and how confident they are in the scores. No Mascot/proteomic confidence scores are provided for these data.</p><p>The conclusion that PTP-mediated desphosphorylation of Osm1 leads to nuclear export is not supported by direct evidence and is therefore speculative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Liu et al. describes molecular mechanisms by which the fungal plant pathogen <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> copes with reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during the host immune response. It provides a complete view of one particular mechanism involving phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions, protein complex assembly and dissociation, protein relocalization to the nucleus and transcriptional regulation. The manuscript is organized with a straightforward logic, but requires extensive language editing to improve clarity. This is a very ambitious manuscript, featuring a lot of diverse experiments, apparently carefully executed, involving many different molecular players. It therefore has great potential to constitute a significant step forward in our understanding of fungal virulence. However, the relatively complex model the authors attempt to build is composed of pieces of evidence that sometimes remain incomplete. Several steps of the reasoning would require more thorough testing for the model to be fully convincing. An effort is also needed to synthesize these findings and present the conceptual novelty arising from the work. My specific major concerns are as follows:</p><p>1) I can see that there is a significant progress being made in understanding a particular ROS-response signaling pathway, the amount of work and new insights appear substantial, but the authors fail to unify their findings and convey the new concepts arising from their experimental work. After reading carefully the manuscript several times, I can tell the authors found new mechanisms for Magnaporthe to sense and respond to host-derived ROS, but I miss a clear statement on what the major novelty/originality is. Can the authors summarize the process they discovered in 1 or 2 simple sentences rather than a list of molecular players? The objectives of the study stated by the authors are:</p><p>â &quot;How does <italic>M. oryzae</italic> percept and then overcome ROS stress?&quot; a mechanism is proposed to mitigate the antifungal effect of host-derived ROS is provided, but how ROS are perceived is not directly addressed.</p><p>â &quot;how MoOsm1 is linked to MoAp1 or MoAtf1 in stress response is unclear&quot; This is a rather field- or organism-centered question. Some efforts are needed to place the study into a broader perspective an qualify in simple terms the novel concepts and mechanisms discovered.</p><p>2) &quot;YFP signal of MoOSM1-cYFP and MoOSM1-nYFP pair was reduced in the nucleus, suggesting that the monomeric form of MoOsm1 is involved in the nuclear localization under the oxidative stress&quot; &gt; Several explanations could fit with this observation, the conclusion is not fully supported. A version of osm1 that remain in the dimer form (maybe a phospho dead mutant of Y173?) should not accumulate in the nucleus.</p><p>&quot;Collectively, the results suggested that Y173D but not T171D phosphomimic mutation is required for the interaction&quot;&gt; I would rather conclude that Y173D but not T171D prevents Osm1 oligomer formation</p><p>BiFC &quot;the empty vectors used as negative controls&quot; &gt; Better controls would be: Phospho-dead mutants of Osm1 or the Y171D mutant + MoOSM1 wt = positive / MoOsm1Y173D + MoOsm1 wt = negative</p><p>Subcellular localisation of MoOsm1Y171D-GFP is not analyzed/commented</p><p>3) &quot;MoAtf1 interacts with MoOsm1&quot; and following section&gt; This is lacking a few controls to be fully convincing: what happens if osm is trapped outside the nucleus (nuclear exclusion signal or Y173 phospho dead mutant?) â Since the interaction assay was performed in the absence of ROS stress, what would be its relevance in response to ROS? What would be the function of Osm1 dimer dissociation and relocalization to the nucleus? Is Osm1-Atf1 interaction modified upon ROS stress? Similarly, the interaction between Atf1 and Tup1 has not been tested in the context of response to ROS.</p><p>4) &quot;disruption of MoAtf1-MoTup1 complex would reverse the suppression of genes involved in virulence&quot; &gt; as far as I understand, disruption of this complex is achieved through Atf1 phosphorylation (S124D phosphomimic mutant) or deletion of Atf1. However, Î´ MoATF1 is less virulent than wild type (Figure 4G/H) while there is no Atf1-Tup1 complex and therefore no repression of virulence genes in this strain â Similarly, Tup1 deletion reduced virulence (Chen et al., 2015) â How can we explain these discrepancies? In these experiment, what is the virulence phenotype of Atf1<sup>S124D</sup> mutants? The reverse controls with phospho-dead mutants of Atf1 would be useful to support the conclusions. In which compartment of the cell (nucleus or cytoplasm) are these interactions happening?</p><p>5) Whether the genes under transcriptional control of the Atf1-Tup1 complex actually play a role in virulence is not described. Do they directly contribute to host-derived ROS detoxification?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The article &quot;Host-derived ROS activates MoOsm1/MoPtp-dependent phosphorylation of MoAtf1 to orchestra virulence in <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>&quot; by Liu et al. propose to demonstrate the role of the MAPK kinase complex MoOsm/MoPtp in the regulation of transcription factors MoAtf1 in the fungus <italic>M. oryzae</italic>.</p><p>Overall, authors have provided evidence to show the role of ROS and its effect on one of the MAPK module, but they do not provide evidence to justify the title.</p><p>1) Exogenous application of H2O2 is NOT the same as host derived ROS. Authors have not provided evidence to show that host derived ROS can drive the changes in the MAPK complexes in the fungus outlined in this manuscript. Therefore, Authors should use host mutants that cannot make ROS to justify their claim.</p><p>2) Authors are aware that fungi have an equivalent ROS producing machinery that can be inhibited by both DPI and catalase (these are not specific to plant NADPH oxidases as claimed by the authors.</p><p>3) Authors describe PTI in their Introduction. How and more importantly when is ROS produced during PTI in a suc (LTH) vs res (K23) interaction? They need to define PTI in their pathosystem.</p><p>4) Authors need to detail their experimental protocols more thoroughly and edit the figure and figure legends so that they match.</p><p>The reviewer questions many of the experimental procedures used:</p><p>1) While the Co-IPs are done in hyphae and other time they use protoplasts; many of the localization studies are done in conidia. The authors do not make any distinction between these two. Conidia and hyphae are two distinct developmental stages of fungus as demonstrated by the authors in Figure 10A and authors cannot use interchangeably these two development stages to support their hypothesis</p><p>2) With respect to using protoplasts: where the Co-IPs performed from plasmids expressed transiently? No experimental procedure is described with respect to preparation, transformation, and efficiency.</p><p>3) What development stage of hyphae was used to extract proteins to perform Co-IPs. How much protein was used in each of the IP experiments?</p><p>4) Authors do not provide evidence that validates any of the constructs used in this manuscripts.</p><p>5) Monomer/Dimer (Figure 3E). should document this by gel-filtration chromatography and the native gel does NOT adequately demonstrate this.</p><p>6) Phosphorylation of MoATF-1 (Figure 4C) â not very convincing (compare 4c to 4F);</p><p>Should use ÎMoosm in 4G.</p><p>7) EMSA experiments: it is not appropriate it to use a 1 Kb fragment to perform gel shift analysis. An oligomer with the binding site and a mutated binding site should be used.</p><p>8) The legend for Figure 9A indicates 100 infecting hyphae were counted. How many of those were used for DAB staining in 9C?</p><p>Figures with no explanation or details:</p><p>1) Figure 3F: the figure clearly show conidia, but the text refers to it as protoplasts.</p><p>2) Figure 1H is referred in text as bulbous structure at 24hrs; not identified in the figure or legend</p><p>3) Figure 4H; Figure 5B; middle lane in Figure 7D; what are type 1.â¦typ4 infection in Figure 9A and 9B?</p><p>The reviewer questions some of the statements made in this manuscript:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>1) MoOsm1 was phosphorylated in response to oxidative stress: &quot;These results suggested that MoOsm1 responds to oxidative stress by inducing a high phosphorylated level and increased accumulation in the nucleus.&quot;</p><p>This statement should be supported by Western with p-p38 Abs in Figure 2E.</p><p>2) MoOsm1 is reduced from a dimer to a monomer under oxidative stress-triggered phosphorylation: &quot;Collectively, the results suggested that Y173D but not T171D phosphomimic mutation is required for the interaction&quot;</p><p>Figure 3D clearly shows that wt MoOsm and the mutant MoOsm Y173D do not interact</p><p>Appropriate statement would be: phosphorylation of tyrosine 173 inhibits interaction</p><p>Figure 3 is a total mess.

This study investigates the molecular mechanisms by which the fungal pathogen <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> responds to ROS during the infection of rice plants. The authors identified a ROS-sensing loop involving protein-protein interactions, subcellular translocation and transcriptional regulation controlled by differential phosphorylation. This thorough investigation proposes a mechanism for restoring fungal cells into a sensitive state after signaling.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is no direct evidence that ROS perceived by <italic>M. oryzae</italic> are of plant origin. The authors are asked to provide experimental support for this claim and discuss putative functions of this ROS-sensing mechanism other than counteracting PTI.</p><p>2) The manuscript remains difficult to read due to its length and style. Reviewer 3 has made suggestions to streamline the manuscript. The authors should carefully edit the style of their manuscript and make better use of supplementary materials to simplify the main text.</p><p>3) Experimental procedures are not always sufficiently explained, justified, and lacking some controls. Please carefully address the reviewer comments related to this concern appended at the bottom of this message.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Liu et al. is a revised version of a study aiming at deciphering the molecular mechanisms by which the fungal plant pathogen <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> copes with reactive oxygen species produced during the host immune response. I found this new version much improved compared to the previous one. The objectives of the work are much clearer, and the additional experiments improved the quality of the Results section.</p><p>There is a number of aspects in which the manuscript should be improved further:</p><p>1) Although it improved since the previous version, I would advise the authors need to think of a better title. First, whether ROS are produced by the plant during the interaction cannot be unambiguously established due to some limitations in the experimental system. Therefore the &quot;host-derived&quot; nature of ROS should be downplayed and discussed rather than presented as an established fact. Second, the authors show that ROS dissociate Mosm1 dimers, but it not clear how this is achieved. The use of &quot;activates&quot; may not be the most appropriate in this respect. Third, I feel like &quot;phospho-regulatory circuitry&quot; does not convey fully the originality and breadth of the findings from this manuscript.</p><p>2) The Discussion section could be improved by A) commenting on the source of ROS in the interaction. Could they be produced by the fungus instead of the plant? Is there any correlation between the expression of ROS-producing enzymes from Rice and the staining observed in Figure 1? B) commenting on how the current work related to the lifestyle and disease progression (e.g. relationship with hemibiotrophic growth) what is the link with either biotrophic or necrotrophic growth? or rather with virulence in general? C) For discussion: What would be the fitness advantage in recycling Osm1 instead of degrading it when phosphorylated?</p><p>3) In spite of real progress, there is still a need to carefully check spelling and grammar throughout the manuscript. (For instance: &quot;To examine MoPtp1/2 in virulence&quot; missing &quot;the role of&quot;; &quot;that of the phosphorylated the MoOsm1-GF&quot; too many &quot;the&quot;; &quot;ROS accumulation around caused by&quot; remove &quot;around&quot;; &quot;pathogenicity assay exhibited that the&quot; &gt; demonstrated that)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The work under revision disentangle the signalling pathway that activates ROS tolerance in a fungal pathogen. This pathway is shown to be critical for virulence and modulate plant immunity during infection. This ambitious work pursues to identify and determine the function of various members of the signalling pathway and the role of each of them in the regulation of ROS tolerance. The work substantially contributes to better understanding how virulence is regulated in plant pathogens. However, I consider that the authors should address the following concerns:</p><p>The virulence phenotype of MoTup1 does not fit either with the model. If it is a negative regulator, I would have thought that the knockout would be more virulent. There should be a discussion about this.</p><p>Figure 3: I think that there are some problems with the controls: Actin is missing in mutant D in Figure 3B. And also RFP is not detected in mutant A in the nuclear fraction</p><p>Finally, Materials and methods section is not complete. For example, I could not find the description on how DAB experiments were performed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors characterized a well conserved signaling pathway in rice blast fungus to show that it responds to changes in ROS, which they try to link to ROS production during immunity. The paper has far too many figures for someone to finish reading it in one go. Also it is a bit difficult to read due to the structuring of sentences.</p><p>My main concerns are:</p><p>1) I don't think their findings really demonstrate this is a signaling cascade evolved to adapt to counteract the ROS produced during infection. I think the data simply shows Osm1 and its regulators respond to ROS changes in environment. To be able to say it is in response to host produced ROS, they need to have rice NADPH Ox mutants, where Osm1 gains full pathogenesis. I assume this is not possible.</p><p>2) Since they are talking about plant infection, the data obtained during appressorium development, which are done on cover slips may not be very relevant. Also, the DPI inhibitor treatments could be problematic. Because the fungus also has NADPH oxidases and they are critical for infection. DPI would probably inhibit fungal enzymes as well.</p><p>3) Figure 2: Hydrogen peroxide treatments, the ROS response that the authors see happens 24 hours after inoculation. At that point, the mature appressoria are isolated from the rest of the hyphae. They should repeat these ROS treatment experiments in the right time points to see the response that is relevant to their infection conditions.</p><p>4) Do we know if the defects in pathogenesis is due to simple growth defects of the mutants?

Adapted pathogens evolved mechanisms to counteract the deleterious effects of host-derived ROS and promote infection. How plant pathogens regulate such an elaborate response against ROS burst remains not fully understood. Using the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, we uncovered a self-balancing circuit controlling response to ROS in planta and virulence. During infection, ROS induces the phosphorylation the high osmolarity glycerol pathway kinase Osm1 and its translocation to the nucleus. There, Osm1 phosphorylates the transcription factor Atf1 and dissociates Atf1-Tup1 complex. This releases Tup1-mediated transcriptional repression on oxidoreduction-pathway genes and activates the transcription of the Ptp1/2 protein phosphatases. In turn, Ptp1/2 dephosphorylate Osm1, restoring the circuit to its initial state. Balanced interactions among Osm1, Atf1, Tup1, and Ptp1/2 proteins provide a means to counter the ROS burst plant immune response. Our findings thereby reveal new insights into how <italic>M. oryzae</italic> utilizes a phosphor-regulatory feedback mechanism to face plant immunity during infection.&quot;</p><p>Please verify that this provides an accurate account of your work, and please correct and amend it as needed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61605.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

This article needs to be revised by an English copy-editor, as the vast number of grammatical errors makes the article difficult to follow.

It provides a complete view of one particular mechanism involving phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions, protein complex assembly and dissociation, protein relocalization to the nucleus and transcriptional regulation. The manuscript is organized with a straightforward logic, but requires extensive language editing to improve clarity. This is a very ambitious manuscript, featuring a lot of diverse experiments, apparently carefully executed, involving many different molecular players. It therefore has great potential to constitute a significant step forward in our understanding of fungal virulence. However, the relatively complex model the authors attempt to build is composed of pieces of evidence that sometimes remain incomplete. Several steps of the reasoning would require more thorough testing for the model to be fully convincing. An effort is also needed to synthecize these findings and present the conceptual novelty arising from the work. My specific major concerns are as follows:</p><p>1) I can see that there is a significant progress being made in understanding a particular ROS-response signaling pathway, the amount of work and new insights appear substantial, but the authors fail to unify their findings and convey the new concepts arising from their experimental work. After reading carefully the manuscript several times, I can tell the authors found new mechanisms for Magnaporthe to sense and respond to host-derived ROS, but I miss a clear statement on what the major novelty/originality is. Can the authors summarize the process they discovered in 1 or 2 simple sentences rather than a list of molecular players? The objectives of the study stated by the authors are:</p><p>â &quot;How does M. oryzae percept and then overcome ROS stress?&quot; a mechanism is proposed to mitigate the antifungal effect of host-derived ROS is provided, but how ROS are perceived is not directly addressed.</p><p>â &quot;how MoOsm1 is linked to MoAp1 or MoAtf1 in stress response is unclear&quot; This is a rather field- or organism-centered question. Some efforts are needed to place the study into a broader perspective an qualify in simple terms the novel concepts and mechanisms discovered.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the very positive comments regarding our study and for the invaluable comments/suggestions. We have since revised the manuscript based on the reviewersâ comments in various areas to improve the clarity of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) &quot;YFP signal of MoOSM1-cYFP and MoOSM1-nYFP pair was reduced in the nucleus, suggesting that the monomeric form of MoOsm1 is involved in the nuclear localization under the oxidative stress&quot; &gt; Several explanations could fit with this observation, the conclusion is not fully supported. A version of osm1 that remain in the dimer form (maybe a phospho dead mutant of Y173?) should not accumulate in the nucleus.</p><p>&quot;Collectively, the results suggested that Y173D but not T171D phosphomimic mutation is required for the interaction&quot;&gt; I would rather conclude that Y173D but not T171D prevents Osm1 oligomer formation</p><p>BiFC &quot;the empty vectors used as negative controls&quot; &gt; Better controls would be: Phospho-dead mutants of Osm1 or the Y171D mutant + MoOSM1 wt = positive / MoOsm1Y173D + MoOsm1 wt = negative</p><p>Subcellular localisation of MoOsm1Y171D-GFP is not analyzed/commented</p></disp-quote><p>We have since revised the statements to improve data interpretation. We have obtained the MoOsm1<sup>Y173A</sup> strain and showed that MoOsm1 <sup>Y173A</sup> remains in the dimer form and is located in the cytoplasm upon ROS stress (Figure 2A and 2E). We have also employed the recommended BiFC control to evaluate the formation of MoOsm1 dimer under stress (Figure 2G). The localization of MoOsm1Y173D was revealed in Figure 3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;MoAtf1 interacts with MoOsm1&quot; and following section&gt; This is lacking a few controls to be fully convincing: what happens if osm is trapped outside the nucleus (nuclear exclusion signal or Y173 phospho dead mutant?) â Since the interaction assay was performed in the absence of ROS stress, what would be its relevance in response to ROS? What would be the function of Osm1 dimer dissociation and relocalization to the nucleus? Is Osm1-Atf1 interaction modified upon ROS stress? Similarly, the interaction between Atf1 and Tup1 has not been tested in the context of response to ROS.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful suggestion. By generating a MoOsm1NES mutant strain, we were able to show that the nuclear localization of MoOsm1 is important for its interaction with MoAtf1 (Figure 4A and 4B). We also assessed the interactions under H2O2 treatment that are also present. We reasoned that ROS may not induce all MoOsm1 into phosphor-MoOsm1. Given that deletion of <italic>MoPTP1/2</italic> induces MoOsm1 phosphorylation, similar to being exposed to ROS stress, the interactions between MoOsm1-MoOsm1 and MoAtf1-MoTup1 were detectable in the <italic>Moptp1/Moptp2</italic> mutants. The results showed that the deletion of <italic>MoPTP2</italic> dissociates MoAtf1 from MoTup1 and MoOsm1 dimer formation is blocked in the Î<italic>Moptp1</italic>Î<italic>Moptp2</italic> double mutant (Figure 9D and 9E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) &quot;disruption of MoAtf1-MoTup1 complex would reverse the suppression of genes involved in virulence&quot; &gt; as far as I understand, disruption of this complex is achieved through Atf1 phosphorylation (S124D phosphomimic mutant) or deletion of Atf1. However, Î´ MoATF1 is less virulent than wild type (Figure 4G/H) while there is no Atf1-Tup1 complex and therefore no repression of virulence genes in this strain â Similarly, Tup1 deletion reduced virulence (Chen et al., 2015) â How can we explain these discrepancies? In these experiment, what is the virulence phenotype of Atf1<sup>S124D</sup> mutants? The reverse controls with phospho-dead mutants of Atf1 would be useful to support the conclusions. In which compartment of the cell (nucleus or cytoplasm) are these interactions happening?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the insightful comments. We have assessed pathogenicity of MoAtf1<sup>S124D</sup> and MoAtf1<sup>S124A</sup> (Figure 4G and 4H) that failed to show any infection differences between wild type (Guy11) and MoAtf1<sup>S124D</sup> strains on cultivar LTH. The Î<italic>Moatf1</italic> and Î<italic>Moatf1</italic>/<italic>MoAtf1<sup>S124A</sup></italic> mutants exhibited restricted lesions. On cultivar K23, however, wild-type caused few typical lesions (gray spots with brown margins), in contrast to MoAtf1<sup>S124D</sup> that caused more lesions and larger lesion sizes (Figure 4G and 4H).</p><p>Given the function of MoAtf1 and MoTup1 in transcriptional regulation, deletion of MoAtf1 or MoTup1 is expected to result in wide changes in transcription levels. The defects of Î<italic>Moatf1</italic> and Î<italic>Motup1</italic> in pathogenicity may be not only solely dependent on MoAtf1-mediated phosphorylation. The conclusion we draw is that MoAtf1 phosphorylation is important for virulence of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Whether the genes under transcriptional control of the Atf1-Tup1 complex actually play a role in virulence is not described.

Due to limitations in obtaining ROS defective rice cultivars, the research field traditionally employs 0.5 Î¼M diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) to inhibit the activity of plant NADPH oxidases and thereby suppress ROS (Bolwell et al., 1998; Grant et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2009). We also used DPI to suppress ROS generation in several of our previous studies.

Rice cultivar K23 infected with Guy11 yielded reddish-brown precipitates around appressoria and infected hypha at 24, 36, 48, and 60 hpi. Over 40% of infected cells were stained brown at 24 hpi and/or 36 hpi (Figure 1B and 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Authors need to detail their experimental protocols more thoroughly and edit the figure and figure legends so that they match.</p><p>The reviewer questions many of the experimental procedures used:</p><p>1) While the Co-IPs are done in hyphae and other time they use protoplasts; many of the localization studies are done in conidia.

MoOsm1 was present in both the cytosol and the nucleus evenly, similar to that in wild type. When treated with H2O2, MoOsm1 shows an enhanced nuclear translocation pattern. At 30 minutes following H2O2 treatment, MoOsm1 shows a nucleus to cytoplasm shifting in the wild type strain but not in the Î<italic>Moptp</italic>2 and â<italic>Moptp2</italic>/<italic>MoPTP2</italic><sup>â<italic>ptpc</italic></sup> mutants (Figure 9C). These results further supported that MoPtp1/2-mediated dephosphorylation of MoOsm1 controls its nuclear-cytoplasm translocation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;As a hemibiotrophic fungus, M. oryzae also maintains a symbiotic relationship</p><p>with rice without directly killing it.&quot;</p><p>The fungus has biotrophic phase but no symbiotic relationship.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the error.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;As the pathogen utilizes MoOsm1 phosphorylation as a means to control the interaction of MoAtf1-MoTup1 complex in responding to host immunity&quot;</p><p>No evidence for this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the proper correction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;We generated respective ÎMoptp1 and ÎMoptp2 mutant strains&quot;</p><p>&quot;independent ÎMoptp1ÎMoptp2 double mutants were also constructed&quot;</p><p>No evidence is provided for either construction or validation of these mutant strains.</p></disp-quote><p>Southern blot analysis was performed for both Î<italic>Moptp1</italic> and Î<italic>Moptp2</italic> mutant strains (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;We further purified the MoOsm1-GFP protein from the âMoptp2/MoOSM1-GFP</p><p>strain and found that tyrosine 173 was the hyperphosphorylated (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A).&quot;</p><p>You can have protein that is hyperphosphorylated, but you cannot have a residue that is hyperphosphorylatedâ¦.

I found this new version much improved compared to the previous one. The objectives of the work are much clearer, and the additional experiments improved the quality of the Results section.</p><p>There is a number of aspects in which the manuscript should be improved further:</p><p>1) Although it improved since the previous version, I would advise the authors need to think of a better title. First, whether ROS are produced by the plant during the interaction cannot be unambiguously established due to some limitations in the experimental system. Therefore the &quot;host-derived&quot; nature of ROS should be downplayed and discussed rather than presented as an established fact. Second, the authors show that ROS dissociate Mosm1 dimers, but it not clear how this is achieved. The use of &quot;activates&quot; may not be the most appropriate in this respect. Third, I feel like &quot;phospho-regulatory circuitry&quot; does not convey fully the originality and breadth of the findings from this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the helpful suggestion. Following new evidence of OsRboh overexpression inducing ROS generation and MoOsm1 phosphorylation, we thought that a âinducibleâ may better depict MoOsm1-MoAtf1-MoPtps in the phosphor-regulatory process, and thereby propose âA host-derived ROS inducible phosphor-regulatory circuitry centering on MoOsm1 governs virulence of <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>â as an updated title.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Discussion section could be improved by A) commenting on the source of ROS in the interaction. Could they be produced by the fungus instead of the plant? Is there any correlation between the expression of ROS-producing enzymes from Rice and the staining observed in Figure 1? B) commenting on how the current work related to the lifestyle and disease progression (e.g. relationship with hemibiotrophic growth) what is the link with either biotrophic or necrotrophic growth? or rather with virulence in general? C) For discussion: What would be the fitness advantage in recycling Osm1 instead of degrading it when phosphorylated?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the insightful comments. In the revised Discussion section, we discussed the following aspects:</p><p>A) For the pathogen, ROS seems like a double-edged sword. During appressorial penetration, <italic>M. oryzae</italic> accumulates high levels of endogenous ROS to strengthen the appressorium cell wall. Here, ROS accumulation is regulated by two fungal NADPH oxidases, Nox1 and Nox2, which themselves are important for appressorium-mediated cuticle penetration. However, ROS is also one of the earliest responses by plants to microbial colonization. This oxidative burst function a potent defense mechanism that limits fungal biotrophic growth (Torres, 2010). Rboh, which encodes NADPH oxidase, is the key host protein that generates ROS upon the pathogen challenge (Wong et al., 2007). Both OsrbohA and OsrbohB are important for this process (Wong et al., 2007). We have updated the relevant description.</p><p>B) During the interaction between <italic>M. oryzae</italic> and the host, the host induces ROS burst during the biotrophic growth stage of the fungus. Once sensing this stress, the pathogen activates MoOsm1-mediated pathways that in turn activates the transcription factor MoAtf1. The phosphorylation of MoAtf1 causes the disintegration of the MoAtf1-MoTup1 complex to induce the expression of oxidation regulation pathway genes to further enhance virulence of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. Phosphorylated MoAtf1 also initiates the transcription of the <italic>MoPTP1/2</italic> genes to further dephosphorylate MoOsm1. Once the ROS stress was circumvented, such as that at the necrotrophic growth stage, MoPtps mediated dephosphorylation of MoOsm1 shut off phosphor-regulatory circuitry to control the virulence.</p><p>C) Given the evidence indicating that the nuclear localization of MoOsm1 was more stable in the Î<italic>Moptps</italic> mutant than Guy11 under ROS stress, it is plausibly that MoPtps function in the recycling of MoOsm1 to the cytoplasm. MoOsm1 recycling may have two benefits: 1) shutdown of phosphorylated MoOsm1 mediates signaling pathways that switch off virulence attack. 2) recycled MoOsm1 in the cytoplasm might respond quickly to external stress as there is no need for protein resynthesing. We have updated the relevant statements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In spite of real progress, there is still a need to carefully check spelling and grammar throughout the manuscript. (For instance: &quot;To examine MoPtp1/2 in virulence&quot; missing &quot;the role of&quot;; &quot;that of the phosphorylated the MoOsm1-GF&quot; too many &quot;the&quot;; &quot;ROS accumulation around caused by&quot; remove &quot;around&quot;; &quot;pathogenicity assay exhibited that the&quot; &gt; demonstrated that)</p></disp-quote><p>We have done so in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The work under revision disentangle the signalling pathway that activates ROS tolerance in a fungal pathogen. This pathway is shown to be critical for virulence and modulate plant immunity during infection. This ambitious work pursues to identify and determine the function of various members of the signalling pathway and the role of each of them in the regulation of ROS tolerance. The work substantially contributes to better understanding how virulence is regulated in plant pathogens. However, I consider that the authors should address the following concerns:</p><p>The virulence phenotype of MoTup1 does not fit either with the model. If it is a negative regulator, I would have thought that the knockout would be more virulent. There should be a discussion about this.</p></disp-quote><p>Studies revealed that Tup1 is a critical transcription repressor that does not bind directly to DNA but is brought to the promoters via interactions with sequence-specific regulatory proteins to regulate the expression of genes. Here, the disrupted interaction between MoAtf1 and MoTup1 induces the expression of various genes. However, MoTup1 may regulate various other transcription factors in addition to MoAtf1, so it is plausible that the deletion of <italic>MoTUP1</italic> causes defect in virulence expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: I think that there are some problems with the controls: Actin is missing in mutant D in Figure 3B.

Adapted pathogens evolved mechanisms to counteract the deleterious effects of host-derived ROS and promote infection. How plant pathogens regulate such an elaborate response against ROS burst remains not fully understood. Using the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, we uncovered a self-balancing circuit controlling response to ROS in planta and virulence. During infection, ROS induces the phosphorylation the high osmolarity glycerol pathway kinase Osm1 and its translocation to the nucleus. There, Osm1 phosphorylates the transcription factor Atf1 and dissociates Atf1-Tup1 complex. This releases Tup1-mediated transcriptional repression on oxidoreduction pathway genes and activates the transcription of the Ptp1/2 protein phosphatases. In turn, Ptp1/2 dephosphorylate Osm1, restoring the circuit to its initial state. Balanced interactions among Osm1, Atf1, Tup1, and Ptp1/2 proteins provide a means to counter the ROS burst plant immune response. Our findings thereby reveal new insights into how M. oryzae utilizes a phosphor-regulatory feedback mechanism to face plant immunity during infection.&quot;</p><p>Please verify that this provides an accurate account of your work, and please correct and amend it as needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the critical comment on the title and Abstract.
