The Ena/VASP family of actin regulators consists of three members that share an EVH1 interaction domain with a 100 % conserved binding site. A proteome-wide screen revealed photoreceptor cilium actin regulator (PCARE) as a high-affinity ligand for ENAH EVH1. Here, we report the surprising observation that PCARE is ~100-fold specific for ENAH over paralogs VASP and EVL and can selectively bind ENAH and inhibit ENAH-dependent adhesion in cells. Specificity arises from a mechanism whereby PCARE stabilizes a conformation of the ENAH EVH1 domain that is inaccessible to family members VASP and EVL. Structure-based modeling rapidly identified seven residues distributed throughout EVL that are sufficient to differentiate binding by ENAH vs. EVL. By exploiting the ENAH-specific conformation, we rationally designed the tightest and most selective ENAH binder to date. Our work uncovers a conformational mechanism of interaction specificity that distinguishes highly similar paralogs and establishes tools for dissecting specific Ena/VASP functions in processes including cancer cell invasion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein-protein interaction</kwd><kwd>short linear motif</kwd><kwd>epistasis</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>Ena/VASP</kwd><kwd>protein specificity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM129007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keating</surname><given-names>Amy E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA196885-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mouneimne</surname><given-names>Ghassan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM007287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>Theresa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>Theresa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A peptide from PCARE achieves &gt;100-fold binding specificity for the EVH1 domain of ENAH, a protein important for metastasis, using a conformational shift mechanism unavailable to ENAH's closely related paralogs VASP and EVL.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Metazoan signal transduction networks have evolved a high degree of complexity using adapter proteins that are specialized to make many interactions and/or highly specific interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rowland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zarrinpar et al., 2003a</xref>). Signaling complexity arises in part from a plethora of interaction domain families such as the SH3, SH2, and PDZ domains. The facile recombination and insertion of modular domains to generate diverse protein architectures have enabled the evolution of new signaling circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pawson and Nash, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Many modular interaction domains bind to short linear motifs (SLiMs), which occur as stretches of 3–10 consecutive amino acids in intrinsically disordered regions of proteins. The SLiM-binding specificity profiles of different paralogous members in a family of domains are often highly overlapping, yet individual members can in some cases engage in highly selective interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hause et al., 2012</xref>). For example, a SLiM in Pbs2 binds only the SH3 domain of Sho1 out of the 27 SH3 domains in yeast to activate the high-osmolarity stress response pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zarrinpar et al., 2003b</xref>). Conversely, the actin assembly protein Las17 binds promiscuously to many SH3 domains, including Sho1, to drive actin-related processes such as endocytosis in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kelil et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Robertson et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The Ena/VASP proteins are a family of actin regulators involved in functions ranging from T-cell activation to axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kwiatkowski et al., 2003</xref>). There are three paralogs in mammals: ENAH (often called Mena), VASP, and EVL. All three proteins contain an N-terminal EVH1 interaction domain responsible for subcellular localization and a C-terminal EVH2 domain that polymerizes actin. The two domains are connected by a linker, predicted to be largely disordered, that contains binding motifs for other proteins. The EVH1 domain binds SLiMs with the consensus motif [FWYL]PXΦP, where X is any amino acid and Φ is any hydrophobic residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ball et al., 2000</xref>). This sequence, referred to here as the FP4 motif, binds the EVH1 domain as a polyproline type II (PPII) helix.</p><p>Ena/VASP proteins have evolved both overlapping and paralog-specific cellular functions. On the one hand, ENAH, VASP, and EVL can all bind to FP4 motifs in lamellipodin to promote actin assembly at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krause et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hansen and Mullins, 2015</xref>). Single deletions of Ena/VASP paralogs lead to mild phenotypic defects in mice, indicating that the paralogs can functionally compensate for each other, whereas triple mutant mice die after proceeding to late embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aszódi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lanier et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwiatkowski et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, the three paralogs participate in distinct pathways. ENAH, alone, promotes haptotaxis of breast cancer cells through fibronectin gradients and regulates translation of specific mRNAs in developing axons, implicating it in functions beyond its role in actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oudin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vidaki et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, whereas ENAH and VASP promote the invasive potential of migratory breast cancer cells, EVL suppresses breast cancer invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roussos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Padilla-Rodriguez et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The FP4-binding pocket of the EVH1 domain is 100 % conserved across ENAH, VASP, and EVL, and the paralogs share 62–72% sequence identity over the entire domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Consequently, the three EVH1 domains recognize many common binding partners. Nevertheless, some proteins bind selectively to certain paralogs. The LIM3 domain of testin binds specifically to the ENAH EVH1 domain in a region adjacent to the highly conserved FP4-binding pocket; this is the only example of an endogenous Ena/VASP EVH1-binding partner where the mechanistic basis for specificity is defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boëda et al., 2007</xref>). Testin binds specifically because it contacts residues that have diverged across paralogs to form distinct surfaces, which is a common mechanism for achieving specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Skerker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bardwell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schreiber and Keating, 2011</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ena/VASP family EVH1 domains are highly conserved but differ in their affinity for a peptide from photoreceptor cilium actin regulator (PCARE).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence alignment of the EVH1 domains of ENAH, VASP, and EVL.

PCARE is almost exclusively expressed in the retina, and mutations in PCARE are associated with inherited retinitis pigmentosa and retinal dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nishimura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kevany et al., 2015</xref>). Prior work implicates PCARE as a scaffold protein important for recruiting complexes that regulate actin assembly as part of new outer segment disk formation in photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corral-Serrano et al., 2020</xref>). Previous investigations identified ENAH as an interaction partner for PCARE based on tandem-affinity purification experiments in HEK293T cells and colocalization of PCARE with Ena/VASP at ciliary membrane expansions in hTERT RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boldt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corral-Serrano et al., 2020</xref>). PCARE was also associated, via protein tandem-affinity purification studies, with 17 other proteins with actin-related functions, including Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein family member 3 (WASF3), which is recruited via PCARE to the cilium, leading to membrane expansions that involve actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corral-Serrano et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that PCARE is surprisingly selective for binding to ENAH in preference to EVL or VASP, despite containing an FP4 motif that can engage the perfectly conserved FP4-binding site. We demonstrate that an extended peptide from PCARE can be used as a tool to perturb ENAH-specific interactions in cells. We also reveal the mechanistic basis behind the striking paralog selectivity, which involves an epistatic residue network in the ENAH EVH1 domain that allows ENAH to adopt a conformation that is not accessible to paralogs VASP and EVL. An alpha-helical extension C-terminal to the FP4 motif in PCARE engages and stabilizes this ENAH-specific conformation using a noncanonical binding mode. These observations reveal a strategy to obtain binding specificity in a highly conserved family that must also make promiscuous interactions. Finally, inspired by previous identification of a noncanonical binding site on the backside of the EVH1 domain of VASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acevedo et al., 2017</xref>), which we found is also conserved in ENAH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2021</xref>), we demonstrate how PCARE can be elaborated to give designed synthetic peptides with further enhanced and unprecedented affinity and specificity for ENAH.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An extended SLiM from ciliary protein PCARE binds selectively to ENAH EVH1 and reduces adhesion in mammalian cells</title><p>In a separate study, we performed a proteomic screen that identified peptides that bind to the ENAH EVH1 domain with dissociation constants primarily in the low- to midmicromolar range (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 2–60 μM). The highest affinity hit from our screen was a 36-residue peptide from PCARE (PCARE<sup>813–848</sup>) that bound to ENAH with a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 0.19 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2021</xref>). Truncation studies showed that 23-residue PCARE<sup>826–848</sup>, which we call PCARE B, maintains high affinity for ENAH EVH1 (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 0.32 μM). To explore the paralog specificity of PCARE B, we quantified binding to EVL and VASP EVH1 domains using biolayer interferometry (BLI) and discovered a 70- to 140-fold preference for binding to ENAH over EVL or VASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This was initially very surprising, given that PCARE B includes the FP4 sequence LPPPP and the Ena/VASP paralogs are 100 % conserved in the FP4-binding groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, this was also an exciting observation, because it suggested that PCARE B could serve as a reagent for selectively targeting ENAH in cell biological studies of its functions.</p><p>To test for association of Ena/VASP proteins and PCARE B in cells, we used Ena/VASP-family-deficient cell line MV<sup>D7</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bear et al., 2000</xref>) and expressed the individual paralogs ENAH, EVL, and VASP.

We used an shRNA against <italic>EVL</italic> to further decrease residual EVL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We tagged PCARE B with mRuby2 (mRuby2-PCARE B) and coexpressed this construct with green fluorescent protein (GFP), or GFP fusions to ENAH, an EVH1 deletion mutant of ENAH (ΔEVH1-ENAH), EVL, or VASP. ENAH, EVL, and VASP all robustly localized to focal adhesions as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Puleo et al., 2019</xref>) while ΔEVH1-ENAH localization was cytoplasmic. mRuby2-PCARE B exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic localization under all conditions except when coexpressed with ENAH, in which case mRuby2-PCARE B was moderately enriched at focal adhesions, consistent with an ENAH–PCARE B interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To demonstrate the specificity of PCARE B for ENAH, we quantified the enrichment ratio of the mean intensity of mRuby2-PCARE B at focal adhesions and in the cytoplasm in each condition. The mean intensity values at focal adhesions and the cytoplasm were divided by the average background intensity of mRuby2-PCARE B. We observed significant enrichment (p &lt; 0.0001) of mRuby2-PCARE B with GFP-ENAH at focal adhesions compared to the cytoplasm. The enrichment ratios for mRuby2-PCARE B with GFP-EVL and GFP-VASP were not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

This strategy has been used to dissect Ena/VASP-dependent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bear et al., 2000</xref>). To test whether PCARE B could serve a similar function, but with specificity for ENAH, we tagged PCARE B with a mitochondrial localization sequence, generating Mito-mRuby2-PCARE B. In MV<sup>D7</sup><sub>shEVL</sub> cells with exogenously expressed Ena/VASP paralogs, ENAH was significantly colocalized with Mito-mRuby2-PCARE B at mitochondria, although some ENAH remained associated with focal adhesions. In contrast, EVL and VASP remained entirely localized to focal adhesions and did not localize to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). There is significant enrichment (p &lt; 0.0001) of Mito-mRuby2-PCARE B with GFP-ENAH at the mitochondria compared to the cytoplasm, whereas the enrichment ratios of Mito-mRuby2-PCARE B with GFP-EVL and GFP-VASP were not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that PCARE B can recruit ENAH, but not EVL or VASP, to artificial localization sites such as the mitochondria, supporting interaction specificity between PCARE B and ENAH in cells.</p><p>We also tested whether cytoplasmic expression of PCARE B could disrupt the function of endogenous ENAH. We examined focal adhesion maturation as a readout of ENAH function in MCF7 breast cancer cells, which express significant levels of ENAH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We compared the effects of PCARE B expression to the effects of ENAH knockdown by shRNA by assessing cell adhesion, using paxillin immunofluorescence labeling to delineate focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). As expected, ENAH knockdown was associated with diminished adhesion and smaller focal adhesion size as compared to cells expressing nontargeting shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>). Intriguingly, expression of PCARE B resulted in a similar decrease in adhesion, suggesting suppression of ENAH function at focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–I</xref>). Importantly, the expression of PCARE B in MCF7 cells shifted the enrichment of ENAH from focal adhesions to membrane protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> center inset). ENAH enrichment at protrusions was not observed in MCF7 cells expressing Mito-mRuby2-PCARE B, which exhibited strong mitochondrial localization of ENAH and markedly decreased adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> right inset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). This suggests that in MCF7 cells, blockade of the EVH1 domain by cytosolic PCARE B liberates ENAH from focal adhesions while permitting other EVH1-independent interactions elsewhere in the cell. In contrast, Mito-mRuby2-PCARE B can recruit ENAH away from its normal sites of action at focal adhesions and the cell membrane and to the mitochondria.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>FP4 motif-flanking elements in ciliary protein PCARE confer high affinity by inducing noncanonical binding</title><p>To understand the structural basis for the high-affinity and selective interaction of PCARE B with ENAH, we solved a crystal structure of ENAH EVH1 domain fused to a 36-mer PCARE sequence to 1.65 Å resolution.

Thus, whereas the FP4-binding site is 100 % conserved, the extended binding site engaged by PCARE is also highly conserved. Residue 63 is alanine in ENAH and VASP, and the corresponding residue 64 in EVL is serine. Modeling serine at position 63 in the PCARE-bound structure of ENAH shows that the side-chain hydroxyl group can be readily accommodated in a solvent-facing conformation without interfering with PCARE binding. On the other hand, residue 65 is proline in ENAH and the corresponding residue is valine in EVL and VASP. As discussed in the previous section, Pro65 is remote from the canonical FP4-binding groove but makes extensive contacts with PCARE and is largely buried at the domain–peptide interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We speculated that proline vs. valine might contribute to the ENAH-binding preference of PCARE.

FP4-motif peptides engage a small and relatively flat surface on EVH1; previously solved structures have shown how short peptides bind to this core region or, in some cases, to an immediately adjacent hydrophobic patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barone et al., 2020</xref>). The limited contacts with a highly conserved, shallow site make it challenging to achieve high affinity or paralog-selective binding.</p><p>There are currently two proteins reported to bind specifically to the ENAH EVH1 domain. The LIM domain of testin binds to ENAH EVH1 with a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 3 μM and does not bind detectably to the EVL or VASP EVH1 domains. Testin achieves paralog specificity by making contacts with ENAH outside of the canonical FP4 groove, at surface sites where the paralogs differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boëda et al., 2007</xref>). Synthetic mini-protein pGolemi binds to ENAH with <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 0.29 μM, moderate selectivity (20-fold) over VASP, and higher selectivity (≥120-fold) over EVL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Golemi-Kotra et al., 2004</xref>). The mechanism behind the specificity of pGolemi has not been determined, and mutational data do not readily rationalize a model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holtzman et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We have now shown that the protein PCARE contains residues adjacent to an FP4 motif that confer both high affinity and selectivity for ENAH over VASP and EVL by stabilizing an ENAH-specific conformation. The biological implications of the specificity of PCARE towards ENAH are unclear at this point. ENAH, VASP, and EVL induce distinct actin remodeling phenotypes based on their differential preferences for profilin isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mouneimne et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, paralog selectivity could be necessary when paralog-dependent actin dynamics and structures are required. Both ENAH and VASP have been identified in affinity purification-mass spectrometry experiments using PCARE as bait in ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corral-Serrano et al., 2020</xref>). Given that ENAH and VASP can heterotetramerize, VASP may be recruited to the identified complexes indirectly, via interaction with ENAH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gertler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Riquelme et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A dramatic feature of the PCARE-bound ENAH structure is that the LPPPP motif of PCARE binds in a reversed orientation, relative to previously observed FP4 ligands. The PPII helix possesses twofold rotational pseudosymmetry, meaning that the side chains and backbone carbonyls are similarly positioned in either the N-to-C- or C-to-N-terminal directions. SH3 domains exploit this pseudosymmetry to bind proline-rich sequences in either direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zarrinpar et al., 2003a</xref>). Although all Ena/VASP and Homer EVH1 domain structures solved so far show the PPII helix engaged in a single direction, the WASP EVH1 domain binds its proline-rich ligand in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Volkman et al., 2002</xref>). Consequently, it has long been hypothesized, although never demonstrated, that Ena/VASP EVH1 domains might also bind FP4 motifs in either direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ball et al., 2002</xref>). Here, we show that this is the case for ENAH. Interestingly, the large effect on PCARE binding that we observed for EVL V65P compared to wild-type EVL EVH1 suggests that EVL also binds PCARE in a reversed orientation (relative to FP4 ligands such as ActA), albeit weakly, because this is the orientation that best explains contacts with position 65.</p><p>We are not aware of other examples of such dramatic conformational specificity, in which a natural ligand binds selectively to one paralog despite almost complete (~89%) conservation of the binding site amongst its family members. However, this mechanism is reminiscent of how the cancer drug Gleevec achieves 3000-fold selectivity for Abl over Src, despite the fact that the two proteins share ~46 % sequence identity across the kinase domain, and ~86 % identity in the Gleevec-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Seeliger et al., 2007</xref>). The mechanism for the selectivity of Gleevec long eluded explanation. As we found here, a few residue swaps based on sequence alignments and structure gazing failed to rescue the affinity of Src for Gleevec, because these mutations failed to account for the higher-order epistatic interactions that contribute to specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Seeliger et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, because evolution has sampled kinase sequence space under the constraints of epistasis, retracing the evolutionary trajectories that led to extant Src and Abl kinases, using ancestral reconstruction, allowed Wilson et al. to identify residues involved in a hydrogen-bonding network distant from the Gleevec-binding interface that are key for selective binding to Abl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We used an alternative approach to discover a set of residues that contribute to specificity, turning to structure-based modeling. Using dTERMen, we scored the compatibility of different sequences with the ENAH-PCARE<sup>828–848</sup> structure template and identified residues in EVL that are incompatible with this binding mode. Our method solved the challenging problem of identifying mutations within an epistatic network that contribute to function. Importantly, this facile method is easily generalizable to many protein systems as long as a structure is available.</p><p>Our results demonstrate an intriguing example of how nature has evolved a protein that achieves selectivity by exploiting a conformation accessible to only one paralog, rather than by making contacts with paralog-specific residues. Our findings raise the question of how widely this mechanism of selectivity is used by other paralogous families, especially within modular interaction domain families. As evidenced by residues identified by dTERMen in our residue swap experiments, hydrophobic core packing plays a key role in enabling new ligand-bound conformations. A recent study demonstrated that randomizing hydrophobic core residues of the SH3 domain from human Fyn tyrosine kinase could effectively switch its affinity and specificity to different ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ben-David et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, directed evolution experiments that varied only the hydrophobic core residues of ubiquitin yielded a conformationally stabilized ubiquitin variant that was specific for the deubiquitinase USP7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). These results hint that such mechanisms of conformational specificity could be widespread.</p><p>The PCARE peptide identified in this study will serve as a valuable research tool to dissect ENAH-specific biological functions in cells. Cytoplasmic expression of a PCARE peptide displaces ENAH from focal adhesions but not membrane protrusions, indicating that this peptide could serve as a valuable tool to selectively perturb EVH1-dependent functions of ENAH. In contrast, a mito-tagged PCARE peptide selectively sequesters ENAH at the mitochondria, depleting it from sites of normal function and inhibiting ENAH-dependent biological processes such as cell adhesion. This is likely due to the high avidity of these peptides when localized to the mitochondrial surface, which could potentially outcompete interactions between the EVH2 domain of ENAH and actin-based structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bachmann et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>There is emerging evidence in the literature that paralog-specific functions exist within the Ena/VASP family. For example, ENAH, but not VASP or EVL, is a regulator of local translation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vidaki et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, EVL has a specific role in durotactic invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Puleo et al., 2019</xref>). Our mito-tagged peptides will serve as valuable research reagents in uncovering and characterizing ENAH-specific molecular functions in other tissues, such as the retina. Interestingly, although VASP is phosphorylated at Tyr39 by c-Abl, we did not find direct evidence in the literature for corresponding phosphorylation of ENAH at the analogous position Tyr38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maruoka et al., 2012</xref>). ENAH is a substrate of c-Abl, but experiments by Tani et al. using transfected murine ENAH or ENAH mutants, c-Abl, and the adapter protein Abi1 showed that the ENAH modification site is Tyr 296; the mutation Y296F ablated the phosphorylation signal, indicating that Y38 is not a site of modification, at least under the tested conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tani et al., 2003</xref>). This has implications for the mechanism of specificity of our dual-motif inhibitors, such as PCARE-Dual, which we showed binds eightfold weaker to ENAH Y38E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Cellular conditions in which there is phosphorylation of the backside site of VASP (and perhaps EVL) but not ENAH could further increase the specificity of inhibitor targeting.</p><p>The role of ENAH in cancer metastasis has motivated work to identify inhibitors of its EVH1-mediated interactions, and extensive structure-based design and chemical optimization recently led to a high-affinity molecule (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 120 nM) that reduced breast cancer cell extravasation in a zebrafish model. This compound and its analogs mimic the PPII conformation of an FP4 motif. However, because the molecule binds to the highly conserved FP4-binding site, this inhibitor has similar affinity for ENAH, EVL, and VASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barone et al., 2020</xref>). Paralog-specific Ena/VASP inhibitors could have higher therapeutic potential, given the antagonistic roles of ENAH and EVL in promoting and suppressing breast cancer metastasis. ENAH deficiency in mouse models of cancer has been shown to decrease metastasis by reducing tumor cell invasion and intravasation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roussos et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, EVL is known to promote the formation of cortical actin bundles that suppress the invasion of breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Padilla-Rodriguez et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, developing high-affinity, paralog-specific inhibitors of Ena/VASP proteins could be crucial in reducing pleiotropic side effects when treating metastasis. Although there are many obstacles to developing peptides as therapeutic inhibitors of cytoplasmic targets, vigorous research on a wide range of strategies for delivering peptides and even complete proteins into cells is ongoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Independent of these advances, the exquisite affinity and specificity of the PCARE B peptide for ENAH firmly establishes the possibility of paralog-selective targeting in this family, providing key proof of principle for the development of conformationally specific therapies based either on peptides or peptide-mimicking small molecules to treat ENAH-dependent diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Samples were resolved by SDS–PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR) for 1 hr and incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies. Primary antibodies were used as follows: mouse Actin 1:2,500 (ProteinTech Group, 66009-1-Ig), mouse GAPDH 1:1000 (Cell Signaling Technology, 5174 S), rabbit ENAH 1:250 (Sigma, HPA028696), rabbit EVL 1:1000 (Sigma, HPA018849), rabbit VASP 1:1000 (Cell Signaling Technology, 3132 S). Membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to either Alexa Fluor 680 or 790 (Thermo Fisher) for 1 hr. Immunoblots were scanned using Odyssey CLx imager (LI-COR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>MCF7 cells were fixed and immunolabeled 8 hr after plating onto fibronectin (10 μg/ml; Corning) coated coverslips to assay focal adhesions. Cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA; Electron Microscopy Services) with 0.075 mg/ml saponin (<italic>Alfa Aesar</italic>, Sigma) diluted in PBS at 37 °C for 10 min. PFA was quenched with 100 mM glycine in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were then blocked in 1 % BSA plus 1 % FBS in PBS either overnight at 4 °C or for 1 hr at room temperature. The following immunofluorescence reagents and antibodies were used: mouse anti-Paxillin (1:200, clone: 349; BD Biosciences, 612405), rabbit anti-ENAH (1:100; HPA028448, Sigma), goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 647 (1:1000, Thermo Fisher), donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 405 (Abcam), and Alexa Fluor 488- and Alexa Fluor 647-Phalloidin (1:40, Thermo Fisher). Primary antibodies were diluted in block solution and incubated for 1.5 hr at room temperature. After washing, coverslips were incubated for 1 hr in secondary antibody solution with fluorescently labeled phalloidin. Coverslips were mounted using ProLong Gold Antifade (Invitrogen) and allowed to cure for at least 24 hr before imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Microscopy and image analysis</title><p>Cells were imaged on a Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon), with a ×100 Apo TIRF 1.49 NA objective (Nikon) and an ORCA-Flash 4.0 V2 CMOS camera (Hamamatsu). For focal adhesion assessment, cells were imaged with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. To increase the depth of imaging for examination of mitochondrial localization, standard widefield fluorescence microscopy was used. Focal adhesion quantification was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Puleo et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, a binary mask was generated for paxillin signal and actin signal, denoting focal adhesions and cell area, respectively. To facilitate semiautomated segmentation of focal adhesions, we generated a sharp, high contrast image of the paxillin and actin channels by the following processing steps: deconvolution using five iterations of the Richardson–Lucy algorithm, shading correction using rolling ball, and unsharp masked (NIS Elements). Focal adhesion area was quantified by measuring the paxillin area of each cell within the whole cell area, or by examining individual focal adhesions. Enrichment ratio was quantified by measuring the mean fluorescence intensity of mRuby2-PCARE B, Mito-mRuby2-PCARE B, or GFP-ENAH/EVL/VASP at regions of interest and normalizing to average cytosolic intensity. Each experimental condition was performed in triplicate and plotted together. Images presented in figures have been lightly processed in NIS Elements, including by applying 2 iterations of the Richardson–Lucy deconvolution algorithm and rolling ball shading correction to reduce background in live cell images.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Resources, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Protein sequences for A distributed residue network permits conformational binding specificity in a conserved family of actin remodelers.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70601-supp1-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Refinement table for ENAH-PCARE crystal structure.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70601-supp2-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70601-transrepform1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Diffraction data have been deposited in the PDB with the accession code 7LXF.

PCARE) coming out of a proteome-wide screen for peptides that can bind to the EVH1 domain of ENAH, one of the three highly homologous Ena/VASP actin regulators. Surprisingly PCARE binds to ENAH selectively over the other two members of Ena/VASP family, EVL and VASP. The authors provide a nice explanation for how this selectivity is achieved and develop a peptide PCARE-Dual that specifically binds ENAH more tightly, setting out the stage for developing potent and selective inhibitors for ENAH.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70601.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Hening</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Hening</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Nicholson</surname><given-names>Linda</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.05.27.445944">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.27.445944v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Hening Lin as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor.

Please add to the introduction a description of the Acevedo et al., 2017 work provides the basis for design of the dual-motif ligands. Titled &quot;A Noncanonical Binding Site in the EVH1 Domain of Vasodilator-Stimulated Phosphoprotein Regulates Its Interactions with the Proline Rich Region of Zyxin&quot;, this paper identified and characterized the novel secondary binding site on the opposite face of the VASP-EVH1 domain that was exploited in design of the dual-motif ligands investigated in the current work.</p><p>2. The possible regulation of the interaction of ENAH with their dual-motif ligands by phosphorylation of ENAH should be addressed. An additional key finding of the Acevedo 2017 paper was that binding to the secondary site is inhibited by mutation of VASP EVH1 residue Y39 to E, providing a potential explanation for regulation of the VASP-Zyxin interaction by Abl-catalyzed phosphorylation of Y39. ENAH is also a reported target of Abl, and the VASP-Y39-equivalent residue is conserved in ENAH and EVL. The bivalent advantage the authors have designed in their dual-motif ligands could potentially be regulated by phosphorylation of this Y, with implications for their proposed use of a dual-motif ligand for &quot;dissecting specific Ena/VASP functions in processes including cancer cell invasion&quot; and &quot;as a promising lead for developing therapies to treat ENAH-dependent diseases.&quot; It would provide essential context if the authors addressed this very important aspect.</p><p>3. It would strengthen the structural conclusions if it could be demonstrated that untethered PCARE peptide binds in the same orientation as observed in their crystal structure of the fusion protein. The main concern is that tethering the peptide to the C-terminus could constrain the binding options of the peptide (i.e., force a binding mode that differs from the biological interaction). For the VASP/Zyxin interaction, the application of NMR enabled the untethered and tethered binding interactions to be matched using chemical shift perturbations. Ideally, EVAH-EVH1 complexed with a tight-binding PCARE peptide (perhaps PCARE-Dual) could be crystallized and its structure determined. Otherwise, the possibility that fusion of the binding partners might influence the binding mode should be addressed.</p><p>4. Figure 2B: The quantification of colocalization in focal adhesions can be more rigorously done using ImageJ along with a plugin for colocalization. The cross-section plots &quot;along a line through focal adhesions&quot; show individual examples but do not provide the necessary statistics on the degree of colocalization observed for each of the three paralogs.</p><p>5. Figure 2F: does the 4th row in each of the mRUBY2-PCARE B and Mito-mRUBY2-PCARE B columns show visualization of mRUBY2? This should be labeled on the vertical edge, as the other 3 rows are. It would be helpful to keep the same vertical order of protein being visualized; currently the 4-row column is ordered Pax/ENAH/PCARE and the enlarged boxes are Pax/PCARE/ENAH.</p><p>6. It would be very helpful to add some discussion of the biological function of PCARE and its connection to actin dynamics.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The impact of this work could be enhanced if key elements from both manuscript were combined into a single, more comprehensive paper.

Our biolayer interferometry experiments were carried out in a buffer that contained 1 mM DTT to prevent the formation of disulfide-mediated oligomers. We now also demonstrate that EVL Y62C runs at the same volume as EVL V65P in size exclusion chromatography, ruling out the possibility that this mutation leads to formation of a dimer or other higher-order state; see Supplementary File 1.</p><p>To test whether the higher affinity of EVL Y62C V65P for PCARE could be attributed to the Y62C mutation alone, we measured binding for EVL Y62C, and found K<sub>D</sub> = 19 ± 2.8 μM; now included in Table 1. This value is almost unchanged from binding of wt EVL (K<sub>D</sub> = 22 ± 1.5 μM), which demonstrates that this mutation is not sufficient to confer high-affinity of binding to PCARE on EVL. We describe this result and its implications on p. 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For the structure, EVAH EVH1 is fused to the PCARE peptide. There is concern that the fusion may affect the binding interaction. Some experimental data is needed to address this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>Covalently linking a motif-containing peptide to a domain that it binds to solve a structure is a standard approach, particularly in the short linear motif field. We added references on p. 4 to provide background about this point. But we shared the reviewers’ concern about the fusion potentially affecting the binding mode and took care to design a linker that would not constrain the binding. Specifically, our crystallization construct consisted of the ENAH EVH1 domain followed by a 6-residue Gly-Ser linker, and then a 36-amino acid segment from PCARE (PCARE<sup>813-848</sup>). In truncation experiments, we determined that the N-terminal 13 residues of the PCARE peptide (residues 813-825) are dispensable for the high-affinity binding and we now emphasize this point on p. 4-5. In addition, in our crystal structure, there is no continuous density for the Gly-Ser linker or for PCARE residues 813 – 825, consistent with the linker being disordered and not engaged with ENAH. In contrast, we see clear electron density for PCARE<sup>828-848</sup>, which coincides almost exactly with the regions that we identified as necessary for high affinity binding in solution. Thus, our biochemical experiments support what we see in the crystal structure.</p><p>We were further reassured by mutational experiments in EVL EVH1 domain that showed: (1) mutations in regions of the EVL EVH1 domain corresponding to those that contact the C-terminal tail of PCARE in the ENAH-PCARE structure affected PCARE binding but not ActA binding (i.e. EVL V65P/Y62C in Table 1), strongly suggesting that this region is involved in binding the C-terminal tail of PCARE, and (2) we successfully redesigned the EVL EVH1 domain to confer high-affinity binding of PCARE by making mutations entirely guided by the ENAH-PCARE structure.</p><p>However, because these mutations were made in EVL, not ENAH, in response to the reviews, we have made and tested a mutation to a residue of ENAH that contacts the C-terminal part of PCARE in the structure and is remote from the poly-proline region (which binds as expected in the canonical groove): mutation P65D. This point mutation leads to a negligible, 1.40-fold change in the binding affinity of ActA (a canonical FP4 binder), indicating that the structure of the domain remains intact, but it weakens binding of PCARE by 167-fold. The dissociation constant for the mutant, which we determined to be 32 ± 3 μM, is similar to that for other FP4-containing peptides that lack affinity enhancing elements. This is what we would predict, based on our structure, if PCARE lost the extra, non-canonical, affinity-enhancing interactions with ENAH that we observe. We chose the P65D mutation to be highly diagnostic of this binding mode, as shown in Figure 3. This additional experiment directly tests and supports the geometry that we observe in the high-resolution crystal structure. We have described the new mutant on p. 5 and added it to Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some experiments to show the physiological interaction between PCARE and EVAH is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>An interaction between PCARE and ENAH has been reported in two separate affinity purification-mass spectrometry experiments, and the two proteins have also been shown to co-localize at ciliary expansions, providing excellent support for the physiological relevance of the biochemical interaction that we observe in this work. We put more emphasis on this synergistic work from cell-based studies on p. 2 and on p. 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Revise the text/Figures according to reviewer suggestions.</p></disp-quote><p>We describe changes that we have made to reviewer suggestions below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I recommend the authors to revise the text to address the questions that I raised in the public review section.

Titled &quot;A Noncanonical Binding Site in the EVH1 Domain of Vasodilator-Stimulated Phosphoprotein Regulates Its Interactions with the Proline Rich Region of Zyxin&quot;, this paper identified and characterized the novel secondary binding site on the opposite face of the VASP-EVH1 domain that was exploited in design of the dual-motif ligands investigated in the current work.</p></disp-quote><p>This paper was very important for our work and we now highlight it in the Introduction, as well as in other parts of the paper, to make sure that the important context of our study is clear to readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The possible regulation of the interaction of ENAH with their dual-motif ligands by phosphorylation of ENAH should be addressed. An additional key finding of the Acevedo 2017 paper was that binding to the secondary site is inhibited by mutation of VASP EVH1 residue Y39 to E, providing a potential explanation for regulation of the VASP-Zyxin interaction by Abl-catalyzed phosphorylation of Y39.

However, it is interesting that Tani et al., report that the site on ENAH that is phosphorylated by Abl (in the presence of Abi1) is not the Y39-equivalent residue Y38 but in fact Y296. We were not able to find any direct evidence of the phosphorylation of ENAH Y38. This raises the intriguing (but undemonstrated) possibility that different phosphorylation specificity, combined with dual-site inhibitors, might further enhance paralog specificity of molecules like PCARE-dual. We added the new data for ENAH Y38E and a discussion of this point on p. 6 and p. 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
