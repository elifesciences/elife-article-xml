Protein synthesis is commonly measured by labeling the nascent proteome with amino acid analogs or isotope-containing amino acids. These methods have been difficult to implement in vivo as they require lengthy amino acid replacement procedures. O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) is a puromycin analog that incorporates into nascent polypeptide chains. Through its terminal alkyne, OPP can be conjugated to a fluorophore-azide for directly visualizing nascent protein synthesis, or to a biotin-azide for capture and identification of newly-synthesized proteins. To achieve cell type-specific OPP incorporation, we developed phenylacetyl-OPP (PhAc-OPP), a puromycin analog harboring an enzyme-labile blocking group that can be removed by penicillin G acylase (PGA). Here, we show that cell type-specific PGA expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can be used to achieve OPP labeling of newly-synthesized proteins in targeted cell populations within the brain. Following a brief 2 hr incubation of intact brains with PhAc-OPP, we observe robust imaging and affinity purification of OPP-labeled nascent proteins in PGA-targeted cell populations. We apply this method to show a pronounced age-related decline in neuronal protein synthesis in the fly brain, demonstrating the capability of PhAc-OPP to quantitatively capture in vivo protein synthesis states. This method, which we call POPPi (<italic>P</italic>GA-dependent <italic>OPP i</italic>ncorporation), should be applicable for rapidly visualizing protein synthesis and identifying nascent proteins synthesized under diverse physiological and pathological conditions with cellular specificity in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteome</kwd><kwd>puromycin</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>OHSU Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Newly-synthesized protein can be labeled with cellular specificity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain using the puromycin analog PhAc-OPP coupled to expression of the unblocking enzyme PGA in a tissue or cell type of interest.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Controlled protein synthesis plays a fundamental role in orchestrating gene expression, and cellular protein amounts are thought to be primarily determined at the level of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schwanhäusser et al., 2011</xref>). Translational control is integral to cellular development and homeostasis and becomes dysregulated in numerous disease states including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robichaud and Sonenberg, 2017</xref>), autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gkogkas et al., 2013</xref>), and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wiebe et al., 2020</xref>). Within a complex organ like the brain, the specialized and distinct properties of neuronal and glial subtypes arise from variable expression of many protein components which are subject to translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doyle et al., 2008</xref>). Regulation of global protein synthesis as well as the modulated synthesis of specific proteins at the synapse is important in synaptic plasticity and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sossin and Costa-Mattioli, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Despite advances in assessing the transcriptome with cellular resolution, mRNA levels are an imprecise surrogate for protein abundance, and methods to capture the nascent proteome of individual cell populations in vivo have lagged behind. Current methods employ indiscriminate protein synthesis labeling in all cells of a tissue followed by flow sorting of tagged cell suspensions from these tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hidalgo San Jose and Signer, 2019</xref>) or regional microdissection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Griesser et al., 2020</xref>) and suffer from a lack of precision or substantial loss of protein. An alternative method for quantifying protein synthesis is through non-canonical amino acid (NCAA) protein labeling, using methionine analogs. This approach recently progressed toward cell-type specificity through the expression of engineered methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez-Castelao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erdmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tanrikulu et al., 2009</xref>). Only mutant MetRS can charge methionyl-tRNA with azidonorleucine (ANL) which is amenable to protein capture by BONCAT (biorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging) and visualization by FUNCAT (fluorescent non-canonical amino acid tagging) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez-Castelao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erdmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tanrikulu et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, nascent protein labeling is restricted to cells that express mutant MetRS. However, this labeling strategy requires extended dietary methionine depletion and lengthy ANL feeding in mice or 1–2d of ANL feeding in flies, and chronic feeding is associated with significant developmental toxicity and behavioral deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez-Castelao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erdmann et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A potentially more efficient approach to protein synthesis labeling is through the use of puromycin analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Puromycin is structurally similar to tyrosyl tRNA, yet its incorporation is not amino acid-specific, hence in contrast to NCAA, its incorporation into nascent proteins is not biased by their sequence or extent of methionine content. This facilitates more uniform incorporation into newly-synthesized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nathans, 1964</xref>), which is advantageous in the assessment of global protein synthesis. One caveat to this approach is that puromycin incorporation results in premature chain termination and therefore the production of truncated puromycylated proteins that, while still generally amenable to MS-based proteomic analysis, may be targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation. Addition of an O-propargyl group to puromycin allows visualization or capture of newly-synthesized protein via click-chemistry conjugation to a fluorophore-azide or a biotin-tagged azide, respectively, and has been successfully demonstrated in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) and in cells isolated from OP-puromycin (OPP)-injected animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hidalgo San Jose and Signer, 2019</xref>). We developed an analog of OPP called PhAc-OPP that harbors an enzyme-labile blocking group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett et al., 2016</xref>). This blocking group renders OPP incapable of nascent protein incorporation until its removal by the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme PGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, targeted expression of PGA can, in principle, be used to limit OPP proteome labeling to individual cell populations within animal tissues. To directly test this, we generated PGA-transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> and developed a method that we call POPPi for rapid, cell type-specific labeling of protein synthesis in intact fly brains. Here, we show that POPPi is a versatile labeling strategy that can achieve efficient visualization and identification of newly-synthesized proteins in a cell population of interest. Our approach enables cell-specific nascent proteome labeling from complex brain tissue within just a few hours, making it a powerful and efficient tool for examining the role of translational control in different physiological and pathological states.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We previously demonstrated that neuronal PGA expression successfully converts PhAc-OPP to OPP, thus enabling OPP labeling of nascent proteins in cultured primary mouse neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Toward cell type-specific protein labeling in complex nervous system tissue in vivo, we generated a transgenic PGA fly line that can express FLAG-tagged PGA when crossed to any of the commonly available fly lines expressing a cell type-specific GAL4 driver of choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Following ubiquitous PGA expression, we assessed PGA levels in embryos and the brains of larvae, pupae, and adults. PGA expression is detectable in both developing and adult flies, with the highest expression levels seen in larval and pupal brains, followed by adult brains and embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

To examine whether isolated adult fly brains exhibit stable protein synthesis, we generated fly brain preparations and assessed <sup>35</sup>S-methionine/cysteine incorporation levels over 8 hr. We observe no significant change in global protein synthesis rates over this time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that protein synthesis is stable in newly-isolated whole brain preparations and that these may therefore be suitable for capturing in vivo protein synthesis states.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) labeling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Global protein synthesis (<sup>35</sup>S-met/cys incorporation) is unaltered for 8 hr in newly-isolated <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> whole brain preparations (ANOVA, n.s. n=4–5 groups of 8–10 brains per timepoint).

We hypothesized that this could be accomplished in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain through OPP labeling of nascent polypeptide chains (NPC) followed by click-chemistry conjugation to either a fluorophore-azide for protein visualization or a biotin-azide for protein capture (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We first assessed whether unblocked OPP can label newly-synthesized proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain explants. Widespread OPP incorporation into newly-synthesized protein is clearly visible across the adult brain when coupled to the fluorophore-azide AF488-azide for detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The extent of incorporation is dependent on OPP concentration and slightly on incubation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and is blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), indicating that it is protein synthesis-dependent. Labeling is most prominently seen in the cell cortex, the location of cell bodies within the fly brain, consistent with the majority of protein synthesis occurring within the cell soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Theoretically, the protein synthesis imaged through this approach could represent OPP incorporation into a wide array of translating proteins or be restricted to a few highly-expressed proteins. In-gel fluorescence assessment of electrophoretically-separated brain extracts reveals that OPP-labeled proteins span the whole molecular weight range, while a minor degree of non-specific background AF488-azide incorporation is seen in the absence of OPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This finding suggests that OPP is efficiently and unbiasedly incorporated into a broad set of proteins, which is also consistent with prior studies from OPP labeling of cultured human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Forester et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rapid cell type-specific protein synthesis labeling with PhAc-OPP</title><p>We next assessed if targeted PGA expression can promote PhAc-OPP unblocking and OPP labeling of newly-synthesized proteins in cell populations of interest. We expressed PGA pan-neuronally in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain using the <italic>elavC155-GAL4</italic> driver, which we confirmed by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and then treated freshly-isolated brain explants with PhAc-OPP for 2 hr. Robust neuronal protein synthesis labeling is seen following PhAc-OPP treatment, but not in the absence of PhAc-OPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or in PhAc-OPP treated brains in the absence of GAL4-driven PGA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that PhAc-OPP is not substantially uncaged in the absence of PGA expression and therefore that it can be reliably used to label newly-synthesized protein in targeted cell populations expressing PGA. The extent of labeling is time-dependent, although appears to be maximal at around 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This is consistent with a prior study of OPP labeling in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), and with a scenario that OPP-peptide conjugates eventually undergo turnover.

PhAc-OPP differs from OP-puromycin by the addition of a phenylacetyl group and <italic>N</italic>- (benzyloxy) carbamate spacer which renders PhAc-OPP more hydrophobic than OP-puromycin. This is anticipated to enhance the ability of PhAc-OPP to penetrate cell membranes by diffusion, while diluted concentrations can still be prepared in an aqueous solution for tissue incubation (see Materials and methods).</p><p>One potential concern surrounding the use of puromycin labeling is that its incorporation into NPC causes chain termination, therefore, at high-enough doses, it could impede cellular protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). This may be circumvented by finding an optimal concentration of puromycin (or analog) which permits sufficient labeling for detection while having minimal impact on total protein synthesis. We assessed this in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brains and found that 100 μM PhAc-OPP allowed us to obtain robust and rapid proteome labeling while not observing significant deficits in global protein synthesis that were seen at a higher concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Another consequence of chain termination when occurring prematurely is the production of truncated protein. Interestingly, we were only able to detect what appears to be full-length protein by western blot following neutravidin enrichment and blotting for individual proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and F</xref>). While truncated proteins may be targeted for degradation and thus depleted from the lysate pool, another simple explanation for this observation is that all antibodies we used which have reported epitopes bind to C-terminal epitopes. These would be missing in truncated proteins, thus precluding their detection using these antibodies.</p><p>We assessed whether ectopic PGA expression in fly cell populations perturbs organism development, function, or survival. In contrast to ubiquitous PGA expression, neither neuronal nor glial PGA expression has any discernible negative impact on development, adult function, or survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, when expressed in individual nervous system cell populations, PGA expression seems to be well tolerated. This may provide an advantage over existing NCAA-based cell-specific labeling strategies, where chronic ANL feeding to flies prior to proteomic assessment significantly impairs fly eclosion as well as negative geotaxis behavior in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erdmann et al., 2015</xref>). There are additional concerns over how chronic NCAA feeding in this approach might affect protein abundance and overall proteome makeup. For example, the replacement of methionine with the NCAA L-azidohomoalanine (AHA) was seen to cause substantial changes in the abundance of numerous proteins in HeLa cells while AHA incorporation into the developing mouse proteome results in altered expression of about 10% of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calve et al., 2016</xref>). It is also currently unclear whether long-term NCAA administration disrupts eukaryotic metabolism given that AHA and L-homopropargylglycine (HPG) were found to alter global metabolism in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Steward et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together with the fact that NCAA labeling requires extended dietary methionine depletion, lengthy feeding with amino acid analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez-Castelao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erdmann et al., 2015</xref>), and that NCAA are not incorporated equally across the proteome, there are significant caveats associated with this labeling strategy that can be avoided using POPPi.</p><p>While here we focused on protein synthesis labeling in intact isolated brains, this method should in theory be amenable to proteome labeling in tissues throughout the body, wherever PGA can be adequately expressed. In support of this, we obtained preliminary evidence demonstrating the ability of PhAc-OPP to penetrate and label several bodily tissues (fat body, trachea, muscle, and salivary gland) under the same conditions used for protein synthesis labeling in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We also obtained preliminary evidence that PhAc-OPP can penetrate the brain when administered dietarily to intact flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Based on the magnitude of AF488-azide labeling, ingestion at the PhAc-OPP concentration range tested yields lower nascent protein labeling than we were able to achieve in brain explants at much lower concentrations, which we speculate may be due to comparatively lower levels of PhAc-OPP reaching the brain. Future studies will address whether labeling in other tissues can be achieved via dietary PhAc-OPP intake, as this approach may be crucial when tissues cannot be isolated and effectively sustained. Despite this uncertainty, the ability to rapidly quantify protein synthesis in cell populations within the CNS established here opens up many possibilities to address important questions pertaining to nervous system development, function, aging, and disease.</p><p>Current proteomic approaches for measuring protein synthesis harbor strengths and weaknesses compared to transcriptomic approaches. Ribosomal profiling and other ribosome capture methods such as TRAP measure ribosomal density on a given transcript which provides a proxy for the rate of protein synthesis but not an actual measure of protein product. Ribosomal profiling has provided important insights into mechanisms of translational control, yet, there are some weaknesses to the method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brar and Weissman, 2015</xref>). Perhaps most importantly, inferring protein synthesis rates from a single snapshot of average ribosomal occupancy on a given mRNA is based on assumptions that all ribosomes complete translation, and are not subject to regulated translational pausing or abortion at the time of capture or at any time prior to finishing translation. Additionally, the method itself may miss ribosomal footprints if nuclease digestion is incomplete, and give rise to false readouts of translation from contaminating non-coding RNA fragments. In contrast, assessing translation at the level of synthesized protein, e.g., through quantitative proteomics, should avoid errors associated with inferring protein synthesis rates from ribosomal occupancy, with the caveat that higher sensitivity limits relative to transcriptomic approaches may make transcriptomics the method of choice when starting material is low. We believe a potential major advantage of POPPi over existing methods for measuring cell type-specific protein synthesis is its efficiency, particularly for visualizing protein synthesis – PhAc-OPP labeling coupled to AF488-azide conjugation can be completed within a few hours (see Methods). Future work will seek to understand the full capabilities and limitations of POPPi, e.g., for profiling rare cell populations in the brain.</p><p>In summary, we provide a new labeling method for rapidly visualizing, capturing, and quantifying cell type-specific nascent proteomes within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain. We believe this method will be a powerful tool for studying the role of the proteome and translational control in nervous system function with cellular resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Briefly, flies were housed for 4 hr on dye-containing food with or without the presence of 4 mM PhAc-OPP, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, washed in chilled water, lysed in chilled water, centrifuged (15 min/13,000 rpm/4 °C) and supernatants were assessed for OD 620 nm (SpectraMax i3x). OD readings were normalized to the number of flies in the lysate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Samples were electrophoresed on 4–20% Tris-Glycine gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting using the following antibodies:</p><p>From the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank: Brp (nc82) 1:50; Synapsin-1 (3C11) 1:500; Syntaxin (8C3) 1:500; Drpr (1:1 mix of 5D14:8A1) 1:400; Repo (8D12) 1:200.

It is not clear what percentage of the newly synthesized polypeptides incorporate puromycin which would allow visualization or immunopurification of the protein through the use of azide conjugates. Since the inclusion of puromycin in the nascent peptide prevents further elongation of the nascent peptide, reaching the levels of puromycin to saturate the cells would likely be detrimental. On the other hand, when lower amounts of puromycin are used, it is likely that the lower expressed genes/polypeptides will not be labelled. In any case, the authors should estimate the ratio of the newly synthesized targeted by puromycin. This can be done by using PhAc-OPP in elav-Gal4 UAS-PGA brains in combination with azide-biotin and S35 methionine. This would allow immunopurification with an antibody specific for a protein (such as bruchpilot), measuring the level of S35, and a second immunopurification with streptavidin and measuring again with S35. This can allow the estimation of the percentage of newly synthesized proteins that are targeted by PhAc-OPP.</p><p>2. It is not clear how there can be clear full-size bands in the Western blots in figure 3. The addition of PhAc-OPP should truncate the protein at random sites that correspond to where the OPP is added to the nascent peptide. This should result in smears in principle unless there is a tendency of OPP to get incorporated towards the end of the protein. An explanation should be included in the discussion to help the reader understand the data better. This also undermines the argument that the fact that there are bands of different sizes suggests that the proteome is uniformly targeted. Since puromycin addition truncates the gene products at random positions, the band sizes should not be informative and indicative of unbiased labelling of the proteome.</p><p>3. Although the imaging using OPP and Alexa488-azide looks rather uniform labeling in figure 1C when PhAc-OPP is used in combination with elav-Gal4 or repo-Gal4 UAS-PGA, the Alexa488-azide signal is much more salt and pepper distributed in figure 2A and D (especially in the magnified insets). This is especially prominent in glia where very few of the mCherry expressing cells are labelled by Alexa488-azide in Figure 2D. This suggests that the proteome of some cells will be much higher represented in the samples when azide-biotin is used to immunopurified proteins expressed by a cell type, severely limiting the use of the technique.</p><p>4. The fact that OPP-mediated labeling is quite uniform suggests that the translation levels do not change very much between cells and the reason for the non-uniform signal in figure2 may result from the non-uniform expression of UAS-PGA. The authors should stain the elav-Gal4 or repo-Gal4 UAS-PGA with an anti-Flag antibody to check for non-uniform expression of PGA.</p><p>5. In figure 1 figure supplement 2B the authors should test incubation times that are between 0-2 hours better since at 2 hours the system already seems to be saturated.</p><p>In summary, the technique needs to be better characterized to be more usable by the fly community. In addition, the demonstration experiments to show that there is an age-dependent decrease in translation rates are not the most informative demonstration of the use of the technique. Hence, this manuscript needs major revision and a better demonstration of the use of the technique to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Rapid Cell Type-Specific Nascent Proteome Labeling in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined by the reviewer. It is really important to address these concerns in detail. Please can you do this at the earliest and submit a revised manuscript?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors satisfied the major concerns in my original review. However, I have an additional major concern.</p><p>The data presented do not convince me that POPPi is a robust and useful method for capturing and identifying newly-synthesized proteins in a cell type-specific manner (e.g. w/ biotin-azide). In the response to my concern of my original review, the authors suggest that background bands seen in negative control lanes of western blots (e.g. now Figure 4A) are due to non-specific AF488-azide incorporation into all proteins (newly synthesized + old). This is unexpected to me, as I had assumed the click chemistry was specific to OPP-labeled proteins. Regardless, assuming that non-OPP-labeled proteins are labeled by AF488-azide, I interpret the western blots in Figure 4A and Figure 4C as showing weak 'signal above background'. This is especially concerning because Figure 4A,C were performed by labeling a large portion of the cells within the collected tissue (pan-neuron and pan-glia). So, labeling in smaller subsets of cell types (e.g. dopaminergic neurons) would be expected to result in even lower 'signal above background'. I outline below additional thoughts and suggestions that could help address my concerns.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1. To more accurately assess the signal-to-background of cell type-specific labeled proteins, the authors should provide a proper negative control in Figure 4A and 4C. The &quot;vehicle-only&quot; negative control may underestimate the background levels of AF488-azide incorporation. I would argue that the most appropriate negative control is to incubate wild-type brains (e.g. elav&gt;GFP) with PhAc-OPP. Hypothetically, PhAc-OPP could be uncaged by endogenous fly enzymes, which would result in higher background levels than the vehicle-only control. As far as I can tell, the possibility of uncaging PhAc-OPP without PGA is not discussed and remains untested in this manuscript. Furthermore, line 203 &quot;PGA-dependent unblocking of PhAc-OPP…&quot; is thus not supported by their data using the &quot;vehicle-only&quot; negative control in Figure 4. I suggest that the authors repeat the data in Figure 4A and 4C using the appropriate negative control I mentioned.</p><p>2. The authors should provide western blots similar to Figures 4A,C, but using the biotin-azide labeling reagent. Since biotin-azide enables researchers to capture and detect OPP-labeled proteins using streptavidin-bead pulldown, it is critical that researchers understand the global signal-to-background when using this reagent. I suggest that the authors repeat Figure 4A,C using biotin-azide to label and streptavidin-fluorophore to detect. Furthermore, since <italic>Drosophila</italic> contains naturally biotinylated proteins, these new western blots would provide the fairest representation of signal-to-background. For example, naturally biotinylated proteins will bind to the streptavidin beads and thus be background on western blots and in Mass spectrometry (MS) data.</p><p>3. I would like to see MS data to support the data presented in Figure 4 B,D. These figures show that POPPi can enrich cell type-specific labeled proteins. However, the background bands for Synapsin, Syntaxin, and Draper are concerning and suggest the sensitivity of this method is low. To convince me that there is global signal over background, I would like to see MS analysis of samples in Figure 4B,D. For example, MS of streptavidin-pulldown from the following brain genotypes (1) elav&gt;PGA + PhAc-OPP, (2) repo&gt;PGA + PhAc-OPP, (3) elav&gt;GFP + PhAc-OPP. Using quantitative approaches such as TMT labeling or SAINT analysis, I would expect to see enrichment of Draper to glia and Syntaxin to neurons, for example.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I'm generally satisfied with the responses and changes to the manuscript. My only remaining request is that the authors include a line for PhAc-OPP in the Key Resources Table. Clearly, this is a key reagent, and the authors should be transparent that it is something that needs to be synthesized, which will likely limit how widespread the method is used by the community.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83545.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We observe concentration-dependent labeling with PhAc-OPP and AF488azide signal becomes significantly higher than background at concentrations ≥1 mM (Figure 7A and 7B). Importantly, flies appear to consume 4 mM PhAc-OPP-containing food in similar quantities to that of control food (Figure 7C), suggesting that food consumption is not significantly impaired by the presence of PhAc-OPP, even at the highest dose tested. These results suggest that PhAc-OPP administered dietarily can penetrate the brain at levels sufficient to obtain detectable albeit subtle nascent protein labeling. These results are described in the Results (line 265), Discussion (line 370) and Methods (line 438).</p><p>We addressed questions related to the pros/cons, sensitivity etc. of our method in new text added to the manuscript Discussion as follows:</p><p>“Current proteomic approaches for measuring protein synthesis harbor strengths and weaknesses compared to transcriptomic approaches. Ribosomal profiling and other ribosome capture methods such as TRAP measure ribosomal density on a given transcript which provides a proxy for the rate of protein synthesis but not an actual measure of protein product. Ribosomal profiling has provided important insights into mechanisms of translational control, yet, there are some weaknesses to the method (45). Perhaps most importantly, inferring protein synthesis rates from a single snapshot of average ribosomal occupancy on a given mRNA is based on assumptions that all ribosomes complete translation, and are not subject to regulated translational pausing or abortion at the time of capture or at any time prior to finishing translation. Additionally, the method itself may miss ribosomal footprints if nuclease digestion is incomplete, and give rise to false readouts of translation from contaminating non-coding RNA fragments. In contrast, assessing translation at the level of synthesized protein, e.g. through quantitative proteomics, should avoid errors associated with inferring protein synthesis rates from ribosomal occupancy, with the caveat that sensitivity limits relative to transcriptomic approaches may make transcriptomics the method of choice when starting material is low. We believe a potential major advantage of POPPi over existing methods for measuring cell type-specific protein synthesis is its efficiency, particularly for visualizing protein synthesis – PhAc-OPP labeling coupled to AF488-azide conjugation can be completed within a few hours (see Methods). Future work will seek to understand the full capabilities and limitations of POPPi, e.g. for profiling rare cell populations in the brain.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The epitope for Syntaxin has not been mapped. Hence, the depletion of truncated proteins combined with an inability to detect them using the available antibodies used in this study likely explain their absence of western blots.

However, another simple explanation is that commercially available antibodies used for Brp, Synapsin and Draper are all reported to recognize epitopes at the C-terminal end of these proteins, which would be absent in most truncated protein and therefore not detectable on Western blot. The epitope for Syntaxin has not been mapped. Hence, the combined depletion of truncated proteins in addition to an inability to detect them using the available antibodies used in this study likely explain their absence of western blots. We added this interpretation to the Discussion (line 337).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. It is not clear what percentage of the newly synthesized polypeptides incorporate puromycin which would allow visualization or immunopurification of the protein through the use of azide conjugates. Since the inclusion of puromycin in the nascent peptide prevents further elongation of the nascent peptide, reaching the levels of puromycin to saturate the cells would likely be detrimental. On the other hand, when lower amounts of puromycin are used, it is likely that the lower expressed genes/polypeptides will not be labelled. In any case, the authors should estimate the ratio of the newly synthesized targeted by puromycin. This can be done by using PhAc-OPP in elav-Gal4 UAS-PGA brains in combination with azide-biotin and S35 methionine. This would allow immunopurification with an antibody specific for a protein (such as bruchpilot), measuring the level of S35, and a second immunopurification with streptavidin and measuring again with S35. This can allow the estimation of the percentage of newly synthesized proteins that are targeted by PhAc-OPP.</p></disp-quote><p>This is conceptually an interesting approach, although we believe there are major practical constraints that render this approach and the suggested experiment unlikely to provide quantitatively meaningful results. First, IP would likely not work well since the available antibodies to our assessed cell type-specific proteins bind to Cterminal epitopes, thus missing any truncated protein fragments and therefore likely a substantial portion of labeled newly-synthesized protein. Second, streptavidin enrichment is expected to enrich all labeled cellular protein, not just the protein-ofinterest, and hence, the <sup>35</sup>S signal for any single protein-of-interest would have to be distinguished from all the other proteins in the eluate. This is potentially feasible by combining autoradiography with western blot, yet due to the antibody issue mentioned above, we would again likely miss any truncated labeled protein present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is not clear how there can be clear full-size bands in the Western blots in figure 3. The addition of PhAc-OPP should truncate the protein at random sites that correspond to where the OPP is added to the nascent peptide. This should result in smears in principle unless there is a tendency of OPP to get incorporated towards the end of the protein. An explanation should be included in the discussion to help the reader understand the data better. This also undermines the argument that the fact that there are bands of different sizes suggests that the proteome is uniformly targeted. Since puromycin addition truncates the gene products at random positions, the band sizes should not be informative and indicative of unbiased labelling of the proteome.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to the last comment of Reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Although the imaging using OPP and Alexa488-azide looks rather uniform labeling in figure 1C when PhAc-OPP is used in combination with elav-Gal4 or repo-Gal4 UAS-PGA, the Alexa488-azide signal is much more salt and pepper distributed in figure 2A and D (especially in the magnified insets). This is especially prominent in glia where very few of the mCherry expressing cells are labelled by Alexa488-azide in Figure 2D. This suggests that the proteome of some cells will be much higher represented in the samples when azide-biotin is used to immunopurified proteins expressed by a cell type, severely limiting the use of the technique.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, glial cell bodies populate the brain cell cortex at much lower numbers than neurons, but cortex glia form an extensive network around their surrounding neurons with each glial cell encapsulating many neurons. This gives the membrane-tethered mCherry signal a honeycomb-like appearance where the majority of mCherry signal is not from glial cell bodies but from glial membrane extensions that spread across the neuronal network (Figure 2D). While these membrane extensions do not appear AF488-azide labeled, most of the solidly-filled glial cell bodies do, consistent with predominant cell body protein synthesis labeling we observe with neurons and with unblocked OPP. However, we acknowledge that there appears to be more overall cellto-cell variability in generally cellular AF488-azide signal when brains are incubated in PhAc-OPP compared to unblocked OPP, although there is also some variability in labeling with unblocked OPP (Figure 1C and Figure 1 —figure supplement 2), which is not dependent on PGA-induced unblocking. This suggests that variability in protein synthesis labeling may be partly due to cell-to-cell differences in global translation, and partly due to differences in PGA expression (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The fact that OPP-mediated labeling is quite uniform suggests that the translation levels do not change very much between cells and the reason for the non-uniform signal in figure2 may result from the non-uniform expression of UAS-PGA. The authors should stain the elav-Gal4 or repo-Gal4 UAS-PGA with an anti-Flag antibody to check for non-uniform expression of PGA.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed FLAG immunostaining of <italic>elav-Gal4&gt;UAS-PGA</italic> adult brains and observed non-uniform FLAG levels between cells suggesting a degree of cell-to-cell variability in PGA expression. The data are presented in Figure 2 —figure supplement 1 and described in the Results (line 168).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In figure 1 figure supplement 2B the authors should test incubation times that are between 0-2 hours better since at 2 hours the system already seems to be saturated.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, at 2h of labeling with unblocked OPP labeling, AF488-azide signal is close to maximal and based on this OPP result, we focused on shorter time points (e.g. 1 hour) with PhAc-OPP (Figure 2B). We did not pursue additional time points with unblocked OPP, since PhAc-OPP is the main focus of our study.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors satisfied the major concerns in my original review. However, I have an additional major concern.</p><p>The data presented do not convince me that POPPi is a robust and useful method for capturing and identifying newly-synthesized proteins in a cell type-specific manner (e.g. w/ biotin-azide). In the response to my concern of my original review, the authors suggest that background bands seen in negative control lanes of western blots (e.g. now Figure 4A) are due to non-specific AF488-azide incorporation into all proteins (newly synthesized + old). This is unexpected to me, as I had assumed the click chemistry was specific to OPP-labeled proteins. Regardless, assuming that non-OPP-labeled proteins are labeled by AF488-azide, I interpret the western blots in Figure 4A and Figure 4C as showing weak 'signal above background'. This is especially concerning because Figure 4A,C were performed by labeling a large portion of the cells within the collected tissue (pan-neuron and pan-glia). So, labeling in smaller subsets of cell types (e.g. dopaminergic neurons) would be expected to result in even lower 'signal above background'. I outline below additional thoughts and suggestions that could help address my concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased that our resubmitted manuscript satisfied major concerns in the Reviewer’s original review.</p><p>Regarding the additional point raised, it is important to note that the presence of background AF488-azide binding to protein is mainly restricted to brain lysates as we do not see significant background in control groups assessed in confocal imaged wholemount brains (Figure 2A, C and D) or other fly tissues (Figure 3) incubated in PhAcOPP then in AF488-azide. We would also like to point out that these gels show total brain lysates, i.e. there is no enrichment for labeled protein. As indicated in our original response, our primary intended application for the AF488-azide reagent is to visualize protein synthesis by confocal imaging whole-mount brains (as in Figures 2A, C and D). The data in previous Figures 4A and 4C were only intended to show that protein synthesis visualized in brains imaged by confocal microscopy was not merely derived from just a few labeled proteins, but from a range of proteins that span the molecular weight range of the gel.</p><p>In order to address the Reviewer’s concern, we have performed additional experiments to incorporate the requested control group for in-gel fluorescence assays and also to show total OPP-labeled protein from neuronal and glial proteomes by the biotin tagging and pulldown method, as described more below. Our new data clearly demonstrates strong signal-to-background for cell type-specific protein synthesis labeling by PhAcOPP, that matches the strong signal-to-background already seen in imaging data from fly brain and other tissues. This, coupled to data showing our ability to enrich for cell type-specific proteins following labeling in targeted cell populations provides rigorous quality control for our method and demonstrates its clear utility for achieving robust cell type-specific protein synthesis labeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1. To more accurately assess the signal-to-background of cell type-specific labeled proteins, the authors should provide a proper negative control in Figure 4A and 4C. The &quot;vehicle-only&quot; negative control may underestimate the background levels of AF488-azide incorporation. I would argue that the most appropriate negative control is to incubate wild-type brains (e.g. elav&gt;GFP) with PhAc-OPP. Hypothetically, PhAc-OPP could be uncaged by endogenous fly enzymes, which would result in higher background levels than the vehicle-only control. As far as I can tell, the possibility of uncaging PhAc-OPP without PGA is not discussed and remains untested in this manuscript. Furthermore, line 203 &quot;PGA-dependent unblocking of PhAc-OPP…&quot; is thus not supported by their data using the &quot;vehicle-only&quot; negative control in Figure 4. I suggest that the authors repeat the data in Figure 4A and 4C using the appropriate negative control I mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>The negative control indicated by the Reviewer was included in the manuscript, not for the data in Figure 4, but for confocal imaging of protein synthesis in whole-mount brains. Specifically, we showed the absence of protein synthesis labeling when brains are incubated with PhAc-OPP but the PGA transgene is not expressed (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1b; data are for flies harboring UAS-PGA transgene but no GAL4 driver, therefore no PGA expression). Hence, we had previously addressed the possibility of PGA-independent PhAc-OPP uncaging and shown via the control group in Figure 2—figure supplement 1b that there is no substantial uncaging of PhAc-OPP without PGA expression.</p><p>However, to fully address any potential concerns of the Reviewer, we repeated the in-gel fluorescence assay incorporating the additional control group requested with brains incubated in PhAc-OPP but not expressing PGA (Figure 4A). For this control group, we chose flies that harbor the UAS-PGA transgene but no GAL4 driver, hence they are unable to express PGA. Exactly as seen with confocal brain imaging, this control group does not show any substantive protein synthesis labeling visualized by A488-azide signal (Figure 4A), again consistent with a lack of PhAc-OPP uncaging in the absence of PGA expression. We have added this new data as new Figure 4A and also added text to the Results (line 164) in order to describe this control group more clearly in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors should provide western blots similar to Figures 4A,C, but using the biotin-azide labeling reagent. Since biotin-azide enables researchers to capture and detect OPP-labeled proteins using streptavidin-bead pulldown, it is critical that researchers understand the global signal-to-background when using this reagent. I suggest that the authors repeat Figure 4A,C using biotin-azide to label and streptavidin-fluorophore to detect. Furthermore, since <italic>Drosophila</italic> contains naturally biotinylated proteins, these new western blots would provide the fairest representation of signal-to-background. For example, naturally biotinylated proteins will bind to the streptavidin beads and thus be background on western blots and in Mass spectrometry (MS) data.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the experiments requested in order to observe total biotin-tagged protein signal from neurons or glia following pulldown with neutravidin beads. The approach described by the reviewer (biotin-azide capture of OPP-labeled protein followed by pulldown with avidin beads) is the same approach we had used in blots to detect enrichment of individual neuron-specific or glial-specific proteins (now Figures 4C and F), hence we used these samples to blot for global biotin-tagged protein as requested by the Reviewer. We used anti-biotin to do this instead of streptavidinfluorophore suggested by the Reviewer, as anti-biotin is well validated for western blots on fly tissue (Reference (12)). Using this approach, we observe strong biotin-tagged protein signal in eluted fractions from PhAc-OPP-treated brains and very little background in the vehicle-treated control group likely corresponding to endogenously biotinylated proteins present in flies (new Figures 4B and E). Biotin-tagged protein can also be seen in inputs (whole lysates) for PhAc-OPP-treated brains and this is weaker than in eluted fractions, as would be expected. As the reviewer indicates, naturally biotinylated proteins are present in flies and can manifest as background on western blots. Consistent with this, we find one major non-specific band across all groups and present in both input and eluates. Hence, these new data demonstrate very high signalto-background for enriched biotin-tagged proteins. We believe these data address the concern about signal strength in in-gel fluorescence assays as pulldown of biotin tagged protein is a preferred method for assessing global labeling signal, as indicated by the Reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I would like to see MS data to support the data presented in Figure 4 B,D. These figures show that POPPi can enrich cell type-specific labeled proteins. However, the background bands for Synapsin, Syntaxin, and Draper are concerning and suggest the sensitivity of this method is low. To convince me that there is global signal over background, I would like to see MS analysis of samples in Figure 4B,D. For example, MS of streptavidin-pulldown from the following brain genotypes (1) elav&gt;PGA + PhAc-OPP, (2) repo&gt;PGA + PhAc-OPP, (3) elav&gt;GFP + PhAc-OPP. Using quantitative approaches such as TMT labeling or SAINT analysis, I would expect to see enrichment of Draper to glia and Syntaxin to neurons, for example.</p></disp-quote><p>Considering our new data from analysis of total biotin-tagged neuronal/glial protein (new Figures 4B and 4E) alongside confocal imaging data from brains (Figure 2) and imaging data from other fly tissues such as muscle, trachea, salivary glands, fat body (Figure 3), we have now demonstrated that our method achieves robust signal over background for labeling newly-synthesized protein using two independent approaches. We have also shown that our method can be used to enrich cell typespecific labeled proteins from neurons and glia (now Figures 4C and 4F), thus verifying its use for assessing nascent proteomes of targeted cell populations. There are minor background bands for some (not all) enriched proteins, but these individual protein blots only detect near full-length labeled protein, whereas the total biotin blots should be able to detect all labeled protein or protein fragments and show a much greater signal-to-background strength (new Figures 4B and 4E). In future studies, we plan to use MS to query cell type-specific proteome changes under altered physiological or pathological conditions, yet it will require significant time, effort and funds to optimize and carry out MS studies. We believe that through the rigorous quality control experiments already performed, we have been able to effectively demonstrate high signal to background using two separate approaches, and therefore MS is not necessary for this purpose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I'm generally satisfied with the responses and changes to the manuscript.
