into directional calcium output. While previous studies have suggested that an asymmetry in the kinetic properties of BCs along the soma-dendritic axes of the postsynaptic cell could enhance directional tuning at the level of individual branches, it remains unclear whether biologically relevant presynaptic kinetics contribute to direction selectivity (DS) when visual stimulation engages the entire dendritic tree. To address this question, we built multicompartmental models of the bipolar–SAC circuit and trained them to boost directional tuning. We report that despite significant dendritic crosstalk and dissimilar directional preferences along the dendrites that occur during whole-cell stimulation, the rules that guide BC kinetics leading to optimal DS are similar to the single-dendrite condition. To correlate model predictions to empirical findings, we utilized two-photon glutamate imaging to study the dynamics of bipolar release onto ON- and OFF-starburst dendrites in the murine retina. We reveal diverse presynaptic dynamics in response to motion in both BC populations; algorithms trained on the experimental data suggested that the differences in the temporal release kinetics are likely to correspond to heterogeneous receptive field properties among the different BC types, including the spatial extent of the center and surround components. In addition, we demonstrate that circuit architecture composed of presynaptic units with experimentally recorded dynamics could enhance directional drive but not to levels that replicate empirical findings, suggesting other DS mechanisms are required to explain SAC function. Our study provides new insights into the complex mechanisms underlying DS in retinal processing and highlights the potential contribution of presynaptic kinetics to the computation of visual information by SACs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>direction selectivity</kwd><kwd>receptive field</kwd><kwd>visual processing</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd><kwd>genetic algorithm</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY030841</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gaynes</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of glutamate imaging, multicompartmental modeling, and machine learning elucidates the peak theoretical and actual contributions of heterogeneous kinetics of presynaptic inputs to the computation of directional selectivity in retinal starburst amacrine cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Starburst amacrine cells (SACs) play a crucial and well-established role in the computation of direction selectivity (DS) in the mammalian retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demb, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mauss et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wei, 2018</xref>). SACs can be broadly categorized into two subtypes: ON and OFF cells, both of which receive excitatory inputs from diverse populations of bipolar cells (BCs). In mice, the majority of input synapses onto SACs are concentrated in the proximal two-thirds of the radially symmetric dendritic tree, while the distal dendrites house the output synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vlasits et al., 2016</xref>). Individual SAC branches exhibit robust calcium responses to objects moving in the outward direction (away from the soma); consequently, different parts of the dendritic tree demonstrate distinct directional preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Euler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morrie and Feller, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poleg-Polsky and Diamond, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poleg-Polsky et al., 2018</xref>). SACs are essential for generating DS in direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs); they provide a combination of cholinergic excitation and GABAergic inhibition that specifically target co-stratifying DSGCs sharing the directional preference of the releasing site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fried et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kostadinov and Sanes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morrie and Feller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sethuramanujam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wei et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yonehara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yonehara et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to the establishment of DS in SACs. For example, network mechanisms, such as feedback inhibition onto neighboring SACs or SAC–derived cholinergic excitation of presynaptic BCs, were shown to enhance DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hellmer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Münch and Werblin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poleg-Polsky et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is worth noting that SACs maintain their directional tuning in the absence of cholinergic and GABAergic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), indicating that other mechanisms must contribute to directional tuning. Other proposals emphasized the involvement of cell-autonomous processes that encompass dendritic voltage gradients sustained by tonic excitation from BCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gavrikov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hausselt et al., 2007</xref>) and fine-tuned morphology that imposes membrane filtering of postsynaptic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tukker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vlasits et al., 2016</xref>). While these mechanisms can contribute to the development of DS to some degree, they fall short in predicting the experimentally observed levels of directional tuning. In addition, it remains unclear whether these requirements for tonically active presynaptic release described in the rabbit are fulfilled in the mouse circuit, and cells with abnormal shapes still exhibit near-normal levels of DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morrie and Feller, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a reformulation of the classical Hassenstein–Reichardt correlator model has been proposed, which emphasizes the kinetic properties of glutamatergic inputs sampled by SAC dendrites as contributing factors to DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Known as the ‘space-time wiring’ model, this formulation is based on connectomic reconstructions of bipolar–SAC contacts. Both ON- and OFF-SAC dendrites tend to stratify closer to the middle of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) as they branch out from the soma. This unique stratification pattern enables SAC dendrites to receive inputs from different types of BCs in their proximal and distal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, functional studies have uncovered a positive correlation between the transiency of BC axonal release and the distance from the boundaries of the IPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Euler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franke et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, BC types that stratify closer to SAC somas (OFF-SACs: BC1-2; ON-SACs: BC7) exhibit prolonged release, whereas more distal types (OFF-SACs: BC3-4; ON-SACs: BC5) tend to respond with a transient pattern. According to the space-time wiring hypothesis, these regional differences facilitate a more effective summation of excitatory inputs in the outward direction.</p><p>Two main methodologies were taken to examine the existence of the space-time wiring hypothesis in the bipolar–SAC circuit. First, with the caveat that the long, thin dendritic processes in SACs impose significant challenges for an effective space clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poleg-Polsky and Diamond, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stincic et al., 2016</xref>), it is possible to measure the distance dependence of BC dynamics by analyzing somatic excitatory postsynaptic currents. Although one study reported substantial differences in the shape of the recorded currents, primarily in the OFF-SACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fransen and Borghuis, 2017</xref>), a second group that recorded from ON-SACs failed to replicate this finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stincic et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A second method utilized genetically encoded fluorescent glutamate sensors, such as iGluSnFR, to directly study the dynamics of BC release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borghuis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marvin et al., 2013</xref>). An examination of glutamate release dynamics confirmed the diverse signaling patterns within the lamina of the IPL accessible to SAC dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaynes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Strauss et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, excitatory drive to ON-DSGCs, which share many glutamatergic inputs with ON-SACs, was found to consist of units with distinct release dynamics, theoretically supporting the type of directional computation proposed by the space-time wiring hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matsumoto et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, a project published last year described the asymmetric distribution of kinetically distinct iGluSnFR signals in ON-SACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Srivastava et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>However, as the investigation of BC signaling has predominantly focused on release dynamics to static stimulus presentations, the question arises: Can responses to flashed stimuli accurately represent the release waveforms produced by moving objects?</p><p>The receptive field (RF) engagement in response to a continuously moving stimulus follows a sequential pattern, with the surround being activated first, followed by the center. As a result, the motion response profile becomes a complex function, influenced by factors like RF size, temporal characteristics, and stimulation velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Strauss et al., 2022</xref>). This integration mode stands in stark contrast to the simultaneous activation of RF components observed during flashes of static objects. Indeed, our research has revealed a significant distinction in BC release between stationary and moving probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaynes et al., 2022</xref>). This discrepancy emphasizes the limited capacity of flash responses to predict the fundamental characteristics of BC responses to motion accurately and highlights the importance of examining directional capabilities in SACs with physiologically relevant stimuli.</p><p>An additional crucial factor to consider is the dependence of the presynaptic response waveform with respect to the direction of activation. The space-time wiring model posits that BCs generate similar glutamatergic drive in both outward and inward directions. Yet, this assumption may be challenged when moving objects appear within the bipolar RF. Signal processing in such scenarios fundamentally differs from stimuli that are flashed or continuously moving, and these differences can vary significantly among different types of BCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaynes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Strauss et al., 2022</xref>). The intricacies of signal transformation within the BC network give rise to important considerations regarding the application of advanced visual protocols utilized in previous studies to investigate the DS properties of SAC dendrites. These protocols were specifically designed to target a small patch of retina beneath a single SAC dendrite or induce circularly symmetric shrinking or expanding motion to elicit consistent responses across the dendritic tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Euler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hausselt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oesch and Taylor, 2010</xref>). Nonlinear integration in BCs triggered by these visual stimuli may unintentionally introduce a directional bias to BC activation, contradicting the fundamental assumptions of the space-time wiring hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaynes et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Due to the challenges associated with examining the relevance of the space-time wiring model in the context of single dendritic computations, we opted instead to focus on understanding the directional performance of SACs when the entire dendritic tree is stimulated. Our approach involved the integration of machine-learning algorithms with multicompartmental models of the bipolar–SAC network. In addition, we employed glutamate imaging techniques to record the waveforms of excitatory synaptic drive experienced by ON- and OFF-SACs during object motion. We reconstructed the underlying RF structure that supports different bipolar release shapes and subsequently combined them into a detailed model. By doing so, we sought to gain insights into how diverse RF characteristics of BCs contribute to the directional performance observed in SAC, while also comparing them to the maximal theoretical capabilities of space-time models achieved with synthetic presynaptic RFs. Our findings indicate that the RF diversity observed in BCs generates response profiles that have the potential to contribute to SAC DS but to levels significantly below the maximum theoretical capabilities observed with synthetic RFs. Overall, by combining machine-learning techniques, multicompartmental modeling, and glutamate imaging, our study provides insights into the complex relationship between BCs and SACs in the context of DS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SAC morphology imposes substantial signal attenuation but does not preclude inter-branch interactions</title><p>Calcium signals occurring in the terminal dendrites of SACs exhibit remarkable DS, both when visual stimulation is focused on the recorded dendrite and when stimuli engage the entire dendritic tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Euler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morrie and Feller, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poleg-Polsky and Diamond, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poleg-Polsky et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Because the precise nature of SAC function when a stimulus encompasses the entire cell remains unclear, our first goal was to determine whether whole-cell activation should be understood as a combination of multiple independent processing units or as the sequential recruitment of interacting dendrites. The distinctive dendritic morphology of SACs, characterized by long and narrow-diameter processes, was proposed to lead to the compartmentalization of individual or sister branches and significant signal attenuation to other dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Masland, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poleg-Polsky et al., 2018</xref>). Yet theoretical studies suggested the presence of nontrivial dendritic crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tukker et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether the dendritic geometry and passive parameters support the hypothesis of independent computations in isolated dendritic compartments, we conducted a multicompartmental NEURON simulation to assess signal attenuation in reconstructed SACs. For our experiments, we selected a specific recording location on a terminal dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, indicated in red) and administered 100-ms-long 10 pA current steps at various dendritic locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with prior studies, we observed a significant increase in signal attenuation as a function of the distance from the recording site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stincic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tukker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vlasits et al., 2016</xref>). On average, approximately 40% of the injected signal was detectable at the recording location when the injection site was within the same branch, whereas stimulating other dendrites yielded negligible responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Modeling reveals substantial dendritic crosstalk in starburst amacrine cells (SACs) despite significant voltage attenuation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Reconstructed morphology of a mouse SAC, with dendrites color-coded based on voltage attenuation toward the recording site (indicated in red).

The combined activation of all inputs is shown for reference (dotted).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90456-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>By utilizing the built-in NEURON 'impedance' class to investigate signal propagation in relation to morphology, we observed a significant &gt;20-fold attenuation on all branches distanced from the recording location by the soma. Notably, even sister dendrites sharing a common second-order bifurcation displayed a considerable &gt;5-fold signal reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, we examined whether dendritic isolation persists when multiple co-active inputs are present, which more accurately represents the activation pattern elicited by global motion. In mouse SACs, BCs innervate the proximal two-thirds of the dendritic tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vlasits et al., 2016</xref>). To replicate this arrangement, we distributed 200 synaptic inputs within a circle of 110 µm radius centered on the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Each synapse exhibited a conductance of 0.1 nS and was stimulated by a 100-ms-long pulse.</p><p>Initially, we activated all the synapses that innervated dendrites sharing a common second-order branch. The peak voltage response following focal stimulation was measured at 10.9 ± 3.3 mV (mean ± SD, n = 100, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Next, we performed a similar manipulation, now stimulating excitatory synapses on the remaining dendritic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, the depolarization recorded from the same branch during the stimulation of other dendrites was higher, reaching 13.2 ± 1.9 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Hence, despite the substantial decrease in inter-dendrite signal propagation resulting from the cell’s morphology and passive characteristics, the model predicts significant voltage interaction throughout the cell. This observation can be attributed to the disparity in the number of active inputs between the two conditions. Specifically, the combined length of dendrites sharing a common second-order parent constitutes less than 10% of the entire dendritic tree’s length. This proportion also applies to the number of synapses involved in focal or global stimuli. Thus, although the efficacy of individual focal synapses is considerably more pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), the larger number of inputs on other dendrites compensates for the signal attenuation caused by an individual synapse – leading to a comparable response to focal and global activation patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Development of a machine-learning model for enhancing DS in BC–SAC interactions</title><p>Our findings highlight the existence of long-distance interactions between synaptic inputs that extend beyond the boundaries of a single dendritic compartment.

To investigate the impact of spatial differences in input kinetics on directional tuning, we extended the multicompartmental SAC model to include BCs, modeled as point neurons with center-surround RFs, each proving a single excitatory input to the postsynaptic SAC. Following the space-time model, we considered two distinct populations of BCs innervating the proximal and distal postsynaptic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

This methodology involved a population of models competing to achieve the training objective. In the initial generation or iteration of the algorithm, the parameters describing RF properties of the proximal and distal BC populations were randomly selected. We stimulated the network with horizontally moving bars and recorded calcium signals on terminal SAC dendrites near the horizontal axis. Direction selectivity index (DSI) was computed from the peak calcium values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Initially, DSI levels were very low (mean [± SD] DSI = 7 ± 3%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), with variations among the models due to random initialization. The next generation of candidate solutions was formed by selecting the highest-scoring models to replace the below-average performers. To avoid overfitting, the models were trained with a range of stimulus velocities. Next, the RF properties of the BC population, as well as the global postsynaptic properties (axial resistance, leak, and voltage-gated calcium channel conductance), were subject to random mutations, and this cycle was repeated for 100 generations.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> illustrates an exemplary solution achieved by the EA, which displays transient distal inputs and slower, delayed proximal BCs.

In our standard configuration, we considered the mean DSI and the amplitude of calcium levels across the recorded dendrites as performance metrics. Including calcium amplitude was crucial in ensuring the robustness of the signal. Models solely rewarded based on DSI levels often evolved strategies that aimed to minimize voltage and calcium levels. This effect was most evident at slow stimulation speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These solutions maximized DSI by capitalizing on the steep nonlinear voltage dependence of the voltage-gated calcium channels near their activation threshold. At these membrane potentials, calcium responses to inward moving stimuli can be almost zero, such that even minute calcium influx at the outward direction will be associated with a significant DSI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, the solution is unstable as the DSI is exceedingly sensitive to minor perturbations in local voltage. Consequently, while threshold-based mechanisms can be highly effective, they are also notably susceptible to noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tukker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the predictions of the threshold-based strategy, physiological somatic excitatory currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and dendritic calcium responses in SACs exhibit consistent peak levels across the velocity spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koren et al., 2017</xref>).

It is worth noting that even with the requirement of identical properties in the bipolar population, the algorithm could explore a vast parameter space by adjusting both the RF properties of presynaptic cells and the postsynaptic integration parameters. However, despite this flexibility, the resulting simulations achieved only a fraction of the DS observed with spatially varying RFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Consequently, the levels of DS obtained in these simulations did not significantly differ from the findings of the simple proximal-distal parameter exploration presented earlier (ON-SACs: DSI = 17 ± 5%, OFF-SACs: DSI = 21 ± 6%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C–F</xref>).

Focusing on the clusters identified by our analysis as contributing to the highest directional tuning, we note that although distal clusters (ON-C2 and OFF-C1) had the shortest duration and fastest delays, their kinetics and RF description were about twofold longer than the optimal synthetic distal inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>), with the largest difference being the rise time dynamics of ON-C2 (303 ± 110 ms vs. 45 ± 12 ms for optimal model). Even further pronounced were the differences in recorded vs. optimal proximal solutions. The durations of ON-C6 and OFF-C5 were 1.25 ± 0.49 s/1.28 ± 0.34, respectively, compared to 0.31 ± 0.15 s measured for synthetic RFs. Similarly, the transiency indexes calculated for these clusters were around 0.4, while optimal synthetic waveforms had TI = 0.87 ± 0.09 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).

The original space-time wiring hypothesis was conceptualized for individual SAC dendrites, and the difference in BC response shape was considered through the lens of the dynamics of responses to static stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Although these circumstances were thought to simplify the analysis of dendritic computations, it is now clear that signal preprocessing in the bipolar population introduces unforeseen challenges to this approach: our prior work demonstrated a low correlation between the dynamics of BC responses to motion and static stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaynes et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we replicate this result on a new dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), reinforcing the notion that signal kinetics, crucial to the space-time wiring model, are not a fixed property of the cell but are instead dependent on the stimulus. For example, we demonstrate that presynaptic signals can exhibit prolonged flash-lags yet generate early responses to motion, a phenomenon explained by their spatial RF structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In addition, it is vital to consider the implications of using stimuli that activate only a small portion of the SAC dendritic tree in isolation or all dendrites through the same stimulation pattern. Such stimulus designs are likely to introduce nonlinear signal processing in BCs and, importantly, result in asymmetric bipolar responses for different stimulation directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaynes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Strauss et al., 2022</xref>). This poses a concern to the space-time model as it assumes consistent presynaptic waveforms independent of the stimulus direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To overcome these issues, it becomes crucial to devise visual stimuli that effectively bypass both limitations. One approach is to design stimuli that either appear or begin to move outside the RF of the BCs innervating the postsynaptic cell. By doing so, we can ensure that the stimulation does not trigger asymmetric responses and maintain the consistency of presynaptic waveforms, as required by the space-time model. A simple stimulus that fulfills this criterion is a continuously moving object that appears and disappears at a considerable distance (several hundred microns) from the cells of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaynes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2023</xref>). By employing this stimulus design, we can effectively mitigate the nonlinear signal processing in BCs and preserve the foundational assumption of consistent presynaptic waveforms in the space-time model. This approach allows for more accurate investigations into the dynamics of BC responses across velocities and their contribution to the directional tuning in SACs and DSCGs.</p><p>While the use of full-field stimuli restricts the ability to investigate the responses of individual branches with high granularity, it provides an opportunity to explore a broader question: the potential impact of interactions among multiple dendrites on DS. Dendritic compartmentalization in SACs is promoted by morphological factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tukker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2023</xref>) and by active processes, such as the presence of potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ozaita et al., 2004</xref>). Additionally, in the mouse, SAC-SAC inhibition predominantly occurs in the perisomatic region, where it modulates communication between branches and maintains the output synapses of SACs within the optimal range for effective DS processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poleg-Polsky et al., 2018</xref>). Similar enhancement of DS signaling is mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors. By limiting calcium influx, they effectively reduce the spread of electrical signals within the dendritic arbor, enhancing the electrotonic isolation of individual processing units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koren et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, our results demonstrate that in contrast to these postsynaptic mechanisms, compartmentalization has little effect on directional tuning produced by the space-time wiring model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This unexpected outcome highlights the distinction between pre- and postsynaptic computations within the bipolar–SAC circuit.</p><p>In this study, we employed EAs, a powerful machine-learning method, to investigate the mechanisms of DS computations in SACs. EAs have broad applicability and have been successfully utilized in examining the mechanisms of directional computations of SACs before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezra-Tsur et al., 2021</xref>). Our work advances the mechanistic understanding of the contribution of the space-time wiring model to stimuli that engage the dendritic tree in an asymmetric manner, experimental determination of the release of glutamate from presynaptic cells, and the amplification of signals by postsynaptic calcium channels. While EAs place minimal constraints on the model type or examined features, it is important to note that these algorithms are most effective when dealing with models with a relatively constrained feature space. While they may be susceptible to getting trapped in local minima, our largest model, which consisted of 23 free parameters (9 × 2 presynaptic + 5 postsynaptic, as described in ‘Methods’), consistently evolved toward similar solutions regardless of the starting parameters. In cases where EAs do not reliably converge on an optimal solution, alternative machine-learning approaches can be employed. For instance, a recent study utilized a neural network system that combined Hassenstein–Reichardt correlators with biologically inspired RFs to describe solutions for computations in collision avoidance neurons of flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We present a novel application of model fitting to map RFs based on responses to moving stimuli. Previous studies have used stimuli moving in different directions to estimate the spatial location of the RF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaynes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wienbar and Schwartz, 2018</xref>). We expand upon this approach by incorporating multiple stimulus velocities. This extension allows efficient RF determination from a brief visual stimulation (approximately 2–3 min). However, it is essential to acknowledge that our fits to the data were based on the assumption of a simple center-surround RF structure and may not fully capture the complexity of more diverse RF types or subcellular release specialization present in some BCs. In particular, our study did not specifically investigate the measurement of directional release from individual axonal terminals, as previously demonstrated in type 2 and 7 BCs that innervate OFF- and ON-SACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsumoto et al., 2021</xref>). We attribute this result to the sparsity of the directionally tuned release sites, which are overshadowed by the release from non-directionally tuned units. In addition, it is presently unknown whether the contacts made by DS boutons on SACs are aligned with the soma-dendritic tip axis to enhance DS in the outward direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Srivastava et al., 2022</xref>). These aspects represent avenues for future research and could provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying DS in retinal circuits.</p><p>We were intrigued by the discovery of presynaptic cells exhibiting broad RFs that spanned hundreds of microns. Our findings bear a resemblance to a recent study that described elongated RFs in type 5A BCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanson et al., 2023</xref>), challenging the classical understanding of bipolar RF structure, which suggests that the extent of the center component is limited to the size of their dendritic fields, typically below 50 µm in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Euler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaynes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Strauss et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Turner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wienbar and Schwartz, 2018</xref>), but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asari and Meister, 2012</xref> for an example of large bipolar RFs in the salamander. One plausible mechanistic explanation for the observed extensive RFs is the presence of gap-junction coupling among neighboring BCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuo et al., 2016</xref>), which could be part of the adaptive changes in the bipolar–SAC circuits to repeated stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ankri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vlasits et al., 2014</xref>). If correct, the mechanism could explain why the number of functional clusters observed in our dataset exceeds the number of BC subtypes known to connect to SACs in the mouse (five OFF and four ON types, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). In line with this interpretation, while most functional clusters were observed in multiple recording sessions, some clusters were observed more rarely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) – perhaps due to differently adapted state of the retina in these preparations.</p><p>Another potential explanation for the abundant functional classes observed in our recordings is the possibility of glutamate release originating from amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grimes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). It is worth noting that, to the best of our knowledge, glutamatergic amacrine cells typically do not establish direct synapses with SACs. However, these cells release glutamate in close proximity to ON-SAC dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mani et al., 2023</xref>). This proximity raises the possibility that the glutamatergic output from these amacrine cells could influence the iGluSnFR fluorescence observed in SACs. Glutamatergic amacrine cells are known to exhibit a small center region and pronounced surrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, if glutamate release from amacrine cells contributes to the signals detected in our recordings, it is plausible that it corresponds to one of the functional clusters characterized by narrow RF centers.</p><p>Mouse SACs exhibit spatial preference to different presynaptic bipolar types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). However, this spatial separation is not absolute, especially in ON-SACs, where most dendritic regions may receive input from multiple presynaptic cell types. The space-time wiring model’s effectiveness in conveying directional performance diminishes when a clear boundary does not exist between proximally and distally innervating presynaptic populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). It is important to note that we intentionally did not impose a strict match between the synaptic distribution in our model and biological data. As a result, our findings establish an upper limit on the contribution of the space-time wiring mechanism to SAC directional tuning. While we observed a slightly higher DS in the OFF population, consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fransen and Borghuis, 2017</xref>), our investigation reveals that the waveforms produced by presynaptic cells in response to moving objects do not fully exploit the potential for directional tuning that can be achieved with synthetic BCs, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>. It is worth highlighting that the DS levels we project for experimentally recorded glutamate signals exhibit 30-50% enhancement compared to the directional performance of a space-time wiring model observed in a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Srivastava et al., 2022</xref> The primary distinction between our studies likely arises from the fact that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Srivastava et al., 2022</xref> investigated flash-evoked glutamate waveforms. In contrast, we integrated over responses to moving stimuli. This discrepancy suggests that, while suboptimal, motion responses within the bipolar population still offer a more suitable foundation for achieving directional tuning. Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2023</xref> put forward the idea that the spatial arrangement of midget and DB4/5 BCs in the primate retina might contribute to DS computation through a similar space-time wiring mechanism. While we lack information regarding the exact shapes of motion responses in primate BCs, it is reasonable to speculate that if they exhibit faster dynamics than those observed in mice, the space-time wiring model’s influence on SAC function in primates may be even more pronounced.</p><p>These results strongly indicate that additional mechanisms are necessary to account for the observed DS capabilities in a manner consistent with empirical evidence. SACs possess intricate morphologies and express multiple voltage-gated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morrie and Feller, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poleg-Polsky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yan et al., 2020</xref>). These cells are integral components of complex neural circuits, the architectural details of which remain incompletely understood but allow SACs to convey functionally distinct signals to postsynaptic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pottackal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sethuramanujam et al., 2021</xref>). Achieving DS undoubtedly relies on a multifaceted interplay of various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the potential feedback mechanisms originating from SACs to presynaptic BCs and neighboring amacrine cells, as well as spatiotemporal modulation of postsynaptic signals by voltage-gated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezra-Tsur et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Overall, by combining experimental methods and computational modeling, our study contributes to a deeper comprehension of the bipolar organization supporting the space-time wiring model. We address the limitations of solely focusing on static stimuli and shed light on the dynamic nature of signal processing in BCs. This knowledge is crucial for elucidating the intricate mechanisms underlying visual computations in the DS circuit in the retina.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>NEURON simulation</title><p>Multicompartmental simulations were performed using NEURON 8.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron">https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron</ext-link>) on four reconstructed SAC morphologies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neuromorpho.org/neuron_info.jsp?neuron_name=185exported">https://neuromorpho.org/neuron_info.jsp?neuron_name=185exported</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neuromorpho.org/neuron_info.jsp?neuron_name=cell8_wt_traces">https://neuromorpho.org/neuron_info.jsp?neuron_name=cell8_wt_traces</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neuromorpho.org/neuron_info.jsp?neuron_name=cell2_wt_traces">https://neuromorpho.org/neuron_info.jsp?neuron_name=cell2_wt_traces</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neuromorpho.org/neuron_info.jsp?neuron_name=cell1_wt_traces">https://neuromorpho.org/neuron_info.jsp?neuron_name=cell1_wt_traces</ext-link>). The number of segments varied from 495 to 879. The diameter of branches further than 30 µm from the soma was set to 200 nm. The initial global passive parameters were as follows: passive conductance = 4e<sup>–4</sup> S/cm<sup>2</sup>, membrane capacitance = 1 µF/cm<sup>2</sup>, reversal potential = –60 mV, and axial resistance = 150 Ω cm. N-type calcium conductance model, adapted without modifications from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benison et al., 2001</xref>, was distributed throughout the entire dendritic tree. In order to calculate the internal calcium levels, a calcium diffusion mechanism was incorporated into all dendrites.

The two best-performing models were retained without any changes, while the parameters of the rest of the models were randomly selected to match either the best or second-best-performing models and then mutated as follows: for each parameter describing the presynaptic RF and postsynaptic SAC properties, a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 5% was used to determine a scaling factor. This scaling factor was multiplied with the parameter value and combined with a random value drawn from a uniform distribution ranging from –0.015 to 0.015. These modified (mutated) models constituted the next generation of candidate solutions. Typically, we evolved the model over 100 generations, as empirical evidence has shown that increasing the number of generations beyond this point does not yield significantly improved results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RF estimation from recorded glutamate waveforms</title><p>To estimate the RF that could mediate the recorded glutamate waveforms presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, we employed an EA for training RF models to match the shape of experimentally observed glutamate release clusters.

In this derivative model, we systematically replaced the RF descriptions of proximal and distal BCs with fits to experimental data. The focus of the evolution process was on altering postsynaptic parameters to optimize synaptic integration toward the largest directional performance. For the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, we employed a different training approach. We divided the input synapses into annuli with a width of 10 µm, centered around the soma. Initially, each annulus was randomly assigned one of the RF fits corresponding to functional clusters.</p><p>As the model evolved, its goal was to achieve the best possible directional performance based on the postsynaptic parameters. Additionally, there was a 5% probability for each annulus to replace the assigned functional cluster identity. This allowed for evolution in the spatial configuration of the functional clusters, enabling us to examine what spatial distribution of experimentally recorded waveforms produces the optimal DS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Virus expression and imaging procedures</title><p>All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with US National Institutes of Health guidelines, as approved by the University of Colorado Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice were housed in a 12 light/12 dark cycle at room temperature (~22°C), 40–60% relative humidity. For intravitreal virus injections, 8–12-week-old ChAT-Cre transgenic mice (Jax strain 031661, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/031661">https://www.jax.org/strain/031661</ext-link>) were anesthetized with isoflurane; ophthalmic proparacaine and phenylephrine were applied for pupil dilation and analgesia. A small incision at the border between the sclera and the cornea was made with a 30-gauge needle.

Experiments on retinas from all animal groups were performed 2–6 wk following virus injection on 11–17-week-old animals (four males and four females).</p><p>Mice were not dark-adapted to reduce rod-pathway activation. Then, 2 hr after enucleation, retina sections were whole mounted on a platinum harp with their photoreceptors facing down, suspended ~1 mm above the glass bottom of the recording chamber. The retina was kept at ~32°C and continuously perfused with Ames media (Sigma-Aldrich, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/">https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/</ext-link>) equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Visual stimulation</title><p>Light stimuli were generated in Igor Pro 8 (Wavemetrics, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wavemetrics.com/">https://wavemetrics.com/</ext-link>) running in Windows 10 and displayed with a DPL projector (Texas Instruments, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ti.com/">https://www.ti.com/</ext-link>, model 4710EVM-G2) connected as a second monitor. Only the blue projector LED was used, and its light was further filtered with a 450 nm low-pass filter (Thorlabs, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thorlabs.com/">https://thorlabs.com/</ext-link>, FEL0450). Light from the visual stimulus was focused by the condenser to illuminate the tissue at the focal plane of the photoreceptors (resolution = 10 µm/pixel, background light intensity = 30,000–60,000 R* rod<sup>–1</sup>). Both vertical and horizontal light stimulus positions were checked and centered daily before the start of the experiments. The following light stimulus patterns were used: static flash covering the entire display (1000 × 1000 µm) presented for 2–4 s. A 1-mm-long bar moving either to the left or the right directions (speeds = 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 mm/s; dwell time over each pixel = 2 s). These stimuli were repeated three times. Typically, stimulus contrast was set to 60% Michelson contrast. To record glutamate signals to OFF-SACs, we reversed the intensity of the moving bar stimulus and the background. In some experiments, we masked different portions of the display to remain at background light levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaynes et al., 2022</xref>). To map the spatial RFs, we flashed 10 × 1000 µm bars for 200 ms every 400 ms. The bars were presented over five evenly spaced (36°) orientations in a pseudorandom sequence over 32 spatial positions in every orientation to densely cover ~300 µm of visual space centered on the imaged region.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Recording procedures</title><p>Glutamate imaging was performed with Throlabs Bergamo galvo-galvo two-photon microscope using the Thorimage 4.1 acquisition software (Throlabs). A pulsed laser light (920 nm, ~1 µW output at the objective; Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.coherent.com/">https://www.coherent.com/</ext-link>) was used for two-photon excitation projected from an Olympus 20× (1 NA) objective. A descanned (confocal) photomultiplier tube (PMT) was used to acquire fluorescence between 500 and 550 nm. The confocal pinhole (diameter = 1 mm) largely prevented stimulus light (focused on a different focal plane), from reaching the PMT, allowing us to present the visual stimulus during two-photon imaging. A photodiode mounted under the condenser sampled transmitted laser light to generate a reference image of the tissue. Fluorescence signals were collected in a rapid bidirectional frame scan mode (128 × 64 pixels; ~50 Hz). The line spacing on the vertical axis was doubled to produce a rectangular imaging window (~164 × 164 µm in size; the corresponding pixel size was 1.28 µm). To reduce shot noise, images were subsampled by averaging 2 × 2 neighboring pixels and filtered by a 20 Hz low-pass filter offline. Horizontal and vertical image drifts were corrected online using a reference z-stack acquired before time-series recordings.</p><p>Labeled cells in the Chat-Cre/tdTomato line (Jax strain 007909, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/007909">https://www.jax.org/strain/007909</ext-link>) were targeted for whole-cell recordings using 4–8 MΩ pipettes filled with 90 mM CsCH<sub>3</sub>S0<sub>4</sub>, 20 mM TEA-Cl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, 10 mM phosphocreatine disodium salt hydrate, 5 mM QX-314, 4 mM Mg-ATP, and 0.4 mM Na-GTP. Recordings were obtained in voltage-clamp configuration with a Double IPA amplifier (Sutter, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sutter.com/">https://www.sutter.com/</ext-link>), low-pass filtered at 2 kHz using a custom acquisition software written in Igor Pro.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis</title><p>The fluorescence signals were averaged across multiple presentations of the visual protocol using Igor Pro 8. Specifically, pixels with dF/F values &gt;20% were selected for subsequent clustering analysis, which involved two steps.</p><p>In the first step, the extent of contiguous ROIs with similar response kinetics was determined. This was achieved on a pixel-by-pixel basis by first averaging the fluorescence signals across repeated presentations of the stimuli. Then, the pixel’s response shape was measured within a 1 s window centered around the time when the bar motion reached the center of the display during the 10 motion trials, which included five speeds and two directions. We applied hierarchical clustering to cluster the responses into ROIs based on the similarity of pixels’ waveforms in these windows using the built-in Igor Pro 'FPClustering' function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaynes et al., 2022</xref>). The number of resulting ROIs was adjusted until no ROI spanned more than 10 µm in size. The ROIs were manually curated, and any ROIs with pixel variability exceeding a coefficient of variation threshold of 1 were removed from further analysis.</p><p>In the second step, we combined individual ROIs from multiple scan fields and mice into functional clusters. This process was separate for ON- and OFF-SACs. For each ROI, we computed the mean motion response shape by aligning the motion responses to both directions of stimulation by the half-maximum rise time. The alignment was performed as follows: first, we calculated the half-maximum rise times for glutamate signals recorded in response to left and right-moving stimuli. Next, we determined the mean of these rise times, which served as a reference point for alignment. In the final step, the response waveforms to both directions of stimulation were shifted to the reference point. The magnitude of the shift was exactly half of the mean time calculated in the previous step. Thus, the alignment procedure produced a single trace, whose half-maximum rise time was precisely in between the rise times for the responses to the two directions. The rise time of the aligned signal does not depend on the position of the RF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaynes et al., 2022</xref>), allowing us to compare the waveforms of glutamate response across different locations and recordings. Secondary hierarchical clustering was performed in R v3.6 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Motion responses to 0.5 mm/s stimuli were first converted to data frames in R. The traces were smoothed with a combination of a Butterworth (filter order = 1, critical frequency = 0.1) and rolling average filters, baseline subtracted, and normalized to the peak amplitude. For the ON responses, we discarded time points with variance less than 0.5 as this aided with convergence to biologically plausible clusters. To quantify the number of functional clusters, we used within-cluster variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Warren Liao, 2005</xref>). Within-cluster variance is computed by finding the sum of the squared differences of each observation in a proposed cluster and the mean of that cluster. We used automated assessment of the elbow plots (within-cluster variance as a function of the number of clusters) to identify optimal cluster numbers for a grid search of distance computations and clustering algorithms available in base R and the dynamic time warping library. We then used expert assessment to identify the most plausible clustering from this small set of options (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Empirically, we found that the ward.D2 hierarchical clustering method, available in the base R ‘hclust’ function, provides the clearest cluster separation. We used the Euclidean and maximum distances for the ON- and OFF-SAC datasets, respectively.</p><p>Tests of statistical significance were performed in Igor Pro using built-in functions.</p><p>RF mapping was determined from a two-dimensional Gaussian fit to the responses to the oriented bars, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnston et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poleg-Polsky et al., 2018</xref>).

Using the SAC computational simulation, the authors initially tested bipolar cell contributions (space-time wiring model, presynaptic effect) and SAC axial resistance contributions (postsynaptic effect) to the SAC DS. Then, the authors conducted two-photon iGluSnFR imaging from SACs to examine the presynaptic glutamate release and found seven clusters of ON-responding and six clusters of OFF-responding bipolar cells. They were categorized based on their response kinetics: delay, onset phase, decay time, and others. Finally, the authors used cluster data to reconstruct bipolar cell inputs to SACs that generate direction selectivity. They concluded that presynaptic effects through the space-time wiring model only account for a fraction of SAC DS.</p><p>The article has many interesting findings, and the data presentation is superb. Strengths and weaknesses are summarized below.</p><p>Major Strengths:</p><p>The authors utilized solid technology to conduct computational modeling with Neuron software and a machine-learning approach based on evolutionary algorithms. Results are effectively and thoroughly presented.</p><p>The space-time wiring model was evaluated by changing bipolar cell response properties in the proximal and distal SAC dendrites. Many response parameters in bipolar cells are compared, and DSI is compared in Figure 3. These parameter comparisons are valuable to the field.</p><p>Two-photon microscopy was used to measure the bipolar cell glutamate outputs onto SACs by conducting iGluSnFR imaging. All the data sets, including images and transients, are elegantly presented. The authors analyzed the response based on various parameters, which generated more than several response clusters. The clustering is convincing.</p><p>Major Weaknesses:</p><p>The computational modeling demonstrates intriguing results: SAC dendritic morphology produces dendritic isolation, and a massive input overcomes the dendritic isolation (Figure 1). This modeling seems to be generated by basic dendritic cable properties. However, it has been reported that SAC dendrites express Kv3 and voltage-gated Ca channels. Are they incorporated into this model? If not, how about comparing these channel contributions?</p><p>In Figure 9 the authors generated the bipolar cell cluster alignment based on the space-time wiring model. The space-time wiring model has been proposed based on the EM study that distinct types of bipolar cells synapse on distinct parts of SAC dendrites (Green et al 2016, Kim et al 2014). While this is one of the representative Reicardt models, it is not fully agreed upon in the field (see Stincic et al 2016). Therefore, the authors' approach might be only hypothetical without concrete evidence for geographical cluster distributions. Is there any data suggesting each cluster's location on the SAC dendrites? I assume that the iGluSnFR imaging was conducted on the SAC dendritic network, which does not provide geographical information. How about injecting the iGluSnFR-AAV at a lower titer, which labels only some SACs in a tissue? This method may reveal each cluster's location on SAC dendrites.</p><p>The authors found that there are seven ON clusters and six OFF clusters, which are supposed to be bipolar cell terminals. However, bipolar cells reported to provide synaptic inputs are T-7, T-6, and multiple T-5s for ON SACs and T-1, T-2, and T-3s for OFF SACs. The number of types is less than the number of clusters. Is there a possibility of clusters belonging to glutamatergic amacrine cells? Please provide a discussion regarding the relations between clusters and cell types.</p><p>In Figure 5B, representative traces are shown responding to moving bars in horizontal directions. These did not show different responses to two directional stimuli. Is there any directional preference from other ROIs? Yonehara's group recently exhibited the bipolar cells' direction selectivity (Matsumoto et al 2021). Did you see any correlations with their results? Please discuss.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90456.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gaynes</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Colorado School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aurora</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Budoff</surname><given-names>Samuel A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Colorado School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aurora</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Grybko</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Colorado School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aurora</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Poleg-Polsky</surname><given-names>Alon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aurora</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the current reviews.</p><p>For the final Version of Record the following changes will be included:</p><p>1.

The impact of this project is to show that this contribution is limited. First, the optimal solution obtained by the evolutionary algorithm to generate DS processes is slow proximal and fast distal inputs - exactly what is predicted by space-time wiring, which is exactly what is required of the HRC model. Hence, this result seems expected and it's not clear what the alternative hypothesis is. Second, the experimental results based on glutamate imaging to assess the kinetics of glutamate release under conditions of visual stimulation across a large region of retina confirm previous observations but were important to test. Third, by combining their model model with this experiment data, they conclude that even the optimal space-time wiring is not sufficient to explain the SAC process DS. The results of this approach might be more impactful if the authors come to some conclusion as to what factors do determine the direction selectivity of the SAC process since they have argued that all the current models are not sufficient.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Gaynes et al. investigated the presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms of starburst amacrine cell (SAC) direction selectivity in the mouse retina by computational modeling and glutamate sensitivity (iGluSnFR) imaging methods. Using the SAC computational simulation, the authors initially tested bipolar cell contributions (space-time wiring model, presynaptic effect) and SAC axial resistance contributions (postsynaptic effect) to the SAC DS. Then, the authors conducted two-photon iGluSnFR imaging from SACs to examine the presynaptic glutamate release, and found seven clusters of ON-responding and six clusters of OFF-responding bipolar cells. They were categorized based on their response kinetics: delay, onset phase, decay time, and others. Finally, the authors generated a model consisting of multiple clusters of bipolar cells on proximal and distal SAC dendrites. When the SAC DS was measured using this model, they found that the space-time wiring model accounted for only a fraction of SAC DS.</p><p>The article has many interesting findings, and the data presentation is superb. Strengths and weaknesses are summarized below.</p><p>Major Strengths:</p><p>• The authors utilized solid technology to conduct computational modeling with Neuron software and a machine-learning approach based on evolutionary algorithms. Results are effectively and thoroughly presented.</p><p>• The space-time wiring model was evaluated by changing bipolar cell response properties in the proximal and distal SAC dendrites. Many response parameters in bipolar cells are compared, and DSI was compared in Figure 3.</p><p>• Two-photon microscopy was used to measure the bipolar cell glutamate outputs onto SACs by conducting iGluSnFR imaging. All the data sets, including images and transients, are elegantly presented. The authors analyzed the response based on various parameters, which generated more than several response clusters. The clustering is convincing.</p><p>Major Weaknesses:</p><p>• In Figure 9, the authors generated the bipolar cell cluster alignment based on the space-time wiring model. The space-time wiring model has been proposed based on the EM study that distinct types of bipolar cells synapse on distinct parts of SAC dendrites (Green et al 2016, Kim et al 2014). While this is one of the representative Reicardt models, it is not fully agreed upon in the field (see Stincic et al 2016). While the authors' approach of testing the space-time wiring model and conclusions is interesting and appreciated, the authors could address more issues: mainly two clusters were used to generate the model, but more numbers of clusters should be applied. Although the location of each cluster on the SAC dendrites is unknown, the authors should know the populations of clusters by iGluSnFR experiments. Furthermore, the authors could provide more suggestive mechanisms after declining postsynaptic factors and the space-time wiring model.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the proximal and more distal SAC dendrites sample from different IPL depths. It should be theoretically possible to match the functional clusters we measured with anatomical bipolar cell identities. However, the stratifications of these cells have significant overlaps (Figure 6-S2), and previous attempts to match iGluSnFR signals to anatomy proved to be challenging (Franke et al., 2017; Gaynes et al., 2022; Matsumoto et al., 2019; Srivastava et al., 2022; Strauss et al., 2022). In the revised version of the manuscript, we reorder the functional clusters based on their transiency, which has a higher correlation to stratification depth (Franke et al., 2017).</p><p>We have examined a scenario in which the presynaptic population comprises more than two clusters. We constructed synthetic models whose input structure was as in Figure 10 (old Figure 9). The optimal configuration for the most proximal and distal inputs closely resembled the proximal-distal model reported in Figure 2. However, we observed a nearly linear variation in the shape of the optimal mid-range inputs, transitioning from proximal-like to distal-like responses as the distance increased. We consider this outcome to be expected based on the structure of the space-time wiring model (Kim et al., 2014). Interestingly, this was not the case with models incorporating physiologically recorded signals. As we show in Figure 10, the most common optimal directional tuning was seen when the bipolar drive consisted of two main populations, both in the ON and OFF SACs.</p><p>Finally, we believe that uncovering additional mechanisms that underlie directional selectivity in SACs represents a crucial challenge for the field to tackle. It is highly probable that achieving directional selectivity involves a complex interplay of multiple factors. This includes the organization of the presynaptic circuit, which we have partially addressed in this study, as well as the influence of postsynaptic active conductances and feedback loops involving other SACs and presynaptic cells. We have expanded the discussion section to describe the possible mechanisms</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The computational modeling demonstrates intriguing results: SAC dendritic morphology produces dendritic isolation, and a massive input overcomes the dendritic isolation (Figure 1). This modeling seems to be generated by basic dendritic cable properties. However, it has been reported that SAC dendrites express Kv3 and voltage-gated Ca channels. It seems to be that these channels are not incorporated in this model.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer's observation is accurate; the model depicted in Figure 1 did not include voltage-gated channels. Our goal was to study electrotonic isolation, which is often measured in passive models. However, while we did not incorporate voltage-gated potassium channels implicitly in the models, our simulations are rooted in previous models that were fine-tuned using empirical data. As potassium channels are expected to influence the experimentally recorded input resistance, we have indirectly accounted for their impact on the interdendritic signal propagation.</p><p>In subsequent model iterations, we have integrated voltage-gated calcium channels into our simulations to assess the signal responsible for driving synaptic release. We show that nonlinear voltage dependence of the calcium currents enhances compartmentalization of the local calcium levels (Figure 2), but did not significantly influence local voltages. Therefore, calcium channels do not appear to have a major impact on electrotonic distances.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In Figure 5B, representative traces are shown responding to moving bars in horizontal directions. These did not show different responses to two directional stimuli. It is unclear whether directional preference was not detected, which was shown by Yonehara's group recently (Matsumoto et al 2021). Or that was not investigated as described in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we observed no discernible directional differences in bipolar responses. This phenomenon can be primarily attributed to the fact that the signals originating from the limited number of directionally-tuned release sites are overshadowed by the release from non-directionally-tuned units (Matsumoto et al., 2021). In the revised discussion, we have acknowledged this limitation in our recorded data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The authors found seven ON clusters and six OFF clusters, which are supposed to be bipolar cell terminals. However, bipolar cells reported to provide synaptic inputs are T-7, T-6, and multiple T-5s for ON SACs and T-1, T-2, and T-3s for OFF SACs. The number of types is less than the number of clusters. Potentially, clusters might belong to glutamatergic amacrine cells. These points are not fully discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the discussion section to address these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major comments</p><p>1. One of the main conclusions of this study is that diverse BC kinetics contribute to DS (Fig. 9). The authors nicely demonstrate using modeling that the experimentally measured BC kinetics are far from ideal. However, this conclusion is based on a model that almost exclusively relies on just two of the 7 putative BC types (e.g., C1 &amp; C6 for On SACs) placed optimally along the dendrites, which raises two important caveats.</p><p>First, given that other BC types are likely to contribute, the effects of two distinct types are likely to be diluted. Thus, the contribution of BCs to DS is likely to be significantly overestimated. Second, given that the dendrites of 10-30 SACs cross each point in the honeycomb, for the given model to work, each BC would need to connect extremely selectively to SACs. i.e., at a given point, a sustained input must only connect to the more proximal dendritic segments, while avoiding entirely the distal segments of overlapping SAC dendrites. Thus, their model requires extremely selective wiring for which there is no evidence. In fact, there is evidence to the contrary provided by Ding et al. 2016, which showed that the type 7 (proximally biased) and type 5 (distally biased) populations had a substantial overlap (assuming these BC types correspond to kinetically diverse clusters).</p></disp-quote><p>We wholeheartedly concur with the reviewer's perspective that our findings have led to an overestimation of the space-time wiring mechanism's role in SAC directional selectivity (DS). We have adjusted our discussion to emphasize this point. In light of this, our assertion that, even with the most favorable distribution of synaptic inputs, the space-time wiring model still does not fully account for the experimentally-determined directional tuning in SAC, remains valid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With regard to the model, it would also be worth comparing results to previous starburst models (e.g., Tukker et al,. 2004), which demonstrated a robust DS in SAC dendrites in the absence of kinetically diverse BC input. Why is the cell-intrinsic DS so weak in the present model?</p></disp-quote><p>We have directly explored this question in the synthetic model (Figures 2, 3). Despite variances in the anatomy of SACs and the distribution of bipolar inputs between our model and the study by (Tukker et al., 2004), we observed remarkably similar levels of directional selectivity index computed from the voltage response (approximately 10%, as shown in Figure 3, 'Identical BCs').</p><p>The primary distinction emerged in the degree of DS amplification mediated by calcium currents. Tukker et al., 2004 reported considerably higher DS compared to our findings, despite employing similar formulations for voltage-gated calcium channel models. The key factor driving this difference lies in the fact that Tukker et al., 2004 measured amplification in proximity to the threshold of calcium channel activation. Even minor variations in membrane potentials near this threshold can lead to substantial differences in calcium influx, especially when outward stimulation results in a calcium spike. In fact, recently, Robert Smith’s group revisited the threshold-based mechanism and concluded that it often fails to produce robust DS due to the heterogeneity of membrane potentials among different terminal dendrites (Wu et al., 2023).</p><p>Our models were trained on five different stimuli velocities whose synaptic integration produced substantially different peak amplitudes. Consequently, the spike threshold alone couldn't reliably distinguish between inward and outward directions across all five conditions, resulting in reduced directional performance in our simulations. In the revised Figure 2-S2 we directly explore the performance of the model with identical BC formulations, trained on a single velocity. We find a dramatic enhancement of calcium DS (DSI=66%) in this condition compared to an identical model trained on 5 velocities (DSI=17%). Thus, evolutionary search is capable of finding the threshold-based solution, but only when the training is performed on a single stimulus velocity (Figure 2-S2). This solution did not generalize to multiple stimuli speeds because, as mentioned above, they lead to different postsynaptic depolarization levels (Figure 2, 2-S1). Instead, the algorithm converged on a set of postsynaptic paraments leading to less nonlinear calcium channel activation over a broader voltage range, ensuring effective DS performance over multiple velocities and heterogenous local potentials (Wu et al., 2023).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Functionally distinct responses across different regions of interest (ROIs) were used to classify BC input. ROIs were obtained from multiple scan fields and retinas and combined into a single dataset for functional clustering. However, the consistency of the cluster distribution across these replicates has not been addressed. As BCs can exhibit different functional properties dependant on the state/health of the retina, it is important to know whether certain functional clusters may originate disproportionately from a particular experiment, as it implies that each cluster does not represent a different stable functional/anatomical population.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the state of the preparation can significantly impact signal dynamics. In response to this important consideration, we have incorporated details about the distribution of functional clusters in various experiments in the revised version of the manuscript (Figure 6-S1, and discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>3. Interpreting iGluSnFR signals: Since the sensor is expressed uniformly across the SAC dendrite, it is important to clarify why the measured F signals are considered synaptic responses. Could spillover contribute to the generation of slower responses?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not believe spillover can explain slower responses because the sluggish clusters often responded significantly (up to 500ms) sooner to moving bars (Figures 6, 6-S3). We acknowledge and discuss this possibility of spillover in the revised discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. One striking finding is the diversity of BCs RF sizes (Fig. 7C). Some BCs have RF that are far larger than their dendritic fields. It will be useful to discuss the potential mechanisms that may underlie large BC RFs.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the discussion to address this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. SAC DS is independent of dendritic isolation: The authors claim that dendritic isolation does not significantly impact DS. However, while this might be true for a linear motion through the receptive field, dendritic isolation probably matters for more dynamic stimuli. For example, DSGCs can encode rapid changes in objection direction, as DS is computed over fine spatiotemporal scales relying on SACs (Murphy-Baum et al., 2022). This could not occur if SAC dendrites were not well electrically isolated from each other.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that this is an accurate interpretation of our findings. Our research suggests that dendritic isolation is likely not a critical factor in the space-time wiring mechanism. However, as we demonstrate that this particular mechanism cannot fully account for the observed levels of DS in SACs, other mechanisms must be important. As previous studies revealed that dendritic isolation enhances SAC DS (for example, Koren et al., 2017), dendritic independence likely contributes to directional performance within SACs by these additional mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 4: From what I understand, the BC inputs for the electrotonic connectivity variations evolved much like they were for the original model without axial resistance constraints. This makes sense, since stronger/weaker inputs with different temporal kernels may be appropriate for each condition, hence why the axial resistance wasn't changed post-evolution, which would have likely caused the DS to drop. If that is the case, however, I wonder how the best DS attainable by the final model which is constrained to the radial arrangement of realistic BC inputs (without being able to fit much more optimal sustained-transient BCs to their circumstance) would be impacted. Is dendritic isolation similarly unimportant when the pre-synaptic story isn't ideal?</p></disp-quote><p>We have explored this question directly by allowing the evolutionary algorithm to modify the passive and active characteristics of the postsynaptic SAC. Our findings are summarized in Figure 9-S1. We observed a correlation between DSI levels and membrane/axial resistance values in SACs in the evolved models. Better DS was seen with leaky membranes (higher isolation) and lower axial resistance (lower isolation). While it is clear that postsynaptic parameters can influence synaptic integration, they can not fully compensate for inadequate presynaptic dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. BC are shown to contribute to DS across velocities (Fig. 9), which contrasts with results from Srivastava et al., (2022) that showed BCs contribute to DS at lower velocities. However, this discrepancy can easily be explained by the choice of moving spots. In this study, the sweeping bars had dynamic width (targeting pixel dwell time of 2s), which means for higher velocities the bar is significantly wider. While in the previous study, the width of the stimulus was kept constant, and thus for higher velocities, the sustained/transient kinetic differences of BCs are less clear (Srivastava et al., 2021). The author's should discuss this explicitly, to avoid discrepancies between these two studies the reader might otherwise perceive.</p></disp-quote><p>We value reveiwer’s feedback, and in response, we have included an additional paragraph in the manuscript addressing the distinctions in directional tuning that arise from the space-time model presented in this work, in comparison to earlier studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

The authors use this model to test the hypothesis that space time wiring contribution to SAC process DS requires dendritic isolation. They do this by increasing axial resistance around the soma of their model neuron to isolate each dendrite. They found comparable DS was achieved in both conditions, indicating that the space-time wiring model works in two cases of high and low dendritic isolation.

Figure 6: To study glutamatergic input onto SACs, the authors expressed iGLuSnFR in ChAT-Cre mice and grouped similarly responding pixels into ROIs and separated these responses into functional groups based on cluster analysis (Figure 5). The alignment of the responses in Figure 6A was confusing. It appears that average responses for each cluster are aligned based on the peak observed during the stimulus in each direction, but it is unclear how they are aligned relative to each other or what this timing is relative to location of the stimulus (i.e. what is time 0 in 6A?).</p></disp-quote><p>The displayed traces represent the average responses to horizontally moving bars (speed = 0.5mm/s), either moving to the left or right. To achieve this alignment, we employed a procedure consistent with our recent publication (Gaynes et al., 2022), which we have now detailed more comprehensively. Here's the step-by-step process we followed:</p><p>1. Determination of half-maximum rise times: Initially, we calculated the half-maximum rise times for glutamate signals recorded in response to left and right-moving stimuli.</p><p>2. Calculation of mean rise time: We then computed the mean of these rise times, which served as a reference point for alignment.</p><p>3. Alignment procedure: To illustrate the alignment process, consider an example. Suppose the 50% rise time for responses to left-moving stimuli occurs at 3 seconds, while responses to right-moving stimuli occur 4 seconds after stimulation onset. This discrepancy suggests that the RF of the cell is shifted to the right from the center of the display (assuming a stimulation speed of 0.5mm/s on the retina, the RF's position would be approximately 250μm from the midline). To align these responses, we shifted both waveforms by 500ms so that their 50% rise times coincided at 3.5 seconds. Importantly, 3.5 seconds would represent the 50% rise time of the ROI if it were precisely centered on the display. This alignment effectively removed any spatial position dependence from the ROIs.</p><p>4. Comparative analysis and clustering: With the responses now aligned, we were able to compare their shapes and subsequently cluster the ROIs into distinct functional clusters.For clarity, we opted to highlight the time of response peak for cluster 1. Although this peak closely aligned with the calculated time of stimulus motion over the center of the 'shifted RF' in the adjusted time frame, it provided a more straightforward comparison between response dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.
