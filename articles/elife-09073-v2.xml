They control embryonic development and adult stem cell compartments, and their dysregulation often causes cancer. β-catenin-dependent transcription relies on the NPF motif of Pygo proteins. Here, we use a proteomics approach to discover the Chip/LDB-SSDP (ChiLS) complex as the ligand specifically binding to NPF. ChiLS also recognizes NPF motifs in other nuclear factors including Runt/RUNX2 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> ARID1, and binds to Groucho/TLE. Studies of Wnt-responsive dTCF enhancers in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic midgut indicate how these factors interact to form the Wnt enhanceosome, primed for Wnt responses by Pygo. Together with previous evidence, our study indicates that ChiLS confers context-dependence on TCF/LEF by integrating multiple inputs from lineage and signal-responsive factors, including enhanceosome switch-off by Notch. Its pivotal function in embryos and stem cells explain why its integrity is crucial in the avoidance of cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09073.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09073.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09073.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In animals, cells have to be able to communicate with neighboring cells in order to generate and maintain the different tissues and organs. One ancient method of cell communication that is used in all animals is the Wnt signaling pathway. In this pathway, a cell secretes a protein called Wnt, which binds to a Wnt receptor present on the surface of another cell. This triggers a cascade of signals inside the second cell that leads to the activation of proteins called TCF factors. These proteins bind to regions of DNA called enhancers to trigger the expression of particular genes that control the development of the animal.</p><p>Hyperactive Wnt signaling in humans can result in cancer, so Wnt signaling is tightly controlled to avoid this. One of the proteins that regulates Wnt signaling is called Groucho and it interacts with TCF to prevent it from activating genes in the absence of a Wnt signal. However, when Wnt is present, a protein called Pygo overcomes this repression by Groucho to activate TCF, but it is not clear how this works. Fiedler, Graeb, Mieszczanek et al. discovered that Pygo directly binds to a protein complex called Chip/LDB-SSDP (or ChiLS for short). ChiLS is able to associate with TCF enhancers through its association with Groucho.</p><p>Fiedler, Graeb, Mieszczanek et al. observed that ChiLS can also interact with a number of other proteins that control body formation. This enables ChiLS to integrate multiple signals that regulate the activity of TCF factors. Fiedler, Graeb, Mieszczanek et al. named this complex the ‘Wnt enhanceosome’ because it serves to activate the expression of genes in response to Wnt signaling.</p><p>Fiedler, Graeb, Mieszczanek et al. analyzed the role of the Wnt enhanceosome during the development of the fly wing and the embryo's midgut. Many genes that are required to form these organs were switched on by the Wnt enhanceosome. This study shows that ChiLS and Pygo are core components of a large complex of proteins that regulate animal development. The next challenge is to study how the components of this complex work together to regulate the enhancers in response to different signals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09073.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09073.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>LIM domain-binding protein</kwd><kwd>beta-catenin</kwd><kwd>groucho/TLE</kwd><kwd>RUNX</kwd><kwd>Osa/ARID1</kwd><kwd>Wnt-responsive transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U105192713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fiedler</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name><name><surname>Graeb</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Mieszczanek</surname><given-names>Juliusz</given-names></name><name><surname>Rutherford</surname><given-names>Trevor J</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Christopher M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK (CRUK)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C7379/A8709</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fiedler</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK (CRUK)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C7379/A15291</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mieszczanek</surname><given-names>Juliusz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Chip/LDB-SSDP complex integrates multiple signals to render TCF/LEF enhancers Wnt responsive.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>TCF/LEF factors (TCFs) were discovered as context-dependent architectural factors without intrinsic transactivation potential that bind to the T cell receptor α (TCRα) enhancer via their high mobility group (HMG) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Waterman and Jones, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giese et al., 1992</xref>). They facilitate complex assemblies with other nearby enhancer-binding proteins, including the signal-responsive CRE-binding factor (CREB) and the lineage-specific RUNX1 (also called Acute Myeloid Leukemia 1, AML1). Their activity further depends on β-catenin, a transcriptional co-factor activated by Wnt signaling, an ancient signaling pathway that controls animal development and stem cell compartments, and whose dysregulation often causes cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clevers, 2006</xref>). The context-dependence of TCFs is also apparent in other systems, for example in the embryonic midgut of <italic>Drosophila</italic> where dTCF integrates multiple signaling inputs with lineage-specific cues during endoderm induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Riese et al., 1997</xref>). The molecular basis for this context-dependence remains unexplained.</p><p>In the absence of signaling, T cell factors (TCFs) are bound by the Groucho/Transducin-like Enhancer-of-split (Groucho/TLE) proteins, a family of co-repressors that silence TCF enhancers by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Turki-Judeh and Courey, 2012</xref>) and by ‘blanketing’ them with inactive chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sekiya and Zaret, 2007</xref>). TLEs are displaced from TCFs by β-catenin following Wnt signaling, however this is not achieved by competitive binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chodaparambil et al., 2014</xref>) but depends on other factors. One of these is Pygopus (Pygo), a conserved nuclear Wnt signaling factor that recruits Armadillo (<italic>Drosophila</italic> β-catenin) via the Legless/BCL9 adaptor to promote TCF-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kramps et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Parker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Thompson et al., 2002</xref>). Intriguingly, Pygo is largely dispensable in the absence of Groucho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mieszczanek et al., 2008</xref>), which implicates this protein in alleviating Groucho-dependent repression of Wg targets.</p><p>Pygo has a C-terminal plant homology domain (PHD) and an N-terminal asparagine proline phenylalanine (NPF) motif, each essential for development and tissue patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mosimann et al., 2009</xref>). Much is known about the PHD finger, which binds to Legless/BCL9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kramps et al., 2002</xref>) and to histone H3 tail methylated at lysine 4 via opposite surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fiedler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miller et al., 2013</xref>) that are connected by allosteric communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miller et al., 2010</xref>).

(<bold>B</bold>) The Armadillo-loading model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Townsley et al., 2004</xref>): the NPF ligand (X, orange) mediates constitutive tethering of Pygo to dTCF enhancers <italic>prior</italic> to Wg signaling, jointly with PHD-mediated recognition of H3K4me1 (marking poised enhancers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kharchenko et al., 2011</xref>) or H3R2me2aK4me1 (marking silenced enhancers in the process of being activated; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirmizis et al., 2007</xref>), priming these enhancers for Wg responses via its ability to capture Armadillo (once available during Wg signaling, indicated by grey) through the Legless/BCL9 adaptor. In both models, the homology domain 1 (HD1) of Lgs/BCL9 binds to the Pygo PHD finger, while HD2 binds to the N-terminus of the Armadillo Repeat Domain (light grey) of Armadillo/β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kramps et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sampietro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fiedler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miller et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09073.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09073.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09073-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Here, we use a proteomics approach to discover that the NPF ligand is an ancient protein complex composed of Chip/LDB ((Lin-11 Isl-1 Mec-3-) LIM-domain-binding protein) and single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSDP), also called SSBP. This complex controls remote Wnt- and Notch-responsive enhancers of homeobox genes in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bronstein and Segal, 2011</xref>), and remote enhancers of globin and other erythroid genes in mammals, integrating lineage-specific inputs from LIM-homeobox (LHX) proteins and other enhancer-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate that Chip/LDB-SSDP (ChiLS) binds directly and specifically to Pygo NPFs, and also to NPF motifs in Runt-related transcription factors (RUNX) proteins and Osa (<italic>Drosophila</italic> ARID1), whose relevance is shown by functional analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut enhancers. Furthermore, we identify Groucho as another new ligand of ChiLS by mass spectroscopy. We thus define the core components of a Wnt enhanceosome assembled at TCF enhancers via Groucho/TLE and RUNX, primed for timely Wnt responses by ChiLS-associated Pygo. The pivotal role of ChiLS in integrating the Wnt enhanceosome provides a molecular explanation for the context-dependence of TCFs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ChiLS is the ligand for Pygo NPF</title><p>To identify the NPF ligand of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pygo, we inserted various tags into its low-complexity linker that separates NPF from PHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and used stably transfected S2 cell lines expressing wild-type (wt) or NPF-mutant versions, for tandem-affinity purification of associated proteins and identification by mass spectrometry. We thus discovered Chip, SSDP and three LIM domain proteins—Beadex and CG5708 (both LIM-only proteins, LMO) and Apterous (an LHX)—amongst the top hits specifically associated with wt but not mutant Pygo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These proteins are known to form a complex: Chip dimerizes through DD (dimerization domain) and binds to SSDP through LDB/Chip conserved domain (LCCD) and to LIM domains through LIM-interacting domain (LID). The latter allow ChiLS to associate with enhancers, either directly through LHX (e.g., Apterous), or indirectly through LMO adaptors that bind to bHLH (e.g., Achaete/Scute) and GATA factors (e.g., Pannier) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bronstein and Segal, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Love et al., 2014</xref>).

NPF-containing fragments from MACC1, RUNX2, Runt and Lozenge (fly RUNX proteins) and Osa tested positive in NMR binding assays, while those from ARID1B and RUNX3 were negative—somewhat curious in the latter case, given that its NPF motif resembles that of Runt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

In Runt, the NPF is within a short conserved sequence block abutting its Runt domain (the DNA-binding domain; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), called region IIIC which is conserved in Runt orthologs of other invertebrates and functionally relevant in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Walrad et al., 2010</xref>). In vertebrate RUNX2/3, the NPFs are further downstream, at the start of a conserved sequence block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Evidently, the affinity of the Runt NPF for ChiLS (estimated to be high μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) is too low for Runt to remain associated with ChiLS during coIP. Rather, this interaction depends on the Runt domain to which ChiLS binds directly, as can be shown by NMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Interestingly, Pygo's histone binding requires at least one methyl group at K4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fiedler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miller et al., 2013</xref>)—the hallmark of poised enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kharchenko et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pygo is highly unorthodox due to an architectural change in its histone-binding surface that allows it to recognize asymmetrically di-methylated arginine 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miller et al., 2013</xref>)—a hallmark of silent chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirmizis et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the rare unorthodox Pygo proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miller et al., 2013</xref>) may recognize silent enhancers even earlier, long before their activation, consistent with the early embryonic function of Pygo, prior to Wg signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Overcoming the OFF state imposed on the enhancer by Groucho/TLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mieszczanek et al., 2008</xref>) involves Pygo-dependent capturing of β-catenin/Armadillo, which recruits various transcriptional co-activators to its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mosimann et al., 2009</xref>). Although these include CREB-binding protein (CBP), a histone acetyl transferase, its tethering to TCF enhancers is likely to co-depend on CRE-binding factors (CREB, c-Fos) and SMAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4a">Bienz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Waltzer and Bienz, 1999</xref>) which synergize with Armadillo to activate these enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4a">Bienz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Waltzer and Bienz, 1999</xref>)—similarly to the interferon-β enhanceosome where CBP recruitment also co-depends on multiple enhancer-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Panne et al., 2007</xref>). The ensuing acetylation of the Wnt enhancer chromatin could promote the eviction of Groucho/TLE whose chromatin anchoring is blocked by acetylation of histone H3 and H4 tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chodaparambil et al., 2014</xref>), thus initiating the ON state.</p><p>Osa antagonizes Wg responses throughout development, and represses <italic>UbxB</italic> through its CRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins and Treisman, 2000</xref>), which also mediates repression in response to high Wg signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yu et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Osa could therefore terminate enhancer activity, by displacing HAT-recruiting enhancer-binding proteins such as CREB and c-Fos from CREs and by cooperating with repressive enhancer-binding proteins such as Brinker (a Groucho-recruiting repressor that displaces SMAD from <italic>UbxB</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Saller and Bienz, 2001;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Saller et al., 2002</xref>) to re-recruit Groucho/TLE to the enhancer, thereby re-establishing its OFF state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Notably, Osa binds Chip, to repress various Wg and ChiLS targets including <italic>achaete-scute</italic> and <italic>dLMO</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heitzler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Milan et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, ChiLS is not only a coincidence detector of multiple enhancer-binding proteins and NPF proteins, but also a switch module that exchanges positively- and negatively-acting enhancer-binding proteins (through LID) and NPF factors, to confer signal-induced activation, or re-repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Its stoichiometry and modularity renders it ideally suited to both tasks. We note that the interferon-β enhanceosome does not contain a similar integrating module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Panne et al., 2007</xref>), perhaps because it is dedicated to a single signaling input.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>ChiLS is a pioneer-like co-regulator</title><p>ChiLS is essential for activation of master-regulatory genes in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morcillo et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), similarly to DNA-binding pioneer factors such as Zelda (in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo) or FoxA (in the mammalian endoderm) which render enhancers accessible to enhancer-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zaret and Carroll, 2011</xref>). Moreover, ChiLS maintains HOX gene expression throughout development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>), enabling Wg to sustain HOX autoregulation, a mechanism commonly observed to ensure coordinate expression of HOX genes in groups of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bienz, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Another hallmark of pioneer factors is that they initiate communication with the basal transcription machinery associated with the promoter.

Indeed, Ldb1 occupies both remote enhancers and transcription start sites (e.g., of globin genes and <italic>c-Myb</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Love et al., 2014</xref>), likely looping enhancers to the basal transcription machinery at promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stadhouders et al., 2012</xref>) which requires self-association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krivega et al., 2014</xref>), but possibly also other factors (such as cohesin, or mediator; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Levine et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We note that the chromatin association of Ldb1 has typically been studied in erythroid progenitors or differentiated erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Love et al., 2014</xref>), following activation of erythoid-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stadhouders et al., 2012</xref>).

Indeed, the first links between Groucho/TLE, RUNX and nuclear Wnt components came from physical interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Roose and Clevers, 1999</xref>), as in the case of ChiLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our work indicates that these nuclear Notch signaling components constitute the Wnt enhanceosome. Although our most compelling evidence for this notion is based on physical interactions, the genetic evidence from <italic>Drosophila</italic> is consistent with a role of ChiLS in Wg responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bronstein et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1 fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>).

Hairy/Enhancer-of-split (HES) repressors could be pivotal for this switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Delidakis et al., 2014</xref>): these bHLH factors are universally induced by Notch signaling, and they bind to ChiLS enhancers to re-recruit Groucho/TLE via their WRPW motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Turki-Judeh and Courey, 2012</xref>). HES repressors may thus be capable of re-establishing the OFF state on Wnt enhancers in response to Notch.</p><p>Notably, restoring a high histone-binding affinity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pygo by reversing the architectural change in its histone-binding surface towards human renders it hyperactive towards both Wg and Notch targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miller et al., 2013</xref>) even though <italic>pygo</italic> is not normally required for Notch responses in flies. Humanized Pygo may thus resist the Notch-mediated shut-down of the Wnt enhanceosome, owing to its elevated histone affinity that boosts its enhancer tethering, which could delay its eviction from the enhanceosome by repressive NPF factors. The apparent Notch-responsiveness of the Wnt enhanceosome supports our notion that orthodox Pygo proteins (as found in most animals and humans) confer both Wnt and Notch responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miller et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Links to human cancer</title><p>Previous genetic studies have shown that the components of the Wnt enhanceosome (e.g., TCF, RUNX, ChiLS and LHX) have pivotal roles in stem cell compartments, as already mentioned (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Folgueras et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lien and Fuchs, 2014</xref>), suggesting a universal function of this enhanceosome in stem cells. It is therefore hardly surprising that its dysregulation, that is, by hyperactive β-catenin, is a root cause of cancer, most notably colorectal cancer but also other epithelial cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clevers, 2006</xref>). Indeed, genetic evidence implicates almost every one of its components (as inferred from the fly counterparts) in cancer: AML1 and RUNX3 are tumour suppressors whose inactivation is prevalent in myeloid and lymphocytic leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mangan and Speck, 2011</xref>), and in a wide range of solid tumors including colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuang et al., 2013</xref>), respectively. Likewise, ARID1A is a wide-spread tumor suppressor frequently inactivated in various epithelial cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wu and Roberts, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, many T-cell acute leukemias can be attributed to inappropriate expression of LMO2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rabbitts, 1998</xref>). Intriguingly, AML1 and ARID1A behave as haplo-insufficient tumor suppressors, consistent with the notion that these factors compete with activating NPF factors such as Pygo2, RUNX2 and possibly MACC1 (predictive of metastatic colorectal cancer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stein et al., 2009</xref>) for binding to ChiLS, which will be interesting to test in future.
