are the backbone of treatment for many cancers. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is an essential enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway that can be targeted by clinically approved inhibitors. However, despite robust preclinical anticancer efficacy, DHODH inhibitors have shown limited single-agent activity in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Therefore, novel combination therapy strategies are necessary to realize the potential of these drugs. To search for therapeutic vulnerabilities induced by DHODH inhibition, we examined gene expression changes in cancer cells treated with the potent and selective DHODH inhibitor brequinar (BQ). This revealed that BQ treatment causes upregulation of antigen presentation pathway genes and cell surface MHC class I expression. Mechanistic studies showed that this effect is (1) strictly dependent on pyrimidine nucleotide depletion, (2) independent of canonical antigen presentation pathway transcriptional regulators, and (3) mediated by RNA polymerase II elongation control by positive transcription elongation factor B (P-TEFb). Furthermore, BQ showed impressive single-agent efficacy in the immunocompetent B16F10 melanoma model, and combination treatment with BQ and dual immune checkpoint blockade (anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1) significantly prolonged mouse survival compared to either therapy alone. Our results have important implications for the clinical development of DHODH inhibitors and provide a rationale for combination therapy with BQ and immune checkpoint blockade.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DHODH</kwd><kwd>MHC-I</kwd><kwd>P-TEFb</kwd><kwd>pyrimidine nucleotide</kwd><kwd>antigen presentation</kwd><kwd>Brequinar</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30CA265277</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mullen</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA163649</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Pankaj K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54CA274329</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Pankaj K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21CA251151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Natarajan</surname><given-names>Amarnath</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM126908</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Price</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA270234</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Pankaj K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cancer cell antigen presentation, a requirement for immune-mediated tumor rejection, is induced by dihydroorotate dehydrogenase-inhibitor-mediated cancer cell pyrimidine nucleotide depletion via P-TEFb-dependent transcriptional upregulation of MHC-I and related genes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Deranged cellular metabolism is a universal feature of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Warburg, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). One particularly cancer-essential metabolic aberration is the hyperactive synthesis and utilization of nucleotide triphosphates; this phenotype is a critical driver of cancer cell malignant behaviors, including uncontrolled proliferation, evasion of the host immune response, metastasis to distant organs, and resistance to antineoplastic therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mullen and Singh, 2023</xref>). The de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, which generates pyrimidine nucleotides from aspartate and glutamine, is consistently hyperactive in cancer cells and druggable by clinically approved inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) catalyzes the fourth step in this pathway and is essential for de novo pyrimidine synthesis. DHODH inhibitors have shown robust preclinical anticancer activity across diverse cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shukla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Christian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sykes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koundinya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Santana-Codina et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mathur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bajzikova et al., 2019</xref>) and have recently entered clinical trials for multiple hematological cancers (NCT04609826 and NCT02509052). Although there is a vast literature on DHODH inhibitors dating back to the early 1990s, and despite the ‘rediscovery’ of DHODH in recent years as a critical cancer cell metabolic dependency, important questions about the cellular response to DHODH inhibition remain unanswered.</p><p>While combination chemotherapy is highly effective and potentially curative against certain cancers (e.g., Hodgkin lymphoma, testicular cancer, childhood leukemia, and others), many common malignancies are refractory to chemotherapy (e.g., lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falzone et al., 2018</xref>). In some chemotherapy-refractory cancers (most prominently melanoma, mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer), immunotherapeutic strategies have demonstrated strong efficacy and led to durable remissions in a subset of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vaddepally et al., 2020</xref>). The efficacy of immunotherapy agents is dependent on multiple factors, including tumor antigen presentation, limited immune cells in the tumor milieu, and T-cell activation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mundry et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Waldman et al., 2020</xref>). Adoptive cell therapies and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) can address the issues of limited immune cell recruitment into tumors and limited T-cell activation, respectively. However, adequate antigen presentation by tumor cells is still required for immunotherapy efficacy, which relies on T-cell-mediated adaptive immunity.</p><p>The antigen presentation pathway (APP) mediates the presentation of endogenous peptide antigens to CD8 T-cells via MHC class I (MHC-I). This pathway entails the degradation of cellular proteins into small peptides by the proteasome, the import of these peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum by transporter associated with antigen presentation proteins (<italic>TAP1</italic> and <italic>TAP2</italic>), and the loading of these peptides into the MHC-I complex, which consists of a heavy chain (encoded by <italic>HLA-A</italic>, <italic>HLA-B</italic>, or <italic>HLA-C</italic>) and a light chain (encoded by <italic>B2M</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pishesha et al., 2022</xref>). APP genes are often downregulated in cancer cells, and this impedes the recognition of immunogenic MHC-I restricted cancer cell antigens by infiltrating T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cornel et al., 2020</xref>). Antigen presentation and T-cell recognition are crucial for T-cell-mediated killing of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dhatchinamoorthy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zaretsky et al., 2016</xref>), and forced MHC-I expression enhances immunotherapy efficacy in preclinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamamoto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalbasi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, high tumoral expression of MHC-I, MHC-II, and other APP genes correlates with better overall survival in patients with melanoma treated with ICB therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rodig et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grasso et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shklovskaya et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While previous reports have shown that pyrimidine nucleotide depletion triggers the expression of innate immunity-related genes and induces an interferon-like response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luthra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lucas-Hourani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sprenger et al., 2021</xref>), the role of pyrimidine starvation in antigen presentation has not been reported. Herein, we report that DHODH inhibition induces the robust upregulation of APP genes and increases tumor cell antigen presentation via MHC-I. We further explored the mechanism and functional consequences of DHODH inhibitor-mediated APP induction in cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Brequinar induces upregulation of MHC-I and APP genes</title><p>We examined gene expression changes following transient or prolonged DHODH inhibition by culturing human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines S2-013 and CFPAC-1 in the presence of brequinar (BQ) at two different doses for 16 hr and for a 2-week duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To address this, we screened a panel of genotoxic chemotherapy agents and small molecule inhibitors for their ability to induce APP genes following 72 hr exposure at previously determined cytotoxic doses in CFPAC-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Besides interferon gamma (a positive control), BQ, teriflunomide, and GSK983 (another DHODH inhibitor), the only agent that induced APP gene transcription in this assay was mycophenolate, a clinically approved inhibitor of the de novo GTP synthesis enzymes inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IMPDH1/2). The effect of mycophenolate on APP gene expression was subsequently validated in B16F10 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), demonstrating that either purine or pyrimidine nucleotide depletion can induce cancer cell APP mRNA expression in vitro.</p><p>The other drugs screened included nucleotide synthesis inhibitors (5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, gemcitabine, and hydroxyurea), DNA damage inducers (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and cytarabine), a microtubule targeting drug (paclitaxel), a DNA methylation inhibitor (azacytidine), and other small molecule inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). While we cannot rule out the possibility that these agents induce APP transcription in other cell lines or under other dose/duration conditions, the inertness of these compounds (with respect to APP gene expression) in our screen suggests that BQ-mediated APP induction in CFPAC-1 cells is not a general phenomenon that occurs downstream of DNA damage or some other response to therapy-induced stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>BQ-mediated APP induction does not depend on canonical APP transcriptional regulators</title><p>To elucidate the molecular pathway leading to APP induction downstream of pyrimidine depletion, we extended our findings to HEK-293T cells, which also display rapid (within 4 hr) transcriptional induction of MHC-I upon BQ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

It also suggests that the BMS-345541 effect of reversing BQ-induced APP upregulation is due to P-TEFb inhibition.</p><p>Within the list of kinases bound by BMS-345541 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we eliminated those that were (a) not expressed by CFPAC-1 cells in our RNA-seq data, (b) not bound by flavopiridol in KINOMEscan data, or (c) bound by ruxolitinib in KINOMEscan data with Kd &lt; 500 nM (as 2.5 µM ruxolitinib failed to reverse BQ-mediated APP induction; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Five candidates (besides CDK9) remained that were bound by both BMS-345541 and flavopiridol in KINOMEscan assays. Of these, three are CDKs known to play a role in transcription (CDK7, CDK13, and CDK16). Inhibition of any of these CDKs could theoretically account for the observed effects of flavopiridol and BMS-345541. However, previous studies suggest that flavopiridol inhibition of these CDKs in vivo is much less efficient than in cell-free assays because it is competitive with ATP (and thus less efficient in living cells where the ATP concentration is in the 1–10 mM range, which is much higher than in cell-free assay conditions), while its inhibition of P-TEFb is not affected by ATP concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chao et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, flavopiridol and the CDK7 inhibitor THZ1 have very different (and mutually exclusive) effects on transcriptional processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nilson et al., 2015</xref>), arguing against CDK7 inhibition as the mechanism of flavopiridol’s effect.</p><p>To further probe whether the observed effect of flavopiridol was due to CDK9 inhibition, we tested two other CDK9 inhibitors (AT7519 and dinaciclib). Both CDK9 inhibitors phenocopied flavopiridol in our assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, a previously characterized CDK9-targeted proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC), termed PROTAC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">King et al., 2021</xref>), had the same effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). PROTAC2 consists of a CDK9-binding aminopyrazole warhead conjugated to pomalidomide, which recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cereblon (<italic>CRBN</italic>). Cereblon in turn ubiquitinates CDK9, resulting in its proteasomal degradation. Co-treatment of HEK-293 cells with PROTAC2 and pomalidomide prevents PROTAC2-mediated CDK9 degradation, as free pomalidomide competes with PROTAC2 for Cereblon binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">King et al., 2021</xref>). We observed that PROTAC2 (1 µM) blocked BQ-mediated APP induction, and this effect was reversed by co-treatment with tenfold excess pomalidomide (10 µM); however, when we increased the concentration of PROTAC2 to 10 µM (so that PROTAC2 and pomalidomide concentrations were equal), pomalidomide no longer had this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Consistently, immunoblot analysis showed that 10 µM pomalidomide prevents CDK9 degradation upon 1 µM but not 10 µM PROTAC2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). When we repeated the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> with HCT116 cells, we found that all CKD9 inhibitors reversed BQ-mediated APP induction, but PROTAC2 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Concordantly, immunoblot analysis showed that PROTAC2 did not cause CDK9 depletion in HCT116 cells treated in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that CDK9 degradation is necessary for the reversal effect of PROTAC2 and that CDK9 is required for BQ-mediated APP induction.</p><p>The dependence of BQ-mediated APP induction on CDK9 strongly suggests that nucleotide starvation enforces nascent transcription of APP genes, as opposed to increased mRNA stability. This is further supported by the rapid buildup of APP transcripts following DHODH inhibitor treatment (within 4 hr, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, ChIP-seq analysis of global Pol II occupancy following 48 hr teriflunomide treatment in A375 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tan et al., 2016</xref>) shows increased Pol II occupancy across many APP genes, and fold change in Pol II occupancy significantly correlated with fold change in mRNA expression under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Overall, these results show that nucleotide starvation induces an antigen presentation gene expression program that is independent of canonical APP regulators but depends on CDK9/P-TEFb.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>BQ suppresses tumor growth, induces MHC-I expression, and increases immunotherapy efficacy in a syngeneic melanoma model</title><p>Enforced MHC-I upregulation by various interventions can facilitate anticancer immunity and enhance the efficacy of ICB by antibodies directed at PD-(L)1 and/or CTLA-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamamoto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalbasi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 2021</xref>).

We thus addressed whether BQ could augment the efficacy of dual ICB (anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1) with the knowledge that enforced MHC-I antigen presentation has also been shown to boost the effect of ICB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamamoto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalbasi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 2021</xref>). While BQ is not an approved medication, two FDA-approved low-potency DHODH inhibitors (leflunomide, teriflunomide) are effective in treating autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis and act to decrease the activity of auto-reactive T-lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klotz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fox et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller, 2021</xref>). It was possible that BQ treatment may actually impair the effectiveness of ICB by inhibiting T-lymphocytes despite augmented cancer cell antigen presentation. We, therefore, tested both concurrent, upfront administration of BQ plus dual ICB and sequential administration of BQ followed by dual ICB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Similar to its impressive activity in our first experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>), BQ monotherapy conferred marked survival benefit. This was significantly enhanced by subsequent dual ICB, while dual ICB alone conferred only marginally prolonged survival, and concurrent BQ plus dual ICB did not significantly improve survival versus BQ monotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This suggests that sequential (rather than concurrent) administration of DHODH inhibitor and ICB may be superior. Hypotheses that may explain these findings include: (a) concurrent BQ dampens the initial anticancer immune response generated by dual ICB, or (b) cancer cell MHC-I and related genes are not maximally upregulated at the time of ICB administration with concurrent treatment. Taken together, these results show that BQ causes pyrimidine nucleotide depletion, MHC-I and APP gene transcriptional upregulation, and additive survival benefit with dual ICB in a highly aggressive and ICB-refractory mouse melanoma model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results demonstrate that pyrimidine nucleotide depletion by DHODH inhibition causes increased expression of APP genes and increased antigen presentation via MHC-I across a diverse panel of cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This effect of BQ and teriflunomide is strictly dependent on pyrimidine nucleotide depletion, as it was abrogated by restoration of pyrimidine levels with exogenous uridine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>). Furthermore, genetic deletion of <italic>DHODH</italic> recapitulated this effect, and treatment of DHODH knockout cells with BQ did not further increase MHC-I mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Our inhibitor reversal studies determined that BQ-mediated APP induction is independent of several canonical APP regulatory pathways, including IFN-JAK-STAT, cGAS-STING-TBK1, and NF-κB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We showed that this effect relies on P-TEFb-mediated release of Pol II from promoter-proximal paused state to productive elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These findings were extended to inhibition of IMPDH (which depletes cellular GTP) and CTPS (which depletes cellular CTP), as these effects were also reversible with P-TEFb inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This suggests that pharmacologic depletion of these nucleotide species also triggers APP upregulation in a P-TEFb-dependent manner.</p><p>Since T-cell recognition of antigens via MHC-I is required for T-cell-mediated elimination of cancer cells or virus-infected cells, these results have important implications for the development of nucleotide synthesis inhibitors as anticancer/antiviral therapies. We provide proof-of-concept evidence that pretreatment with DHODH inhibitors can improve the efficacy of ICB in a highly aggressive and ICB-refractory mouse melanoma model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because BQ-mediated APP induction does not require interferon signaling, this strategy may have particular relevance for clinical scenarios in which tumor antigen presentation is dampened by the loss or silencing of cancer cell interferon signaling, which has been demonstrated to confer both intrinsic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shin et al., 2017</xref>) and acquired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zaretsky et al., 2016</xref>) ICB resistance in human melanoma patients.</p><p>Emerging evidence suggests that cancer cell MHC-I expression predicts favorable response to ICB, and several recent studies have shown that enforced cancer cell MHC-I expression enhances anticancer immunity and ICB efficacy in various mouse models. Accordingly, functional genomic screens for regulators of cancer cell MHC-I expression have recently been undertaken, and these efforts have revealed novel molecular targets to induce cancer cell APP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dersh et al., 2021</xref>). Agents shown to increase cancer cell antigen presentation include hydroxychloroquine (by autophagy inhibition) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamamoto et al., 2020</xref>), poly(I:C) (by NF-κB activation downstream of dsRNA sensing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalbasi et al., 2020</xref>), SMAC mimetics (by NF-κB activation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 2021</xref>), CDK4/6 inhibitors (by activation of endogenous genomic retroviral elements) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goel et al., 2017</xref>), and others. It is very likely that many other anticancer drugs perturb cancer cell antigen presentation and/or have other immunomodulatory properties in addition to their cell-intrinsic antiproliferative activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Petroni et al., 2021</xref>), and this area requires further scrutiny. In this study, we identified DHODH inhibition as a powerful inducer of antigen presentation and MHC-I expression in diverse cancer cell lines and in HEK-293T cells.</p><p>Previous studies have linked pyrimidine depletion with upregulation of innate immunity and interferon-stimulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lucas-Hourani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sprenger et al., 2021</xref>) and this was confirmed by our transcriptomic profiling experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Multiple mechanistic explanations for these observations have been suggested. Lucas-Hourani et al. proposed that interferon-stimulated gene expression requires the DNA damage checkpoint kinase ATM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lucas-Hourani et al., 2013</xref>) while Sprenger et al. conclude that pyrimidine depletion causes accumulation of mitochondrial DNA in the cytosol, which is sensed by the cGAS-STING-TBK1 pathway to promote innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sprenger et al., 2021</xref>). In our models, neither ATM/ATR nor TBK1 inhibition blocked BQ-mediated APP induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). It is possible that pyrimidine nucleotide shortage leads to APP induction by multiple redundant mechanisms, any of which may predominate based on the cellular context. We speculate that cells may have evolved multiple means of sensing acute pyrimidine shortage as a way to detect viral infection or malignant transformation, as both viral replication and uncontrolled cell proliferation avidly consume nucleotides.</p><p>Our focused chemical screen for MHC-I inducers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) identified the approved IMPDH1/2 inhibitor mycophenolate, which was subsequently validated in multiple other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, S4A). This is consistent with a recent study in which IMPDH inhibition was shown to enhance ICB efficacy by favorably altering the MHC-I peptide repertoire and increasing immunoproteasome expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keshet et al., 2020</xref>). However, in this study, the cancer cells were pretreated with IMPDH inhibitor before implantation into syngeneic hosts, and so possible countervailing immunosuppression by systemic IMPDH inhibitor treatment was not addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keshet et al., 2020</xref>). Our in vivo results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) highlight the importance of timing/sequence when administering immunotherapy in combination with nucleotide synthesis inhibitors and suggest that upfront BQ followed by ICB may be superior to concurrent administration.</p><p>Thymidylate synthase inhibition was recently shown to induce MHC-I in a model of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dersh et al., 2021</xref>). The failure of thymidylate synthase inhibitors 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate to induce MHC-I in our screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) may be attributable to cell line differences (PDAC vs. DLBCL), dose/duration considerations, or the use of different thymidylate synthase inhibitors than in their study (which used pemetrexed and raltitrexed). Thus, it appears that the abundance of multiple nucleotide species can exert context-dependent influence on MHC and APP gene expression, and key details of this relationship remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Overall, our study establishes P-TEFb and Pol II elongation control as a mechanistic link between nucleotide depletion and APP induction. We provide proof-of-concept evidence for combinatorial benefit of DHODH inhibition and ICB in an aggressive and poorly immunogenic mouse model of melanoma. A deeper understanding of metabolic control of antigen presentation will enable rational therapy development for cancer and viral infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

For comparison of means between three or more experimental groups, a ANOVA was used. If the one-way ANOVA rejected the null hypothesis of all means being equivalent, a multiple comparison test was used to accept or reject the null hypothesis of equivalent means for each experimentally relevant pair-wise comparison. For each experiment, the chosen multiple comparison test set the family-wise type I error rate (i.e., alpha level) to 0.05 and computed multiplicity-adjusted p values for each pair-wise comparison. The choice of multiple comparison test was based on which pair-wise comparisons were of interest; this was prespecified during the design of each experiment. If each experimental group was to be compared to a single control group (e.g., for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>), Dunnett’s multiple-comparison test was used, with each experimental group compared with the control group but not with the other non-control experimental groups. In all other cases, each experimental group (including the control group) was compared to every other experimental group (e.g., for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B, C, D, E</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B, C and E</xref>) using Tukey’s multiple-comparison test.

For RT-qPCR experiments, if a single technical replicate for a given experimental condition did not show any amplification after 40 cycles, and if all other technical replicates for that experimental condition consistently showed amplification, then the non-amplification in the single replicate was attributed to random technical failure and that replicate was excluded. In instances where none of the technical replicates for a given experimental condition showed amplification after 40 cycles, but amplification was consistently observed in other experimental conditions assayed in parallel, the non-amplification for the mRNA of interest was attributed to the true absence of the mRNA from that sample, and the replicates were assigned a relative abundance value of zero.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Co-founder and holds equity in Clear Creek Bio</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (protocol number: 20-112-03-FC).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Table listing the name, manufacturer, and catalog number of all small molecules used in this study.</title><p>The concentration of each agent that was used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> is also listed.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-87292-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Table listing the gene symbol and NCBI gene ID for each gene that was named in this this article.</title><p>For genes that were assayed by RT-qPCR, forward and reverse primer sequences are listed. ‘N/A’ indicates that primer sequence is not applicable because that gene was not assayed by RT-qPCR in this study.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-87292-supp2-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-87292-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed in this study have been included in the manuscript and supporting files; source data files have been provided for all figures.

The manuscript includes a series of experiments that demonstrate that blockade of pyrimidine synthesis with DHODH inhibitors (i.e. brequinar (BQ)) stimulates the expression of genes involved in antigen presentation. The authors provide evidence that BQ mediated induction of MHC is independent of interferon signaling. A subsequent targeted chemical screen yielded evidence that CDK9 is the critical downstream mediator that induces RNA Pol II pause release on antigen presentation genes to increase expression. Finally, the authors demonstrate that BQ elicits strong anti-tumor activity in vivo in syngeneic models, and that combination of BQ with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) results in significant lifespan extension in the B16-F10 melanoma model. Overall, the manuscript uncovers an interesting and unexpected mechanism that influences antigen presentation and provides an avenue for pharmacological manipulation of MHC genes, which is therapeutically relevant in many cancers. However, a few key experiments are needed to ensure that the proposed mechanism is indeed functional in vivo.</p><p>Major Points:</p><p>(1) According to the proposed model, BQ mediated induction of antigen presentation is a contributing factor to the efficacy of this therapeutic strategy. If this is true, then depletion of immune cells should reduce the therapeutic efficacy of BQ in vivo. The authors should perform the B16-F10 transplant experiments in either Rag null mice (if available) or with CD8/CD4 depletion. The expectation would be that T cell depletion (or MHC loss with genetic manipulation) should reduce the efficacy of BQ treatment. Absent this critical experiment, it is difficult to confidently conclude that induction of antigen presentation is a fundamental component of the in vivo response to DHODH inhibition.</p><p>(2) Does BQ treatment induce antigen presentation in non-malignant cells? APCs? If the induction of antigen presentation is not cancer specific and related to a pyrimidine depletion stress response, then there is a possibility that healthy tissues will also exhibit a similar phenotype, raising concerns about the specificity of a de novo immune response. The authors should examine antigen presentation genes in healthy tissues treated with BQ.</p><p>(3) In the title, the authors claim that DHODH enhances the efficacy of ICB. However, the experiment shown in Figure 5D does not demonstrate this. The Kaplan Meier curves reflect more of an additive response versus a synergistic combination. Furthermore, the concurrent treatment of BQ and ICB seems to inhibit the efficacy of ICB due to BQ toxicity in immune cells. When concurrently administered, the survival of the mice is the same as with brequinar alone, suggesting that the efficacy of ICB was diminished. However, if ICB is administered following an initial dose of BQ, there is an added survival benefit of a magnitude that is similar to ICB alone. This result seems to contradict the title. Furthermore, the authors should show the longitudinal growth curves of these tumors.</p><p>(4) Related to Point 3, the temporal separation of BQ and ICB raises the question of whether the induction of antigen presentation with BQ is persistent during the course of delayed ICB treatment. One explanation for the results is that BQ treatment reduces tumor burden, and then a subsequent course of ICB also reduces tumor burden but not that the two therapies are functioning in synergy. To address this, the authors should measure the duration of BQ mediated induction of antigen presentation after stopping treatment.</p><p>(5) In Figure 1, the authors show that DHODH inhibition induces expression of both MHC-I and MHC-II genes at the RNA level. However, they only validate MHC-I by flow cytometry. A simple experiment to evaluate the effect of BQ treatment on MHC-II surface expression would provide important additional mechanistic insight into the immunomodulatory effects of DHODH inhibition, especially given recent literature reinforcing the importance of MHC-II expression on epithelial cancers, including melanoma (Oliveira et al. Nature 2022).</p><p>Minor Points:</p><p>(1) The authors show ChIP-seq tracks from Tan et al. for HLA-B. However, given the pervasive effect of Ter treatment across many HLA genes, the authors should either show tracks at additional loci, or provide a heatmap of read density across more loci. This would substantiate the mechanistic claim that RNA Pol II occupancy and activity across antigen presentation genes is the major driver of response to DHODH inhibition as opposed to mRNA stabilization/increased translation.</p><p>(2) A compelling way to demonstrate a change in antigen presentation is through mass spectrometry based immunopeptidomics. Performing immunopeptidomic analysis of BQ treated cell lines would provide substantial mechanistic insight into the outcome of BQ treatment. While this approach may be outside the scope of the current work, the authors should speculate on how this treatment may specifically alter the antigenic landscape where future directions would include empirical immunopeptidomics measurements.</p><p>(3) While the signaling through CDK9 seems convincing, it still does not provide a mechanistic link between depleted pyrimidines and CDK9 activity. The authors should speculate on the mechanism that signals to CDK9.</p><p>(4) Related to minor point 2, the authors should consider a genetic approach to confirm the importance of CDK9. While the pharmacological approach, including multiple mechanistically distinct CDK9 inhibitors provides strong evidence, an additional experiment with genetic depletion of CDK9 (CRISPR KO, shRNA, etc) would provide compelling mechanistic confirmation.</p><p>(5) The authors should comment in the discussion on how this strategy may be particularly useful in patients harboring genetic or epigenetic loss of interferon signaling, a known mechanism of ICB resistance. Perhaps DHODH inhibition could rescue MHC expression in cells that are deficient in interferon sensing.</p><p>Overall, the paper is clearly written and presented. With the additional experiments described above, especially in vivo, this manuscript would provide a strong contribution to the field of antigen presentation in cancer. The distinct mechanisms by which DHODH inhibition induces antigen presentation will also set the stage for future exploration into alternative methods of antigen induction.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>The authors address the majority of the points raised in my previous review. However, no additional in vivo experiments were performed, which seems necessary for the major conclusions of the paper.</p><p>I disagree with the authors' assessment of Major Point 3 in my review. I have updated the text of Major Point 3 in my public review to further clarify my position.</p><p>My final assessment is that if the authors want to claim that DHODH inhibition potentiates immune checkpoint blockade, as is stated in the title, then further in vivo experimentation is needed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87292.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Mullen et al present an important study describing how DHODH inhibition enhances efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade by increasing cell surface expression of MHC I in cancer cells. DHODH inhibitors have been used in the clinic for many years to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis and there has been a growing interest in repurposing these inhibitors as anti-cancer drugs. In this manuscript, the Singh group builds on their previous work defining combinatorial strategies with DHODH inhibitors to improve efficacy. The authors identify an increased expression of genes in the antigen presentation pathway and MHC I after BQ treatment which is mediated strictly by pyrimidine depletion and CDK9/P-TEFb. The authors rationalize that increased MHC I expression induced by DHODH inhibition might favor efficacy of dual immune checkpoint blockade. In fact, this combinatorial treatment prolonged survival in an immunocompetent B16F10 melanoma model.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that DHODH inhibitors can increase expression of innate immunity-related genes but the role of DHODH and pyrimidine nucleotides in antigen presentation has not been previously reported. A strength of the manuscript is the solid in vitro mechanistic data supported by analysis in multiple cell lines. The in vivo data show compelling additive effects of DHODH inhibitors and ICB. However, more controls and experiments would be required to define the nature of these effects and to confirm that the mechanistic in vitro data is conserved in vivo.</p><p>This is a relevant manuscript proposing a mechanistic link between pyrimidine depletion and MHC I expression and a novel therapeutic approach combining DHODH inhibitors with dual checkpoint blockade. These results might be relevant for the clinical development of DHODH inhibitors in the treatment of solid tumors, a setting where these have not shown optimal efficacy yet.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>The authors have addressed my questions regarding validation of gene expression in other cell lines. They have also provided an explanation about why in vivo evaluations could not be performed for the experiment in Figure 5E.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment"

According to DepMap, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of CDK9 in cancer cell lines is almost universally deleterious, scoring as “essential” in 99.8% (1093/1095) of all cell lines tested (see Author response image 1 below). This makes sense, as P-TEFb is required for productive RNA polymerase II elongation of most mammalian genes. As such, it was not feasible to generate cell lines with stable genetic knockout of CDK9 to test our hypothesis.</p><p>While knockdown of CDK9 by RNA interference could support our results, DepMap data seems to indicate that RNAi-mediated knockdown of CDK9 is generally ineffective in silencing its activity, as this perturbation scored as “essential” in only 6.2% (44/710) of tested cell lines. This suggests that incomplete depletion of CDK9 will likely not be sufficient to block APP induction downstream of nucleotide depletion. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated depletion of CDK9 may trigger transcriptional changes in the cell by virtue of its many documented protein-protein interactions, and it would be difficult to establish a consistent “time zero” at which point CDK9 protein depletion is substantial but secondary effects of this have not yet occurred to a significant degree. These factors constitute major limitations of experiments using RNAi-mediated knockdown of CDK9.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Essentiality score from CRISPR and RNAi perturbation of CDK9 in cancer cell lines <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org/portal/gene/CDK9?tab=overview&amp;dependency=RNAi_merged">https://depmap.org/portal/gene/CDK9?tab=overview&amp;dependency=RNAi_merged</ext-link>.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87292-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>At any rate, we provide evidence that three different inhibitors of CDK9 (flavopiridol, dinaciclib, and AT7519) all inhibit our effect of interest (Fig 4B). The same results were observed using a previously validated CDK9-directed proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC2), and this was reversed by addition of excess pomalidomide (Fig 4C), which correlated with the presence/absence of CDK9 on western blot under the exact same conditions (Fig 4D).</p><p>It is formally possible that all CDK9 inhibitors we tested are blocking BQ-mediated APP induction by some shared off-target mechanism (or perhaps by two or more different off-target mechanisms) AND this CDK9-independent target also happens to be degraded by PROTAC2. However, this would be an extraordinarily non-parsimonious explanation for our results, and so we contend that we have provided compelling evidence for the requirement of CDK9 for BQ-mediated APP induction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, high concentrations of BQ have been reported to show off-target effects, sensitizing cancer cells to ferroptosis, and the authors should discuss whether the dose used in the in vivo study reached the ferroptotic sensitizing dose or not.</p></disp-quote><p>We are intrigued by the results shown to us by Reviewer #1 in the linked preprint (Mishima et al 2022, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2190326/v1">https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2190326/v1</ext-link>). We have also observed in our unpublished data that very high concentrations of BQ (&gt;150µM) cause loss of cell viability that is not rescued by uridine supplementation and that occurs even in DHODH knockout cells. This effect of high-dose BQ must be DHODH-independent. We also agree that Mishima et al provide compelling evidence that the ferroptosis-sensitizing effect of high-dose BQ treatment is due (at least in large part) to inhibition of FSP1.</p><p>Although we showed that DHODH is strongly inhibited in tumor cells in vivo (Fig 5C), we did not directly measure the concentration of BQ in the tumor or plasma. Sykes et al (PMID: 27641501) found that the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for [BQ]free following a single IP administration in C57Bl6/J mice (15mg/kg) is approximately 3µM, while the Cmax for [BQ]total was around 215µM. Because polar drug molecules bound to serum proteins (predominantly albumin) are not available to bind other targets, [BQ]free is the relevant parameter.</p><p>Given a Cmax for [BQ]free of 3µM and half-life of 12.0 hours, we estimate that the steady-state [BQ]free with daily IP injections at this dose is around 4µM. Since we used an administration schedule of 10mg/kg every 24 hours, we estimate that the steady-state plasma [BQ]free in our system was 2.67µM (assuming initial Cmax of 2µM and half-life of 12.0 hours).</p><p>To derive an upper-bound estimate for the Cmax of [BQ]free over the 12-day treatment period (Fig 5A-D), we will use the observed data for 15mg/kg dose, and we will assume that (1) there is no clearance of BQ whatsoever and (2) that [BQ]free increases linearly with increasing [BQ]total. This yields a maximum free BQ concentration of 12 x 3 = 36µM.</p><p>Therefore, we consider it very unlikely that plasma concentrations of free BQ in our experiment exceeded the lower limit of the ferroptosis-sensitizing dose range reported by Mishima et al. However, without direct pharmacokinetic analysis, we cannot say for sure what the maximal [BQ]free was under our experimental conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In their manuscript entitled &quot;DHODH inhibition enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade by increasing cancer cell antigen presentation&quot;, Mullen et al. describe an interesting mechanism of inducing antigen presentation.

DHODH inhibitors have been used in the clinic for many years to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis and there has been a growing interest in repurposing these inhibitors as anti-cancer drugs. In this manuscript, the Singh group build on their previous work defining combinatorial strategies with DHODH inhibitors to improve efficacy. The authors identify an increase in expression of genes involved in the antigen presentation pathway and MHC I after BQ treatment and they narrow the mechanism to be strictly pyrimidine and CDK9/P-TEFb dependent. The authors rationalize that increased MHC I expression induced by DHODH inhibition might favor efficacy of dual immune checkpoint blockade. This combinatorial treatment prolonged survival in an immunocompetent B16F10 melanoma model.</p></disp-quote><p>[No comment from authors]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Previous studies have shown that DHODH inhibitors can increase expression of innate immunity-related genes but the role of DHODH and pyrimidine nucleotides in antigen presentation has not been previously reported. A strength of the manuscript is the use of multiple controls across a panel of cell lines to exclude off-target effects and to confirm that effects are exclusively dependent on pyrimidine depletion. Overall, the authors do a thorough characterization of the mechanism that mediates MHC I upregulation using multiple strategies. Furthermore, the in vivo studies provide solid evidence for combining DHODH inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade.</p></disp-quote><p>No comment from authors</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, despite the use of multiple cell lines, most experiments are only performed in one cell line, and it is hard to understand why particular gene sets, cell lines or time points are selected for each experiment.

We would like to explain how our cell line panel evolved over the course of the study.Our first indication that BQ caused APP upregulation came from transcriptomics experiments (Figs 1A-D, S1A) performed as part of a previous study investigating BQ resistance (Mullen et al, 2023 Cancer Letters). In that study, we used CFPAC-1 as a model for BQ sensitivity and S2-013 as a model for BQ resistance. We did RNA sequencing +/- BQ in these cell lines to look for gene expression patterns that might underlie resistance/sensitivity to BQ. When analyzing this data, we serendipitously discovered the APP/MHC phenomenon, which gave rise to the present study.</p><p>Our next step was to extend these findings to cancer cell lines of other histologies, and we prioritized cell lines derived from common cancer types for which immunotherapy (specifically ICB) are clinically approved. This is why A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), HCT116 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), A375 (cutaneous melanoma), and MDA-MB-231 (triple-negative breast cancer) cell lines were introduced.</p><p>Because PDAC is considered to have an especially “immune-cold” tumor microenvironment, we reasoned that even dramatically increasing cancer cell antigen presentation may be insufficient to elicit an effective anti-tumor immune response in vivo. So we shifted our focus towards melanoma, because a subset of melanoma patients is very responsive to ICB and loss of antigen presentation (by direct silencing or homozygous loss-of-function mutations in MHC-I components such as B2M, or by functional loss of IFN-JAK1/2-STAT signaling) has been shown to mediate ICB resistance in human melanoma patients. This is why we extended our findings to B16F10 murine melanoma cells, intending to use them for in vivo studies with syngeneic immunocompetent recipient mice.</p><p>The PDAC cell line MiaPaCa2 was introduced because a collaborator at our institution (Amar Natarajan) happened to have IKK2 knockout MiaPaCa2 cells, which allowed us to genetically validate our inhibitor results showing that IKK1 and IKK2 (crucial effectors for NF-kB signaling) are dispensable for our effect of interest.</p><p>Ultimately, realizing that our results spanned various human and murine cell lines, we chose to use HEK-293T cells to validate the general applicability of our findings to proliferating cells in 2D culture, since HEK-293T cells (compared to our cancer cell lines) have relatively few genetic idiosyncrasies and express MHC-I at baseline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The differential in vivo survival depending on dosing schedule is interesting.

The additional effect of BQ in the xenograft tumor study was not examined to determine if it was due to increased antigen presentation toward the cancer cells or due to merely cell cycle arrest effect by pyrimidine depletion in the tumor cells. The different administration timing of ICB with BQ treatment (Fig 5E) would not be sufficient to answer this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this assessment and, and we believe the experiment proposed by Reviewer #2 below (comparing the efficacy of BQ in Rag-null versus immunocompetent recipients) would address this question directly. We also think that using a more immunogenic cell line for this experiment (such as B16F10 transduced with ovalbumin or some other strong neoantigen) would be useful given the poor immunogenicity and lack of any defined strong neoantigen in B16F10 cells.

If this is true, then depletion of immune cells should reduce the therapeutic efficacy of BQ in vivo. The authors should perform the B16-F10 transplant experiments in either Rag null mice (if available) or with CD8/CD4 depletion. The expectation would be that T cell depletion (or MHC loss with genetic manipulation) should reduce the efficacy of BQ treatment. Absent this critical experiment, it is difficult to confidently conclude that induction of antigen presentation is a fundamental component of the in vivo response to DHODH inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this assessment and the proposed experiment comparing the response in Rag-null versus immunocompetent recipients.

If the induction of antigen presentation is not cancer specific and related to a pyrimidine depletion stress response, then there is a possibility that healthy tissues will also exhibit a similar phenotype, raising concerns about the specificity of a de novo immune response. The authors should examine antigen presentation genes in healthy tissues treated with BQ.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it is important to examine if our findings regarding nucleotide depletion and antigen presentation are true of APCs and other non-transformed cells, but we are not so concerned about the possibility of raising an immune response against non-malignant host tissues, as explained above.

However, the experiment shown in Figure 5D does not demonstrate this. The Kaplan Meier curves reflect more of an additive response versus a synergistic combination.

This result seems to contradict the title.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not agree with this assessment.

One explanation for the results is that BQ treatment reduces tumor burden, and then a subsequent course of ICB also reduces tumor burden but not that the two therapies are functioning in synergy. To address this, the authors should measure the duration of BQ mediated induction of antigen presentation after stopping treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the alternative explanation proposed by Reviewer #2 is possible and we appreciate the suggestion to test the stability of APP induction after stopping BQ treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Figure 1, the authors show that DHODH inhibition induces expression of both MHC-I and MHC-II genes at the RNA level.

However, given the pervasive effect of Ter treatment across many HLA genes, the authors should either show tracks at additional loci, or provide a heatmap of read density across more loci. This would substantiate the mechanistic claim that RNA Pol II occupancy and activity across antigen presentation genes is the major driver of response to DHODH inhibition as opposed to mRNA stabilization/increased translation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion. We have changed Fig 4 by replacing the HLA-B track (old Fig 4E) with a representation of fold change (Ter/DMSO) in Pol II occupancy versus fold change (Ter/DMSO) in mRNA abundance for 23 relevant genes (new Fig 4G); both of these datasets were obtained from the Tan et al manuscript. This new figure panel (Fig 4G) also shows linear regression analysis demonstrating that Pol II occupancy and mRNA expression are significantly correlated for APP genes. While we recognize that this data in itself is not formal proof of our hypothesis, it does strongly support the notion that increased transcription is responsible for the increased mRNA abundance of APP genes that we have observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) A compelling way to demonstrate a change in antigen presentation is through mass spectrometry based immunopeptidomics. Performing immunopeptidomic analysis of BQ treated cell lines would provide substantial mechanistic insight into the outcome of BQ treatment. While this approach may be outside the scope of the current work, the authors should speculate on how this treatment may specifically alter the antigenic landscape where future directions would include empirical immunopeptidomics measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this comment. While the abundance of cancer cell surface MHC-I is an important factor for anticancer immunity, another crucial factor is the identity of peptides that are presented. Treatments that cause presentation of more immunogenic peptides can enhance T-cell recognition even in the absence of a relative change in cell surface MHC-I abundance.</p><p>While we did not perform the immunopeptidomics experiments described, we can offer some speculation regarding this comment. As shown in Fig 1D-E, transcriptomics experiments suggest that immunoproteasome subunits (PSMB8, PSMB9, PSMB10) are upregulated upon DHODH inhibition. If this change in mRNA levels translates into greater immunoproteasome activity (which was not tested in our study), this would be expected to alter the repertoire of peptides available for presentation and could thereby change the immunopeptidome.</p><p>However, this hypothesis requires direct testing, and we hope future studies will delineate the effects of DHODH inhibition and other cancer therapies on the immunopeptidome, as this area of research will have important clinical implications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) While the signaling through CDK9 seems convincing, it still does not provide a mechanistic link between depleted pyrimidines and CDK9 activity. The authors should speculate on the mechanism that signals to CDK9.</p><p>We agree with the assessment. A mechanistic link between depleted pyrimidines and CDK9 activity will be a subject of future studies.</p><p>(4) Related to minor point 2, the authors should consider a genetic approach to confirm the importance of CDK9. While the pharmacological approach, including multiple mechanistically distinct CDK9 inhibitors provides strong evidence, an additional experiment with genetic depletion of CDK9 (CRISPR KO, shRNA, etc) would provide compelling mechanistic confirmation.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1 raised this very same point, and we agree. Please see our reply to Reviewer #1, which details why we did not pursue this approach and argues that the evidence we present is compelling even in absence of genetic manipulation.</p><p>Additionally, please see the new Fig 4E and 4F, which is a repeat of Fig 4B using HCT116 cells. Figure 4E shows that, in this cell line, CDK9 inhibitors (flavopiridol, dinaciclib, and AT7519) block BQ-mediated APP induction, while PROTAC2 does not. Figure 4F shows that (for reasons we cannot fully explain) PROTAC2 does not lead to CDK9 degradation in HCT116 cells. This data strongly implicates CDK9, because it excludes a CDK9-degradation-independent effect of PROTAC2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 2B needs a legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.

We have amended the Discussion section to mention this important point. Please see paragraph 2 of the revised Discussion section where we have added the following text:</p><p>“Because BQ-mediated APP induction does not require interferon signaling, this strategy may have particular relevance for clinical scenarios in which tumor antigen presentation is dampened by the loss or silencing of cancer cell interferon signaling, which has been demonstrated to confer both intrinsic and acquired ICB resistance in human melanoma patients.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The authors present convincing evidence of the mechanism by which pyrimidine nucleotides regulate MHC I levels and about the potential of combining DHODH inhibitors with dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB).

Although Fig 3C shows that BQ-induced expression of H2-Db, H2-Kb, and B2m is reversed by uridine (in B16F10 cells), we recognize that this was not the best placement for this data, as it can easily be overlooked here since uridine reversal is not the main point of Fig 3C.

As we explained above, we consider it very unlikely that the in vivo BQ exposure in our experiments (Fig 5) was high enough to cause significant ferroptosis, especially in the absence of any dedicated ferroptosis-inducing agent (which is typically required to cause ferroptosis even in the presence of high-dose BQ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The authors nail down the mechanism to CDK9 (Fig 4).
