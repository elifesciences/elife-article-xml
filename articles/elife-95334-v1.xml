Current FDA-approved RAF inhibitors selectively inhibit the monomeric BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and suffer from tumor resistance. Recently, dimer-selective and equipotent RAF inhibitors have been developed; however, the mechanism of dimer selectivity is poorly understood. Here, we report extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the monomeric and dimeric BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in the apo form or in complex with one or two dimer-selective (PHI1) or equipotent (LY3009120) inhibitor(s). The simulations uncovered the unprecedented details of the remarkable allostery in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> dimerization and inhibitor binding. Specifically, dimerization retrains and shifts the αC helix inward and increases the flexibility of the DFG motif; dimer compatibility is due to the promotion of the αC-in conformation, which is stabilized by a hydrogen bond formation between the inhibitor and the αC Glu501. A more stable hydrogen bond further restrains and shifts the αC helix inward, which incurs a larger entropic penalty that disfavors monomer binding. This mechanism led us to propose an empirical way based on the co-crystal structure to assess the dimer selectivity of a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitor. Simulations also revealed that the positive cooperativity of PHI1 is due to its ability to preorganize the αC and DFG conformation in the opposite protomer, priming it for binding the second inhibitor. The atomically detailed view of the interplay between BRAF dimerization and inhibitor allostery as well as cooperativity has implications for understanding kinase signaling and contributes to the design of protomer selective RAF inhibitors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kinases</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>molecular simulations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA256557</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Jana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA238229</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gavathiotis</surname><given-names>Evripidis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>BRAF inhibitors achieve monomer or dimer selectivity through their ability to modulate dimerization and allosteric communication.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades regulate cell growth, proliferation, and survival in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lavoie et al., 2020</xref>).

Mutations of BRAF, a kinase within the RAF family, are present in about 8% of human tumors, most commonly melanoma and colorectal cancers, with the mutation V600E accounting for about 90% of them. It is believed that the wild type BRAF signals as a dimer, the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> is able to signal as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Poulikakos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poulikakos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karoulia et al., 2017</xref>). The first generation BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitors, including the current FDA-approved inhibitors, Vermurafenib, Dabrafenib, and Encorafenib, inhibit the monomeric BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>; however, drug resistance led to only short-term cancer remission in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poulikakos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Monaco et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamopoulos et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In the adaptive drug resistance mechanism, RAF dimerization renders the monomer-selective inhibitors ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poulikakos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Monaco et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamopoulos et al., 2021</xref>).

Understanding the molecular mechanism of dimer selectivity would be valuable for the rational design of RAF inhibitors.

Like other kinases, the catalytic activity of BRAF depends on the conformation of two motifs: the αC-helix, which contains the conserved residue Glu501, and the DFG motif on the activation loop (a-loop), which contains the conserved ATP-binding (via magnesium) residue Asp594. In the active state, both the αC helix and DFG adopt the IN conformation, dubbed CIDI. In this state, the αC helix is positioned inward such that αC-Glu501 and the catalytic Lys483 form a salt bridge; meanwhile the DFG motif is also IN, meaning DFG-Asp594 is near Lys483 often in a salt-bridge distance. An inactive conformation can be achieved if either or both the αC helix and DFG motif adopt an OUT state. Specifically, αC-out involves an outward movement of the αChelix, while DFG-out involves the sidechains of the DFG Asp594 and Phe595 exchanging regions, that is Phe595 facing the ATP binding site and Asp594 facing the αC-helix.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The X-ray structure of the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> dimer in complex with PHI1.</title><p>Left.

Thus, the αC conformation has been the center of attention in numerous structural and biochemical studies to understand RAF signaling and inhibitor activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rajakulendran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thevakumaran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Karoulia et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In a recent study, Gavathiotis and coworkers discovered a modification to the dimer-compatible inhibitor Ponatinib which can increase the dimer selectivity by more than three fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cotto-Rios et al., 2020</xref>). The novel inhibitor, named Ponatinib hybrid inhibitor 1 (PHI1), extends the headgroup of Ponatinib by replacing the methylpiperazine with the 4-(2-aminoethyl) morpholino group. Remarkably, PHI1 showed more potent inhibition of the second protomer in the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> dimer; in contrast, Ponatinib and equipotent inhibitors, for example LY3009120 or LY, AZ-628, and TAK-632, are non-cooperative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cotto-Rios et al., 2020</xref>). The co-crystal structure of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in complex with PHI1 (PDB: 6P7G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cotto-Rios et al., 2020</xref>) revealed that the morpholine group extends the ligand-kinase interaction from the type-II pocket (occupied by all DFG-out inhibitors) to the center of αC helix, allowing a hydrophobic interaction with Asn500 next to the αC-Glu501 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The co-crystal structures show that this interaction is not available with the shorter Ponatinib (PDB ID: 6P3D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cotto-Rios et al., 2020</xref>) or equipotent inhibitors, for example LY3009120 (LY, PDB ID: 5C9C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peng et al., 2015</xref>). Gavathiothis and coworkers noticed that PHI1 stabilizes the αC helix in a slightly different IN conformation as compared to Ponatinib and hypothesized that the additional interaction with Asn500 is a key to the dimer selectivity of PHI1, as it may be unfavorable in monomer binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cotto-Rios et al., 2020</xref>). Shortly after, a biochemical study supported by the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggested that restriction of the αC helix movement is the basis for the difference between dimer-selective and equipotent inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamopoulos et al., 2021</xref>); however, the detailed mechanism remains elusive.</p><p>Prompted by the open questions regarding dimer selectivity and binding cooperativity of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitors, we carried out a series of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the conformational dynamics of the monomeric and dimeric BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in the presence and absence of one or two dimer-selective (PHI1) or equipotent (LY) inhibitor(s). Analysis of the simulation data which ammounts to 135 μs aggregate time uncovered the atomic details of the remarkable conformational allostery in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> dimerization and inhibitor binding. Supported by the co-crystal structure analysis of the published monomer-selective, dimer-selective, and equipotent inhibitors, an atomically detailed mechanism emerged that explains the monomer or dimer selectivity and binding cooperativity of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitors.

The interaction fingerprints showed that while most monomer-selective inhibitors make a hydrophobic contact with Leu505 next to the conserved RKTR motif at the end of the αC helix, only the dimer-compatible inhibitors interact with αC-Glu501 by donating a h-bond (e.g. from an amide group in PHI1 and LY) to the carboxylate sidechain of Glu501 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Glu501 rests above BP-II in the DFG-out conformation (called BP-II-out) and may interact with the catalytic Lys483 (see later discussion), which makes up a part of BP-I. Interestingly, even though SB590885 binds in the DFG-in conformation, it can also donate a h-bond to Glu501 through an oxime hydroxyl group (PDB ID: 2FB8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">King et al., 2006</xref>). This h-bond stabilizes the salt-bridge between the catalytic Lys483 and Glu501 such that the αC helix position is further inward (according to the KLIFs definition, see later discussion) as compared to the co-crystal structures in complex with other dimer-compatible inhibitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).</p><p>All monomer-selective and dimer-compatible inhibitors interact with the DFG-Asp594 although with subtle differences.</p><p>In PHI1 (PDB ID: 6P7G) and LY (PDB ID: 5C9C), the amide carbonyl occupying the BP-II accepts a h-bond from the backbone amide of Asp594, while in VEM (PDB ID: 4RZV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grasso et al., 2016</xref>) the sulfonamide occupying the BP-II donates a h-bond to the backbone amide of Asp594 (orange in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). One unique property of PHI1 is the ability to donate a h-bond to the backbone carbonyl of HRD-His574 through an amino nitrogen next to the morpholine headgroup. This region is classified as BP-IV by KLIFS, although the sidechain of His574 is a part of BP-II (in PDB 6P7G) and makes a h-bond with the backbone of the DFG-1 Gly593.

Among the three inhibitors tested, PHI1 is the only compound to be more potent against SKMEL239-C4 versus SKMEL239 (IC50 of 256 nM vs. 1.5 μM). By contrast, LY has similar potency (27 nM vs. 15 nM) while VEM is more potent against SKMEL239 (3 μM vs 35 nM). This data confirms that PHI1 is dimer-selective, LY equipotent, and VEM monomer-selective.</p><p>In light of the above finding and given the central location of Glu501 on the αC helix, we hypothesized that the ability to form a h-bond with Glu501 is required by dimer-compatible inhibitors, as the h-bonding would restrict the αC helix to the αC-in conformation as observed in the co-crystal structures of all dimer-compatible inhibitors. This restriction was also suggested as a key for dimer selectivity in the recent study by Poulikakos and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamopoulos et al., 2021</xref>). However, the crystal structures do not provide an explanation for why the ability to induce the αC-in conformation enables the inhibitor to favor dimeric BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> over monomeric BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>. Thus, to test the hypothesis regarding the role of h-bond with the Glu501 and to dissect the mechanism of dimer selectivity, we conducted a series of MD simulations of the monomeric and dimeric BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in the absence and presence of two dimer-compatible inhibitors (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Overview of the MD simulations of the monomeric and dimeric BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></title><p>The dimer interface of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> contains two histidines, His477 and His510.

Enhanced sampling (particularly of αC helix) would likely lead to dimer dissociation. Second, biased sampling methods such as metadynamics may lead to unrealistic conformational states due to the slow relaxation of some parts of the protein to accommodate the conformational change directed by the reaction coordinate.

We also examined the salt-bridge formation between the αC-Glu501 and catalytic Lys483; a minimum sidechain distance below 4.5 Å is an alternative way to define the αC-in states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tsai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sultan et al., 2018</xref>). These two definitions are consistent and offers complementary information (see later discussion). The holo PHI1-bound structure (PDB: 6P7G) has both protomers resolved with the αC positions of 19.1 and 19.0 Å, suggesting that the αC helix is in but close to the boundary (19.6 Å) with αC-out according to the KLIFS definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kanev et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Unlike in the co-crystal structures of dimer-compatible inhibitors, the simulations of the apo monomer and dimer revealed that the αC helix mostly samples the αC-out state.

It is also noteworthy that when the PHI1–Glu501 interaction switches from h-bonding to van der Waals interaction, the αC position is slightly shifted outward to ∼19 Å, which is similar to the position adopted in the LY-bound dimer simulations. This suggests that the stronger h-bond between PHI1 Glu501 may contribute to the inward αC position as compared to the LY-bound dimer.</p><p>To further dissect the mechanism of dimer selectivity, we examined the h-bond interaction between PHI1 or LY and Glu501 in inhibited monomer BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> simulations. Strikingly, the PHI1–Glu501 interaction can become completely disrupted, with the distance moving beyond 6 Å to as high as 12 Å; correlated with the disruption of the PHI1–Glu501 interaction, the αC position is shifted out to the range of 21 Å–24 Å, similar to that sampled by the apo dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>).

Since dimerization already restricts the motion of the αC helix and shifts it inward in the apo dimer, inhibitors capable of interacting with Glu501 can bind to the dimer via a conformational selection mechanism in addition to induced fit. On the other hand, conformational selection cannot be exploited for these inhibitors to bind the monomer, as the αC position in the apo monomer is outward. Compared to the equipotent inhibitors, the dimer-selective inhibitors such as PHI1 form much stronger h-bond with Glu501, which shifts the αC helix further inward.

To rule out the possibility that the different degree of dimer (de)stabilization may also be a contributing factor for dimer selectivity, we turned to the difference contact network analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). In this analysis, the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> dimer was first partitioned into four different communities based on the the residue-residue contacts, which resulted in each community largely corresponding to the N-lobe (blue or grey) and C-lobe (red or orange) of either protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> left). Then, a community-community difference contact network between the apo and holo dimer simulation sets was calculated and mapped onto a graph, where the vertices represent the communities and blue and red edges represent the increased and decreased contact probabilities due to inhibitor binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> right). Since we are interested in testing the dimer stability in the presence of PHI1 or LY, the interprotomer contact probabilities(between N-lobe:A and N-lobe:B or C-lobe:B; between C-lobe:A and C-lobe:B or N-lobe:A) were calculated and summed up. Interestingly, for both PHI1 and LY, the total interprotomer contact probability is increased (by 0.3) in the holo relative to the apo simulations. This net increase is mainly due to the N-lobe:A to C-lobe:B interactions which compensates for the decrease in the C-lobe:A to C-lobe:B contacts. This analysis demonstrates that both the dimer-selective and equipotent inhibitors have the same slightly stabilizing effect on the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> dimer interface; this rules out the possibility that the dimer selectivity is due to the different degree of dimer stabilization between the dimer-selective and equipotent inhibitors.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Both PHI1 and LY stabilize the interprotomer contacts of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>.</title><p>Left.

The simulations uncovered the atomic details of the remarkable allostery in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> dimerization and ligand binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), which offer explanation for why some BRAF inhibitors are monomer selective while others are dimer compatible, that is selective or equipotent. Specifically, our data showed that dimerization of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> leads to the restriction and an inward shift of the αC helix position relative to the monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> top panel), which explains why inhibitors that can stabilize the αC-in states are dimer compatible whereas those that cannot are monomer selective. The fact that both dimerization and inhibitor binding induces αC to move inward contributes to the phenomenon of drug-induced RAF dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lavoie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Karoulia et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A working model that explains dimer selectivity and binding cooperativity of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitors.</title><p>Top left. In the monomeric BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, the αC-helix (orange) is very flexible and exclusively samples the out states. Top right. Upon dimerization, the αC-helix is restrained and shifts inward, while the DFG-motif maintains its conformation but gains significant flexibility. Bottom right. When the first PHI1 molecule binds, its amide linker donates a h-bond to the carboxylate of Glu501 (orange stick) in the first protomer, which locks the αC helix to the αC-in state; it also shifts and restricts the DFG-motif into the DFG-out state through the interaction with the DFG-Asp backbone. The αC-helix in the second unbound protomer is also affected, shifting in the direction of the inhibitor-bound state towards αC-in. Thus, the allosteric pre-organization primes the second protomer for accepting a second PHI1 molecule. Bottom left. When the second PHI1 molecule binds, the αC helix and DFG-motif in both protomers are shifted and fully locked into the αC-in and DFG-out states.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95334-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The co-crystal structure analysis and MD simulations identified a h-bond donor (e.g. an amide linker in the dimer-selective PHI1 or the equipotent LY) as a key for dimer compatibility; the h-bond with the carboxylate of Glu501 stabilizes the αC helix in the αC-in states. Two factors make Glu501 a special and critical anchoring point for inducing the αC-in states. First, it is located at the center of the αC helix, which makes it easier (as opposed to the end of the helix) to induce a helix movement. Second, the h-bonding between the inhibitor and Glu501 is synergistic with the Lys483–Glu501 salt-bridge formation. In contrary, the lack of a h-bond with Glu501, for example in VEM, Debrafenib, or PLX7904, results in the monomer selectivity.</p><p>Note, the DFG-in inhibitors can also donate a h-bond to αC-Glu501 and bind the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> dimer. An example is SB5909885, which donates a h-bond from the oxime group to αC-Glu501 and also forms a salt bridge with Lys483 (PDB ID: 2FB8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">King et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The difference between the dimer-selective and equipotent inhibitors is more subtle. The MD simulations revealed that PHI1 forms a more stable h-bond with Glu501 in the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> dimer as compared to LY, which is consistent with the ∼1 Å inward shift of the αC helix and more stable Lys483–Glu501 salt bridge. The latter differences are much smaller in the co-crystal structures; the αC positions and Lys483–Glu501 distances are only respectively 0.1 and 0.2 Å smaller in the PHI1- vs. LY-bound co-crystal structure. Since the monomeric BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> has a flexible αC helix that predominantly samples the αC-out states, forming a tighter h-bond would incur a higher entropic penalty for monomer binding. This may explain why the PHI1–Glu501 interaction as well as the αC position are unstable in the monomer simulations but stable in the dimer simulations, in contrast to the LY-bound simulations. Therefore, the stability of the h-bonding with Glu501 may be a key for dimer selectivity.</p><p>Without the MD simulations, how would one determine if the h-bond between the inhibitor and Glu501 is stable? We found that the deviation between the αC position and/or K–E distance of the two protomers in the co-crystal structure offers some indication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). With the exception of LY and Ponatinib, the αC position and/or K–E distance between the two protomers in the co-crystal structures of AZ628, TAK632, BGB283, SB5909885 deviate by 0.3 Å or higher (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). In contrast, the αC position and the K–E distance are (nearly) identical between the two protomers in the co-crystal structures of the dimer-selective inhibitors LXH254, RAF709, Sorafenib, and Belvarafenib (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). The identical αC position and K-E distance in the two protomers suggest that the αC helix is restrained by the inhibitor, that is it forms a stable h-bond with Glu501.</p><p>To additionally test this crystal structure-based hypothesis, we examined the co-crystal structures of GDC0879 and Tovorafenib, which were not analyzed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamopoulos et al., 2021</xref>. In the co-crystal structure of GDC0879 (PDB ID: 4MNF), the αC position deviates by 0.3 Å and the K–E distance deviates by 0.1 Å between the two protomers. In the co-crystal structure of Tovorafenib (PDB ID: 6V34), the the αC position deviates by 0.2 Å and the K–E distance deviates by 0.4 Å between the two protomers. These deviations suggest that the αC is not adequately restrained by the inhibitors and therefore we predicted GDC0879 and Tovorafenib to be equipotent. Note, GDC0879 is a DFG-in inhibitor, which is an additional indication for a equipotent inhibitor. Indeed, both GDC0879 and Tovorafenib were found as equipotent in experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Karoulia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tkacik et al., 2023</xref>). These analyses led us to propose the following empirical assessment of a RAF inhibitor based on its co-crystal structure with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>: (1) lack of a h-bond with Glu501 indicates monomer selectivity; (2) presence of a h-bond with Glu501 but inconsistent αC position and/or K–E distance between the two protomers indicates equipotency; (3) presence of a h-bond with Glu501 and identical αC position and K–E distance between the two protomers indicates that the inhibitor is likely (but not necessarily) dimer selective. Given that the resolution of a resolved structure is often ∼2–3 Å, this proposed assessment is not intended to replace more rigorous tests, that is utilizing MD simulations.</p><p>Finally, the MD analysis uncovered a mechanism for positive cooperativity. Our findings are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; upon dimerization (top row) the αC-helix goes from αC-out and highly flexible to slightly restrained and inward shifted. The first PHI1 binding in the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> dimer restricts the motion of the αC helix and DFG, shifting them slightly inward and outward, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, bottom right panel). Intriguingly, the first PHI1 binding primes the apo protomer by making the αC more favorable for binding, that is shifting the αC inward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, bottom right panel). Importantly, upon binding the second PHI1, the αC helix is shifted further inward and the DFG is shifted further outward in both protomers. These data suggest that the positive cooperativity of PHI1 is due to its ability to allosterically modulate the αC and the DFG conformation in the second protomer. Taken together, our findings provide a mechanistic understanding for the remarkable allostery and conformational interplay between kinase dimerization and inhibitor binding. As we prepare the manuscript for submission, a biophysical experiment was published, which suggested that the first inhibitor binding dominates the allosteric coupling between type II inhibitor binding and BRAF dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rasmussen et al., 2023</xref>), consistent with our simulation data.</p><p>The work presented here has implications for understanding the molecular mechanism of kinase signaling and contributes to the rational design of protomer-selective inhibitors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Intracellular homogeneous TR-FRET assay</title><p>SKMEL239 and SKMEL239-C4 cells were plated at 50,000 cells/well in white TC-treated 96-well plates in 100 µl complete growth media (DMEM).

The monomer and dimer selectivities of inhibitors in black are based on the experimental data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamopoulos et al., 2021</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cotto-Rios et al., 2020</xref> (PHI1). The monomer and dimer selectivities of inhibitors in red were predicted by us and supported by experiments in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karoulia et al., 2017</xref> (GDC0879) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tkacik et al., 2023</xref> (Tovorafenib). Note, the PDB entries indicated by an astrisk are co-crystal structures in complex with the wild type BRAF (the BRAFV600E forms are unavailable). All structures contain an inhibitor in each protomer, with the exception of PLX7904; in the PDB entry 4XV1, PLX7904 is only present in protomer A. The C helix position (in Å) is defined in the main text. Two values refer to the two protomers. The back pockets (BPs) occupied was calculated by KLIFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kooistra et al., 2016</xref>) based on the definition of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liao, 2007</xref>. K-E refers to the distance (in Å) between the amine nitrogen of Lys483 and the nearest carboxylate oxygen of Glu501. Table B: Average value and standard deviation of reported quantities from out dimeric BRAF simulations, separated by system and protomer. Each quantity was calculated for each replica after removing the first 2 s for equilibration.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-95334-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability</title><p>The MD simulation input files and analysis scripts are freely downloadable from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/JanaShenLab/RAF/">https://github.com/JanaShenLab/RAF/</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clayton and Shen, 2024</xref>).

It is not convincing that a slight shift can support the conclusion that the binding in one protomer is enough to shift the DFG motif outward allosterically. Moreover, the DFG dihedral time-series for the apo protomer (Supplementary Figure 9) clearly shows that the measured quantities are affected by significant fluctuations and poor consistency between the three replicates. The apo protomer of the mixed state simulations could be affected by the same problem that the authors pointed out in the case of the apo dimer simulations, where the amount of sampling is insufficient to model the DFG-out/-in transition properly.</p></disp-quote><p>While the reviewer is correct there are large fluctuations in the DFG pseudo dihedral over the course of the apo simulations, these fluctuations occur primarily in the first 2 <italic>µ</italic>s of the simulations, which were removed from our analysis. The reviewer is also correct that these simulations do not sufficiently model the DFG-out/-in transition; however, a full transition is not necessary for our analysis, as we are only interested in the shift of the DFG pseudo dihedral. As to the reviewer’s comment on the overlapping DFG distributions, we agree that the difference is very subtle. We revised the text.</p><p>On page 9, second paragraph from the bottom:</p><p>“While PHI1 or LY binding clearly perturbs the <italic>α</italic>C helix of the opposite apo protomer, the effect on the DFG conformation is less clear when comparing the DFG dihedral distribution of the the apo protomer in the PHI1 or LY-mixed dimer with that of the apo dimer (blue, orange, and grey, Figure 5a right). All three distributions are broad, covering a range of 160-330°. It appears that, relative to the apo dimer, the DFG of the apo protomer in the PHI1-mixed dimer is slightly shifted to the right, whereas that of the LY-mixed dimer is slightly shifted to the left; however, these differences are very subtle and warrant further investigation in future studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2b: There is similar concern with the Lys483-Glu501 salt bridge measured for the apo protomers of the mixed simulations. As it can be observed from the probabilities bar plot (Fig. 5a middle), the standard deviation is too high to support a significant role for this interaction in the allosteric modulation of the apo protomer.</p></disp-quote><p>As for the salt bridge, the fluctuation in the apo dimer and LY-mixed dimer is indeed large, and together with the lower average probability suggests that the salt bridge is weaker, which is consistent with the <italic>α</italic>C helix moving outward. To clarify this, we revised the text.</p><p>On page 9, second paragraph from the bottom:</p><p>“Consistent with the inward shift of the <italic>α</italic>C helix, the Glu501–Lys483 salt bridge has a lower average probability and a larger fluctuation in the apo dimer and the apo protomer of the LY-mixed dimer, as compared to the apo protomer of the PHI1-mixed dimer.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Comment 1: The authors employ molecular dynamics simulations to understand the selectivity of FDA approved inhibitors within dimeric and monomeric BRAF species.

In the present version, only Supplementary Figures 2,3, and 4 are cited in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>This was an oversight; supplementary figures 5 through 9 are now cited in the text, to point to the time-series of the quantity discussed. We note that supplementary figures 10 and 11 show the time-series of the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of each protomer in both all monomeric and dimeric simulations; these quantities are not discussed in the manuscript but are provided for further insight.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2: It is unclear whether the present data could support a direct involvement of the DFG movement in the allosteric mechanism proposed. The same argument applies to the Lys483Glu501 interaction in the apo protomer of the mixed state simulations. The current simulation data could only support a different stabilization of the αC-helix position. The authors should either remove/tone down the claim or extend the simulations to sample a ”converged” distribution of the DFG dihedral and the Lys483-Glu501 salt bridge of the apo protomers.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the DFG change in the apo protomer of the PH1-mixed dimer is very subtle (see our response and revision to comment 2); however, the allosteric involvement of DFG is clearly demonstrated in Figure 5 (right panel in 5a and 5b). We compare three states: apo protomer in the mixed dimer, PHI1-bound protomer in the mixed dimer, and holo dimer (i.e., with two PHI1) Binding of the first PHI1 restricts the DFG conformation to the larger DFG dihedrals (blue curves in the top and bottom right panels). This effect (DFG outward and more restricted) is even strong when the second PHI1 binds, locking the DFG in both protomers to a narrow dihedral range 270–330 degree (green and blue curves in Figure 5b, right panel). These are allosteric effects, demonstrating that the second PH1 binding induces conformational change of the DFG in the first protomer. This is why in Figure 6, the DFG of the PHI1-bound protomer in the mixed dimer is labeled as “almost out”, while the DFG in the holo dimer is labeled as “fully out”.</p><p>The effect of second PHI1 on the DFG of the first protomer is consistent with that the <italic>α</italic>C helix position, in which case, the second PH1 induces an inward movement of the <italic>α</italic>C of the first protomer (illustrated as “fully in” in the schematic Figure 6). Through the aC movement, the salt-bridge strength is affected, as we discussed in our response and revision to Reviewer’s comment 2a. To clarify these points, we revised the discussion of Figure 5. We made the x axis range of the DFG dihedral distributions the same between the top and bottom panels in Figure 5. To remove the claim of priming effect on DFG, we revised Figure 6.</p><p>Page 10, Figure 5:</p><p>we made the x axis range of the DFG dihedral distributions on the top and bottom panels the same to facilitate comparison.</p><p>Page 11, second and third paragraphs:</p><p>“Consistent with the change in the DFG conformation between the holo (two inhibitor) and apo dimers (Figure 3c,3f), DFG is rigidified upon binding of the first inhibitor, as evident from the narrower DFG dihedral distribution of the PHI1 or LY-bound protomer in the mixed protomer (Figure 5b right) compared to the apo protomer in the mixed dimer (Figure 5a right). Importantly, the DFG dihedral is right shifted in the occupied vs. apo protomer, demonstrating that the inhibitor pushes the DFG outward.”</p><p>“Consistent with the effect of the second PHI1 on the <italic>α</italic>C position of the first PHI1-bound protomer, binding of the second PHI1 shifts the peak of the DFG distribution for both protomers further outward, as shown by the 30° larger DFG pseudo dihedral in the holo dimer relative to the mixed dimer (green and blue in Figure 5b right; Supplementary Figures 6,9). In contrast, there is no significant difference in the DFG pseudo dihedral between the LY-mixed and holo dimers. These data suggest that while the binding of the first PHI1 pushes the DFG outward, binding of the second PHI1 has an allosteric effect, shifting the DFG of the opposite protomer further outward.”</p><p>On page 12, the last paragraph of Conclusion, we remove the claim of the priming effect for DFG:</p><p>“The first PHI1 binding in the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> dimer restricts the motion of the <italic>α</italic>C helix and DFG, shifting them slightly inward and outward, respectively (Figure 6, bottom right panel). Intriguingly, the first PHI1 binding primes the apo protomer by making the <italic>α</italic>C more favorable for binding, i.e., shifting the <italic>α</italic>C inward (Figure 6, bottom right panel). Importantly, upon binding the second PHI1, the <italic>α</italic>C helix is shifted further inward and the DFG is shifted further outward in both protomers.”</p><p>On page 13, Figure 6:</p><p>we removed the label “slightly outward” for DFG.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3: An alternative approach could be using enhanced sampling methods to enhance the diffusion along these coordinates.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this point. While that the allostery and cooperativity effects are apparent from our simulation data, we agree that enhanced sampling methods in principle could be used to further converge the conformational sampling; however, these approaches face significant challenges. First, BRAF dimer is weakly associated, with <italic>α</italic>C helix forming a part of the dimer interface. Enhanced sampling of <italic>α</italic>C helix would likely result in dimer dissociation. On the other hand, simply using RMSD as a reaction coordinate or progress variable would not necessarily enhance the motion of <italic>α</italic>C helix or DFG or activation loop, which are all coupled. Second, our extensive simulations of a monomer kinase with metadynamics demonstrated that the kinase conformation becomes distorted when a biasing potential is placed to enhance the motion of DFG. This is likely because the other parts of the protein do not have enough time to relax to accommodate the conformational change. To our knowledge, this aspect has not been discussed in the current metadynamics literature, which focuses on the free energy differences and (local) conformational changes along the reaction coordinate. To clarify these points, we added a discussion.</p><p>Page 6, end of the first paragraph:</p><p>“We note that enhanced sampling methods were not used due to several challenges. First, the BRAF dimer is weakly associated, with <italic>α</italic>C helix forming a part of the dimer interface (Figure 1a). Enhanced sampling (particularly of <italic>α</italic>C helix) would likely lead to dimer dissociation. Second, biased sampling methods such as metadynamics may lead to unrealistic conformational states due to the slow relaxation of some parts of the protein to accommodate the conformational change directed by the reaction coordinate. For example, our unpublished metadynamics simulations of a monomer kinase showed that enhancing the DFG conformational change resulted in distortion of the kinase structure.”</p><p>We thank the reviewers again for their valuable comments. We believe our revision has further elevated the quality of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
