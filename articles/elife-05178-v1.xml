pathways. In this study, we visualise epidermal ERK activity in living mice using an ERK FRET biosensor. Under steady-state conditions, the epidermis occasionally revealed bursts of ERK activation patterns where ERK activity radially propagated from cell to cell. The frequency of this spatial propagation of radial ERK activity distribution (SPREAD) correlated with the rate of epidermal cell division. SPREADs and proliferation were stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in a manner dependent on EGF receptors and their cognate ligands. At the wounded skin, ERK activation propagated as trigger wave in parallel to the wound edge, suggesting that ERK activation propagation can be superimposed. Furthermore, by visualising the cell cycle, we found that SPREADs were associated with G2/M cell cycle progression. Our results provide new insights into how cell proliferation and transient ERK activity are synchronised in a living tissue.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05178.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05178.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05178.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our skin is our largest organ; it provides a barrier that protects the underlying tissues and internal organs from the external environment and acts as one of our first lines of defense against infection. Both of these roles subject the skin to wear and tear and so it must constantly create new skin cells to replace those lost or damaged. However, if this renewal process goes awry it can lead to excessive cell growth or skin cancer. To avoid this, cells tightly regulate the pathways that stimulate skin renewal.</p><p>Skin renewal involves growth signals activating an enzyme called ERK. When and where the ERK enzyme is activated is normally tightly regulated, and many kinds of cancer have been linked to ERK becoming active at the wrong time or in the wrong place. Despite the importance of ERK in skin cells, a number of technical challenges have made it difficult to study how these signals are passed from cell to cell.</p><p>Hiratsuka et al. have now examined genetically altered mice that produce a fluorescent sensor molecule that makes it possible to see ERK activity in living skin cells. The skin of anesthetized mice was observed under a microscope, and time-lapse videos revealed occasional ‘firework-like’ bursts of ERK activity. At first the ERK enzyme was active in a small cluster of skin cells, then ERK activity was seen in the surrounding cells—appearing to spread outwards over the course of several minutes—before the activity stopped. Hiratsuka et al. named this pattern of activity a ‘Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity Distribution’, or SPREAD for short.</p><p>By studying SPREADs in the skin on the ears and the back of these mice, Hiratsuka et al. learned that these bursts of ERK activity coincided with skin cell growth; the bursts happened more frequently in the areas where the skin cells were dividing. Applying a chemical that stimulates cell division to the skin of the mice triggered more bursts of ERK activity; whereas fewer bursts were observed if Hiratsuka et al. used other chemicals to block the activity of some of the signaling proteins that work upstream of ERK.</p><p>Further experiments suggested that SPREADs encourage cells to progress through the cycle of events that leads a cell to divide; blocking these bursts caused the cell to pause at the stage just before it would normally divide. Hiratsuka et al. also observed similar patterns of ERK activity moving out like waves from the edges of skin wounds. Further research using similar methods will reveal how growth signals are triggered and propagated in healthy and diseased tissues, not only in the skin but also other organs such as the liver, intestine, and muscles.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05178.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05178.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>in vivo imaging</kwd><kwd>ERK</kwd><kwd>epidermis</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuda</surname><given-names>Michiyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 22113002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuda</surname><given-names>Michiyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hiratsuka</surname><given-names>Toru</given-names></name><name><surname>Fujita</surname><given-names>Yoshihisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vivo imaging of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity reveals radial ERK activation patterns that are associated with cell cycle progression in the mouse epidermis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Exquisite control of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK signalling is required for homeostasis in the epidermis and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pouysségur et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kholodenko, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Khavari and Rinn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Roberts and Der, 2007</xref>). ERK activation is triggered by the activation of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) through binding to their cognate ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yuspa, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sibilia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schneider et al., 2008</xref>). Precursors of EGFR ligands including EGF, transforming growth factor α (TGFα), and heparin binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), are generated as membrane-bound proteins and are released through cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) including ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Massagué and Pandiella, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sahin et al., 2004</xref>). The critical role of MMP-mediated release of EGFR ligands is corroborated by the close resemblance of the phenotypes among knockout mice of TGFα, ADAM17, and EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Luetteke et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Peschon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Franzke et al., 2012</xref>). However, little is known about how such cell-to-cell communication leading to activation of the Ras/ERK pathway is dynamically regulated in vivo.</p><p>To address this issue, we live imaged transgenic (Eisuke) mice expressing a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor for ERK in order to visualise ERK activity in living epidermis under two photon excitation microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kamioka et al., 2012</xref>). During long-time time lapse imaging of the steady-state mouse skin, we noticed the epidermis occasionally appear with bursts of ERK activation patterns, where ERK activation is propagated from cell to cell in a radial wave. We named this new phenomenon as Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity Distribution (SPREAD) and investigated characteristics, mechanisms, and roles of SPREAD. Single-cell analysis of SPREAD demonstrated that ERK activation in SPREAD originated from a cluster of a few cells and propagated up to about 50 μm with an average velocity of 1.5 μm/min. The amplitude of ERK activation and efficiency in propagation gradually decreased until SPREAD disappeared. Interestingly, the frequency of SPREAD was spatio-temporally associated with that of cell division. SPREADs were significantly stimulated by topical treatment of mitotic stimulation, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). The induction was dependent on EGF receptors and the production of their cognate ligands by MMPs. The role of SPREAD in cell cycle progression was studied with Fucci mice, in which G0/G1 cells and S/G2/M cells are visualised by the expression of mKO2-Cdt1 and mAG-Geminin, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008</xref>). Inhibition of SPREAD in Fucci mice led to significant delay of entry to G0/G1 phase from S/G2/M phase under TPA treatment, suggesting the role of SPREAD in G2/M progression of cell cycle.</p><p>We also imaged ERK activity of ear skin subjected to epithelial wounding. Interestingly, wounded skin revealed another type of ERK activation propagation pattern, where waves of ERK activation propagated in parallel with the wound edge. Single cell analysis revealed similarity and difference between the wound-induced waves and SPREAD. While the velocity of ERK activity propagation in wound-induced waves was similar to that of SPREAD, the ERK activation waves from the wound edge was relatively maintained during propagation during propagation.</p><p>In this study, we propose how dynamically growth signal is regulated in steady-state and wounded skin in a living tissue by showing two types of novel ERK activation patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vivo imaging of ERK activity at single cell resolution</title><p>We recently reported Eisuke mice, which can visualise ERK activity at a single cell resolution by the expression of a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor for ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kamioka et al., 2012</xref>). In Eisuke mice used in this study, the nuclear ERK biosensor is expressed ubiquitously under the control of the CAG promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We imaged mainly ear epidermis of anaesthetised mice by two-photon excitation microscopy. The ear skin was stabilized between thermo-conductive silicon gum sheet and a cover glass to avoid movement derived from heart pulses and respirations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Images were acquired every 5 min with a viewfield of 0.213 mm<sup>2</sup> in 2–3 μm steps using a 25X/1.05 water-immersion objective lens (XLPLN 25XWMP; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). In our imaging settings for two photon microscopy, skin cells were clearly imaged from hair follicles to the outer epidermal layers (stratum corneum). The level of FRET was analysed by the FRET/CFP ratio image and shown in intensity modulated display mode; eight colours from red to blue are used to represent the FRET/CFP ratio and the 32 grades of colour intensity are used to represent the signal intensity of the CFP image. The warm and cold colours indicate high and low FRET levels, namely ERK activity, respectively. Epidermal layers and dermis were clearly discerned by cellular size and collagen fibres visualised by second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>).

Among eight SPREADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), ‘SPREAD 6’ is shown as the example of analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The centres of SPREADs were tentatively determined by visual inspections, which were optimised in later analyses. A square region was set to encompass the entire area of each SPREAD and individual cells were recognised by a segmentation programme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Then, we attempted to fit the FRET/CFP value of each cell to a flat line of the average FRET/CFP value during the analysed period. If the line fitting was successful, the cell of interest was classified as a non-responder, otherwise the cell was fit to one to three sine curve(s) and was classified as a responder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Based on the fitted data, the peak time and the amplitude of ERK activation were determined for each cell. The mean duration of the activation wave was 47 ± 15 min (n = 582). By plotting the peak time against the distance from the centre of the SPREAD, the velocity of ERK propagation was determined as 1.93 μm/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The mean velocity of the eight SPREADs was 1.5 ± 0.3 μm/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We also applied the square root fitting, which yielded similar coefficient determination values; therefore, we could not conclude whether the wave slows down during propagation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The amplitude of ERK activation of each responder cell decreased inversely with the distance of the cell from the origin of the SPREAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The number of responders reached the zenith around 5 min after the initiation of SPREAD and subsequently decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

There are some differences between the propagation of ERK activation in vitro and in vivo, that is, SPREADs. First, the amplitudes of ERK activation in vitro are relatively constant during propagation, whereas in SPREADs the amplitudes of ERK activation decay during propagation. Second, ERK activation was propagated initially to almost all neighbouring cells in SPREADs, whereas ERK activity was propagated stochastically in vitro to the neighbouring cells. Third, SPREAD seems to emerge from a small fraction of cells, which is not the case in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The frequency of SPREAD positively correlates with that of cell division</title><p>Interestingly, the frequency of SPREAD was not constant.

Furthermore, we counted cell divisions by visual inspection of time lapse images and found that cell divisions were also more abundantly observed in the periods with frequent SPREADs than those with less frequent SPREADs. For example, while mice #102, #107, #112, #115, and #117 showed frequent SPREADs and cell divisions, mice #113, #114, and #120 showed much less SPREADs and cell divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The cause of the heterogeneity of SPREADs and cell division among the mice is not clear.

The size of SA was inferred from the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>. Cell division in SAs was twice as frequent as that in Non-SAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). It is noteworthy that about 50% of SPREADs emerged from within 50 μm of hair follicles, which occupied 26% of ear skin on average, indicating that SPREADs were initiated preferentially in, but not necessarily restricted to the para-hair follicle regions. To examine statistically whether there are hot spots for SPREAD generation, we tested the null hypothesis that the origins of SPREADs are distributed randomly. In this test, we adopted, as a test statistic, average distance of from the centre of each SPREAD to the nearest neighbour. Then, we generated the histogram on the null hypothesis by 100,000 trials of Monte Carlo simulations. We found that actual value of the test statistic was significantly lower than the expectation based on the histogram (p &lt; 0.01 in one-sided test), indicating that the SPREADs were significantly clustered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, SPREADs often emerged repeatedly from the same spot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results suggest that SPREAD may have a relationship to follicular and interfollicular stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jones et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arwert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanpain and Fuchs, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SPREADs induced by TPA treatment</title><p>The association of SPREADs with cell divisions prompted us to examine the effect of a mitotic stimulant, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Upon topical TPA treatment, ERK activity was gradually stimulated, reaching a plateau approximately 6 hr later. ERK activity remained high for more than 24 hr and gradually decreased to the basal state by 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Unexpectedly, we failed to observe an increase in the frequencies of SPREAD and cell division following a single TPA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–H</xref>, TPA1). However, when we applied a second dose of TPA, according to the established protocol for tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2009</xref>), the frequencies of SPREAD and cell division were significantly increased 10–18 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). This observation suggests that the increase in SPREAD frequency requires the induction and/or synchronization of cells in the replicating cycle upon the second TPA treatment. It has been shown that a single EGF pulse induces cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase by p53-mediated mechanisms and two EGF pulses promote cell cycle progression in mammary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zwang et al., 2011</xref>). Although the interval between the two EGF stimulations is only 7 hr in this in vitro study, similar mechanism may operate in the mouse epidermal cells, where the cell cycle period is markedly longer than in tissue mammary epithelial cells.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05178.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Induction of SPREADs by the double TPA treatments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Eisuke mice were subjected to topical application of 20 μl acetone with or without 0.5 nanomole TPA and imaged according to the protocols.

To examine the spatial and temporal variation in the proportion of cycling cells, images of 120 viewfields were acquired at various locations and times from 12 mice with ages ranging between 8 to 20 weeks. In each viewfield, 723 cells on average were classified into G0/G1 or S/G2/M phase based on the fluorescence intensities of mKO2-Cdt1 and mAG-Geminin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). While the average proportion of S/G2/M cells was 12.2%, 2.5% of the viewfields showed more than 50% of S/G2/M cells, which might correspond to the periods of frequent SPREADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, double-asterisk, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right panel). We then performed the double TPA treatment experiments with Fucci mice. In a preliminary experiment, we found that the fraction of S/G2/M cells after the second TPA application was increased from 61% to 95% by reducing the interval from 48 hr to 24 hr. Because high synchronization of cell cycle is helpful to examine the effect of inhibitors clearly, we applied this modified protocol to the following experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Single TPA treatment alone drove a maximum of ca. 40% cells into the S/G2/M phase at 30 hr after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, black line), followed by gradual decrease of the proportion of the S/G2/M phase. In contrast, the second TPA treatment increased the proportion of S/G2/M cells up to 95% within 12 hr (36 hr after the first TPA), which decreased to about 20% at 58 hr after the first TPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, red line). PD0325901, a MEK inhibitor, cancelled the effect of the second TPA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, green line). In contrast to the MEK inhibitor, TAPI-1 did not suppress the increase in the S/G2/M cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, blue line). Surprisingly and importantly, however, the percentage of S/G2/M cells remained very high until 58 hr, indicating that TAPI-1 inhibited exit from the S/G2/M phase and entry to the G0/G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>). Together with the reduced frequency of cell division in the TAPI-1-treated Eisuke mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), this observation suggests that SPREADs play an important role in G2/M progression.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05178.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Delayed exit from S/G2/M phase by MMP inhibitor treatment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histogram of the percentage of S/G2/M cells in 120 viewfields (0.213 mm<sup>2</sup> each) of steady-state Fucci mice.

The induction of SPREADs during wound healing again raises the possibility that stem cell activation is involved in their emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jones et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arwert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanpain and Fuchs, 2014</xref>). As with TPA-induced SPREADs, both SPREADs and cell divisions during wound healing were significantly reduced by TAPI-1 or PD153035 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>). Interestingly, in regions within about ca. 100 μm from the wounded edge, we found another type of ERK activation propagation pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Here, repetitive waves of ERK activation parallel to the wound edge emerged and propagated to cells ca. 100 μm from the wound edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The ERK activation waves from the wound edge were suppressed by TAPI-1 treatment, suggesting the involvement of the similar mechanisms as that of SPREAD (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). Single-cell analysis of the ERK activation waves from the wound was performed with segmentation and sine curve fittings as performed for SPREADs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>). The velocity of ERK activity propagation was determined as 1.4 μm/min, which is similar to that in SPREAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). In contrast to ERK propagation in SPREAD, ERK activation waves from the wound edge maintained high ERK activity and propagation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–F</xref>), suggesting that ERK activation propagation can be synchronized and superimposed to generate trigger waves if a number of ERK activation pulses are evoked in close temporal and spatial proximity. These similarities and differences between SPREADs and ERK activation waves from the wound edge suggest the possible modification of the amplitude and efficiency in propagation depending on the surrounding environment of the cells.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05178.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Two types of ERK activity propagation patterns during epithelial wound healing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CFP images of the wounded ear skin of an Eisuke mouse.

In steady-state skin, epidermal cells undergo continuous turnover through autonomous activation of growth signal pathway triggered by the interaction of EGFRs and their cognate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kholodenko, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Khavari and Rinn, 2007</xref>). ERK plays a central role as a downstream target of a variety of growth signal pathways and its tight regulation in time, place, and degree of activation determine cell behaviours such as cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pouysségur et al., 2002</xref>). Aberrant activation of ERK has been reported in many types of cancers especially by the oncogenic mutation of Ras and Raf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Roberts and Der, 2007</xref>). Despite the significance of ERK activity regulation, technical limitations have obscured how growth signal activation is generated and propagated throughout the tissue.</p><p>In this study, we exploited transgenic mice expressing a FRET biosensor of ERK and monitored ERK activity in epidermal cells at single cell resolution. Our long time lapse imaging of intact epidermis revealed radial propagation of ERK activity, where ERK activation originates from a few cells and propagate radially up to a radius of about 50 μm over 30 min until disappearance. We named this novel phenomenon as SPREAD and investigated its mechanism of ERK propagation and its role in cell cycle progression.</p><p>Although we previously reported stochastic propagation of ERK activity pulse in a single cell to its neighbouring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>), the propagation was restricted within an array of a few cells rather than firework-like round propagation covering more than 100 cells. Our single cell analysis of SPREAD and inhibitor treatment revealed similarities and differences between the two patterns of ERK activation in vitro and in vivo. While they share in common the dependence of EGFRs and the production of their cognate ligands for ERK activation propagation, they differ in the efficiency and amplitude of ERK activation during propagation. Together with the difference in ERK propagation manner between SPREADs in steady-state skin and ERK activation waves, this suggests that ERK propagation pattern might be altered depending on the surrounding environment of the cells, including the involvement of stem cells, cellular density, and pathological conditions. The induction of SPREADs by double TPA treatment raises the possibility that the alterations in SPREADs could be involved in tumorigenesis. Thus, it will be of special interest to observe SPREADs in various pathological conditions including cancer.</p><p>The dependency on EGFRs and MMPs strongly suggests that a common molecular mechanism operates between SPREADs and ERK activation propagation in tissue culture cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>). Unlike the ERK activation propagation in tissue culture cells, however, we could not conclude whether the inhibitors against EGFRs and MMPs suppress ERK activation in the initiator cell or abrogate intercellular propagation of the ERK activation. This is because we cannot clearly identify the ERK activation pulse at single cell resolution due partly to the long interval of image acquisition in vivo and low signal-to-noise ratio of in vivo FRET imaging.</p><p>As well as the established role of ERK activation in G1/S progression of cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Torii et al., 2006</xref>), the necessity of ERK to G2/M progression has also been reported in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tamemoto et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wright et al., 1999</xref>). On the other hand, excessive ERK activation in G2 phase arrests cells in G2-phase. High ERK activity due to BRCA1 mutation, lack of Vaccinia H1-related (VHR) dual-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase, or stimulation by TPA induces G2-phase arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dangi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rahmouni et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chambard et al., 2007</xref>). Intriguingly, ERK activity is high around the G2/M phase in synchronized cells, but low when cells are arrested in M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Torii et al., 2006</xref>). These previous reports together with our findings show that exquisite regulation of ERK activation in terms of time, place, and degree is required for cell cycle progression and the localised transient activation of ERK in SPREAD can contribute to it. To validate the causal relationship between SPREADs and cell cycle progression, we need to develop methods to control cell cycle and/or ERK activity with the single cell resolution in the tissues.</p><p>We used the C57BL/6 strain and the FVB/N strain for the expression of the Fucci biosensor and the FRET biosensor, respectively. This is because bright fluorescence of melanin granules in C57BL/6 mice hampered quantification of FRET signal and because Fucci mice with FVB/N background were not available. However, we speculate that the difference of the mouse strain will not affect our interpretation significantly by the following reasons. First, we observed significant increase of cell division in TPA-treated C57BL/6 mice, indicating that TPA promotes cell cycle in C57BL/6 as in FVB/N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Second, we observed SPREADs in C57BL/6 mice as in FVB/N, although quantitative data analysis was hampered by the fluorescence from the melanin granule.</p><p>In summary, here we revealed localized propagations of ERK activation regulate cell cycle progression in mouse epidermis. The propagation of ERK activity was achieved by cellular interaction via EGFRs and the production of their cognate ligands. Our finding of SPREAD achieved by in vivo imaging of dynamic changes in kinase activity pave a new way to understanding intrinsic relationship between cell cycle and the underlying growth signal in vivo regulated by an intercellular communications via EGFR ligands.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals</title><p>TAPI-1 and PD0325901 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).

FRET mice were backcrossed for more than 10 generations to FVB/N before imaging. Fucci mice were bred in C57BL/6 background. Mice were housed in a specific-pathogen-free facility and received a routine chow diet and water ad libitum. To date, no disease or anomaly has been associated with the transgenic mice used in this study. 8- to 20-week-old mice were used for the in vivo imaging. The animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine (No. 10584).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Two-photon excitation microscopy was performed with FV1200MPE-BX61WI upright microscopes, equipped with a 25X/1.05 water-immersion objective lens (XLPLN 25XWMP; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and an InSight DeepSee Ultrafast laser (0.95 W at 900 nm) (Spectra-Physics, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The laser power used for observation was 2–4% for mice expressing EKAREV-NES/NLS, 10–15% for Fucci mice. Scan speed was 8 μs/pixel. Images were recorded every 5 min for long-time imaging or every 1.5 min or 2.5 min for short-time imaging of Eisuke mice expressing EKAREV-NLS, and every 1 hr for imaging of Fucci mice and Eisuke mice expressing EKAREV-NES. The excitation wavelength was 840 nm for mice expressing a FRET biosensor and 910 nm for Fucci mice. For FRET mouse imaging, we used an IR-cut filter, RDM690 (Olympus), two dichroic mirrors, DM505 (Olympus) and DM570 (Olympus), and three emission filters, FF01-425/30 (Semrock, Rochester, NY) for second harmonic generation imaging, BA460-500 (Olympus) for CFP, and BA520-560 (Olympus) for FRET.

Mouse ear was sandwiched between a cover glass and a thermal conductive silicon gum sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mouse backskin was observed by a similar method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Hairs were removed by depilation cream 24 hr before experiments. Mice were topically treated with 0.5 nanomole TPA, 2.0 nanomole TAPI-1, 0.2 nanomole PD153035, 207 nanomole PD0325901 in 20 μl acetone. Time-lapse images were acquired every 1.5 or 5 min for at least 9 hr, up to 29 hr, starting from 1 hr after the last treatment. For the wound healing experiments, an epithelial wound was created by a mini router No. 28600 (Kisopowertool MFG CO., LTD, Osaka, Japan) 12 hr before imaging. Time-lapse imaging was aborted when the body temperature and breathing conditions of mice deteriorated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image processing</title><p>Acquired images were analysed with MetaMorph (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aoki and Matsuda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kamioka et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, the level of FRET was shown by the FRET/CFP ratio image in intensity modulated display mode; eight colours from red to blue are used to represent the FRET/CFP ratio and the 32 grades of colour intensity are used to represent the signal intensity of the CFP image. The warm and cold colours indicate high and low FRET levels, respectively. For better presentation of SPREADs, a 3 × 3 median filter was applied to the FRET/CFP ratio images, and the resulting images were represented by a gold pseudo-colour. Both SPREADs and cell divisions were scored by visual inspections of time-lapse images. Projection images were generated by averaging five serial FRET/CFP images for the analysis of wound images, in which epidermal basal cells appeared in different z planes due to invagination.</p><p>Cell cycle analysis was performed with Fucci mice. Melanin granules were excluded from the images based on the size and strong autofluorescence. For the identification of the nuclei of S/G2/M cells, images of mKO2-hCdt1 (30/120) were subtracted from images of mAG-hGeminin (1/110). The resulting images were processed with the segmentation function of the multi-dimensional motion analysis module of MetaMorph. Parameters used were: segmentation method, adaptive threshold; XY diameter, 4–10; local intensity above background, 30. The nuclei of G0/G1 cells were identified similarly.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of SPREADs</title><p>The origins of SPREADs were initially determined by visual inspection and used in the following analysis. First, on the CFP image a square region was set around the origin of the SPREAD. In the selected region, nuclei were automatically recognized with a segmentation program. With each nucleus, the FRET/CFP ratio was calculated for all time frames. Second, the FRET/CFP values of each nucleus were smoothened by 15-min moving averages. The smoothed values in each cell were fit with a flat line first. If the coefficient for the difference between the experimental data and the approximated data is less than 0.003, the cell was defined as a non-responder. Otherwise, values were fit with increasing number of sine curves until the coefficient became less than 0.003. The fitting was ended if the number of sine curves reached three. Cells fit by sine curve(s) were defined as responder cells. For the responder cells, the approximated sine curves were used to obtain the following parameters; peak time, the time when the FRET/CFP ratio reaches the zenith; amplitude, the FRET/CFP ratio at the peak time; duration, the duration during which the FRET/CFP ratio was higher than 50% of the peak ERK activity. Third, for each nucleus of the responder cells, the distance from the origin of the SPREAD was plotted against the peak time. The location of SPREAD origin was optimised by changing the ordinates of the SPREAD origin between −10 and 10 pixels and finding the position that gave the highest correlation efficiency between the data and the linear regression curve. Fourth, circles with increasing radius were drawn and the fraction of responder cells therein was obtained. When the fraction of responder cells became less than 50%, the obtained value was defined as the radius of the SPREAD. The data analysis was performed with MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Monte Carlo simulation of SPREAD distribution</title><p>A statistical test was performed with the null hypothesis that SPREAD locations are randomly distributed.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor) and 4 reviewers, two of whom are members of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Fiona Watt declared a potential conflict of interest and therefore has not had input into this decision letter, except at the proofing stage.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study builds upon previous work showing that ERK activation can propagate at constant speed from cell to cell in tissue culture, that the spreading requires metaloproteinase activity, and that the amplitude of the ERK activation does not decrease as the distance traveled by the activation wave increases. Here the authors set out to test whether this cell culture work is relevant to the situation in mouse skin in vivo by making use of the Eisuke mouse, which stably expresses an ERK reporter.</p><p>They report two types of ERK activity propagation in mouse skin. The first (which they refer to by the acronym SPREAD) begins stochastically, like the waves in vitro, but decreases in amplitude and fizzles out over a distance of ∼50 µm. The second occurs in response to wounding, and is characterized by repeated, self-organizing wave fronts of ERK activation that do not decrease in amplitude. Both of these types of waves depend upon metalloprotease activity and MEK activation. It is not yet clear what makes the SPREAD waves peter out vs. the more sustained propagation of the wound-response waves.</p><p>This is a beautiful paper, using powerful quantitative methods to discover interesting phenomena. The discovery of the wound-response waves is particularly exciting because of the high likelihood they are physiologically and functionally important.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The authors should make clear that there are two different types of propagation described in this report: what they call SPREAD, which is a sporadic burst of ERK activation in normal skin and TPA-treated skin; and a more wave-like, longer distance response to wounding. For example, the title of the manuscript refers to waves, but this is only observed in the wounding paradigm. The manuscript would be improved by placing the analysis within overall context of diffusive spatial propagation vs. trigger wave spatial propagation. This would help to put these particular examples of intercellular signaling into a broader context.</p><p>2) There is significant heterogeneity of SPREADs and cell division amongst the mice that were analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Might this be due to variations in basal levels of ERK signaling between different mice, or is it related to age, sex or other factors? If the same mouse was repeatedly analysed, would the number of SPREADs/cell divisions vary significantly each time? Are mice that display fewer SPREADs under basal conditions equally responsive to TPA? Can the authors comment on this or provide any insight?</p><p>3) The authors state in the Results section that their observations show that the propagation of ERK activation in SPREADs is mediated by EGFR-ligands released by MMPs. However, their data shows that the EGF and MMP inhibitors decrease the number of SPREADs, which may not necessarily be the same as blocking the propagation of ERK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). This should be clarified.</p><p>4) The cell cycle analysis is performed using Fucci mice without the ERK sensor. Therefore, the argument that SPREADs play an important role in G2/M progression makes the presumption that SPREADs occur in Fucci mice similar to the Eisuke mice. These mice are backcrossed to different strains. This caveat should be mentioned in the text. Moreover, the data that support an association between SPREADs and cell cycle regulation are weak. The authors find that mice with frequent SPREADs also have more frequent cell division, but these events do not appear to have a definable temporal relationship. The authors should comment on this.</p><p>5) The authors show data to support a spatial relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) between SPREADs and cell division.

These data should be recalculated using values described for SPREADs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, or a justification should be provided for why 100 uM was used.</p><p>6) Figure 7–figure supplement 1 is important enough that it should be in the main manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05178.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors should make clear that there are two different types of propagation described in this report: what they call SPREAD, which is a sporadic burst of ERK activation in normal skin and TPA-treated skin; and a more wave-like, longer distance response to wounding.

Similarity in the velocity of ERK activity propagation and the dependence on MMP supports this proposal. Therefore, we would like to refrain from emphasizing the difference between the two types of ERK activity propagation and have included a statement, in the Results section, that ERK activation propagation can be synchronized and superimposed to generate trigger waves if a number of ERK activation pulses are evoked in close temporal and spatial proximity.</p><p>We admit that “wave” in the title was misleading. We did not intend to refer to the ERK activity propagation from the wound edge. Furthermore, by the suggestion, we have toned down not to conclude the function of SPREADs in the title. The revised title is as follows: “Intercellular propagation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation revealed by in vivo imaging of mouse skin.”</p><p><italic>2) There is significant heterogeneity of SPREADs and cell division amongst the mice that were analysed (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>).

Unfortunately, we have not found any correlation of the SPREAD frequency with sex, age, or other factors. The number of mice used in our study may not be sufficient to find the conditions for the induction of SPREADs. For the benefit of readers, we have included the sex and age of each mouse in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>Heterogeneity of SPREADs vs. basal ERK activity: we compared the basal ERK activities between mice with frequent SPREAD (#102, 107, 112, and 115) and mice with infrequent SPREAD (#113, 114, and 120). The average ERK activity was higher in SPREAD-frequent mice than SPREAD-infrequent mice; however, the difference was not statistically significant by student t-test (P=0.14). We have stated this observation in the Results section and included the data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1B</xref>.</p><p>Heterogeneity of SPREADs in each mouse: we have not succeeded in the second long-term imaging in the same mouse.

We established the FVB/N<sup>EKAREV-NLS</sup> mice to avoid the fluorescence of melanin granules in the skin of C57BL/6 <sup>EKAREV-NLS</sup> mice. In our preliminary experiments, however, we observed SPREADs in C57BL/6 <sup>EKAREV-NLS</sup> mice as in FVB/N<sup>EKAREV-NLS</sup> mice. Therefore, we do not think the difference of mouse strain will significantly affect the results. We have discussed this issue in the Discussion section. We also admit that, without techniques to control cell cycle or ERK activity in vivo, the causal relationship between SPREAD and cell cycle cannot be validated. We have toned down our conclusion in the Title and Abstract, and commented these points in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>5) The authors show data to support a spatial relationship (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref><italic>) between SPREADs and cell division.
