One bound Na<sup>+</sup> (Na1) contributes to the substrate binding, while the other Na<sup>+</sup> (Na2) is thought to be involved in the conformational transition of the NSS. Two NSS members, the serotonin transporter (SERT) and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> dopamine transporter (dDAT), also couple substrate uptake to the antiport of K<sup>+</sup> by a largely undefined mechanism. We have previously shown that the bacterial NSS homologue, LeuT, also binds K<sup>+</sup>, and could therefore serve as a model protein for the exploration of K<sup>+</sup> binding in NSS proteins. Here, we characterize the impact of K<sup>+</sup> on substrate affinity and transport as well as on LeuT conformational equilibrium states. Both radioligand binding assays and transition metal ion FRET (tmFRET) yielded similar K<sup>+</sup> affinities for LeuT. K<sup>+</sup> binding was specific and saturable. LeuT reconstituted into proteoliposomes showed that intra-vesicular K<sup>+</sup> dose-dependently increased the transport velocity of [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine, whereas extra-vesicular K<sup>+</sup> had no apparent effect. K<sup>+</sup> binding induced a LeuT conformation distinct from the Na<sup>+</sup>- and substrate-bound conformation. Conservative mutations of the Na1 site residues affected the binding of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> to different degrees. The Na1 site mutation N27Q caused a &gt;10-fold decrease in K<sup>+</sup> affinity but at the same time a ~3-fold increase in Na<sup>+</sup> affinity. Together, the results suggest that K<sup>+</sup> binding to LeuT modulates substrate transport and that the K<sup>+</sup> affinity and selectivity for LeuT is sensitive to mutations in the Na1 site, pointing toward the Na1 site as a candidate site for facilitating the interaction with K<sup>+</sup> in some NSSs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic></kwd><kwd>structure-function relationships</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>secondary active transport</kwd><kwd>transition metal ion FRET</kwd><kwd>ion binding site</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004836</institution-id><institution>Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1030-00036B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loland</surname><given-names>Claus J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeck Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R344-2020-1020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loland</surname><given-names>Claus J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF19OC0058496</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loland</surname><given-names>Claus J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002808</institution-id><institution>Carlsbergfondet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CF20-0345</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loland</surname><given-names>Claus J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Potassium presumably binds to the Na1 site in LeuT, playing a role in inwardly rectifying the transport of substrates.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The family of neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs) include the transporters responsible for the reuptake of neurotransmitters from the extracellular space following synaptic transmission. Of pronounced interest to neuropharmacology is the subclass of monoamine transporters (MATs), including the dopamine transporter (DAT), the norepinephrine transporter (NET), and the serotonin transporter (SERT), which are molecular targets for a range of psychopharmaceuticals, including drugs against depression, anxiety, neuropathic pain, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and narcolepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kristensen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal and Mortensen, 2017</xref>). They are also targets for psychostimulant drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and amphetamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jayanthi and Ramamoorthy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Di Giovanni et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, understanding the molecular basis underlying their ligand binding and transport are of physiological and pharmacological interest.</p><p>The NSS member LeuT, a hydrophobic amino acid transporter originating from the thermophile bacterium <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic>, was the first NSS for which the structure solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). LeuT has served as a structural and mechanistic model for NSS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Loland, 2015</xref>). All NSS proteins are thought to share the LeuT-fold structure, comprising 10 transmembrane (TM) segments ordered in a pseudo-symmetry in the plane of the membrane between the first and the second five TMs. The LeuT-fold is mostly followed by two C-terminal TMs. Comparing the available structures stabilized in different states of the transport cycle suggests an overall similar transport mechanism, substantiating LeuT as a valid model protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang and Gouaux, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shahsavar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Motiwala et al., 2022</xref>). The substrate binding site is located halfway through the core of the protein and consists of coordinating residues from TM1, -3, -6, and -8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). It is flanked by two Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites, Na1 and Na2. The location and the residues forming the Na1 and Na2 sites are quite conserved between LeuT and the MATs. In the Na1 site, only one of the four coordinating residues differ by a serine to threonine substitution. In the Na2 site, two of the five residues are substituted between LeuT and MATs. A conserved feature shaping the Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites is the helical unwinding in TM1 and TM6, which exposes backbone-carbonyl oxygen atoms to partake in the ion coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). In LeuT, the Na1 ion is also coordinated by the carboxyl-group of the substrate, yielding substrate binding highly Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The sodium gradient across the cell membrane is essential for driving substrate uptake in NSS proteins through occupation of the Na<sup>+</sup> sites. In addition, it has for long been recognized that SERT antiports K<sup>+</sup> as studies have shown that serotonin uptake was accelerated by an outward-directed K<sup>+</sup> gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nelson and Rudnick, 1979</xref>). Consequently, K<sup>+</sup> antiport was suggested to increase the rate of the return step, which is thought to be the rate-limiting step of the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hasenhuetl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fitzgerald et al., 2019</xref>). Cryo-EM reconstruction of SERT obtained in KCl revealed an inward-open conformation, suggesting this to be the most prevalent structure with KCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang and Gouaux, 2021</xref>). The resolution of this structure, however, did not allow unambiguous identification of densities for bound ions. Thus, while the conformational details of the K<sup>+</sup>-bound state of SERT are emerging, the location of the K<sup>+</sup> binding site remains unknown and the antiport mechanism not fully understood. We have shown that K<sup>+</sup> is antiported also by DAT from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (dDAT) by a mechanism that shares similarities with K<sup>+</sup> antiport in SERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schmidt et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we have reported that LeuT interacts with K<sup>+</sup> and that the binding favors an outward-closed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billesbølle et al., 2016</xref>). Intra-vesicular K<sup>+</sup> also increased the concentrative capacity of [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine by LeuT, possibly by decreasing substrate efflux, but the details of K<sup>+</sup>’s interaction with LeuT were not fully explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billesbølle et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we use purified LeuT, either in detergent micelles or reconstituted into proteoliposomes, to characterize the molecular components of how K<sup>+</sup> binds to LeuT, and how it influences the kinetics of substrate transport and the underlying conformational dynamics. Moreover, we mutate Na1 site residues and observe the effect on Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> binding. Analogous to how LeuT for long has served as a structural model for the NSS family of proteins, it here serves as a functional model to suggest a role for K<sup>+</sup> in the transport mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We have previously shown that K<sup>+</sup> inhibits Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine binding to LeuT and changes its conformational equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billesbølle et al., 2016</xref>). However, fundamental questions remain to be addressed: Is the effect of K<sup>+</sup> the result of direct binding to a specific binding site in LeuT? If so, where is this site located? What are the kinetic mechanisms underlying the effect of K<sup>+</sup> on [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine transport? To address this, we expressed His-tagged LeuT in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, harvested and solubilized the membranes in <italic>n</italic>-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) and purified the protein by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Purified LeuT was then used for radioligand binding assays, to analyze the consequences of ion binding on conformational dynamics by transition metal ion FRET (tmFRET), as well as for reconstitution into proteoliposomes for transport assays.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>K<sup>+</sup> binding is competing with Na<sup>+</sup> and saturable</title><p>To characterize the relationship between Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> binding to LeuT, we investigated the effect of K<sup>+</sup> on Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine binding using the scintillation proximity assay (SPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Quick and Javitch, 2007</xref>). Accordingly, we performed a Na<sup>+</sup> titration with 100 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Choline (Ch<sup>+</sup>), seemingly inert to LeuT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billesbølle et al., 2016</xref>), was used as counter ion to maintain the ionic strength.

To ensure close to saturating conditions for both Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> while preserving the ionic strength, we applied 800 mM of the ions. The FRET efficiencies at saturating Ni<sup>2+</sup> concentrations reflect the average distance between the FRET probes and showed that K<sup>+</sup> uniquely stabilizes a high FRET state, suggesting a shift in the conformational equilibrium of the transporter toward an outward-closed state by K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). The Ni<sup>2+</sup> affinity for the His-X<sub>3</sub>-His site is increased ~3-fold when Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> is added to LeuT relative to NMDG<sup>+</sup>. This indicates that both Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> bind and stabilize LeuT, including the His-X<sub>3</sub>-His motif, whereas NMDG<sup>+</sup> does not.</p><p>We proceeded by measuring the FRET efficiency only at saturating Ni<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (10 mM) to obtain FRET efficiencies independent of potential differences in Ni<sup>2+</sup> affinities. In addition to the conditions above, we measured FRET efficiencies for LeuT incubated in Na<sup>+</sup> with alanine and in Rb<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, applying Rb<sup>+</sup>, a cation often seen to be able to substitute for K<sup>+</sup> in biological systems, also stabilized a more outward-closed state relative to that in NMDG<sup>+</sup>. The FRET efficiency in the Na<sup>+</sup>/leucine-bound state was decreased relative to that in the Na<sup>+</sup>-bound state, suggesting a, on average, more open-to-out state when adding leucine. We speculate that LeuT adopts a more conformationally restricted equilibrium upon binding of leucine relative to that with Na<sup>+</sup> alone, and that this is reflected in a lower FRET efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is also in line with the observation that alanine gives rise to a higher FRET efficiency than leucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) as alanine binding allows a higher degree of conformational freedom in the transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calugareanu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The large difference in tmFRET efficiencies between the apo state with NMDG<sup>+</sup> and the K<sup>+</sup>-bound state of LeuT<sup>tmFRET</sup> allowed us to use the K<sup>+</sup>-induced change in conformational dynamics as a proxy for K<sup>+</sup> binding.

We observed an increase in FRET as a function of K<sup>+</sup> yielding an EC<sub>50</sub> of 183 [176; 189] mM, in line with the affinity determined by K<sup>+</sup>-dependent displacement of Na<sup>+</sup> and [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This EC<sub>50</sub> is also in line with the affinity from the Schild analysis performed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billesbølle et al., 2016</xref>). While Na<sup>+</sup> did not impose major conformational changes, we found that also Rb<sup>+</sup> induced a conformational response resembling that of K<sup>+</sup>, suggesting that Rb<sup>+</sup> can indeed substitute for K<sup>+</sup> although with a lower apparent affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Of note, the high salt concentrations did not affect the intrinsic fluorescence properties of the fluorophore, validating that the responses to titration of the ions were direct results of conformational changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Along with the effect of K<sup>+</sup> on Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine binding, this finding supports the existence of a specific K<sup>+</sup> binding site in LeuT, and that K<sup>+</sup> binding to this site induces an outward-closed conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>K<sup>+</sup> increases the rate of substrate uptake by LeuT</title><p>We have previously shown for LeuT reconstituted into liposomes that intra-vesicular K<sup>+</sup> increases the concentrative capacity of [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine, probably by decreasing its efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billesbølle et al., 2016</xref>). To expand on these findings and to characterize how substrate transport was affected by the cations in the intra-vesicular buffer, we reconstituted purified LeuT into liposomes containing either Na<sup>+</sup>, NMDG<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>, Rb<sup>+</sup>, or K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

To assess how the concentration of extra-vesicular Na<sup>+</sup> affected the substrate uptake, we measured [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine uptake at initial velocity conditions in increasing concentrations of extra-vesicular Na<sup>+</sup>. We found that the half-saturating extra-vesicular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration was ∼25 mM for vesicles containing 200 mM intra-vesicular K<sup>+</sup>, which is in line with the higher affinity for Na<sup>+</sup> to LeuT compared to K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>The increase in [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine transport rate by K<sup>+</sup> could be due to an imposed driving force by the outward-directed gradient. If so, dissipation of the K<sup>+</sup> gradient would decrease the [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine transport rate. To allow for the addition of K<sup>+</sup> on the extracellular side also, we lowered the inward-directed Na<sup>+</sup> gradient to 50 mM. The lowered Na<sup>+</sup> gradient still resulted in an ~3.5-fold increased transport capacity with intra-vesicular K<sup>+</sup> relative to NMDG<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, dissipation of the K<sup>+</sup> gradient by application of equal amounts of K<sup>+</sup> on both sides did not change the transport capacity. Addition of K<sup>+</sup> only on the outside did also not change the transport capacity relative to that with the Na<sup>+</sup> gradient only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and only having an outward-directed K<sup>+</sup> gradient could not drive [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results suggest that it is the intra-vesicular K<sup>+</sup> per se that increases the transport rate of alanine and not a K<sup>+</sup> gradient.</p><p>It is difficult to control the directionality of proteins when they are reconstituted into lipid vesicles. They will be inserted in both orientations. Outside-out and inside-out. In the case of LeuT, it is the imposed Na<sup>+</sup> gradient which determines the directionality of transport. Uptake through the inside-out transporters will probably also happen. Note that the inside-out LeuT will not have the K<sup>+</sup> binding site exposed to the intra-vesicular environment. Accordingly, a propensity of transporters will likely not be influenced by the added K<sup>+</sup> and will tend to mask the contribution of K<sup>+</sup> on the transport mode from the right-side out LeuT. To investigate LeuT directionality in our reconstituted samples, we performed thrombin cleavage of accessible C-terminals on intact and perforated vesicles, respectively. The result suggests that the proportion of LeuT inserted as outside-out is larger than the proportion with an inside-out directionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mutations in the Na1 site change the affinity for K<sup>+</sup></title><p>With the elucidation of the impact of K<sup>+</sup> on LeuT substrate transport, we next sought to identify the binding site for K<sup>+</sup> in LeuT.

According to the solved LeuT crystal structures, it predicts that this distance will gradually decline upon transition from the outward-open, through the occluded, to the inward-open conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</xref>). K<sup>+</sup> specifically induces a high FRET efficiency relative to those of the other ions and ligands tested, and titration with K<sup>+</sup> fits a Hill model with a slope of 1.15±0.03 (mean ± s.e.m.), which is in accordance with the existence of one K<sup>+</sup> binding site in LeuT that – when occupied – biases the conformational equilibrium towards an outward-closed state. Interestingly, Rb<sup>+</sup> induced a response similar to that of K<sup>+</sup>, which correlates with previous observations that Rb<sup>+</sup> can substitute for K<sup>+</sup> binding due to similarities in size and preferred coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billesbølle et al., 2016</xref>). The decreased FRET efficiency in the Na<sup>+</sup>/leucine-bound state, relative to that in the Na<sup>+</sup>-bound state, could suggest that the binding of leucine on average favors a more open-to-out state, although this contradicts with the known crystal structures. However, we speculate that instead this result could be a consequence of the principle by which steady-state FRET efficiencies for heterogeneous dynamic ensembles are biased toward shorter distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Taraska et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beechem and Haas, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lakowicz, 2006</xref>). If LeuT adopts a more conformationally restricted equilibrium upon binding of Na<sup>+</sup> and leucine relative to that with Na<sup>+</sup> alone, thereby lowering the frequency by which the transporter visits the outward-closed state, this could reflect the lower FRET efficiency observed for the Na<sup>+</sup>/leucine-bound state.</p><p>When we reconstituted LeuT into liposomes, intra-vesicular K<sup>+</sup> increased the capacity and <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> for [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine uptake compared to intra-vesicular NMDG<sup>+</sup> and Cs<sup>+</sup>. Rb<sup>+</sup> displayed a similar effect, suggesting that the conformational effect of Rb<sup>+</sup> measured by tmFRET translates to an effect on transport function. Dissipating the K<sup>+</sup> gradient or adding K<sup>+</sup> solely on the extra-vesicular side of the proteoliposomes did not affect uptake capacity. Neither were a K<sup>+</sup> gradient alone able to drive uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine. This suggests that the effect of K<sup>+</sup> on LeuT uptake is independent of a K<sup>+</sup> gradient. Conservative mutations in the Na1 site and the adjacent residue Glu290 retained the ability of the transporter to bind ligands, but only A22S and T254S showed sustained [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine transport into proteoliposomes, and a persistent functional effect of K<sup>+</sup>. Interestingly, the LeuT N27Q possessed low affinity for K<sup>+</sup> but increased Na<sup>+</sup> affinity. Also, the tmFRET data suggested it irresponsive to K<sup>+</sup>, but also showed an altered conformational equilibrium. This could suggest that the N27Q mutation causes a bias toward an outward-open conformation. [<sup>3</sup>H]Alanine transport by LeuT A22V showed no effect by the addition of intra-vesicular K<sup>+</sup>. This correlates with the loss of apparent K<sup>+</sup>-induced conformational response as assessed in the tmFRET studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, even though the mutant showed Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine transport, the rate constant was high (1.55 min<sup>–1</sup>) relative to LeuT WT (0.056 min<sup>–1</sup>). This could suggest that the A22V mutation influences additional functional properties, such as entering an exchange mode. Further investigations are needed to clarify this.</p><p>Despite the known role of K<sup>+</sup> in the transport mechanism of SERT and other NSSs, only few studies have attempted to localize the K<sup>+</sup> binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billesbølle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mari et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Khelashvili et al., 2016</xref>). Mutations of Asn338 (corresponding to Asn286 in LeuT) in the Na<sup>+</sup>- and K<sup>+</sup>-coupled amino acid transporter KAAT1 from <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> suggest that this residue is important for cation selectivity and coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mari et al., 2004</xref>). Molecular dynamics simulations of LeuT showed that the K<sup>+</sup> ion could jump between the Na2 and Na1 sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Khelashvili et al., 2016</xref>). Mutation in the Na2 site of LeuT (T354V) resulted in a transporter locked in the outward-closed state, and mutation in the Na1 site (T254V) resulted in a transporter which showed a decreased conformational response to K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billesbølle et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematical examination of K<sup>+</sup> binding in the Na1 site. We found mutations that either increase or decrease the affinities for both Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>, but we also saw mutations with opposite effects with respect to the affinities, and thereby selectivity, for the two ions. These changes in ion affinities were independent of conformational biases as assessed with tmFRET. This decoupling in ion selectivity and conformational bias suggests that the alterations result from direct modulations of the binding site for K<sup>+</sup>. However, binding of the two Na<sup>+</sup> ions and substrate in LeuT is synergistic, making it difficult to completely isolate effects of mutations to a specific site. Consequently, we cannot exclude the possibility that K<sup>+</sup> binding could also involve the Na2 site or another unknown site. Nevertheless, we consider our mapping of the effect on K<sup>+</sup> binding by mutations in Na1 a robust starting point for the quest to identify the K<sup>+</sup> binding site in NSSs.</p><p>We propose that K<sup>+</sup> binding either facilitates LeuT transition from inward- to outward-facing (the rate-limiting step of the transport cycle) or solely prevents the rebinding and possible efflux of Na<sup>+</sup> and substrate. It could also be a combination of both. Either way, intracellular K<sup>+</sup> will lead to an increase in <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> and concentrative capacity. Note that our previous experiment showed an increased [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine efflux when LeuT transports alanine in the absence of intra-vesicular K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billesbølle et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, the mechanistic impact of K<sup>+</sup> could be to catalyze LeuT away from the state that allows the rebinding of Na<sup>+</sup> and substrate. This way, K<sup>+</sup> binding would decrease the possible rebinding of intracellularly released Na<sup>+</sup> and substrate, thereby rectifying the transport process and increase the concentrative capacity and <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our results suggest that K<sup>+</sup> is not counter-transported but rather promotes LeuT to overcome an internal rate-limiting energy barrier. However, further investigations must be performed before any conclusive statement can be made here. If K<sup>+</sup> is not counter-transported, LeuT might comply with the mechanism previously suggested for the human DAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhat et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed role of K<sup>+</sup> in the translocation cycle.</title><p>Here, exemplified for alanine (Ala) as substrate.

After Na<sup>+</sup> and Ala are bound (1) and released (3), LeuT can either (i) rebind Na<sup>+</sup> and Ala, which will promote efflux (2); (ii) transition to the outward-open conformation in its apo-form (4), or (iii) bind K<sup>+</sup> (5). K<sup>+</sup> binding will promote an inward-facing LeuT state (<italic>T</italic>*) which is unable to bind Na<sup>+</sup>, either by competitive inhibition or by promoting a state that does not allow Na<sup>+</sup> binding.

Also, the ability of K<sup>+</sup> binding to induce a conformational change toward an outward-closed/inward-open state appears to be a common mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang and Gouaux, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schmidt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schicker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Möller et al., 2019</xref>).

Harvested cells were disrupted using a cell disruptor (CF1, ConstantSystems) and isolated crude membranes were solubilized with 1.5% (wt/vol) DDM (anagrade, Anatrace). Solubilized LeuT was incubated with Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 40 mM imidazole, batch-washed and labeled overnight with F5M (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Lipids were re-suspended to 10 mg/ml in reconstitution buffer (200 mM NMDG-Cl, 20 mM Tris/HEPES [pH 7.5]) by vortexing and 2× 10 min bath sonication. The lipid solution was subjected to five freeze-thaw cycles in ethanol dry ice bath. Subsequently, the liposomes were extruded with a mini extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) 11 times through a Nuclepore Track-Etch Membrane polycarbonate filter of pore size 400 nm (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and diluted to 4 mg/ml in reconstitution buffer. Liposome destabilization was induced by stepwise addition of 10 µl aliquots of 10% (vol/vol) Triton X-100. Destabilization of liposomes was followed by measuring absorbance at 550 nm. Triton X-100 was added until absorbance of the sample had reached a maximum and started to decrease. LeuT solubilized in DDM was added in a protein to lipid ratio of 1:25 (wt/wt) and the protein-liposome solution was incubated under slow rotation for 30 min at 4°C. Semidry SM-2 Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad Laboratories), equilibrated in reconstitution buffer, were added in aliquots of 8.5 mg beads/mg lipid after 30 min, 60 min, 120 min and after overnight incubation at 4°C with gentle agitation. The beads were filtered out 2 hr after the last addition of bio-beads. The proteoliposome solution was diluted ~20 times in the indicated internal buffer (200 mM salt [NaCl, KCl, NMDG-Cl, CsCl, or RbCl], 20 mM Tris/HEPES [pH 7.5]) and centrifuged for 1 hr at 140,000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4°C. Pelleted proteoliposomes were re-suspended in the indicated internal buffer to a final concentration of 10 mg lipid/ml.

Uptake was assayed in a 96-well setup in ultra-low attachment, round bottom plate (Costar) at room temperature (21–23°C). Uptake buffer (20 mM Tris/HEPES [pH 7.5], 200–225 mM salt [NaCl, KCl, or NMDG-Cl]) supplemented with [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine (Moravek Biochemicals) was added to each well in a volume of 190 µl. Subsequently, 10 µl of proteoliposome solution was added to start the uptake reaction. For time-dependent uptake, the uptake buffer was supplemented with 2 µM [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine with a specific activity of 1.335 Ci/mmol and proteoliposomes were added at the indicated time points (2–60 min). For concentration-dependent uptake, uptake buffer was supplemented with [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine with a specific activity of 3.73 Ci/mmol (50–2000 nM) or 1.07 Ci/mmol (3.5–6 µM). The uptake reaction was terminated after 5 min. To assess nonspecific [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine uptake and binding, proteoliposomes were pre-incubated with 200 µM unlabeled leucine for 15 min, and 100 µM unlabeled leucine was added to the uptake buffer to saturate all transporters with leucine. The uptake reaction was terminated by filtering the samples through a 96-well glass fiber filter (Filtermat B – GF/B, Perkin Elmer) soaked in 1.5% poly(ethyleneimine) solution, using a cell harvester (Tomtec harvester 96 match II). The filter was washed with 1 ml ice-cold wash buffer (200 mM ChCl, 20 mM Tris/HEPES [pH 7.5]) for each of the 96 positions on the filter. Filter plates were dried at 96°C before scintillation sheet (MeltiLex B/HS, Perkin Elmer) was melted on to the filter. Filters were counted on a 2450 MicroBeta<sup>2</sup> microplate counter (PerkinElmer) in ‘normal’ counting mode.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>SDS-PAGE analysis of LeuT orientation</title><p>As for uptake experiments, proteoliposomes were extruded through a Nuclepore Track-Etch Membrane polycarbonate filter with 400 nm pore size (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).

Controls without thrombin and with 1.5% DDM (for 180 min) were included.

The samples were left for 3 hr with gentle agitation at 4°C to dissolve proteoliposomes and solubilize LeuT in DDM detergent micelles. The amount of re-solubilized active LeuT was assessed by binding in a saturating [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine concentration (1 µM) in buffer (200 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris [pH 8], 0.05% [wt/vol] DDM) by SPA. Measures of maximum binding from each condition were used to normalize the c.p.m. obtained from uptake experiments to ensure that uptake was not affected by variations in protein content in the proteoliposome samples. The highest maximum binding was used as normalization standard.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analysis of [<sup>3</sup>H]alanine uptake data</title><p>For <bold>time-dependent uptake</bold>, specific uptake data, normalized to the amount of active protein (see section above), was fitted to a one-phase association using GraphPad Prism 9.0.<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>p</italic> is the maximal uptake (the amplitude), <italic>k</italic> is the rate constant in min<sup>–1</sup>, <italic>t</italic> is time in min, and <italic>y</italic> is uptake in c.p.m. after normalization.

I was initially concerned about the use of solutions of very high ionic strength (the Km for K+ is in the 200 mM range), however, the authors performed good controls with lower ionic strength solutions, suggesting that the K+ effect is specific and not caused by artifacts from the high salt concentrations.</p><p>The major issue I have with this manuscript is with the interpretation of the experimental data. Granted that the K+ effect seems to be complex. However, it seems counterintuitive that K+ competes with Na+ for the same binding site, while at the same time accelerating the transport rate. Even if K+ prevents rebinding of Na+ on the inside of vesicles, it would be expected that K+ then stabilizes this Na+-free conformation, resulting in a slowing of the transport rate. However, the opposite is found. I feel that it would be useful to perform some kinetic modeling of the transport cycle to identify a mechanism that would allow K+ to act as a competitive inhibitor of Na+ binding and rate-accelerator at the same time.</p><p>This ties into the second point: It is not mentioned in the manuscript what the configuration of the vesicles is after LeuT reconstitution. Are they right-side out? Is LeuT distributed evenly in inside-out and right-side out orientation? Is the distribution known? If yes, how does it affect the interpretation of the uptake data with and without K+ gradient?</p><p>Finally, mutations were only made to the Na1 cation binding site. These mutations have an effect mostly to be expected, if K+ would bind to this site. However, indirect effects of mutations can never be excluded, and the authors acknowledge this in the discussion section. It would be interesting to see the effect of K+ on a couple of mutants that are far away from Na+/substrate binding sites. This could be another piece of evidence to exclude indirect effects, if the K+ affinity is less affected.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2(Public Review):</bold></p><p>To characterize the relationship between Na+ and K+ binding to LeuT, the effect of K+ on Na+- dependent [3 H] leucine binding was studied using a scintillation proximity assay. In the presence of K+ the apparent affinity for sodium was reduced but the maximal binding capacity for this ion was unchanged, consistent with a competitive mechanism of inhibition between Na+ and K+.</p><p>To obtain a more direct readout of K+ binding to LeuT, tmFRET was used. This method relies on the distance-dependent quenching of a cysteine-conjugated fluorophore (FRET donor) by a transition metal (FRET acceptor). This method is a conformational readout for both ion- and ligand-binding. Along with the effect of K+ on Na+-dependent [3 H] leucine binding, the findings support the existence of a specific K+ binding site in LeuT and that K+ binding to this site induces an outward closed conformation.</p><p>It was previously shown that in liposomes inlaid with LeuT by reconstitution, intra-vesicular K+ increases the concentrative capacity of [ 3 H] alanine. To obtain insights into the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon, purified LeuT was reconstituted into liposomes containing a variety of cations, including Na+ and K+ followed by measurements of [ 3 H] alanine uptake driven by a Na+ gradient.</p><p>The ionic composition of the external medium was manipulated to determine if the stimulation of [3 H] alanine uptake by K+ was due to an outward directed potassium gradient serving as a driving force for sodium-dependent substrate transport by moving in the direction opposite to that of sodium and the substrate. Remarkably it was found that it is the intra-liposomal K+ per se that increases the transport rate of alanine and not a K+ gradient, suggesting that binding of K+ to the intra-cellular face of the transporter could prevent the rebinding of sodium and the substrate thereby reducing their efflux from the cell. These conclusions assume that the measured radioactive transport is via right-side-out liposomes rather than from their inverted counterparts (in case of a random orientation of the transporters in the proteoliposomes). Even though this assumption is likely to be correct, it should be tested.</p><p>Since K+- and Na+-binding are competitive and K+ excludes substrate binding, the Authors chose to focus on the Na1 site where the carboxyl group of the substrate serves as one of the groups which coordinate the sodium ion. This was done by the introduction of conservative mutations of the amino acid residues forming the Na1 site. The potassium interaction in these mutants was monitored by sodium dependent radioactive leucine binding. Moreover, the effect the effect of Na+ with and without substrate as well as that of potassium on the conformational equilibria was measured by tmFRET measurements on the mutants introduced in the construct enabling the measurements. The results suggest that K+-binding to LeuT modulates substrate transport and that the K+ affinity and selectivity for LeuT is sensitive to mutations in the Na1 site, pointing toward the Na1 site as a candidate site for facilitating the interaction between K+ in some NSS members.</p><p>The data presented in this manuscript are of very high quality. They are a detailed extension of results by the same group (Billesbolle et. al, Ref. 16 from the list) providing more detailed information on the importance of the Na1 site for potassium interaction. Clearly this begs for the identification of the binding site in a potassium bound LeuT structure in the future. Presumably LeuT was studied here because it appears that it is relatively easy to determine structures of many conformational states. Furthermore, convincing evidence showed that the stimulatory effect of K+ on transport is not because of energization of substrate accumulation but is rather due to the binding of this cation to a specific site.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Include a transport mechanism that can account for the K+ effects.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to elaborate further regarding how we envision this complex mechanism. It is generally known that, within the LeuT-fold transporters, the return step is ratelimiting for the transport process. Our data suggests that K+ binds to the inward-facing apo form.</p><p>Accordingly, we propose that the role of K+ binding is to facilitate LeuT to overcome the rate-limiting step. We propose the following mechanistic model: When Na+ and substrate is released to the intracellular environment the transporter must return to the outward-facing conformation. This can happen in (at least) two ways: (1) The transporter in its apo-form closes the inner gate and opens to the extracellular side, now ready to perform a new transport cycle. (2) The transporter rebinds Na+, which allows for the rebinding of substrate. It can now go in reverse (efflux) or it once again release its content. The transporter can naturally also only rebind Na+ and release it again to the cytosol.</p><p>The purpose of K+ binding is to prevent Na+ rebinding and to promote a conformational state of the transporter, which does not allow Na+ binding. Even though Na+ has a higher affinity for the site, K+ is much more abundant.</p><p>This model is supported by our previous experiment, showing that intravesicular K+ prevents [3H]alanine efflux while LeuT performs Na+-dependent alanine transport. Thus, the increase in Vmax could be due to a decreased efflux (exchange mode), or a facilitation of the rate-limiting step, or a combination of the two.</p><p>Note that the model does not require that K+ is counter-transported. It just has to prevent Na+ rebinding. However, even though we failed to show K+ counter-transport, it does not mean that it does not happen. Further experiments must clarify this issue.</p><p>To be more explicit about our proposed mechanistic model, we have expanded the last paragraph in the Discussion section. It now reads:</p><p>“We propose that K+ binding either facilitates LeuT transition from inward- to outward-facing (the rate limiting step of the transport cycle), or solely prevents the rebinding and possible efflux of Na+ and substrate. It could also be a combination of both. Either way, intracellular K+ will lead to an increase in Vmax and concentrative capacity. Note that our previous experiment showed an increased [3H]alanine efflux when LeuT transports alanine in the absence of intra-vesicular K+16. Specifically, the mechanistic impact of K+ could be to catalyze LeuT away from the state that allows the rebinding of Na+ and substrate. This way, K+ binding would decrease the possible rebinding of intracellularly released Na+ and substrate, thereby rectifying the transport process and increase the concentrative capacity and Vmax (Figure 6). Our results suggest that K+ is not counter-transported but rather promotes LeuT to overcome an internal rate limiting energy barrier. However, further investigations must be performed before any conclusive statement can be made here.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Describe the orientation of the transporter in the vesicles.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>When working with reconstituted NSS, the transport activity is determined by the Na+ gradient. This is also evident in the experiments where we dissipate the Na+ gradient. Here we find transport activity compatible to background. We can also see in the literature, that directionality is rarely determined for transport proteins in reconstituted systems. When that is said, it is difficult to know how the inside-out LeuT contribute to the transport process. Will they work in reverse and contribute to the accumulation of intravesicular [3H]alanine? If so, to what extent? They will likely not be affected by the intravesicular K+. Therefore, their possible contribution will ‘work against’ our results and decrease the apparent K+ effects reported herein. Taken together, unless the vast majority of LeuT molecules are inside-out, knowing the actual proportion will not, in our perspective, affect our interpretations and conclusions of the data.</p><p>When that is said, we have also been curious about this issue and with the question raised by the reviewer, we performed the suggested experiment. We have inserted the results in Figure 3 – Figure supplement 1D. The figure shows that a fraction of the reconstituted LeuT are susceptible to thrombin cleavage of the accessible C-terminal. We have quantified the cleaved fraction to around 40% of the total (see Author response image 1 below). It is, however, a crude estimate since it is difficult to perform reliable dosimetry with fractions that close together. Thus, we are reluctant to add a quantitative measure in the article text.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87985-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We have inserted the following in the main text:</p><p>“It is difficult to control the directionality of proteins when they are reconstituted into lipid vesicles. They will be inserted in both orientations. Outside-out and inside-out. In the case of LeuT it is the imposed Na+-gradient which is determines the directionality of transport. Uptake through the insideout transporters will probably also happen. Note that the inside-out LeuT will not have the K+ binding site exposed to the intra-vesicular environment.Accordingly, a propensity of transporters will likely not be influenced by the added K+ and will tend to mask the contribution of K+ to the transport mode from the right-side out LeuT. To investigate LeuT directionality in our reconstituted samples, we performed thrombin cleavage of accessible C-terminals on intact and perforated vesicles, respectively. The result suggests that the proportion of LeuT inserted as outside-out is larger than the proportion with an inside-out directionality (Figure 3 – Figure supplement 1D).”</p><p>For the inserted Figure 3 – Figure supplement 1D, we have added the following legend:</p><p>“(D) SDS-PAGE analysis of LeuT proteoliposomes following time-dependent thrombin digestion of accessible C-terminals (reducing the mass of LeuT by ~1.3 kDa).

Either way, it must facilitate a transition towards a non-Na+ binding state. We tried to differentiate between the two possibilities by investigating if an outwarddirected K+ gradient alone could drive transport (Figure 3E). We do not observe any significant difference from background (no gradient). However, the gained information is rather weak: It is still possible that K+ is counter-transported, but the K+ gradient does not impose any driving force. Instead, it ensures a rectification of the Na+-dependent substrate transport. If so, this experiment would come up negative even if K+ is counter-transported.</p><p>To be more explicit, we have changed the wording on page 16.</p><p>Our results suggests that K+ is not counter-transported, but rather promote LeuT to overcome an internal rate limiting energy barrier.

If these mutants have no transport activity this should be stated. Moreover, alanine uptake by A22V is almost sodium independent and is also very fast, suggesting binding, not transport. Are the counts sensitive to ionophores like nigericin?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this important point. Indeed, the LeuT N27Q and N286Q are transport inactive. This information is now inserted in the main text when describing the conformational dynamics of N27QtmFRET and N286QtmFRET.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the [3H]alanine uptake for A22V is not very conclusive. The vesicles with Na+ on both sides (open diamonds) do allow [3H]alanine binding. Vesicles with added gramicidin are similar in activity. The fast rate could indeed suggest a binding event. This we also do not rule out in the main text. However, the contribution in activity from LeuT A22V in vesicles with a Na+ gradient cannot be explained by a binding event alone. Then it should bind more [3H]alanine in the presence of a Na+ gradient, which is possible, but hard to imagine. Also, the alanine affinity for LeuT A22V is ~1 µM (Table 1). At this affinity it should be literally impossible to detect any binding because the off-rate is so fast that it would all dissociate during the washing procedure.</p><p>We have described the data and left out any interpretation (e.g. changed ‘[3H]alanine transport’ to ‘[3H]alanine activity’). In addition, we have replaced: “This correlates with the lack of changes in conformational equilibrium observed in the tmFRET data between the NMDG+, Na+ and K+ states.” with: “Further investigations must clarify whether the changes in observed [3H]alanine activity constitutes a transport- or a binding event.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lower part of p. 16. The Authors speculate &quot;that the mechanistic impact of K+ binding could be to accelerate a transition away from the conformation where Na+ and substrate are released, to a state where they can no longer rebind and thus revert the transport process (efflux)&quot;. This could be easily tested by measuring exchange, which should not be influenced by potassium.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed this experiment in Billesbolle et al. 2016. Nat Commun (Fig. 1f). We show that the exchange is decreased in the presence of K+. We hypothesize that this is because K+ binding forces LeuT away from the exchange mode.</p></body></sub-article></article>
