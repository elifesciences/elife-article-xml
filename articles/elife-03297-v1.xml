Impediment of DNA replication can lead to DNA damage and genomic disorders. In this study, we show a novel function for <italic>NDE1</italic>, whose mutations cause brain developmental disorders, in safeguarding the genome through S phase during early steps of neural progenitor fate restrictive differentiation. Nde1 mutant neural progenitors showed catastrophic DNA double strand breaks concurrent with the DNA replication. This evoked DNA damage responses, led to the activation of p53-dependent apoptosis, and resulted in the reduction of neurons in cortical layer II/III. We discovered a nuclear pool of Nde1, identified the interaction of Nde1 with cohesin and its associated chromatin remodeler, and showed that stalled DNA replication in Nde1 mutants specifically occurred in mid-late S phase at heterochromatin domains. These findings suggest that NDE1-mediated heterochromatin replication is indispensible for neuronal differentiation, and that the loss of NDE1 function may lead to genomic neurological disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03297.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03297.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03297.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain is a complex organ with many different cell types that each have specialized functions. Mutations in genes that control how the brain develops can have serious consequences—and one of the most important genes involved in the development of the human brain is called <italic>NDE1</italic>.</p><p>Individuals who inherit mutated copies of the <italic>NDE1</italic> gene from both parents have brains with fewer folds than a healthy brain, and their brains are up to 90% smaller than normal.

Looking for molecules that interact with the mouse version of the Nde1 protein revealed that it binds to proteins that control how DNA is packaged inside the nucleus of a cell. In doing so, Nde1 appears to protect the genome of brain stem cells, while these cells' DNA is copied and before they divide to form new cells destined to become neurons.</p><p>For a cell to divide, its genetic information must be accurately copied and then segregated between the two new cells to ensure that each receives all the genetic instructions needed to develop and function properly. In brain cells from mice without functional Nde1, the DNA frequently breaks as it is copied. Brain cells that inherit damaged DNA might not function correctly, while serious breaks that affect both strands of the DNA can trigger a response that kills the mutated cell. This means, there are fewer cells that make up the outer layer of the brain, making it less wrinkled than normal. This part of the brain—called the cerebral cortex—is important for many processes including thought and memory, and it helps different areas of the brain communicate with one another. This may explain why mutations in the <italic>NDE1</italic> gene can contribute to a variety of brain disorders.</p><p>Errors during DNA replication can also cause cancer to develop. As such, the findings of Feng and Houlihan may also help to explain why some genetic mutations are associated with both cancer and brain disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03297.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03297.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>DNA damage response</kwd><kwd>cerebral cortex</kwd><kwd>cohesin</kwd><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000071</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD56380</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Yuanyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Differentiation-specific maintenance of genome integrity during S-phase is essential for establishing both the structure and function of the cerebral cortex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The developmental formation of complex multicellular organs requires the impeccable integration of cell division with differentiation. The precise control of the DNA synthesis (S) phase of each cell division cycle warrants the faithful replication of the entire genome and at the same time establishes the epigenetic state that defines the differentiation identity of individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McNairn and Gilbert, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nordman and Orr-Weaver, 2012</xref>). Concurrent with genome duplication, the protein components of chromatin are disassembled and re-assembled throughout the S phase into higher order structures that characterize the specific gene expression status of daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabert and Groth, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Budhavarapu et al., 2013</xref>). The task of assuring error-free S phases is especially challenging in the generation of organs with extraordinarily high cell number and diversity, such as the cerebral cortex, during which billions of functionally specialized neurons are produced following a tightly controlled developmental program of cell cycle progression and step-wise neural progenitor fate restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rakic, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Desai and McConnell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rakic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>). S phase-mediated genome regulation is recently shown to be essential not only for rapid expansion of neural progenitor pool but also for neural differentiation, as the amount of time neural progenitors spend in S phase is highly correlated to the cell fate of cerebral cortical neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arai et al., 2011</xref>). Longer S phase appears more necessary for self renewing than neuron-producing cell cycles, suggesting an S phase specific quality control in maintaining the identity of neural progenitors before their terminal neurogenic division. The importance of genome maintenance in corticogenesis is also underscored by large amounts of clinical and experimental observation, which have shown that the functional impairment of genes important for DNA metabolism frequently leads to brain developmental pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McKinnon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zeman and Cimprich, 2014</xref>). However, as the genes involved are also essential for genome surveillance outside of the brain, pathogenic lesions of the brain genome have been believed to associate with the lack of effective DNA damage repair, improper checkpoint signaling, rapid cell proliferation, or increased metabolic, chemical, and physical stresses. It is unclear whether a genome quality control associated specifically with neuronal differentiation is required to ensure the correct genetic and epigenetic identity of both neural progenitors and daughter neurons.</p><p>NDE1 is a multifunctional molecular scaffold fundamental for CNS development. It was originally identified as the central nervous system (CNS) specific partner of LIS1 (known as PAFAH1B1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feng et al., 2000</xref>), whose haploinsufficiency results in lissencephaly (smooth brain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reiner et al., 1993</xref>). Homozygous mutations of <italic>NDE1</italic> were found recently to cause microlissencephaly (small and smooth brain) with up to 90% reduction in brain mass, while the affected individuals showed normal development of non-CNS organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkuraya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakircioglu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Guven et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, copy number variants (CNVs) in the <italic>NDE1</italic> locus are increasingly shown to associate with a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders with complex genetic traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ullmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hannes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heinzen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mefford et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nagamani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tropeano et al., 2013</xref>). Genetic epistasis studies in mice demonstrated that Nde1 and Lis1 function synergistically in a dose-dependent manner in governing the generation of late-born cortical neurons that comprise the upper cortical layers II and III. Layer II/III neurons were found specifically reduced in both Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> and Nde1<sup>+/−</sup> Lis1<sup>+/−</sup> mice, and they were abolished almost completely in Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Lis1<sup>+/−</sup> mice along with severe brain hypoplasia but insignificant change in the body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feng and Walsh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pawlisz et al., 2008</xref>). Neurons in cortical upper layers are evolutionarily novel and undergo great expansion in mammalian evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeFelipe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Molnar et al., 2006</xref>). They are highly diverse projection neurons and essential for cognitive functions including perception, emotion, attention, and memory through making functional connections among various cortical areas and between the two cerebral hemispheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeFelipe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fame et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Greig et al., 2013</xref>). The essential requirement of Nde1 in the generation of cortical layer II/III neurons underscores the gene dosage dependency of <italic>NDE1</italic> in brain cognition. However, current molecular information on NDE1 (Nde1) is limited by its previously identified association with the cytoskeleton, which does not fully explain its CNS specific phenotype and function.</p><p>In the present study of murine models of Nde1 mutations, we report that Nde1 is indispensible for the successful completion of S phase, specifically during the early neuronal fate restrictive differentiation of multipotent neural progenitors. The most profound phenotype that resulted from Nde1 mutations was severe DNA damage that occurred during mid to late S phase heterochromatic DNA replication. Stalled DNA replication led to DNA replicative catastrophe and the activation of tumor suppressor p53 (encoded by Trp53 or Tp53) via DNA damage responses (DDRs). Abrogating p53-suppressed apoptosis rescued the size and structure of Nde1 mutant brain but failed to mitigate the genomic stress. We also identified a nuclear pool of Nde1 and the interaction of Nde1 with the cohesin complex as well as the chromatin remodeler SNF2h. These findings suggest that Nde1 is essential for CNS specific genomic quality control, that chromatin remodeling during heterochromatic replication facilitated by Nde1 is essential for generating cortical layer II/III neurons, and that reduced fidelity of S phase choreography during the early phase of neural progenitor differentiation and identity establishment may lead to mosaic genomic lesions and developmental brain disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The loss of Nde1 results in DNA damage in early steps of neuronal fate restriction</title><p>The reduction of cortical layer II/III neurons in both Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> and Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Lis1<sup>+/−</sup> mutants was previously found to result from a failure in cell division and precocious neurogenesis of the mutant neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feng and Walsh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pawlisz et al., 2008</xref>). However, massive apoptosis detected by TUNEL was also observed predominantly in the newly formed cortical plate (CP) of Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Lis1<sup>+/−</sup> embryos at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pawlisz et al., 2008</xref>). To understand the mechanism of apoptosis and evaluate its contribution to the loss of layer II/III neurons in Nde1 mutant brains, we examined its associated cellular processes and found that the apoptosis in both Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Lis1<sup>+/−</sup> and Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> mutants corresponded with increased DNA damage. A substantial number of cells in the neocortex of Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Lis1<sup>+/−</sup> and Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> mutants showed abnormally high γH2AX immunosignals, a hallmark for DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thiriet and Hayes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While γH2AX foci associated with DNA replication were also widely detected in wild-type and mutant cortices, the γH2AX+ signals observed in the mutant were several orders of magnitude higher, showed pan-nuclear pattern, and were often co-stained by antibodies to cleaved caspase 3 (CC3), the marker for apoptosis. While apoptosis was wide-spread and observed in both CP neurons and ventricular zone (VZ) neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pawlisz et al., 2008</xref>), γH2AX+ cells were confined in the VZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This suggested that DNA damage occurred prior to apoptosis and that apoptosis was one of the endpoints of DNA damage caused by Nde1 deficiency.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03297.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The correlation of DNA damage and apoptosis with neural progenitor early fate restriction in Nde1 mutant brains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunohistological analysis of γH2AX (red) and cleaved caspase 3 (CC3, green) reveals the co-existence of DNA damage and apoptosis in the neocortex of Nde1 mutants at E12.5.

In the Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Lis1<sup>+/−</sup> brain, γH2AX+ and CC3+ cells were detected as early as the onset of neocortical neurogenesis at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At this stage, a majority of the neural progenitors progress through the cell cycle rapidly to expand the progenitor pool, while some start to differentiate into intermediate neural progenitors or neurons. From E10.5 to E12.5, as more neural progenitors become fate restricted, both DNA damage and apoptosis in the Nde1 mutant cortex increased and peaked at E12.5. With the progression of cortical neurogenesis, γH2AX+ and CC3+ cells declined gradually after E13.5 when more cortical neurons were produced. Apoptosis in both Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Lis1<sup>+/−</sup> and Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> mutants became lower during the later stages of cortical neurogenesis after E15, even though a majority of cortical layer II/III neurons are generated through terminal mitosis between E15 and E17. In contrast to the low level of apoptosis, γH2AX+ cells remained detectable until birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). While γH2AX and CC3 signals were at peak levels in the neocortex of Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Lis1<sup>+/−</sup> and Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> brains at E12.5, they were absent in the mutant cortical hem, the highly proliferating but non-neurogenic hippocampus organizer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This suggested that DNA damage and apoptosis caused by Nde1 mutation were associated with neural progenitor differentiation as opposed to proliferation. During neocortical development, neurogenesis is known to proceed along the transverse neurogenic gradient (TNG), which initiates rostrolaterally and propagates caudomedially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caviness et al., 2009</xref>). To better reveal the correlation of DNA damage and apoptosis with neocortical neurogenesis, we examined serially sectioned Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> brains (n = 6) by double immunostaining of γH2AX and CC3 with newborn neuron markers DCX or Tuj1. Compared to Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Lis1<sup>+/−</sup> brains, the well-preserved cytoarchitecture of Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> brains allows for a better assessment of the spatial distribution of DNA damage and apoptosis with respect to the TNG. At earlier E12, more γH2AX+ cells were observed in the rostrolateral than the caudomedial neocortex. Similarly, CC3+ cells were predominantly detected rostrolaterally in these brains. Towards later E12, as TNG progresses caudomedially, CC3+ cells also increased in the caudolateral and rostromedial cortical regions. In all cortical sections examined, γH2AX+ and CC3 signals were correlated spatially with the presence and abundance of newborn neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these data demonstrated that DNA damage and apoptosis in Nde1 mutant cortices had little correlation with self-renewal proliferation or neurogenic terminal divisions but was well in line with early neural progenitor fate restrictive differentiation around E12.5 in the developing neocortex.</p><p>The link of DNA damage and apoptosis with early progenitor differentiation was further shown in the developing spinal cord, where neurogenic domains are better spatiotemporally defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We also examined DNA damage and apoptosis on sagittal sections of E12.5 Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Lis1<sup>+/−</sup> embryos and found only a small number of cells outside of the developing CNS were affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These developmental analyses demonstrate that the most profound phenotype caused by Nde1 mutations is characterized by DNA damage and apoptosis, and that this phenotype is spatiotemporally in parallel to the early differentiation period of neural progenitors. Thus, the indispensible role of Nde1 in generating layer II/III neurons appears to be at the time when the fate of these neurons is initially established rather than when they are generated through terminal mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Apoptosis resulted from DNA damage response</title><p>To confirm that the apoptosis in Nde1 mutants was the result of DNA damage but not vice versa, we detected DNA damage directly by performing the comet assay on primary cortical cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Olive and Banath, 2006</xref>).

To confirm this, we measured the duration of S phase (Ts) of primary progenitors by sequential IdU-BrdU labeling and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martynoga et al., 2005</xref>). In this experiment, IdU was used to label progenitors in S phase, and BrdU was added 1.5 hr later to assess if IdU+ cells had completed DNA replication. Our data showed that the Ts of Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> progenitors was significantly longer than that of the wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, we also noticed that in both Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Lis1<sup>+/−</sup> and Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> mutants, many nuclei that stopped incorporating BrdU (IdU+BrdU−) remained in the S phase zone of the basal VZ instead of descending apically as seen in the wild-type progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, white arrows). Neural progenitors in the cortical VZ are polarized apical-basally and known to undergo interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) by moving their nuclei basally during S phase. After S phase is completed, the nuclei are moved apically for mitosis to occur at the ventricular surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Takahashi et al., 1993</xref>). As the basally localized IdU+BrdU− nuclei in the mutant were not recognized in G2/M by PH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), it suggested that these mutant cells might arrest in the basal S phase zone due to the stalled DNA replication. To confirm the faulty S phase prior to G2/M, we increased the time between IdU and BrdU pulses to 2.5 hr to observe if the IdU+BrdU− cells in the basal S phase zone of the mutant may progress to mitosis over time. However, we observed that rather than progressing to mitosis, these cells remained stalled and that about half (47.5%) of the γH2AX+ cells were positively stained by antibodies to IdU but not to BrdU, indicating that S phase-stalled cells underwent DDR by activating γH2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This explains why only 20% of γH2AX+ cells were actively incorporating BrdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), since a majority of γH2AX+ cells were stalled in the S phase. Therefore, our data demonstrate that Nde1 is functionally essential during S phase and that DNA damage in Nde1 mutant progenitors results from stalled and catastrophic DNA replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>S phase impairment during heterochromatic replication</title><p>During the S phase of metazoan cells, various chromosomal domains are known to replicate in a well-defined spatiotemporal sequence and can be visualized experimentally by labeling and immunostaining with nucleotide analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dimitrova and Gilbert, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dimitrova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maison et al., 2010</xref>). To better understand the function of Nde1 in S phase, we studied the dynamic progression of S phase and analyzed IdU and CldU sequentially labeled chromosomal domains by taking advantage of the non-overlapping immunosignals between IdU and CldU. Embryos were pulse labeled by IdU for 1.5 hr before being labeled again by CldU transiently. Cells in early S phase were identified by CldU but not IdU incorporation (IdU−CldU+) as well as a more evenly distributed CldU immunosignals, as new replication foci emerge continuously throughout the transcriptionally active euchromatin. Whereas cells in mid to late S phase were labeled by both IdU and CldU (IdU+CldU+) and recognized by enhanced nucleotide incorporation in various transcriptionally silent heterochromatic domains. Cells that had left S phase could be noted by IdU+ only (IdU+CldU−) immunosignals, since they stopped nucleotide incorporation before CldU pulse labeling. By quantitative comparison of IdU-CldU labeled progenitors in the cortical VZ of wild-type and Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> mutant, we failed to detect a significant difference in the early S phase population but found more mutant progenitors in mid to late S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In a large number of Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> progenitors, CldU signals in IdU+CldU+ cells were predominantly detected along the nuclear periphery, the rim of nucleoli, and on particles of satellite repeats which are characteristic for heterochromatic domains, indicating replication difficulties in these domains during mid to late S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). Triple immunostaining of IdU, CldU, and PH3 allowed us to access the S to G2/M progression; we found that Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> progenitors showed a reduction in the intensity and the number of IdU labeled foci in PH3+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, arrows), suggesting reduced nucleotide incorporation into mutant progenitors before S phase completion. Collectively, the unaltered early S phase population, significant increase in CldU labeling in various heterochromatic domains, reduced IdU labeling in PH3+ cells, combined with prolonged duration of S phase, suggest that DNA replication in Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> progenitors progresses normally through the euchromatin, but stalls during heterochromatin replication in mid-late S phase.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03297.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Stalled DNA replication during mid-late S phase at heterochromatic domains in Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> mutant neural progenitors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantitative analysis of IdU+CldU− (red), IdU+CldU+ (yellow), and IdU−CldU+ (green) cell fractions (%) by IdU (2 hr) and CldU (30 min) sequential labeling.

As somatically generated chromosomal aberrations can happen in neocortical progenitors and neurons of the normal brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rehen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bushman and Chun, 2013</xref>), and Nde1 mutation affects only selected cells in a heterogeneous pool of neural progenitors, such genomic mosaicism and cell heterogeneity of the developing cortex precluded us from obtaining direct information on the genomic lesions in the Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Trp53<sup>−/−</sup> brain. Instead, we looked into further evidence of DNA damage by examining cell cycle stress in Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Trp53<sup>−/−</sup> embryonic cortices. After completing S phase, neural progenitors of the VZ normally move replicated chromosomes through INM towards the apical ventricular surface where chromosome condensation and mitosis occur. In both Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> and Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Trp53<sup>−/−</sup> cortices, a substantial number of PH3+ progenitors were found mislocalized basally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). PH3 is an indicator of cells in both late-G2 and M phases; we found chromosomes of the mislocalized PH3+ mutant progenitors were not condensed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref> higher magnification views), indicating cell cycle arrest in G2 instead of M phase. The G2 arrest in Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> and Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Trp53<sup>−/−</sup> progenitors was confirmed by co-immunostaining PH3+ cells with the phospho-vimentin antibody 4A4, which exclusively recognizes progenitors in M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Weissman et al., 2003</xref>). Most PH3+4A4+ progenitors in Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> and Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Trp53<sup>−/−</sup> mutants were correctly localized at the ventricular surface, whereas most PH3+4A4− progenitors in the mutants were ectopically localized, indicating that the basally mislocalized PH3+ cells were those arrested in late-G2 and that INM in the mutant was largely normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Consistent with the G2 arrest, we found that the level of PH3 was elevated in the Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Trp53<sup>−/−</sup> brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The hallmark for DNA damage-induced G2/M checkpoint involves the degradation of Cdc25A, a phosphatase essential for Cdk1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mailand et al., 2000</xref>). Both Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> and Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Trp53<sup>−/−</sup> brains showed reduced levels of Cdc25A at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), supporting the notion that prolonged G2 in Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Trp53<sup>−/−</sup> progenitors was a result of persistent DNA damage.</p><p>We followed a cohort of Nde1 Trp53 double mutant mice (n &gt; 80) over a 4-month period, and none of the Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Trp53<sup>−/−</sup> mice (n &gt; 20) was found to have altered brain structures or tumors of CNS origin, though they showed obvious tumors in multiple organs outside of the CNS.

Smc3 is a core subunit of cohesin, an essential guardian of genome integrity. Composed of SMC1, SMC3, SCC1 (RAD21), and SCC3 (STAG), cohesin forms a ring-like structure to embrace chromatin fibers from the moment they arise following the replication fork until the onset of anaphase to ensure the proper segregation of genetic materials to daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nasmyth, 2011</xref>). The physical interaction of Nde1 and Smc3 was confirmed by the co-immunoprecipiation studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Two other core subunits of the cohesin complex, Smc1 and Rad21, were also detected in the Nde1–Smc3 immunocomplex, indicating the direct interaction of Nde1 with the entire cohesin complex. We also performed the reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation analysis to detect Nde1 in the immunoprecipitate of the SMC3 fragment recovered from the Nde1 yeast two-hybrid screen. This Nde1 binding domain of Smc3 (NBD), which corresponds to amino acids R746 to R903 in the coiled-coil region between the C-terminal globular and central hinge domains of Smc3, was immunoprecipitated and found to form a specific immunocomplex with Nde1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). To determine the functional significance of the Nde1–Smc3 interaction, we over-expressed the NBD to block the binding of Nde1 with cohesin and found that NBD arrested the cell cycle preferentially in S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). We also noted that many cells expressing the NBD showed fragmented nuclei or committed to apoptosis as seen in Nde1 mutant neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggested that the lack of proper interaction of Nde1 with cohesin may underlie the S phase genotoxicity in Nde1 mutant neural progenitors.</p><p>Besides a canonical role in maintaining the fidelity of chromosome segregation, cohesin has emerged as an important regulator for higher order chromatin structures, essential for DNA replication through densely packed heterochromatic repetitive sequences. Cohesin can also serve as a platform for DSB repair or act as a nuclear global controller for gene expression on both transcriptional and epigenetic levels. The diverse functions of cohesin are accomplished through recruiting various molecules to the core cohesin ring complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Peters et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Imakaev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baranello et al., 2014</xref>). To define the functional cooperation of Nde1 with cohesin, we tested if Nde1 co-complexes with cohesin partners for DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, and transcriptional regulation through co-immunoprecipitation studies. The chromatin remodeler SNF2h was consistently found in the Nde1–cohesin immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). SNF2h is an ATPase chromatin remodeler that interacts with RAD21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hakimi et al., 2002</xref>). During S phase, SNF2h is recruited to the replication foci and facilitates heterochromatic remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guetg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sugimoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Postepska-Igielska et al., 2013</xref>). The participation of Nde1 in the cohesin–SNF2h complex suggests that Nde1 may participate in mid to late S phase heterochromatin remodeling.</p><p>Karyotyping analysis of mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) also revealed that Nde1 mutation led to increased genomic instability similar to those that have been seen in cohesinopathy, and that Nde1 Trp53 double mutation accelerated the aneuploidy caused by the Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> single mutation. At passage 3, when Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> MEFs only showed a modest increase in aneuploidy compared to the wild-type MEFs, more than 50% of the Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Trp53<sup>−/−</sup> MEFs were aneuploid. About 70% of the Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> MEFs became aneuploid by passage 10, but a similar degree of aneuploidy developed in the Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Trp53<sup>−/−</sup> MEFs at passage 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). While some Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> cells showed chromosomal aberrations with visible chromosome breaks on crossed chromosome arms, which was reminiscent of what have been observed in cohesin mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Peters et al., 2008</xref>), more severe chromosomal aberrations including breaks, fragmentation, detachments, and cross of chromosome arms were frequently observed in Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Trp53<sup>−/−</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). The increased chromosomal instability of Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Trp53<sup>−/−</sup> over Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> MEFs was also in agreement with what was observed in Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Trp53<sup>−/−</sup> neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and supported that abrogating p53 increased genotoxic lesions in the Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> mutant by allowing mutant cells with DSBs to escape DDR-induced p53-dependent apoptosis, enabling the genetically altered mutant cells to survive and propagate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have elucidated a novel role of NDE1 in maintaining the brain genome.

The peak detection of γH2AX and CC3 in the developing cortex of Nde1 mutant mice was around E12.5. Levels of DNA damage and apoptosis were low, both during the early phase neural progenitor self renewal before E12 and when the bulk of cortical neurons were generated after E15. During the period when genomic lesions were detected at the peak level between E12 and E13, their abundance spatially correlated with the level of neurogenesis following the TNG. According to a recent genetic fate mapping study, at least a subset of progenitors become fate restricted to become upper layer cortical neurons before E13.5, even through these neurons are generated through terminal mitosis 3–4 days later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Franco et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the temporal-specific DNA damage that we observed in the Nde1 mutant brain matches closely with the time when primary neural progenitors become fate restricted to be layer II/III neurons. This phenotype is different from what have been seen in conditional brain mutation of genes known to play global roles in DNA metabolism and genome surveillance, such as Brca1, ATR, DNA ligase IV, XRCC4, TopBP1, and Cdh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frank et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gao et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pulvers and Huttner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gatz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eguren et al., 2013</xref>). In these mutants, endogenous or gamma irradiation-induced DNA damage and p53-dependent apoptosis were shown to occur non-selectively in all progenitors that undergo active proliferation; abrogating p53 ameliorated the microcephaly but made little improvement to the structure of the mutant brain, which agree well with the wide-spread loss-of-function defects of these genes in many other organs. These previous studies demonstrated the importance of genome maintenance in brain development but did not reveal the brain specific endogenous origins of DNA damage and its underlying molecular mechanisms. In contrast, experimental findings of this study not only identified Nde1 as a key player for brain specific genome maintenance but also highlighted the principal source of DNA damage in brain development. Our data suggest that the strongest demand for genomic surveillance occurs in S phase and at heterochromatic DNA domains when neural progenitors undergo fate restrictive differentiation.</p><p>Heterochromatin constitutes a significant portion of the mammalian genome and is preferentially formed at chromosomal regions with high density of repetitive DNA elements, such as rRNA genes, centromeres, pericentromeres, and telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lander et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grewal and Jia, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Politz et al., 2013</xref>). Compared to the actively transcribed euchromatin, heterochromatin is densely packed and traditionally considered transcriptionally inert. However, heterochromatin is known to produce RNA transcripts necessary for the establishment of heterochromatic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bierhoff et al., 2014</xref>), and these RNA transcripts were preferentially generated during the replication of the heterochromatin in late S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Heterochromatin may not only influence gene expression profiles through regulating the higher-order chromatin structure, the repetitive sequences of heterochromatin are also hotspots for recombination which represent serious challenges to genomic integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Peng and Karpen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almouzni and Probst, 2011</xref>). The proper maintenance of heterochromatin following the replication fork is indispensible for genomic stability by suppressing recombination and somatic mutations. The newly identified Nde1 partners cohesin and SNF2h are both known to participate in heterochromatin formation and function in multiple tissues. Therefore, further delineating the genomic target specifically co-regulated by Nde1and cohesin complex in neural progenitors will provide critical insight into how genomic quality is specifically controlled during neuronal differentiation.</p><p>In addition to the S phase, previous observation has shown that neocortical neurogenesis is governed by the length of G1 phase of the cell cycle (TG1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lange et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pilaz et al., 2009</xref>), which progressively increases over fourfold in mice from E11 to E17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takahashi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miyama et al., 1997</xref>). While the lengthened G1 may permit increased gene expression and protein synthesis required for neurogenesis, another important task of G1 is to determine the timing of DNA replication and ‘license’ the replication origins through loading pre-replication complexes of DNA helicase at various chromosomal domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dimitrova and Gilbert, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gilbert, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nordman and Orr-Weaver, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Renard-Guillet et al., 2014</xref>). In mammalian cells, over 30,000 origins are unutilized in each cell cycle; the spatiotemporal pattern of replication origin activation may depend on, as well as determine, a cell's differentiation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gilbert, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nordman and Orr-Weaver, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rhind and Gilbert, 2013</xref>). As the peak of S phase defect in Nde1 mutants at E12 to E13 overlaps with the developmental period, when Ts is at the top value and TG1 increased most drastically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takahashi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miyama et al., 1997</xref>), it is not unreasonable to speculate that the early phase of neuronal fate determination involves the reprogramming of chromatin state that initiates in G1 and executes in S phases. Thus, cell fate in cortical development may not merely be determined by turning on or off a handful of genes, but rather controlled at the genomic level by a nuclear global alteration of the chromatin state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Multifaceted function of Nde1 protein</title><p>The core Nde1 protein is approximately 40 kDa and comprises an N-terminal extended coiled-coil that shows remarkable evolutionary conservation. However, Nde1 is diverged structurally and functionally from its paralog Ndel1 in mammals outside of the coiled-coil and is primarily expressed in neural progenitors and hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feng et al., 2000</xref>). We have found that the native Nde1 protein in the developing mouse tissue is very insoluble and exists at a relatively low level, but genetic studies have shown that Nde1/NDE1 is an essential player for various pivotal aspects of the neural progenitor biology. It is likely that all native Nde1 molecules are fully occupied through binding to other cellular proteins. The multifaceted function of NDE1 as a molecular scaffold might be fulfilled by post-translational modifications or through undergoing reversible transitions between monomeric and polymeric forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feng and Walsh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Soares et al., 2012</xref>), which facilitate its dynamic partition and reassembly into different molecular complexes. DNA replication is one of the most challenging processes that requires efficient and accurate molecular re-arrangements. During S phase, thousands of replication origins are utilized in a spatiotemporally defined pattern. At each licensed origin, helicase is loaded, replisome is assembled, nucleosomes are disassembled ahead of each replication fork, and resembled onto the two daughter genomes. Meanwhile, multiple histone chaperones, modification enzymes, and numerous chromatin remodelers are recruited to ensure the precise duplication of both the genome and the epigenome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabert and Groth, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Whitehouse and Smith, 2013</xref>). Such a dynamic process requires a protein(s) like NDE1 to serve as a versatile platform to facilitate various protein–protein interactions. Thus, an evolutionarily advanced dynamic scaffold function during heterochromatin replication is consistent with a functional involvement of Nde1 in neural progenitor biology.</p><p>Nde1 has been implicated in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and dynein motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lipka et al., 2013</xref>). However, it is unclear how such regulation could underlie the tissue specific and spatiotemporally dependent phenotype of both human and mouse NDE1/Nde1 mutations nor the DNA replication defects described in this study. Our data suggest that instead Nde1 may be involved in assisting ATP-utilizing chromatin remodeling proteins such as SNF2h to move and reorganize nucleosomes along the DNA strand during heterochromatin replication. Replication forks in Nde1 mutant neural progenitors are paused or stalled at heterochromatic domains composed of centric/pericentric repeats. The integrity of centric/pericentric heterochromatic domains is essential not only for defining the chromatin state but also for the recruitment and the establishment of kinetochore complexes required for mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ishii et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeLuca and Musacchio, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mankouri et al., 2013</xref>). While a direct role of Nde1 in mitotic spindle organization remains plausible, we also believe that the skewed mitosis previously observed in Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> neural progenitors may, at least in part, originate from unresolved centromeric and pericentromeric structural defects arising during S phase. It remains to be further tested whether the mitotic spindle defect observed in Nde1 mutant progenitors is a primary cause for the defective cortical neurogenesis or a consequence of an ill-replicated genome.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Genomic control of cerebral cortical evolution and function</title><p>The selective expression of Nde1 in neural progenitors and cells of hematopoietic lineage implies specific functional requirement of Nde1 in these cells. It is intriguing that the loss of NDE1 impairs the developing CNS much more profoundly than the hematopoietic system and other non-CNS tissues, though NDE1 mutations are associated with leukemogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavazzini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Van der Reijden et al., 2010</xref>). In the developing CNS, the role of NDE1 is more essential in humans than in mice. Patients who lose both functional copies of <italic>NDE1</italic> show severe malformation of many brain structures, but the detectable brain anatomical defect of Nde1<sup>−/−</sup> mice is largely limited to the neocortex and specifically to layer II/III cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feng and Walsh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkuraya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakircioglu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Guven et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Paciorkowski et al., 2013</xref>). While the mild phenotype in many key brain structures, such as the hippocampus, of Nde1 mice may be due to the functional redundancy of Nde1 with Ndel1, the common etiology of NDE1 mutation-induced genotoxicity in both neural and hematopoietic progenitors suggests that NDE1 may be important for establishing the evolutionarily increased cell diversity and function in both brain and blood. The cerebral cortex is the largest organ in terms of both cell number and functional diversity, and cortical layer II/III is expanded exponentially in evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeFelipe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Molnar et al., 2006</xref>). The small and medium-size pyramidal neurons of cortical layer II/III are essential for functional connectivity between two cerebral hemispheres and among various cortical regions; they are essential for evolutionarily advanced higher order brain activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeFelipe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fame et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Greig et al., 2013</xref>). It is evident that even a slight perturbation to these neurons is likely to result in cognitive deficits. Therefore, it is conceivable that advanced novel molecular controls are gained in mammalian evolution to protect the genome of these neurons, although further study is required to elucidate the mechanism underlying such genome maintenance. Our data show that genomic damages during neurogenesis are primarily responsible for the cortical neuronal loss in Nde1 mutant brains. However, depending on the activity of DDRs, genomic damages may not necessarily result in altered brain structure as evidenced by the restored structure and layer II/III neurons in the Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Trp53<sup>−/−</sup> mutant. We believe that these data highlight the importance of genomic control of neuronal functions. Nde1 mutant cells presented an entire array of genotoxic features including DSBs and chromosomal lesions that would ordinarily lead to carcinogenesis. Nonetheless, even the Nde1<sup>−/−</sup>Trp53<sup>−/−</sup> brain, which presumably carries the unresolved genomic lesions to adulthood, was cancer-free. While the absence of brain tumor may be in line with our observation that genotoxicity in Nde1 mutant neural progenitors occurred when they become fate restricted along the path of differentiation towards post-mitotic neurons, it is still interesting to learn whether cortical neurons can truly forgive the genomic lesions they inherit from their precursors. With the advent of comprehensive genome-wide analysis, somatic mutations, especially copy number variants (CNVs) are found to be specifically abundant in human neurons and increasingly linked to neurodevelopmental diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grayton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McConnell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moreno-De-Luca et al., 2013</xref>). The <italic>NDE1</italic> gene is one of the ‘hot spots’ for CNVs at chromosome 16p13.11, of which deletions and duplications have been found to associate with a wide spectrum of developmental brain disorders including intellectual disability, epilepsy, autism, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hebebrand et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gillberg, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sharp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ullmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hannes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heinzen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mefford et al., 2010</xref>). The genomic region span 16p13.11 encodes eight transcripts including MPV17L, C16orf45, KIAA0430, MYH11, C16orf63, ABCC1, and ABCC6 in addition to NDE1. Among these <italic>NDE1</italic> is the only gene that is known to be important for brain formation. Findings described in this study suggest that <italic>NDE1</italic> dosage alteration may result in secondary genomic lesions in cortical neurons. Therefore, even with the lack of neoplastic over-proliferation, brain developmental diseases may have a commonality with cancers as genomic mosaic genomic disorders. Although neurons with altered genome do not become cancerous due to their post-mitotic nature, they can be manifested by functional deficits of the brain in various forms. While further studies are required for delineating the causal relationship between <italic>NDE1</italic> gene dosage and compromised cortical functions, results from this study predict that genomic insults incurred during heterochromatic DNA replication during neural progenitor differentiation may underlie a large variety of developmental neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>The Nde1 and Lis1 knockout mice have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feng and Walsh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pawlisz et al., 2008</xref>).The Trp53 knockout mice (Trp53<sup>tm1Tyj/J</sup>) were obtained from JaxMice (Bar Harbor, ME, stock # 002101).

Do the authors see this gradient in terms of onset of apoptosis in their material? The authors are imprecise in defining for the reader the specific neocortical region (anterior-posterior and medio-lateral) in which the analyses are done. Is this well-controlled from one animal to the next, across embryonic ages?</p><p>2) There is no information on sample sizes for most of the experiments. Additionally, the authors need to include a section in Methods regarding statistical analyses for the different experiments. There needs to be more information on counting methods used; if unbiased stereological methods were not used, then the authors need to justify their choice of method. For example, with regard to counting, what were the total number of layer II-III neurons and were they diminished both in relation to other cell types as well as to controls?</p><p>3) Was double labeling of nuclei with the different markers in brain sections was confirmed by z-stacking of the sections?</p><p>4) Based on Caviness et al, it appears that cell cycle 3-5 in the neurogenetic gradient in neocortex exhibits the greatest degree of DNA replication-associated damage. Why is this? Their conclusion is that this is the time (e11.5-13.5) of fate restriction for superficial cells. This corresponds to the TG1 middle phase, when G1 increases from ∼3 to ∼11 hr. Could this be the time of greatest vulnerability, as this is the time when protein synthesis and accumulation in G1 may govern cell fate decisions? The authors should incorporate a more thoughtful discussion of quantitative neuronogenesis concepts, which may allow them to build a testable model.</p><p>5) The hippocampus, a cortical structure, is normal in Nde1-/- mice. Any explanation for this?</p><p>6) The brains of Nde1 mutants appear to be globally smaller. If this is the case, and brain size limitations are not confined to the cortex, then the authors should discuss this as it relates to their hypotheses.</p><p>7) Nde1 is clearly not required for fate decisions – elimination of cell death via p53 is sufficient to restore normal cortical development. Really interesting, and should be emphasized. The authors point out in additional experiments that p53 elimination does not correct the genomic disruption caused by Nde1 deletion, yet prevents the disruption of production of layer 2-3 neurons. It's never really discussed well, the mechanism through which this might occur.</p><p>8) γH2AX double-labeling with 30 minute pulse-labeled progenitors should be quantified to get a sense of overlap, rather than relying just on staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This is a valid criticism also for the B44/BU1/75 triple labeling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Authors note 'many cells were co-stained with γH2AX', but that is not accurate based on the images, in which there 6-8 co-labeled cells out of hundreds in the image.</p><p>9) The general model put forth implies that there is a greater level of aneuploidy in the adult cortex of double P53/Nde1 mutants. In situ aneuploidy staining methods are available and not difficult to employ. This data would be very helpful for improving the completeness of the manuscript.</p><p>10) Granted that Nde1's impact is fate and time-restricted, in contrast to other proteins (as noted in the Discussion), but the authors don't know the origins of this specificity. That is a shortfall of the study, but not fatal for impacting the importance of the study. However, to describe Nde1 as a 'guardian' of the brain genome is both overzealous and inaccurate. Such language needs to be toned down, to reflect or more limited understanding, based on the data presented here, of Nde1 in protecting against genome instability during a particular part of the cell cycle in a limited number of progenitor cells.</p><p>[Editors' note: further clarifications were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “The scaffold protein Nde1 safeguards the brain genome during S phase of early neural progenitor differentiation” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. The manuscript has been improved but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In the original decision letter, we noted that you did not use unbiased stereological counting; we asked you to justify not using this, but you did not. The counting method, given that you are expressing data as a ratio (percentage) of double-labeled cells, is reasonable. However, you do not specify the area dimensions of the regions counted. This is important, because the brain sizes are not the same. In addition, you did not use appropriate statistics. For example, the brain weight data has 8 genotype categories. You need to do an ANOVA to show a genotype affect before doing a post-hoc test to show which genotype. Individual t-test is not appropriate for your data. The same issue needs to be addressed for the double labeling studies in 3E and 3F. You have 3 genotypes, and thus, you need to report your analysis using ANOVA and then a post-hoc test for specific genotype effects.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03297.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) At e12.5, there is a transverse neurogenetic gradient (Caviness et al TINS, 2009).

Therefore, all immunohistological analysis in the study was performed with spatially matched brain sections among littermates. To formally address the question from the reviewer and present a more informative picture to readers, we serially sectioned and analyzed brains from 6 more Nde1-/- embryos. These new data which encompass the entire TNG are included in the in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Figure 1–figure supplement as well as their associated text. They should better demonstrate the correlation of DNA damage and apoptosis with the TNG between E12 and E13.</p><p><italic>2) There is no information on sample sizes for most of the experiments.

All data from embryonic studies were obtained from at least 3 independent litters. The Nde1-p53 adult brain structure analysis was performed with 5 sets of age and genetic background matched mice. A more detailed description of these analyses and statistical methods has been added to the experimental methods section. We also included quantitative analysis of layer II/III neurons to the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to show their specific reduction in Nde1-/- brain in relation to other neurons and their full restoration in Nde1-/-p53-/-mice.</p><p><italic>3) Was double labeling of nuclei with the different markers in brain sections was confirmed by z-stacking of the sections?</italic></p><p>All double /triple immunofluorescence stained tissue sections were co-stained with Hoechst 33342 to visualize nuclear DNA, thin sections (5 u or 12 u) were used, and images taken at different fluorescent channels were from the same focal-plane to assure that the correct cell was counted only once. We have noted this in the revised Methods section.</p><p><italic>4) Based on Caviness et al, it appears that cell cycle 3-5 in the neurogenetic gradient in neocortex exhibits the greatest degree of DNA replication-associated damage.

The authors should incorporate a more thoughtful discussion of quantitative neuronogenesis concepts, which may allow them to build a testable model</italic>.</p><p>This excellent suggestion has been well received. As we indicated in the revised Discussion, we think that in addition to protein synthesis, increased TG1 may also relate to properly establishing the DNA replication pattern and chromatin state required for neural differentiation. This hypothesis explains our observation that the genome is more vulnerable during neuronal differentiation.</p><p><italic>5) The hippocampus, a cortical structure, is normal in Nde1-/- mice. Any explanation for this?</italic></p><p>As discussed in the revised manuscript, we think this is either due to the redundancy of Nde1 with Ndel1 or due to the evolutionarily advanced requirement or function of Nde1in genome maintenance since the neocortex, especially layer II/III, is evolutionarily novel, whereas the hippocampus is relatively less evolved from low to high vertebrates.</p><p><italic>6) The brains of Nde1 mutants appear to be globally smaller. If this is the case, and brain size limitations are not confined to the cortex, then the authors should discuss this as it relates to their hypotheses</italic>.</p><p>The brain of Nde1homozygous mice is significantly smaller in the neocortex, but NDE1 homozygous mutation results in the severe reduction of many other brain structures in addition to the cortex. We believe this is in line with a more indispensable role of human NDE1 in more complex structures formed though evolution and we have addressed this in the revised Discussion.</p><p><italic>7) Nde1 is clearly not required for fate decisions</italic> – <italic>elimination of cell death via p53 is sufficient to restore normal cortical development. Really interesting, and should be emphasized. The authors point out in additional experiments that p53 elimination does not correct the genomic disruption caused by Nde1 deletion, yet prevents the disruption of production of layer 2-3 neurons. It's never really discussed well, the mechanism through which this might occur</italic>.</p><p>Whether Nde1 is required for fate decision is dependent on the definition of “fate”. This study suggests that neuronal fate is not merely determined by the expression of a few markers, such as Cux1. Instead, we think the fate of cortical neurons should be further defined by many other fine characteristics including genomic signatures and chromatin states, although these fine characteristics need to be further elucidated in future studies. It is conceivable that restored Cux1+ neurons in the Nde1-/-p53-/- cortices may have functional deficits due to unrepaired genomic damage; they may have a different “fate” in terms of the genome or chromatin state. We believe further investigation of the function and refined cell biology features of these mutant neurons will shed light on a more advanced definition of cortical neuronal fate identities.</p><p><italic>8) γH2AX double-labeling with 30 minute pulse-labeled progenitors should be quantified to get a sense of overlap, rather than relying just on staining (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>). This is a valid criticism also for the B44/BU1/75 triple labeling in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>. Authors note 'many cells were co-stained with γH2AX', but that is not accurate based on the images, in which there 6-8 co-labeled cells out of hundreds in the image</italic>.</p><p>Quantifications of γH2AX in both BrdU transiently labeled (active S phase) and IdU+BrdU-(stalled S phase) have been added to the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and the text of the revised manuscript. We hope this explains that γH2AX-BrdU transiently co-labeled cells indicate conceptually that DNA damage can occur in concurrence with DNA replication. However, DNA damage indicated by γH2AX is more frequently associated with stalled and defective S phase as indicated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and the revised text.</p><p><italic>9) The general model put forth implies that there is a greater level of aneuploidy in the adult cortex of double P53/Nde1 mutants. In situ aneuploidy staining methods are available and not difficult to employ. This data would be very helpful for improving the completeness of the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We are very thankful for this constructive suggestion. Showing genomic damage in Nde1-p53 double mutant brains directly has been one of our major efforts during this study. Several attempts have been made including a genome-wide study to identify aneuploidy and other chromosomal aberrations from adult cortical neurons using array-CGH. However, the presence of aneuploidy in wild type progenitors /neurons as well as the high heterogeneity of cortical cells and somatic mutations in Nde1 and Nde1-p53 brains prevented us from identifying consensus mutations. Although FISH can also be used to demonstrate aneuploidy, it requires sequence or chromosome specific DNA probes. Due to the random nature of somatic mutations and the putative involvement of heterochromatic repetitive sequences in the Nde1-p53 double mutant brain, it would be hard to pinpoint specific mutations and reach a statistically significant consensus conclusion with individual or a limited number of FISH probes. Therefore, we showed as clearly as was possible that both Nde1-/- and Nde1-/-;P53-/- progenitors experienced increased cell cycle and genomic stress through S phase, G2, and DDR analyses, and in particular, the increased degradation of Cdc25A (showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) is a hallmark of persistent genomic stress.</p><p><italic>10) Granted that Nde1's impact is fate and time-restricted, in contrast to other proteins (as noted in the Discussion), but the authors don't know the origins of this specificity. That is a shortfall of the study, but not fatal for impacting the importance of the study. However, to describe Nde1 as a 'guardian' of the brain genome is both overzealous and inaccurate. Such language needs to be toned down, to reflect or more limited understanding, based on the data presented here, of Nde1 in protecting against genome instability during a particular part of the cell cycle in a limited number of progenitor cells</italic>.</p><p>We have eliminated “guardian” and other words which may not be accurately used in the text. However, it is clear that Nde1 deficiency results in genomic damage in the brain. The tissue, cell type and developmental specificity of the phenotype suggest a mechanism specific to evolutionarily advanced complex tissue with high cell diversity. We believe the study provides a new entry point, rather than conclusion, for further investigating the neuronal fate control at the genomic level.</p><p>[Editors' note: further clarifications were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>In the original decision letter, we noted that you did not use unbiased stereological counting; we asked you to justify not using this, but you did not. The counting method, given that you are expressing data as a ratio (percentage) of double-labeled cells, is reasonable. However, you do not specify the area dimensions of the regions counted. This is important, because the brain sizes are not the same. In addition, you did not use appropriate statistics. For example, the brain weight data has 8 genotype categories. You need to do an ANOVA to show a genotype affect before doing a post-hoc test to show which genotype. Individual t-test is not appropriate for your data. The same issue needs to be addressed for the double labeling studies in 3E and 3F. You have 3 genotypes, and thus, you need to report your analysis using ANOVA and then a post-hoc test for specific genotype effects</italic>.</p><p>Thank you very much for your continued effort to make this a better paper. I am sorry that we did not explain the reason for not using unbiased stereological counting. The cerebral cortex is a well-organized and laminated structure in both embryonic and adult brains, yet its cellular organization is spatially dependent and varies in different brain regions. We felt that more accurate counts for both embryonic ventricular zone progenitors and postnatal cortical neurons may be obtained from spatially well-matched brain sections than unbiased random cell samplings, and we tried to match the tissue sections among different genotypes or individual brains using structures not altered by Nde1 mutation as landmarks. These details, including areas selected for cell counting and their dimension, are now added to the experimental method.</p><p>We very much appreciate your correction on our method of statistical analysis. We have reassessed statistical significance of all data from multiple genotype categories using ANOVA followed by post-hoc pairwise comparisons. The revised statistical analysis and results are included in the Methods and figure legends.</p></body></sub-article></article>
