through coincidence detection, signal amplification, and additional logic operations such as XOR. Supralinear dendritic integration has been documented extensively in principal neurons, mediated by several voltage-dependent conductances. It has also been reported in parvalbumin-positive hippocampal basket cells, in dendrites innervated by feedback excitatory synapses. Whether other interneurons, which support feed-forward or feedback inhibition of principal neuron dendrites, also exhibit local non-linear integration of synaptic excitation is not known. Here, we use patch-clamp electrophysiology, and two-photon calcium imaging and glutamate uncaging, to show that supralinear dendritic integration of near-synchronous spatially clustered glutamate-receptor mediated depolarization occurs in NDNF-positive neurogliaform cells and oriens-lacunosum moleculare interneurons in the mouse hippocampus. Supralinear summation was detected via recordings of somatic depolarizations elicited by uncaging of glutamate on dendritic fragments, and, in neurogliaform cells, by concurrent imaging of dendritic calcium transients. Supralinearity was abolished by blocking NMDA receptors (NMDARs) but resisted blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. Blocking L-type calcium channels abolished supralinear calcium signalling but only had a minor effect on voltage supralinearity. Dendritic boosting of spatially clustered synaptic signals argues for previously unappreciated computational complexity in dendrite-projecting inhibitory cells of the hippocampus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Brain</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>interneuron</kwd><kwd>dendrite</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/212285</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kullmann</surname><given-names>Dimitri Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/V013556/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kullmann</surname><given-names>Dimitri Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/V034758/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kullmann</surname><given-names>Dimitri Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000324</institution-id><institution>Gatsby Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GAT3955</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kullmann</surname><given-names>Dimitri Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.For the purpose of Open Access, the authors have applied a CC BY public copyright license to any Author Accepted Manuscript version arising from this submission.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NMDA receptors mediate prominent supralinear summation of clustered excitatory inputs to the dendrites of neurogliaform and oriens-lacunosum moleculare interneurons of the hippocampus, showing that these cells perform sub-cellular computations.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accumulating evidence indicates that dendrites do more than merely summate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Makarov et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mikulasch et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Poirazi and Papoutsi, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Larkum et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stuart and Spruston, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2015</xref>). Dendrites endow neurons with increased computational capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lorenzo et al., 2022</xref>) and the ability to act as multi-level hierarchical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ujfalussy et al., 2018</xref>) or even to reproduce some features of artificial and deep neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beniaguev et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wybo et al., 2023</xref>). The underlying mechanisms include extensive dendritic arborisation, compartmentalisation, synaptic plasticity and expression of specific receptors and ion channels that in turn facilitate nonlinear input summation. Nonlinear dendritic integration of excitatory inputs in particular can potentially support signal amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Poleg-Polsky, 2019</xref>), coincidence detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leugering et al., 2023</xref>), XOR logic gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gidon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">MagÃ³ et al., 2021</xref>), and computing prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mikulasch et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wybo et al., 2023</xref>). One striking example of non-linear integration is local supralinear summation of signals that arrive at a dendritic fragment in a narrow time window, a phenomenon that can be investigated by exploiting the spatial and temporal precision of somatic depolarizations elicited by multi-photon glutamate uncaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cornford et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Katona et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Masala et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiovini et al., 2014</xref>).

Closely related to voltage supralinearity is the occurrence of dendritic calcium transients which can be detected with calcium-sensitive fluorescent indicators. Such calcium transients are implicated in synaptic plasticity and result not only from influx via voltage-dependent channels but also release from intracellular stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">CamirÃ© et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">CamirÃ© and Topolnik, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harvey and Collingridge, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Padamsey et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Inhibitory interneurons have a crucial role in brain circuit and network excitability, rhythmicity, and computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Freund and BuzsÃ¡ki, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">HertÃ¤g and Sprekeler, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tzilivaki et al., 2023</xref>). However, in comparison with principal cells, relatively little is known about non-linear dendritic integration in interneurons. Early evidence for NMDAR-dependent supralinear summation of EPSPs, and dendritic calcium transients, in hippocampal CA1 interneurons was not accompanied by molecular or genetic markers of interneuron type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Katona et al., 2011</xref>). Subsequent studies in parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons reported supralinearly summating EPSPs and dendritic calcium transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiovini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">CamirÃ© et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">CamirÃ© and Topolnik, 2014</xref>). Using multiphoton glutamate uncaging for increased spatial precision, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cornford et al., 2019</xref> also showed evidence for NMDAR-dependent supralinear EPSP summation in PV+ basket cells, although this was only seen in dendrites receiving feedback excitation in stratum oriens and not in dendrites receiving feed-forward excitation in stratum radiatum. Failure to detect supralinear summation in stratum radiatum dendrites of PV+ interneurons is consistent with evidence from dendritic recordings that somatic action potentials attenuate rapidly as they back-propagate, and that PV+ dendrites express abundant Kv3 family potassium channels and relatively few sodium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu and Vervaeke, 2018</xref>). Indeed, compartmental modelling has been used to infer that synaptic inputs to PV+ interneuron dendrites summate sublinearly, and that this helps to ensure that they do not disrupt population spike synchrony during gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kriener et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast to the evidence for both supra- and sublinear summation in PV+ interneurons (likely to occur simultaneously in different dendrites) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cornford et al., 2019</xref>), it remains unknown how synaptic inputs are integrated in other forebrain interneurons. As for other brain regions, cerebellar cortex stellate cells have been shown to exhibit sublinear summation of uncaging-evoked EPSPs whilst simultaneously exhibiting supralinear summation of dendritic calcium transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Dysfunction of interneurons generally has been associated with a variety of psychiatric and neurological pathologies, including epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dinocourt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fujiwara-Tsukamoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Magloire et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marx et al., 2013</xref>), schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belforte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jahangir et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">MarÃ­n, 2012</xref>), autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">MarÃ­n, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lunden et al., 2019</xref>), and Alzheimerâs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hijazi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Verret et al., 2012</xref>), among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>). There is emerging evidence suggesting that impairments in dendritic integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Masala et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mitchell et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griesius et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nelson and Bender, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Palmer, 2014</xref>), and specifically in interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Masala et al., 2023</xref>), may be important contributors to pathological phenotypes in psychiatric and neurological pathologies. We therefore set out to characterize dendritic integration in two types of interneurons innervating the distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons: PV-negative neurogliaform interneurons, which support feed-forward inhibition, and oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) cells, which additionally mediate feedback inhibition. Although their cell bodies reside in different layers, and their developmental origin and intrinsic properties are strikingly different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asgarian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Booker and Wyllie, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sik et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chittajallu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Price et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tricoire et al., 2010</xref>), their axons innervate the same targets, the apical tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the SLM. Neurogliaform cells receive inputs from the entorhinal cortex and the nucleus reuniens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chittajallu et al., 2017</xref>), with distinct plasticity rules at synapses made by these afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mercier et al., 2022</xref>), and a subset can be identified in stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) using knock-in mice expressing cre recombinase at the neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (<italic>Ndnf</italic>) locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chittajallu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tricoire et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mercier et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Booker and Vida, 2018</xref>). OLM cells, in contrast, have their cell bodies and dendrites in stratum oriens, are excited by axon collaterals of both CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, and can be identified using mice expressing cre at the somatostatin locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We quantified non-linear dendritic summation using two-photon glutamate uncaging at multiple locations within a small dendritic fragment, by comparing the arithmetic sum of the uncaging-evoked EPSPs evoked individually to the result of near-synchronous glutamate uncaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cornford et al., 2019</xref>). We asked if neurogliaform and OLM interneurons exhibit non-linear summation and whether this depends on NMDARs or sodium or calcium channels. In parallel, we asked if non-linear summation could also be detected in these cell types by concurrent measurement of dendritic calcium-dependent fluorescence transients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Supralinear dendritic integration in a representative neurogliaform interneuron</title><p>NDNF-positive (NDNF+) neurogliaform interneurons were studied in the hippocampal CA1 stratum lacunosum/moleculare in acute slices from <italic>Ndnf<sup>cre</sup></italic> or <italic>Ndnf<sup>cre/cre</sup></italic> mice injected with AAV2/9-mDLX-FLEX-mCherry virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In order to probe the spatiotemporal dynamics of dendritic integration, glutamate was locally delivered by 2-photon uncaging of bath-perfused MNI-glutamate (3 mM) using an infrared (720 nm) pulsed laser at points along dendrites, whilst recording from their somata with a patch pipette. The absence of dendritic spines prevented identification of the sites of excitatory synapses, and the uncaging locations were therefore spaced 1â2 Âµm apart, either side of the selected dendritic fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cornford et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The locations were kept within a dendritic length of ~15 Î¼m, consistent with the size of interneuron dendritic domains exhibiting correlated tuning of synaptic calcium transients in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).

The number of uncaging stimuli at neighbouring locations was cumulatively increased from 1 to 12 in the near-synchronous condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

When neurogliaform and OLM data obtained in TTX were grouped together with the data without blockers, the supralinearity for voltage integral in OLM interneurons was significantly smaller than that in neurogliaform cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8p</xref>). Among possible explanations is that the local dendritic impedance is greater in neurogliaform cells, lowering the threshold for recruitment of regenerative currents. Consistent with such a pattern, the local dendrite diameter of neurogliaform interneurons was significantly lower than that of OLM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8q</xref>). A morphological difference may thus contribute to the smaller voltage and calcium supralinearities in OLM than neurogliaform cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main results of the present study are that both hippocampal neurogliaform interneurons and OLM cells exhibit robust NMDAR-dependent supralinear integration of dendritic uEPSPs recorded at the soma. Supralinear NMDAR-dependent integration was also observed by measuring dendritic calcium fluorescence transients in neurogliaform cells, which were sensitive to blockade of L-type calcium channels or depletion of intracellular stores. However, near-synchronous glutamate uncaging that was sufficient to elicit NMDAR-dependent boosting of uEPSPs failed to recruit detectable dendritic calcium transients in OLM cells. In contrast to principal neurons, we observed no role for voltage-gated sodium channels in dendritic integration of uEPSPs in either cell type.</p><p>Taken together, the data are consistent with a model where clustered synaptic receptor activation leads to relief of voltage-dependent block of dendritic NMDARs by magnesium ions, accounting for supralinear summation of uEPSPs recorded at the soma. In neurogliaform cells (although apparently not in OLM cells) L-type voltage-gated calcium channels are also recruited by the local depolarization, and together with calcium influx via NMDARs, the resulting local elevation of intracellular calcium triggers further release from intracellular stores, thereby amplifying the dendritic calcium concentration transient. This account of the signalling cascade underlying local calcium signalling does not exclude additional roles for metabotropic glutamate receptors and calcium influx via rectifying calcium-permeable glutamate receptors, which have been implicated in dendritic calcium transients in oriens interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">CamirÃ© and Topolnik, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The dependence of supralinear dendritic summation on NMDARs but not voltage-gated sodium channels is reminiscent to the pattern observed at dendrites of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in stratum oriens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cornford et al., 2019</xref>). NMDARs have previously been implicated in synaptic signalling in neurogliaform cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chittajallu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Price et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong et al., 2011</xref>) and also contribute to long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mercier et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, the ratio of NMDAR- to AMPAR-mediated signalling at glutamatergic synapses on neurogliaform cells has been shown to be higher than in other hippocampal interneuron subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chittajallu et al., 2017</xref>). This feature may explain why NMDAR-mediated supralinear integration is especially prominent in neurogliaform cells, although a further contribution may come from their unusually thin and short dendrites, which would be expected to represent a high impedance, thus facilitating their depolarization by glutamate receptor activation.</p><p>OLM cells exhibited several differences in comparison with neurogliaform cells. First, supralinear voltage integration was smaller. Second, blockade of NMDARs led to linear, as opposed to sublinear summation of uEPSPs. And third, uEPSPs evoked by glutamate uncaging, whether asynchronous or near-synchronous, were subthreshold for robust dendritic calcium transients. These differences can be explained by a relatively lower expression of NMDARs and/or lower dendritic impedance as expected from larger dendritic diameter and length. Indeed, we confirmed that the dendritic diameter at the uncaging locations was larger in OLM than neurogliaform cells. A further morphological difference is that the dendrites of OLM cells are equipped with sparse thin spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martina et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maccaferri et al., 2000</xref>), although we did not visualize them. The density of both spines and NMDA receptors have also been reported to differ with distance from the soma in the dendrites of OLM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gramuntell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guirado et al., 2014</xref>). Whilst we saw no evidence suggesting sodium-channel-dependent supralinear voltage integration in OLM cells, OLM cells have been reported to boost dendritic signals via active sodium conductances when increasing amounts of current were injected into the dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martina et al., 2000</xref>). This difference may be due to the uncaging stimulation protocol remaining subthreshold for the initiation of sodium-channel-dependent boosting, as current injection seemed to remain linear until EPSPs became greater than ~20 mV in amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martina et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The present study highlights the ability of both neurogliaform and OLM neurons to perform local computations upstream of the site of axonal action potential initiation. The adaptive significance of this phenomenon remains to be determined. In principal neurons, synaptic inputs converging to common dendritic domains have been shown to exhibit correlated activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iacaruso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>).

The dendritic nonlinearities uncovered by the present study, together with different forms of synaptic plasticity described in interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kullmann et al., 2012</xref>), are a candidate mechanism to achieve such an organization of information processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and husbandry</title><p>Adult male and female mice of varying ages were throughout the study (ages 1â3 months).

This was performed by normalising the asynchronous (separate responses) measurements from 0 to 1 using the following equation:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where x is the input array, and z<sub>i</sub> is the normalised output element.</p><p>The near-synchronous responses were scaled using the same formula and the minima and maxima from the corresponding asynchronous (separate responses) conditions.</p><p>Traces including action potentials were excluded from analysis. Asynchronous separate uEPSPs were staggered by 0.82ms for arithmetic summation to replicate the near-synchronous uncaging condition. Voltage and calcium traces were filtered using a Savitzky-Golay filter. Uncaging light artefacts were removed from linescans. Due to the substantial variability in responses across dendrites, dendrites were used as the experimental unit. The numbers of dendrites, cells, and animals are reported in figure legends. <italic>Î±</italic>â=â0.05 was applied for all statistical tests. The t and p values are presented in the figure legends and discussed in the text, as appropriate. Estimation statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Claridge-Chang and Assam, 2016</xref>) and the generation of slopegraphs and Gardner-Altman estimation plots were performed using code provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ho et al., 2019</xref>. The slopegraphs indicate the difference in nonlinearity between asynchronous (separate responses) and the near-synchronous conditions or the differences in nonlinearity between pre- and post-drug administration. The adjacent paired mean difference plots are the group summaries. 95% confidence intervals of the mean difference were calculated by bootstrap resampling with 5000 resamples. The confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated. p Values are provided with estimation statistics for legacy purposes only. Data were processed using custom Python code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gohlke, 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garcia et al., 2014</xref>), Microsoft Excel, and WinWCP 5.5.6 (John Dempster, University of Strathclyde). Figures were created using custom Python code, Microsoft PowerPoint, Procreate, ImageJ.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Research was conducted in accordance with the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 Amendment Regulations (SI 2012/3039) under PPL: PP3944290.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-100268-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Electrophysiology and calcium fluorescence data for Figures 1-8 together with uncaging distances, dendrite orders and dendrite diameters, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5522/04/28143356.v2">https://doi.org/10.5522/04/28143356.v2</ext-link> under the Creative Commons CC0 licence.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Griesius</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kullmann</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2025">2025</year><data-title>Supralinear dendritic integration in murine dendrite-targeting interneurons: voltage and calcium fluorescence nonlinearities in response to near-synchronous 2-photon glutamate uncaging</data-title><source>UCL Research Data Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5522/04/28143356.v2</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Jonathan Cornford, Vincent Magloire, Kaiyu Zheng and other members of the Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy for help and advice.

The authors nicely show that temporal summation in dendrites of NDNF-INs is to a certain extent non-linear. Pharmacology with AP5 hints towards contribution of NMDA receptors. However, the authors report that the non-linearity in not significantly dependent on EPSP amplitude (Fig. S2), which should be the case if NMDA-receptors are involved. Unfortunately, there are no voltage-clamp data showing NMDA and AMPA currents, potentially providing a mechanistic explanation for the non-linear summation.</p><p>(2) Recovery of drug effect. Pharmacological application of AP5 is the only argument for the involvement of NMDA receptors. However, as long-lasting experiments were apparently difficult to obtain, there is no washout-data presented - only drug effect versus baseline. For all the other drugs (TTX, Nimodipine, CPA) recordings were even shorter, lacking a baseline recording. Thus, it remains open to what extent the AP5-effect might be affected by rundown of receptors or channels during whole-cell recordings or beginning phototoxicity.</p><p>(3) Nonlinear EPSP summation in OLM-IN. The authors do similar experiments in dendrite-targeting OLM-INs and show that the non-linear summation is smaller than in NDNF cells. The reason for this remains unclear. The diameter of proximal dendrites in OLM cells is larger than the diameter in NDNF cells. However, there is probably also an important role of synapse density and glutamate receptor density, which was shown to be very low in proximal dendrites of OLM cells and strongly increase with distance (Guirado et al. 2014, Cerebral Cortex 24:3014-24, Gramuntell et al. 2021, Front Aging Neurosci 13:782737). Therefore, it would have been helpful to see experiments quantifying synapse density (counting spines, PSD95-puncta, ...) and show how this density compares with non-linearity in the analyzed NDNF and OLM dendrites.</p><p>(4) NMDA in OLM-IN. Similar to the NDNF cells, the authors argue for an involvement of NMDA receptors in OLM cells, based on bath-application of AP5 (Fig. 8). Again, there seems to be no significant dependence on EPSP amplitude (Fig. S3). Even more remarkable, the authors claim that there is no dendritic calcium increase after activation of NMDA receptors without showing data. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the calcium signals are just below detection threshold, or whether the non-linearity depends on other calcium-impermeable channels and receptors. To understand this phenomenon different calcium sensors, different Ca2+/Mg2+ concentrations or voltage-clamp data would have helped.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100268.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Griesius</surname><given-names>Simonas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Leicester</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Leicester</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kullmann</surname><given-names>Dimitri Michael</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Griesius et al. addresses the dendritic integration of synaptic input in cortical GABAergic interneurons (INs). Dendritic properties, passive and active, of principal cells have been extensively characterized, but much less is known about the dendrites of INs. The limited information is particularly relevant in view of the high morphological and physiological diversity of IN types. The few studies that investigated IN dendrites focused on parvalbumin-expressing INs. In fact, in a previous study, the authors examined dendritic properties of PV INs, and found supralinear dendritic integration in basal, but not in apical dendrites (Cornford et al., 2019 eLife).</p><p>In the present study, complementary to the prior work, the authors investigate whether dendrite-targeting IN types, NDNF-expressing neurogliaform cells, and somatostatin(SOM)-expressing O-LM neurons, display similar active integrative properties by combining clustered glutamate-uncaging and pharmacological manipulations with electrophysiological recording and calcium imaging from genetically identified IN types in mouse acute hippocampal slices.</p><p>The main findings are that NDNF IN dendrites show strong supralinear summation of spatially- and temporally-clustered EPSPs, which is changed into sublinear behavior by bath application of NMDA receptor antagonists, but not by Na+-channel blockers. L-type calcium channel blockers abolished the supralinear behavior associated calcium transients but had no or only weak effect on EPSP summation. SOM IN dendrites showed similar, albeit weaker NMDA-dependent supralinear summation, but no supralinear calcium transients were detected in these INs. In summary, the study demonstrates that different IN types are endowed with active dendritic integrative mechanisms, but show qualitative and quantitative divergence in these mechanisms.</p><p>While the research is conceptionally not novel, it constitutes an important incremental gain in our understanding of the functional diversity of GABAergic INs. In view of the central roles of IN types in network dynamics and information processing in the cortex, results and conclusions are of interest to the broader neuroscience community.</p><p>The experiments are well designed, and closely follow the approach from the previous publication in parts, enabling direct comparison of the results obtained from the different IN types.

Indeed, the degree to which clustered inputs belonging to a functional neuronal assembly occur on interneuron dendrites is an open question. However, Chen et al (2013, Nature 499:295-300) reported that dendritic domains of PV-positive interneurons in visual cortex, unlike their somata, exhibit calcium transients in vivo which are highly tuned to stimulus orientation. This suggests that clustered inputs to dendritic segments may well belong to functional assemblies, much as in principal cells (e.g. Wilson et al, 2016, Nature Neuroscience 19:1003â1009; Iacaruso et al, 2017, Nature 547;449â452). In our earlier work reporting NMDAR-dependent supralinear summation of glutamate uncaging-evoked responses at a subset of dendrites on PV-positive interneurons, we demonstrated how this arrangement in an oscillating feedback circuit could be exploited to stabilise neuronal assemblies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors study the temporal summation of caged EPSPs in dendrite-targeting hippocampal CA1 interneurons.

The authors nicely show that temporal summation in dendrites of NDNF-INs is to a certain extent non-linear. However, this non-linearity varies massively from cell to cell (or dendrite to dendrite) from 0% up to 400% (Figure S2). The reason for this variability is totally unclear. Pharmacology with AP5 hints towards a contribution of NMDA receptors. However, the authors claim that the non-linearity is not dependent on EPSP amplitude (Figure S2), which should be the case if NMDA-receptors are involved. Unfortunately, there are no voltage-clamp data of NMDA currents similar to the previous study. This would help to see whether NMDA-receptor contribution varies from synapse to synapse to generate the observed variability? Furthermore, the NMDA- and AMPA-currents would help to compare NDNF with the previously characterized PV cells and would help to contribute to our understanding of interneuron function.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful comments.</p><p>We did not actually claim that EPSP amplitude has no role in determining the magnitude of non-linearity: âAmong possible sources of variability for voltage supralinearity, we did not observe a systematic dependence on the average amplitude of individual uEPSPs [â¦] (Fig. S2)â. Whilst we fully agree that, at first sight, a positive dependence of supralinearity on uEPSP amplitude might be expected simply from the voltage-dependent kinetics of NMDARs, there are two main reasons why this could have been obscured. First, the expected relationship is non-monotonic, because with large local depolarizations the driving force collapses, as seen in the overall sigmoid shape of the average relationship between the scaled observed response and arithmetic sum (e.g. Figs 2a &amp; c; 4c &amp; e). Therefore, we would arguably expect a parabolic relationship rather than a simple positive slope relating the degree of supralinearity to the average amplitude of individual uEPSPs. Second, given that the uncaging distance varied substantially, the average amplitudes of the individual uEPSPs recorded at the soma would have undergone different degrees of electrotonic attenuation and further distortion by active conductances before they were measured. Ultimately, the plots in Fig. S2 show too much scatter to be able to exclude a positive or parabolic relationship of nonlinearity to uEPSP amplitude. To avoid misunderstanding, we have changed the sentence in the Results that refers to Fig. S2 to: âAmong possible sources of variability for voltage supralinearity, we did not observe a significant monotonic dependence on the average amplitude of individual uEPSPs, distance from the uncaging location along the dendrite to the soma, [or] the dendrite order (Fig. S2)â.</p><p>As for the relative contributions of NMDARs and AMPARs, voltage clamp recordings from both neurogliaform and OLM interneurons have already been reported, with the conclusion that neurogliaform cells exhibit relatively larger NMDAR-mediated currents (e.g. Chittajallu et al. 2017; Booker et al. 2021; Mercier et al. 2022), entirely in keeping with the conclusions of our study. Repeating these measurements would add little to the study. Furthermore, because the mean baseline uEPSP amplitude was &lt;0.5 mV (Fig S2), it would be difficult to obtain reliable meaurements of isolated NMDAR-mediated uEPSCs.</p><p>Turning to the high variability of supralinearity, indeed, the 95% confidence interval for the data in Fig. 2d is 73%, 213%. This degree of variability is consistent with the wide range of NMDAR/AMPAR ratios reported by Chittajallu et al. 2017 (their Fig. 1g), compounded by the expected non-monotonic relationship alluded to above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Sublinear summation in NDNF-INs. In the presence of AP5, the temporal summation of caged EPSPs is sublinear. That is potentially interesting. The authors claim that this might be dependent on the diameter of dendrites. Many voltage-gated channels can mediate such things as well. To conclude the contribution of dendritic diameter, it would be helpful to at least plot the extent of sublinearity in single NDNF dendrites versus the dendritic diameter. Otherwise, this statement should be deleted.</p></disp-quote><p>We have plotted the degree of nonlinearity against dendritic diameter for neurogliaform cells (under baseline conditions and in D-AP5) in Fig S2h-k. We did not observe any significant linear correlations, other than between amplitude nonlinearity and dendrite diameter post D-AP5. This does not negate the possibility that the significant difference in average dendritic diameters between neurogliaform and OLM cells contributes to differences in impedance (which we have rephrased as âAmong possible explanations is that the local dendritic impedance is greater in neurogliaform cells, lowering the threshold for recruitment of regenerative currentsâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Nonlinear EPSP summation in OLM-IN. The authors do similar experiments in dendrite-targeting OLM-INs and show that the non-linear summation is smaller than in NDNF cells. The reason for this remains unclear. The authors claim that this is due to the larger dendritic diameter in OLM cells. However, there is no analysis. The minimum would be to correlate non-linearity with dendritic diameter in OLM-cells. Very likely there is an important role of synapse density and glutamate receptor density, which was shown to be very low in proximal dendrites of OLM cells and strongly increase with distance (Guirado et al. 2014, Cerebral Cortex 24:3014-24, Gramuntell et al. 2021, Front Aging Neurosci 13:782737). Therefore, the authors should perform a set of experiments in more distal dendrites of OLM cells with diameters similar to the diameters of the NDNF cells. Even better would be if the authors would quantify synapse density by counting spines and show how this density compares with non-linearity in the analyzed NDNF and OLM dendrites.</p></disp-quote><p>The difference in average dendritic diameters between OLM and neurogliaform cells is highly significant (Fig. 8q, P&lt;0.001). We do not claim that dendritic diameter (and by implication local impedance) is the only determinant of the degree of non-linearity. The suggestion that a gradient of glutamate receptor density contributes is interesting. However, the results of uncaging experiments targeting more distal OLM dendrites of similar diameter as neurogliaform dendrites would be subject to numerous confounds, not least the very different electrotonic attenuation, likely differences in various active conductances, and the presence of spines in OLM dendrites (which are generally sparse and were not reliably imaged in our experiments). Moreover, the cell would have to remain patched for longer in order for the fluorescent dyes to invade the distal dendrites. This alone could potentially result in systematic biases among groups. We now cite Guirrado et al (2014) and Gramuntell et al (2021) to highlight that factors other than dendritic diameter per se, such as inhomogeneity in spine and NMDA receptor density may also contribute to the heterogeneity of nonlinear summation in OLM cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) NMDA in OLM. Similar to the NDNF cells, the authors claim the involvement of NMDA receptors in OLM cells. Again there seems to be no dependence on EPSP amplitude, which is not understandable at this point (Figure S3). Even more remarkable is the fact that the authors claim that there is no dendritic calcium increase after activation of NMDA receptors. Similar to NDNF-cell analysis there are no NMDA currents in OLMs. Unfortunately, even no calcium imaging experiments were shown. Why? Are there calcium-impermeable NNDA receptors in OLM cells? To understand this phenomenon the minimum is to show some physiological signature of NMDA-receptors, for example, voltage-clamp currents. Furthermore, it would be helpful to systematically vary stimulus intensity to see some calcium signals with larger stimulation. In case there is still no calcium signal, it would be helpful to measure reversal potentials with different ion compositions to characterize the potentially 'Ca2+ impermeable' voltage-dependent NMDA receptors in OLM cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The same response to point (1) above applies to OLM cells. As with neurogliaform cells, mean OLM baseline asynchronous (separate response) amplitudes were &lt;0.5 mV, making it very difficult to record an isolated NMDAR-mediated uEPSC. Having said that, NMDARs do contribute to EPSCs elicited by stimulation of multiple afferents (e.g. Booker et al, 2021). We do not claim that dendritic calcium transients cannot be elicited following activation of NMDARs in OLM cells. We simply reported that the evoked uEPSPs, designed to approximate individual synaptic signals, were sub-threshold for detectable dendritic calcium signals under conditions that were suprathreshold in neurogliaform cells. The statement has been amended to specify that there were no detectable signals under our recording conditions. There is no evidence presented in the manuscript to suggest that OLM NMDARs are calcium impermeable and indeed no such claim was made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>There is a large variability in the observed dendritic nonlinearity, in NDNF IN dendrites e.g. the uEPSP amplitude nonlinearity measure varies from as low as 10-20% to over 200%. As only single dendrites were recorded from each IN, it is unclear if this variability is among the cells or between individual dendrites. While the authors analyzed some potential factors, such as distance along the dendrites, branch order, or response magnitude (amplitude and integral), they did not find any substantial correlation. It remains open if different dendrites of NDNF INs, located in the str. moleculare vs. those in or projecting towards str. radiatum, have divergent properties. Similarly, for SOM INs an important question is if axon-carrying dendrites show distinct properties.</p><p>In this context, it would be interesting to see not only values for the mean nonlinearity but also the maximal nonlinearity and its distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>Nonlinearity as defined in the manuscript is a cumulative measurement. The final value per dendritic segment is therefore the sum of nonlinearities at 1 to 12 near-synchronous uncaging locations. The data for the individual dendritic segments are shown in the slopegraphs as in Fig 2b, with their distribution visible. The averages referred to in the results correspond to the paired mean difference plots, which are the group summaries. The method section has been amended to clarify the analysis method. We did not address specifically whether dendrites projecting in different directions behaved differently. This is an interesting question beyond the scope of this study. Nor did we compare axon-carrying OLM dendrites to other dendrites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures:</p><p>Figure 1: The gray line in plots g and h is not explained.
