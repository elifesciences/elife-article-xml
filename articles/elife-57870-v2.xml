a crucial role in regulating gut movement, and are the principal target of setrons, a class of high-affinity competitive antagonists, used in the management of nausea and vomiting associated with radiation and chemotherapies. Structural insights into setron-binding poses and their inhibitory mechanisms are just beginning to emerge. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of full-length 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R in complex with palonosetron, ondansetron, and alosetron. Molecular dynamic simulations of these structures embedded in a fully-hydrated lipid environment assessed the stability of ligand-binding poses and drug-target interactions over time. Together with simulation results of apo- and serotonin-bound 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R, the study reveals a distinct interaction fingerprint between the various setrons and binding-pocket residues that may underlie their diverse affinities. In addition, varying degrees of conformational change in the setron-5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R structures, throughout the channel and particularly along the channel activation pathway, suggests a novel mechanism of competitive inhibition.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Serotonin is perhaps best known as a chemical messenger in the brain, where it regulates mood, appetite and sleep. But as a hormone, serotonin works in other parts of the body too. Serotonin is predominantly made in the gut, where it binds receptor proteins that help to regulate the movement of substances through the gastrointestinal tract, aiding digestion. However, a surge in serotonin release in the gut induces vomiting and nausea, which commonly happens as a side effect of treating cancer with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.</p><p>Anti-nausea drugs used to manage and prevent the severe nausea and vomiting experienced by cancer patients are therefore designed to target serotonin receptors in the gut. These drugs, called setrons, work by binding to serotonin receptors before serotonin does, essentially neutralising the effect of any surplus serotonin. Although they generally target serotonin receptors in the same way, some setrons are more efficient than others and can provide longer lasting relief. Clarifying exactly how each drug interacts with its target receptor might help to explain their differential effects.</p><p>Basak et al. used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to examine the interactions between three common anti-nausea drugs (palonosetron, ondansetron and alosetron) and one type of serotonin receptor, 5-HT3AR. The experiments showed that each drug changed the shape of 5-HT3AR, thereby inhibiting its activity to varying degrees. Further analysis identified a distinct ‘interaction fingerprint’ for the three setron drugs studied, showing which of the receptors’ subunits each drug binds to. Simulations of their interactions also showed that water molecules play a crucial role in the process, exposing the binding pocket on the receptor’s surface where the drugs attach.</p><p>This work provides a structural blueprint of the interactions between anti-nausea drugs and serotonin receptors. The structures could guide the development of new and improved therapies to treat nausea and vomiting brought on by cancer treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Setron</kwd><kwd>anti-emetic</kwd><kwd>ion channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM108921</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakrapani</surname><given-names>Sudha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17POST33671152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Basak</surname><given-names>Sandip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20POST35210394</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Arvind</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM134896</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakrapani</surname><given-names>Sudha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM131216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakrapani</surname><given-names>Sudha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-electron microscopic structures of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>A receptor in complex with first and second generations of clinically used setron reveal the molecular basis for their binding modes and mechanisms of inhibitory action.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer treatment by radiation or chemotherapy triggers the release of excess serotonin from the mucosal enterochromaffin cells in the upper gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwörer et al., 1991</xref>). Serotonin binds to serotonin (3) receptors (5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs), a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC), on the vagal afferent nerve in the gut and on the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the brainstem leading to severe nausea and vomiting in patients receiving cancer treatments. These common side effects of cancer treatments take a significant physical and psychological toll on cancer patients. Without management, these side effects can reduce patient compliance, undermining treatment success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilmore et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, uncontrolled debilitating side effects result in secondary complications such as dehydration and anorexia that require additional hospitalization and increase overall healthcare costs.</p><p>Current antiemetic therapies include a 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R antagonist treatment regimen, which is considered a major advancement in improving patient quality of life during cancer treatment. Setrons, competitive antagonists of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R, are effective in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), radiation therapy- induced nausea and vomiting (RINV), and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spiller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hsu, 2010</xref>). Notably, CINV occurs in acute and delayed phases. The first generation of FDA approved setrons are effective for treating acute but not delayed phase nausea due to their short plasma half-lives. They belong to the following major classes based on their chemical structures: carbazole (<italic>e.g.</italic> ondansetron), indazole (<italic>e.g.</italic> granisetron), indole (e.g. dolasetron, tropisetron), and pyridoindole (<italic>e.g.</italic> alosetron). Although setrons share the same fundamental mechanism of action, they have varying efficacies, dose-response profiles, duration of action, and off-target responses. These differences perhaps underlie variable patient response, particularly in the context of acute and refractory emesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Wit et al., 2005</xref>). The isoquinoline derivative palonosetron, the only FDA approved second generation setron, is shown to have a longer half-life, improved bioavailability, and efficacy. In addition, palonosetron is implicated in causing receptor internalization, which further improves antiemetic properties. Beyond their role in controlling emesis, setrons are used to treat GI disorders including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), obesity, and several inflammatory, neurological and psychiatric disorders such as migraine, drug abuse, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and cognitive disorders. However, in some cases, toxicity and adverse side effects have hampered their use. For example, the FDA approved treatment of diarrhea-predominant IBS with alosetron led to severe ischemic colitis in many patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friedel et al., 2001</xref>). Given the broad therapeutic potential of 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R antagonists, the prospect of substantial therapeutic gains by probing the setron pharmacophore as well as developing novel pharmaceuticals with higher efficacy and reduced side effects is encouraging.</p><p>At the physiological level, the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs play an important role in gut motility, visceral sensation, and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lummis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kia et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bétry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thompson and Lummis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gershon, 2004</xref>), and are also implicated in pain perception, mood, and appetite. 5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs are the only ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maricq et al., 1991</xref>) among the large family of serotonin receptors, the rest being G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). 5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs are expressed as homopentamers of subunit A or heteropentamers of subunit A, in combination with B, C, D, or E subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Niesler et al., 2007</xref>). Compositional and stoichiometric differences lead to differential responses to serotonin, gating kinetics, permeability, and pharmacology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davies et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kelley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thompson and Lummis, 2013</xref>). This functional diversity, tissue specific expression patterns, and distinct pathophysiology of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R isoforms establish a need for subtype specific drugs to address diverse clinical needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hammer et al., 2012</xref>). Of note, granisetron, palonosetron, ondansetron, and alosetron have slightly different affinities for various receptor subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gregory and Ettinger, 1998</xref>). Ondansetron, in addition to binding to 5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs, also binds to several GPCRs, such as 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>R, 5-HT<sub>1C</sub>R, α1-adrenergic receptors and μ-opioid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kovac, 2016</xref>). Granisetron binds to all subtypes of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R, but has little or no affinity for 5-HT<sub>1</sub>R, 5-HT<sub>2</sub>R and 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R receptors. Palonosetron is highly selective for 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R and dolasetron for 5-HT<sub>3AB</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). Structural insights into setron-binding poses came initially from crystal structures of the acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP), bound to granisetron, tropisetron, or palonosetron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kesters et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hibbs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Price et al., 2016</xref>) and more recently from 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R complexed with tropisetron and granisetron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Polovinkin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basak et al., 2019</xref>). While some of the basic principles of setron-binding are now clear, there is still limited understanding of differing pharmacodynamics among setrons and the associated clinical relevance.</p><p>In the present study, we have solved cryo-EM structures of the full-length 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R in complex with palonosetron, ondansetron, and alosetron at the resolution range of 2.9 Å to 3.3 Å. Together with our previously solved structures of 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R in complex with granisetron (5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Grani) and serotonin-bound (5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-serotonin, State 1-preopen), as well as ligand-free 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R (5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo), we provide details of various setron-binding modes and the ensuing conformational changes that lead to channel inhibition. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and electrophysiology, we have further validated setron-binding modes and interactions within the conserved binding pocket. Combined with abundant functional, biochemical, and clinical data, these new findings may serve as a structural blueprint of drug-receptor interactions that can guide new drug development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cryo-EM structures of setron-5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R complexes</title><p>Structures of the full-length 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R in complex with setrons were solved by single-particle cryo-EM.

The amine is within 4 Å of Trp156 (Loop B), Tyr207 (Loop C), Trp63 (Loop D) and Tyr126 (Loop E), and is likely to be involved in polar interactions with these residues. In particular, the carbonyl oxygen of Trp156 is close to the amine group of setron, and in the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Alo, it forms a hydrogen bond with the amine group in the diazole ring. The relative orientation of the tertiary nitrogen and Trp156 is conducive for a cation-pi interaction, as seen in the AChBP-5-HT<sub>3</sub> chimera structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kesters et al., 2013</xref>). A similar interaction is also predicted for the primary amine group of serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beene et al., 2002</xref>). The aromatic end of the molecule is an indazole in granisetron, isoquinoline in palonosetron, carbazole in ondansetron, and pyridoindole in alosetron. It is oriented toward the complementary subunit, and lies parallel to the membrane. In this orientation, the aromatic moiety is stabilized by a number of hydrophobic interactions with Ile44, Trp63, Tyr64, Ile201, and Tyr126 (shown by gray color in surface representation <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The setron molecule is within 4–5 Å and potentially makes π-π interactions (edge-to-face or face-to-face) with Trp63, Tyr126, Trp156, and Tyr207. These interactions are also consistent with our MD simulations (discussed below). While most interactions with setrons observed in these structures are apolar in nature, it is to be noted that water molecules were not modeled into the structures. Interactions mediated through water molecules are inferred from MD simulations (discussed below). In addition, the planar aromatic rings lie beneath Arg65, and are in close proximity to the positively charged nitrogen in the guanidinium group of Arg65, revealing a potential cation-pi interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This interaction was also observed in the AChBP-5-HT<sub>3</sub> chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kesters et al., 2013</xref>) and 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Grani structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basak et al., 2019</xref>). As previously noted in 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Grani, the setron position causes reorientation of Arg65 (β2 strand or Loop D) and Trp168 (β8-β9; Loop F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basak et al., 2019</xref>). Earlier reports also predicted large orientational differences for Trp168 when the binding site was occupied by agonist or antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>). In this position, Arg65 is in a network of interactions involving Asp42 (β1), Try126 (β6), Trp168 (β8-β9; Loop F), Arg169 (β8-β9; Loop F), and Asp177 (β8-β9; Loop F) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Glu102 (Loop A) which is in the vicinity of the ligand-binding site is in a hydrogen-bond network with Thr133 and Ala134 carbonyl (β6 strand). Interestingly, both of these networks are also present in serotonin-bound 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R, but absent in 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo, indicating the ligand-induced formation of the interaction network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basak et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>To understand the dynamics of ligand-receptor interactions, 100 ns MD simulations were carried out for 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Grani, 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Palono, 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Ondan and 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Alo, structures embedded in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidyl choline (POPC) membrane and encased in water with 150 mM NaCl. The analysis also included simulations of the un-liganded (5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo) and the serotonin-bound structures under the same conditions. In the presence of serotonin, two conformational states were resolved for 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R by previous cryo-EM studies; one was partially open (referred to State 1) and the other was open (referred to State 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2018b</xref>). Although the two states had major differences in the TMD and the ICD, they were identical at the level of the serotonin-binding site and Loop C orientation. Given the better resolution of State 1 (referred to as 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Serotonin here and throughout), we used this structural model for comparison with setron-bound structures. While the cryo-EM density for the setrons allowed precise orientation of the ligand in the pocket, accurate modeling of the serotonin was limited by the cryo-EM resolution in combination with the smaller size of the molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2018b</xref>). Upon evaluating the various docking poses for serotonin acquired using an initial pose placement with GlideSP followed by an in place refinement with GlideXP (Schrödinger Release 2019–2: Glide, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2019), we found that the identified top-scored pose was essentially identical to that in the cryo-EM model.</p><p>To assess the stability of each ligand binding-pose modeled from cryo-EM density, we quantified the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of each pose relative to its starting conformation, assessed for each subunit independently every 500 ps of each ligand-5HT<sub>3A</sub>R 100 ns simulation for a total of 200 simulation frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We also quantified the average RMSD of each pose relative to its starting conformation by averaging over 1000 simulation snapshots (200 frames sampled every 500 ps for each of the five subunits treated as replicates) extracted from the 100 ns simulations for each ligand-5HT<sub>3A</sub>R complex. Among the ligands studied, the serotonin molecule exhibited considerable fluctuations (RMSD up to 5.4 Å with an average value of 1.9 Å, across five subunits) within the binding pocket. In contrast, most setron molecules maintained a low RMSD (RMSD average values of 1.1 Å, 1.0 Å, and 1.1 Å for granisetron, ondansetron, and alosetron, respectively), with palonosetron demonstrating the largest RMSD (1.9 Å) among all the simulated setrons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). During the simulation, the palonosetron’s bicyclic ring displayed fluctuation and positional reorientation. In these orientations, palonosetron had distinct interactions with binding-site residues, in particular with Asn101 in the ‘down’ position and Trp156 in the ‘up’ position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and c</xref>). A recently reported structure of 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R in complex with palonosetron (published during revision of this manuscript) shows an overall similar conformation of the protein as seen here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zarkadas et al., 2020</xref>).

In the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Serotonin simulations, the indole ring of serotonin makes pi-pi stacking interactions (edge-to-face or face-to-face) with key aromatic residues Trp63, Tyr126, and Trp156, and Tyr207. Among these only interactions with Trp156 and Tyr126 occur with probability larger than 50%. Mutations to each of these aromatic position affects serotonin-binding and is reflected in increase in EC<sub>50</sub> for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beene et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Spier and Lummis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beene et al., 2004</xref>). The indole nitrogen of serotonin forms water-mediated interactions with Asp42 and Arg169, albeit with a 25% probability whereas the ligand’s hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen-bond with the amine nitrogen of Trp156 with a 50% probability. The indole nitrogen is also involved in an extended water network with Glu173 on Loop F, particularly in simulation frames where Loop F orients toward serotonin where this network is sampled as a two water -mediated hydrogen bond interaction. The primary amine nitrogen in serotonin makes multiple water-mediated interactions with the side chains of Glu209 and Thr154, and occasionally with Asn101 (less than 25% of the simulation time). In addition, serotonin forms relatively stable apolar interactions (&gt;50% probability) with Ile44, Phe199, and Ile201.</p><p>The structural fingerprint analysis shows that all setrons form a number of very stable (probability &gt;75%), mostly apolar, interactions with the following residues: Asp42, Val43, Ile44, Trp63, Tyr64, Arg65, Tyr126, and Trp156. While interactions between serotonin and residues Ile44, Trp63, Arg65, Tyr126, and Trp156 occurred with similar probability, those with Val43 and Tyr64 did not form at all and those with Asp42 were reduced, albeit complemented by hydrogen bond and water-mediated interactions. In 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Grani, the bicyclic nitrogen makes water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the sidechains of Thr154, Ser155, and Glu209. The indazole nitrogen occasionally interacts with Asp202 through a water-mediated hydrogen bond. Reduced affinity for granisetron is noted upon mutations at these positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yan et al., 1999</xref>) and notably W63A, W156A, and Y207A do not bind granisetron. In 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Palono, the tertiary amine on the ligand’s bicyclic ring makes water-mediated and direct polar contacts with the backbone oxygen of Trp156 or the sidechain of Asn101 depending on the orientation of bicyclic ring. The carbonyl group of the isoquinoline moiety interacts with the amine nitrogen of Trp156 and carbonyl oxygen of Tyr64 through a water molecule. Mutations of Trp156 or Tyr64 cause large or small increases of palonosetron-induced inhibition, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Price et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Del Cadia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beene et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, while N101Q preserves palonosetron-induced inhibition similar to wild-type receptor, a mutation to N101A (no H-bond with side chain) increases the potency of palonosetron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Price et al., 2016</xref>). Palonosetron forms an apolar interaction with Arg169 with higher probability compared to the other ligands, potentially due to palonosetron’s pose forming weak interactions with loop C in favor of loop F. In 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Ondan, the ondansetron molecule forms highly probable edge-to-face stacking interactions with Tyr126 and Tyr207. The secondary nitrogen on the diazole ring forms a hydrogen-bond interaction with Glu209 through a water molecule. These water-mediated interactions are also occasionally seen with Thr154 and Asn101. In 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Alo, one of the secondary amine nitrogen on the diazole ring forms a water-mediated hydrogen-bond interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of Trp156. The amide oxygen of Trp156 forms a water-mediated hydrogen-bond contact with the amine group of the ligand’s imidazole. The backbone oxygen of Tyr64 interacts with the carbonyl group of the ligand’s pyridoindole ring through a water molecule. Interestingly, water-mediated interactions with Glu209 are absent in the alosetron fingerprint when compared to the ondansetron, granisetron, and serotonin fingerprints.</p><p>It is to be noted that many of the ligand-receptor interactions identified as important by the MD simulations are not directly evident from the Cryo-EM structures particularly since many of these interactions are mediated through water molecules (not modeled in the structural coordinates). In addition, MD simulation captures several transient interactions arising from side-chain flexibility and drug mobility within the pocket.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Conformation of loop C</title><p>We previously showed that instead of being in a 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo like conformation, 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Grani revealed a counter-clockwise twist of beta strands in the ECD leading to a small inward movement of Loop C (connecting β9-β10 strands) closing-in on granisetron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basak et al., 2019</xref>). The Loop C conformation has been correlated to the agonistic nature of the ligand in the binding site. The AChBP-ligand complexes have shown that agonist binding induces a ‘closure’ of Loop C, capping the ligand-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hansen et al., 2005</xref>). The 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R and other pLGIC structures solved thus far, in the apo and agonist-bound states, also follow this general trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Polovinkin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basak et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumar et al., 2020</xref>). This conformational change may be part of a conserved pLGIC mechanism that couples ligand binding to channel opening through the ECD-TMD interfacial loops. However, studies have shown that unliganded pLGIC gating kinetics remain unaffected by Loop C truncation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Purohit and Auerbach, 2013</xref>), raising ambiguity over the role of Loop C closure in channel opening. Antagonist-bound AChBP structures show that Loop C further extended outward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hansen et al., 2005</xref>), while partial agonists seem to induce partial Loop C closure but not to the level achieved by agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hibbs et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting a correlation between the degree of Loop C closure and the level of agonism. However, in the crystal structure of AChBP in complex with antagonist dihydro-<italic>β</italic>-erythroidine, Loop C appears to move inward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shahsavar et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In comparison to the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo structure, Loop C adopts varying degrees of an inward conformation, and in the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Alo structure the orientation is similar to 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). The twisting inward movement does not pertain to Loop C alone, but it is also shared by adjoining β7, β9 and β10 strands forming the outer-sheets of the β-sandwich core, with notable deviations from the corresponding regions in the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). In contrast, only minimal changes are observed in the β-strands of the inner sheets (β1, β2, β6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>). These conformational changes approach those seen in the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Serotonin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2018b</xref>). Although these results appear to diverge from the classical view that competitive antagonists either cause steric hindrance to agonist binding or evoke structural changes that are opposite to those caused by agonist, they are generally consistent with previous findings from dynamics studies in pLGIC using voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF). In VCF, ligand-induced conformational changes and channel function are simultaneously monitored. When reporter-groups were introduced in Loop C of 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R, similar fluorescence changes were recorded from binding either serotonin or setrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Munro et al., 2019</xref>). In GlyR, both glycine (agonist) and strychnine (a competitive antagonist) produced identical fluorescence responses from labels in certain regions of Loop C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pless and Lynch, 2009</xref>), and a similar trend was also observed in ρ1GABAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang and Weiss, 2002</xref>). These findings implied that the local structural changes induced by these ligands were indiscriminate to the functional response from the channel. Overall, these findings underscore the complexity of Loop C movement and its role in coupling channel opening. Interestingly, the inner β-sheet regions (particularly Loop E, contributing to the binding pocket from the complementary subunit) undergo distinct movements depending on the nature of the bound ligand in GlyR, 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R, and GABA<sub>A</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Munro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pless and Lynch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang and Weiss, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muroi et al., 2006</xref>) suggesting that this region maybe a better reporter for ligand discrimination.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Setron-binding pocket and conformational changes in Loop C.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Global alignment of 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo, 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-State1 (serotonin-bound), 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Grani, 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Palono, 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Ondan, and 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Alo structures.

To characterize the flexibility of Loop C in the liganded and unliganded states of 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R, we monitored two structural parameters during the MD simulation runs. First, we assessed the RMSD of Loop C for each protomer in each 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R simulation by evaluating the distances of Cα, carbonyl carbon, and backbone nitrogen atoms of residues Ser200 through Asn205 with respect to their initial cryo-EM conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Second, we defined a custom dihedral formed by the Cα atoms of residues Ala208, Phe199, Glu198, and Ile203 that measured the orientation of the loop relative to the complementary subunit binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). This dihedral was defined in such a way that a large angle would denote that the loop is oriented away from the binding site and small or negative angles indicate that the loop is oriented toward the binding site. Comparing these two parameters across the different systems suggest that Loop C is stable in its initial cryo-EM conformation in the case of 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Alo and 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Serotonin simulations where it predominantly adopts a ‘closed’ conformation. In other setron complexes, Loop C is observed to switch to an alternate ‘open’ conformation where it extends away from the binding-site surface. In comparison to all the ligand-bound structures, Loop C exhibited a much larger flexibility in 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo as evidenced by large RMSD values and a wide-range of dihedral angles. These multiple Loop C ‘opening’ and ‘closing’ events in the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo structure contrasts ligand-bound states of the channel and suggest that the presence of a ligand in the binding-site forces the loop C to remain ‘closed’. Such enhanced flexibility in the unliganded state of 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R has also been reported in a previous 20 μs simulation study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guros et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To assess the impact of Loop C movement on the relative size of each setron-binding pocket, we quantified the average number of water molecules found within each binding site assessed separately for each protomer chain.

We hypothesized that in our MD simulations Loop C would not adopt an ‘open’ conformation if an Arg65-Asp202 interaction was formed. We find that the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Alo and 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Serotonin MD simulations maintained an interaction between Arg65 and Asp202 more often than in any other setron-bound structure, and that most setron-bound simulations did not appreciably form this stabilizing interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and b</xref>). Thus, our mechanistic hypothesis is such that when Arg65 is interacting with Asp202, Loop C is in a stable ‘closed’ conformation, which in turn reduces the accessibility of the binding pocket to water, and incidentally contributes to the higher stability of the ligand binding pose.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Dynamic interaction between Arg65 and Asp202.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Time evolution of the minimum distance between side-chain polar atoms of Arg65 and Asp202 throughout 100 ns simulations.

To further assess the role of Arg65 in binding various setrons, we measured the extent of inhibition of serotonin-induced currents. Since for competitive antagonists the extent of inhibition depends on agonist concentration, the serotonin concentration in each case was kept close to the EC<sub>50</sub> value for wild type (2 μM) and R65A (10 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>).

As expected, no major changes to the overall pore profile of the channel were observed during simulations, which were carried out in the absence of positional restraints. The side-chain movements of the residues lining the permeation pathway caused only slight fluctuations of the pore radius as shown by the standard deviations from across eight equidistant simulation frames for each system. Most notably, in each case, the pore remained constricted at the Leu260 (9′) to under 2.3 Å (below the hydrated Na<sup>+</sup> radius). As also reported in earlier simulation studies, the Leu260 (9′) position is the major barrier in the TMD to ion permeation in the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo and 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Serotonin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2018b</xref>). While there are small conformational changes in the ICD, the post-M3 loop occludes the lateral portals at the interface of the TMD and ICD which are predicted to be the ion exit paths. The extent of occlusion is similar to that seen in the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basak et al., 2018a</xref>) suggesting that the ICD exits are closed in these conformations. Interestingly, in muscle-type nAChR, the ICD portals appear to be open even in the Apo conformation, highlighting the mechanistic differences among pLGIC members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>). Overall, these analyses suggest that although there are different extents of conformational changes in the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-setron structures that lie between those of 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo and 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Serotonin, each of these structures appears to be non-conducting to ions.</p><p>A limitation of these standard, shorter MD simulation timescales is that dynamic transitions between multiple states or allostery between ligand-binding at the ECD and pore-opening at the TMD are not expected to be captured during runs. The purpose of these simulations was to verify ligand stability in the pocket and the overall stability of the cryo-EM conformation rather than ligand-induced conformational rearrangements. Future studies with enhanced MD simulations may provide insights into transitions between different conformational states and the mechanistic details of coupling across domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Setron-binding sites in heteromeric 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R</title><p>We further explored the question of whether setrons discriminate between homomeric 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R and the heteromeric assemblies of subunit A in combination with either B, C, D, or E subunits. Among the different heteromeric 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R assemblies, the most studied is the 5-HT<sub>3AB</sub>R. A sequence alignment of mouse and human 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) shows that two key residues that interact with serotonin and setrons, Trp156 (on the principal side) and Arg65 (on the complementary side), are present exclusively in subunit A. This suggests that the setron- binding site may be limited to A-A interfaces both in the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R homomeric and heteromeric assemblies. A similar conclusion has also been drawn from earlier studies that have shown that setrons do not significantly differ in potency between 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R and 5-HT<sub>3AB</sub>R, and that mutations to binding-site residues in subunit A had more dramatic effects on antagonist-binding affinity and an increased serotonin EC<sub>50</sub> than mutations to equivalent positions in subunit B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Del Cadia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lochner and Lummis, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Summary</title><p>A comprehensive structural analysis of multiple high-resolution structures of setron-bound 5- HT<sub>3A</sub>R complexes reveal several features of competitive antagonism that were not fully evident from the previous structural findings. Serotonin binds within a partially solvent-exposed cavity at the subunit interface and elicits Loop C closure and twisting of the β-strands within the ECD. The setron-binding pocket, while involving overlapping residues, extends further into the complementary subunit. Setron-binding evokes varying degrees of Loop C closure and in some cases, almost to the same degree as in the serotonin-bound state. The Loop C movements are associated with varying degrees of structural changes in the inner and outer β-strands that translate to small changes in the pore-lining M2 helices. Overall, setrons stabilize 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R conformational states that are non-conductive, but appear to lie between the apo and serotonin-bound states. These findings therefore suggest that competitive antagonism in 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R, and potentially in other pLGIC, may involve stabilizing intermediates along the activation pathway. With new emerging uses of setrons to treat psychiatric disorders, inflammation, substance abuse, and Alzheimer’s disease, these studies lay the foundation for the design of novel therapeutics that may have higher treatment efficacy and potentially fewer off-target effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Electrophysiological measurements in oocytes</title><p>Mouse 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R gene (purchased from GenScript) and mutant genes were inserted into pTLN plasmid.

This protocol adds missing hydrogen atoms to the initial protein-ligand complex. After the initial preparatory steps and protonation assignment of side chains, a brief restrained energy minimization <italic>in vacuo</italic> using the OPLS3 force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harder et al., 2016</xref>) was carried out to finalize system setup for each protein-ligand complex. Each setron-5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R complex was then embedded into a POPC bilayer using the Membrane Builder tool of the CHARMM-GUI webserver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jo et al., 2008</xref>). The system was then solvated with TIP3P water, and 150 mM NaCl was added to the simulation system by replacing random water molecules. Excess sodium ions were added to neutralize the charge of each protein-ligand complex. The resulting simulation systems had initial dimensions of ~130 × 130×207 Å<sup>3</sup> and consisted of the unliganded 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R pentamer, or the pentamer bound to the setron or serotonin at each 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R subunit,~400 POPC molecules,~83,000 water molecules,~240 sodium ions, and ~220 chloride ions, for a total of ~330,000–346,000 atoms. Throughout this work we reference data from our previously published simulation of granisetron-bound 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basak et al., 2019</xref>) in comparison to these three new setron-bound 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R complexes, as well as the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-serotonin complex and the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo structure.</p><p>The CHARMM36m forcefield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacKerell et al., 1998</xref>) was used to parameterize the protein and lipid atoms within each simulation system. Initial parameters for palonosetron, alosetron, and ondansetron were obtained from the ParamChem webserver using the CHARMM general force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2010</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cgenff.parmchem.org">https://cgenff.parmchem.org</ext-link>). Parameters were validated according to the procedure described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2010</xref>). Said validation required quantum calculations performed with Gaussian 16 (Gaussian 16, Revision C.01, Gaussian, Inc, Wallingford CT, 2016) to finalize the charges and dihedrals defined within our setron molecule models. These parameter refinement steps were not conducted for serotonin as the default ParamChem parameters were found to be sufficient as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2010</xref>.</p><p>MD simulations were run using GROMACS 2018.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berendsen et al., 1995</xref>) software with a timestep of 2 fs, following a steepest descent energy minimization run for 5000 steps, as well as 100 ps isothermal-isovolumetric (NVT) and 52 ns isothermal-isobaric (NPT) equilibration runs. The NVT equilibration was performed to initially heat the model systems after the steepest descents minimization. This step was performed with restraints on protein, membrane, and ligand molecule heavy atoms (when ligand was present) relative to their starting conformation. The NPT equilibration runs were performed in 5 steps of 10 ns each, within which the system was allowed to relax with gradually released restraints until finally the system was allowed to equilibrate for 2 ns of unrestrained NPT equilibration. This was followed by a 100 ns production run in isothermal-isobaric conditions. System temperature and pressure were maintained at 300 K and 1 bar, respectively, using velocity rescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bussi et al., 2007</xref>) for temperature coupling and Parrinello-Rahman barostat for pressure coupling during equilibration. Semi-isotropic pressure coupling and the Nose-Hoover thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoover, 1985</xref>) were applied during production runs. All bonds involving hydrogens were constrained using the LINCS algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hess et al., 1997</xref>). Short-range nonbonded interactions were cut at 12 Å. Long-range electrostatic interactions were computed using the Particle Mesh Ewald summation with a Fourier grid spacing of 1.2 Å.</p><p>Trajectory analyses were performed using a combination of Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>) and the GROMACS analysis toolkit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Van Der Spoel et al., 2005</xref>) over equidistant frames of our production simulations using a 500 ps stride. In particular, all RMSD measurements and Loop C orientations were obtained after aligning simulation frames onto the coordinates of the initial cryo-EM structure by comparing Cα atoms in the helices and β-sheets of the ECD. RMSD calculations were assessed for each ligand by evaluating the difference in heavy atoms of the ligands between each simulation frame and the initial cryo-EM structure conformation. Similarly, Loop C RMSD’s were calculated by comparing the Cα, backbone carbonyl carbon, and backbone nitrogen atoms of residues Ser200 through Asn205 relative to their conformation in the initial cryo-EM resolved structures. To measure the orientation of Loop C, we defined a custom Loop C dihedral as being drawn between the alpha carbons of residues Ala208, Phe199, Glu198, and Ile203. To determine whether Loop C adopted a ‘closed’ or ‘open’ conformation we evaluated the distance between the Arg65 and Asp202 side chains, measured by a minimum distance of their respective polar side-chain atoms for each analyzed simulation frame. To evaluate how well solvated the setron-binding sites were throughout our simulations, we counted the number of water oxygen atoms within 3 Å of any setron atoms for each simulation frame averaged across all five subunits. Structural interaction fingerprints were calculated with an in-house python script that monitored 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R interactions with each setron. Specifically, for each residue of 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R, ligand-protein interactions with both sidechain and backbone heavy atoms were calculated as a 9-bit representation based on the following 9 types of interactions: apolar (van der Waals), face-to-face aromatic, edge-to-face aromatic, hydrogen-bond interactions with the protein either as a donor or acceptor, electrostatic with either the protein acting as a positive or negative charge, one-water-mediated hydrogen bond, and two-water-mediated hydrogen bonds. A distance cutoff of 4.5 Å was used to identify apolar interactions between two non-polar atoms (carbon atoms), while a cutoff of 4 Å was used to evaluate aromatic and electrostatic interactions. Interaction probabilities were averaged across simulation frames as well as across all five 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R binding sites and errors for each interaction type were estimated using a two-state Markov model, sampling the transition matrix posterior distribution using standard Dirichlet priors for the transition probabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trendelkamp-Schroer et al., 2015</xref>). Pore radii of 5-HT3AR systems were assessed over equidistant simulation frames with a stride of 12.5 ns using HOLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smart et al., 1996</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Data availability accession numbers </title><p>The coordinates of the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-setron structures and the corresponding Cryo-EM maps have been deposited in wwPDB and EMDB with the following accession numbers.

This study reports 3 new high resolution cryo-EM structures of full-length 5HT<sub>3</sub>Rs in complex with different competitive antagonists called setrons, which are used as anti-emetics. Molecular dynamic simulations and functional assays were used to assess ligand-protein interactions and ligand induced motions. The structures add significant new information about antagonist binding to 5HT<sub>3</sub>Rs. By comparing structures (apo, antagonist bound and agonist bound), the authors conclude that antagonist binding stabilizes intermediate conformations along the activation pathway and suggest that this is a novel mechanism.</p><p>The strength of the paper is the new cryo-EM structures with resolutions among the highest reported for this family of channels. Unexpected differences in loop C highlight the value of obtaining independent structural data, even for compounds with similar antagonist actions that target the same binding site.</p><p>Weaknesses noted are with the interpretations arising from the MD simulations, the limited functional data and the lack of detail in the drug-protein interaction fingerprint analyses. The manuscript would benefit from including additional simulations, deeper analyses of the simulations and clearer interpretations of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R-setron interaction fingerprints and LigPlot data. In addition, reorganization and reframing of conclusions to highlight how the data in this study provide new mechanistic insights into how setrons bind at 5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs and how they inhibit channel function are needed.</p><p>Addressing the following essential revisions will strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Simulations should provide mechanistic insights. In general, the simulations demonstrate that setrons remain in binding pocket and orientation does not change (Figure 5) and that loop C does not move appreciably (supplemental Figure 7). The central model, that setrons inhibit 5-HT<sub>3A</sub> by locking the receptor-particularly loop C-in an intermediate state, would be substantially strengthened by comparing dynamics in apo and serotonin-bound states. Indeed, in light of the variations among static structures shown in Figures 3/4, it seems strange that Figures 5/6/SI do not include analyses of e.g. loop closure, flexibility, or &quot;dihedral&quot; in apo and serotonin simulations, nor of ligand RMSD or hydration for serotonin simulations. Similarly, how do specific setron interactions reported in Supplemental Figures 5/6 compare to serotonin? The conclusion states they involve &quot;overlapping residues&quot; but extend &quot;further into the complementary subunit,&quot; a comparison that does not seem directly documented in this work. At least some of these data would seem readily accessible, as the same authors previously reported simulations of apo and serotonin-bound structures on similar timescales. For example, how does the &quot;open&quot; conformation visited by loop C in setron simulations compare to the apo state?</p><p>2) The proposal that setrons stabilize an intermediate conformation also raises striking questions as to the dynamics of inhibited structures beyond the orthosteric site. The authors previously reported fluctuations in pore hydration and diameter in apo versus pre-open structures; how do these compare in the apparently intermediate-diameter pores of setron complexes? Does the apparent constriction of the upper-pore region in the presence of setrons, or the generally shifted profile of the lower pore with alosetron, persist in simulations? If alosetron locks loop C in a 5HT-like conformation but with &quot;varying degrees of structural changes in the inner and outer β-strands that translate to small changes in the pore-lining M2 helices,&quot; how are these changes reflected in simulations?</p><p>3) The constriction in the ECD appears to be the biggest difference between apo-, antagonist- bound conformations and the serotonin pre-open and open conformations. Identify the residues that contribute to the constriction and discuss more thoroughly on how data supports idea that antagonists stabilize intermediate conformations.</p><p>4) The authors do not discuss what information is gained from 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R-setron interaction fingerprints in Supplementary Figures 5 and 6 compared to analyzing and critically examining the cryo-EM structures. Discussion of this data is brief and does not provide enough details. The authors state &quot;Notably, the alosetron fingerprints suggests that this compound forms stronger interactions with Asp202 and Trp156 when compared to palonosetron, ondansetron, and granisetron.&quot; It is not clear how these analyses are used to quantitate whether an interaction is stronger than another. The interaction maps do not seem to correspond entirely to structural snapshots in e.g. Figure 5.

In general, the simulations demonstrate that setrons remain in binding pocket and orientation does not change (Figure 5) and that loop C does not move appreciably (supplemental Figure 7). The central model, that setrons inhibit 5-HT<sub>3A</sub> by locking the receptor-particularly loop C-in an intermediate state, would be substantially strengthened by comparing dynamics in apo and serotonin-bound states. Indeed, in light of the variations among static structures shown in Figures 3/4, it seems strange that Figures 5/6/SI do not include analyses of e.g. loop closure, flexibility, or &quot;dihedral&quot; in apo and serotonin simulations, nor of ligand RMSD or hydration for serotonin simulations. Similarly, how do specific setron interactions reported in Supplemental Figures 5/6 compare to serotonin? The conclusion states they involve &quot;overlapping residues&quot; but extend &quot;further into the complementary subunit,&quot; a comparison that does not seem directly documented in this work. At least some of these data would seem readily accessible, as the same authors previously reported simulations of apo and serotonin-bound structures on similar timescales. For example, how does the &quot;open&quot; conformation visited by loop C in setron simulations compare to the apo state?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers on the importance of comparing the dynamics of the various 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-setron complexes presented in this manuscript with that of 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo and 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Serotonin. To this end, we carried out new simulations of apo and serotonin-bound conformations (state 1) using the same protocol used for simulations of the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-setron complexes. We report a new plot of the serotonin RMSD (Figure 3A), which suggests that this ligand is more mobile in the binding pocket as compared to setrons. The plots of loop C RMSD and dihedral angles, water interactions, and R65-D202 interactions for 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo and 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Serotonin are also included (Figure 4—figure supplement 1; Figure 6A). Taken together, the results of these analyses point to a more stable “closed” conformation of Loop C in all the ligand-bound 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R structures, including the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-serotonin structure, compared to a much more flexible conformation of this loop in the absence of a ligand. Such enhanced flexibility in the unliganded state has also been reported in a recent 20 μs simulation study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The proposal that setrons stabilize an intermediate conformation also raises striking questions as to the dynamics of inhibited structures beyond the orthosteric site. The authors previously reported fluctuations in pore hydration and diameter in apo versus pre-open structures; how do these compare in the apparently intermediate-diameter pores of setron complexes? Does the apparent constriction of the upper-pore region in the presence of setrons, or the generally shifted profile of the lower pore with alosetron, persist in simulations? If alosetron locks loop C in a 5HT-like conformation but with &quot;varying degrees of structural changes in the inner and outer β-strands that translate to small changes in the pore-lining M2 helices,&quot; how are these changes reflected in simulations?</p></disp-quote><p>We have investigated the dynamics of the pore within the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-setron structures, as well as the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-serotonin structure, during 100 ns unrestrained simulations and compared it to results of simulations of the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo carried out in the same environment (POPC lipid bilayer in 150 mM NaCl) and using the same protocol (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). No positional restraints were placed on the molecules during the simulation runs and, as expected, there were no major changes to the overall pore profile during the limited simulation timescale. In each case, the pore remained constricted at the Leu260 (9′) to under 2.3 Å (below the hydrated Na<sup>+</sup> radius). As also reported in earlier simulation studies, Leu260 (9′) position is the major barrier in the transmembrane domain (TMD) to ion permeation in the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo and 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Serotonin structures. These analyses suggest that although there are different extents of TMD conformational changes in the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-setron structures, each of these conformations appear to be non-conducting to ions. We note, however, that no dynamic transitions between multiple states or allostery between ligand-binding at the ECD and pore-opening at the TMD were expected during the limited standard MD timescales. The purpose of our simulations was to verify ligand stability in the pocket rather than ligand-induced conformational rearrangements. The latter would most likely require enhanced MD simulations to observe transitions between different conformational states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The constriction in the ECD appears to be the biggest difference between apo-, antagonist- bound conformations and the serotonin pre-open and open conformations. Identify the residues that contribute to the constriction and discuss more thoroughly on how data supports idea that antagonists stabilize intermediate conformations.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers make a good point on the ECD constriction. We have expanded on this in the discussion of the results. Briefly, this constriction point is lined by Asp105 and Lys108 in the β4-β5 loop. The Asp105 position is conserved among most cation-selective pLGICs and mutations at this position affect single-channel conductance and open probability in pLGICs. The ECD constriction is narrower in 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo and widens in the serotonin-bound structures. 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-setron structures show different extents of widening at this position. However, previous studies assessing permeation of ion and water molecules with imposed membrane potential have shown that this constriction point does not impede ion permeation in the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Apo and 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-Serotonin systems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors do not discuss what information is gained from 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R-setron interaction fingerprints in Supplementary Figures 5 and 6 compared to analyzing and critically examining the cryo-EM structures. Discussion of this data is brief and does not provide enough details. The authors state &quot;Notably, the alosetron fingerprints suggests that this compound forms stronger interactions with Asp202 and Trp156 when compared to palonosetron, ondansetron, and granisetron.&quot; It is not clear how these analyses are used to quantitate whether an interaction is stronger than another. The interaction maps do not seem to correspond entirely to structural snapshots in e.g. Figure 5. For example, alosetron is depicted with water-bridged H-bonds to sidechains of N101 and E209, yet these interactions are listed as hydrophobic or nonexistent. Depending on the purpose of the interaction map, it also seems odd to limit lists to sidechain interactions, since several emphasized in Figure 5 are with backbone atoms. What mechanistic or drug-design implications can be derived from these maps?</p></disp-quote><p>The discussion of the drug-receptor section has been reorganized, and it now includes interaction fingerprint analysis results extended to the protein backbone from 100 ns MD simulations of the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R-setron structure (see Figure 3—figure supplement 2). The discussion includes details of these interactions with setrons, as well as those with serotonin. We have also highlighted in the text that a number of interactions seen in simulations were not directly evident from the cryo-EM structures given that they were mediated by water molecules. In addition, MD simulations capture several transient interactions arising from side-chain flexibility and drug mobility within the pocket.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 2: Authors do not thoroughly discuss LigPlot analysis. For example, are there any residues identified that are specific for one setron versus another? Granisetron has more interactions compared to others. A discussion on how data from this paper provides a basis for understanding setrons different affinities should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included an additional LigPlot analysis figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) that shows surface representation with color-coding for apolar and polar interactions. As such most of the interactions of binding-site residues with setrons appear to be hydrophobic. We have extended the section on interaction fingerprint from MD analysis that includes water molecules within the binding-pocket. As can be seen from this analysis, many of the interactions are mediated through water molecules that are not evident in the cryo-EM structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The effort to test predictions from simulations using electrophysiology is encouraging, though less than conclusive. Specifically, dynamics are said to implicate differential interactions with R65, at least for alosetron versus other agents; yet, the functional effect of R65A on alosetron appears to be intermediate.

The data provide limited new insight into antagonist actions.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewers that R65A mutational analysis while revealing a functional effect on serotonin and setron binding does not provide conclusive evidence for the differential effects of various drugs. We think that the effect of R65 is exerted in concert with neighboring residues. Additional mutagenesis and combination of mutations may be needed to understand the mechanism better. We have noted this limitation in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) A more thorough discussion and summary of the data from this study and from previously published work that support the conclusion that antagonists stabilize intermediate conformations along the activation pathway should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>Now included in the discussion of AChBP and other pLGIC.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Please discuss limitations of short 100msec simulations, which may not capture ligand bound structures found under physiological conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the following text (was from previous response to reviewer comments) in the main manuscript:</p><p>“A limitation of these standard, shorter MD simulation timescales is that dynamic transitions between multiple states or allostery between ligand-binding at the ECD and pore-opening at the TMD are not expected to be captured during runs.

We also quantified the average RMSD of each pose relative to its starting conformation by averaging over 1000 simulation snapshots (200 frames sampled every 500 ps for each of the 5 subunits treated as replicates) extracted from the 100 ns simulations for each ligand-5HT<sub>3A</sub>R complex.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 7 supplemental, MD simulation data indicate that pore radius is not different between any of the conditions.
