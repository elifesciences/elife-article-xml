Fibroblast activation is also detected under human in vitro decidualization. Similar arachidonic acid-PGI<sub>2</sub>-PPARδ-ACTIVIN A pathway is conserved in human endometrium.

Decidualization is characterized by significant proliferation, differentiation, and epithelial transition of endometrial stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tan et al., 2004</xref>). In mice, decidualization occurs only after the onset of implantation. However, decidualization can also be induced by artificial stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McConaha et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to mice, human decidualization does not require embryo implantation and is driven by the rise of postovulatory progesterone and local cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from endometrial stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>). Although decidualization is essential to the successful establishment of pregnancy, the underlying mechanism during decidualization is still poorly defined. Accumulating evidence indicates that decidualization and fibroblast activation share similar characteristics. During primate decidualization,αSMA increases at the initial stage and decreases at the final differentiation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 1999</xref>). αSMA is also strongly expressed in rat decidual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Venuto et al., 2008</xref>). αSMA expression in interstitial fibroblasts during pregnancy correlates with the onset of the decidual process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fazleabas et al., 1999</xref>). Meanwhile, αSMA is strongly expressed in myofibroblast and often recognized as the marker of fibroblast activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fujigaki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angelini et al., 2020</xref>). ATP and uric acid belong to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which are released following tissue injury or cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Nuñez, 2010</xref>). We recently demonstrated that either ATP or uric acid can induce mouse decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). It has been shown that ATP or uric acid can also stimulate fibroblast activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolmatova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Fibroblasts are the most numerous cells in connective tissue. Fibroblast activation refers to the process in which dormant quiescent fibroblasts in tissues are stimulated to form functionally active fibroblasts and perform different functions. Fibroblasts synthesize the extracellular matrix of connective tissue and play a key role in maintaining the structural integrity of most tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yoshida, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tracy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Enzerink and Vaheri, 2011</xref>). In healthy and intact tissues, fibroblasts remain a dormant and non-proliferating state. Upon stimulation, dormant fibroblasts acquire contractile properties by inducing the formation of stress fibers, resulting in the formation of myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pakshir et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tomasek et al., 2002</xref>). The myofibroblast is a specialized fibroblast expressing α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angelini et al., 2020</xref>). α-SMA is also a marker of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nurmik et al., 2020</xref>). In tumor tissues, activated stromal fibroblasts are called as CAFs and show similar characteristics with myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shimura, 2021</xref>). Under the stimulation of cytokines and growth factors, fibroblasts will transform into myofibroblasts at the initial stage and further differentiate to into functionally fibroblasts. Activated fibroblasts are characterized by expressing α-SMA, FAP, Vimentin, Desmin, S100A4(also called FSP1), Tenascin C (TNC), periostin, and SPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuzet and Gaggioli, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In adult tissues, the human endometrium undergoes cyclical shedding and bleeding, scar-free repair and regeneration in subsequent cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Salamonsen et al., 2021</xref>). In the uterus, the mesenchyme accounts for about 30–35% of the main uterine cell types. Six cell types have been identified in human endometrium, including stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, uNK, lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Based on a recent single-cell transcriptomic analysis of human endometrium, stromal cells were the most abundant cell type in the endometrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lv et al., 2022b</xref>). As mouse blastocyst begins to adhere to the luminal epithelium on day 4 of pregnancy, the activated embryo secretes a series of factors to remodel the stationary fibroblasts through epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Whether fibroblast activation is involved in embryo implantation and decidualization is still unknown.</p><p>Arachidonic acid (AA) is the biosynthetic precursor of prostaglandins in the cell membrane. CPLA<sub>2α</sub> is encoded by the <italic>Pla2g4a</italic> gene and a major provider of AA. <italic>Pla2g4a</italic> knockout mice show uneven embryo distribution and reduced litter size, suggesting that maternal uterine CPLA2α is critical for successful embryo implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Song et al., 2002</xref>). Cyclooxygenase COX is the rate-limiting enzyme for prostaglandin synthesis. COX-1 knockout mice are fertile, with only birth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim and Dey, 1997</xref>). COX-2 knockout on C57BL/6 J/129 background mice results in impaired implantation, and decidualization, indicating the important role of COX-2 during embryo implantation and decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim and Dey, 1997</xref>). Prostaglandin I<sub>2</sub> (PGI<sub>2</sub>) and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) are the two most abundant prostaglandins at the embryo implantation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lim et al., 1999</xref>). PGI<sub>2</sub> derived from COX-2 and prostacyclin synthase (PGIS) can regulate embryo implantation through peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor δ (PPARδ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lim et al., 1999</xref>). Both embryonic implantation and decidualization are abnormal in <italic>PPARδ-/-</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). Although prostaglandins are required for embryo implantation and decidualization, whether prostaglandins are involved in fibroblast activation during early pregnancy remains unclear.</p><p>This study was to analyze whether fibroblast activation is involved in mouse and human decidualization, and why fibrosis does not occur during normal early pregnancy. In this study, the multiple markers of fibroblast activation were detected during mouse in vivo and in vitro decidualization. Embryo-derived TNF was able to induce the phosphorylation of CPLA<sub>2α</sub> in luminal epithelium, which liberated AA into uterine stroma to promote fibroblast activation through COX2-PGI<sub>2</sub>-PPARδ pathway for inducing decidualization. The underlying mechanism of fibroblast activation was also conserved during human in vitro decidualization. This study offers novel insights into the function of fibroblasts during embryo implantation and decidualization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fibroblast activation is present during mouse early pregnancy</title><p>S100A4, αSMA, TNC, and SPARC are well-recognized markers of fibroblast activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuzet and Gaggioli, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prime et al., 2017</xref>). Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry showed that TNC, SPARC, and S100A4 were mainly localized in the primary decidual region after embryo implantation. SPARC immunofluorescence was strongly observed in subluminal stromal cells from D4.5 to D5.5. However, TNC immunostaining was strongly detected in subluminal stromal cells on D4, D4.5, and D5, but disappeared on D5.5.

E2F8 and CYCLIN D3 are markers of polyploidy during mouse decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qi et al., 2015</xref>).

In order to examine whether fibroblast activation is involved in mouse decidualization, mouse stromal cells were treated with S100A4, SPARC, TNC, and ACTIVIN A to induce in vitro decidualization, respectively. TNC treatment upregulated the protein levels of WNT4 and CYCLIN D3, but had no obvious effects on BMP2, E2F8, and <italic>Prl8a2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

SPARC treatment on mouse stromal cells had no significant effect on decidualization markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Because ACTIVIN A is secreted under fibroblast activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loomans and Andl, 2014</xref>), we examined ACTIVIN A protein levels in the uteri on D4 and D4.5 of pregnancy and pseudopregnant (PD4, PD4.5) mice, respectively. The level of ACTIVIN A protein on D4 was 1.75-folds that of PD4 mice, and the level of ACTIVIN A protein on D4.5 was 3.77-folds that of PD4.5 mice. The protein level of ACTIVIN A on D4.5 was 1.88-folds higher than that on D4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), indicating that the secretion of ACTIVIN A increased after embryo implantation. After mouse stromal cells were treated with ACTIVIN A, all the protein levels of BMP2, WNT4, E2F8, CYCLIN D3, and <italic>Prl8a2</italic> were obviously up-regulated 1.35, 2.36, 3.11, 1.90, and 6.29 folds, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H, I</xref>).

The induction of AA on <italic>IGFBP1</italic> and <italic>PRL</italic> mRNA expression was significantly abrogated by either COX-2 inhibitor NS398 or PPARδ antagonist GSK0660 (1.85 and 4.63 folds; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Under human in vitro decidualization (MPA +cAMP 500 μM), the mRNA levels of <italic>IGFBP1</italic> and <italic>PRL</italic> were also significantly up-regulated by ACTIVIN A treatment (6.62 and 1.61 folds; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).

Taken together, these results suggested that epithelium-derived AA could promote fibroblast activation through COX-2-PGI<sub>2</sub>-PPARδ pathway and induce decidualization via ACTIVIN A during human decidualization, which was also consistent with the results in mice.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>AA-PGI2-PPARδ-ACTIVIN A regulation on human decidualization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) QPCR analysis of <italic>IGFBP1</italic> and <italic>PRL</italic> mRNA levels after stromal 4003 cells were treated with AA.

We also showed that the pathway underlying fibroblast activation was conserved in mice and humans.</p><p>Fibroblast activation could be identified by many markers, including α-SMA, TNC, POSTN, NG-2, PDGF receptor-a/b, S100A4and FAP. These fibroblast markers expressed alone or in combination and could be used to identify distinct subpopulations following fibroblast activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prime et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grinnell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oliver et al., 1999</xref>). Fibroblast activation plays an important role under many physiological or pathological conditions, such as cancer, injury repair and fibrosis. However, the regulation and function of fibroblast activation during decidualization remain unknown. In our study, the regulation and function of fibroblast activation was confirmed by multiple approaches during mouse and human decidualization. A study from single-cell analysis of human decidual cells also suggests the presence of fibroblast activation during human in vitro decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stadtmauer and Wagner, 2022</xref>). Based on fibroblast activation markers, we confirmed the existence of fibroblast activation during early pregnancy. Fibroblasts are generally in a dormant and quiescent state in tissues, and are only activated when stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pakshir et al., 2020</xref>). In a previous study, mPGES1-derived PGE<sub>2</sub> supports the early inflammatory phase of wound healing and may stimulate subsequent fibroblast activation early after damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stratton and Shiwen, 2010</xref>). Although PGE<sub>2</sub> has been shown to be essential for mouse decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holmes and Gordashko, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baskar et al., 1981</xref>), PGE<sub>2</sub> was ineffective in activating fibroblast activation in our study. Additionally, PGE2 has no obvious effect on Prl8a2 mRNA level under mouse in vitro decidualization. Our study indicated that AA from luminal epithelium was able to induce fibroblast activation via PGI<sub>2</sub>-PPARδ pathway. Previous studies indicated that AA could promote mouse decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tessier-Prigent et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Handwerger et al., 1981</xref>). PGI<sub>2</sub> has been identified to be essential for mouse decidualization via PPARδ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lim et al., 1999</xref>). It is shown that multiple factors are able to induce in vitro decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>). In our study, AA-PGI<sub>2</sub> pathway is involved in stimulating decidualization. previous studies indicate that PGI<sub>2</sub> can also activate a cAMP signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fetalvero et al., 2008</xref>). It is possible that AA may also act on decidualization through cAMP. Our study also confirmed AA secretion during either mouse or human in vitro decidualization, which may have positive feedback during in vitro decidualization. In our study, AA concentration in uterine lumen was significantly increased during embryo attachment. AA, PGI<sub>2</sub> or PPARδ agonist was able to induce fibroblast activation.</p><p>Activated fibroblasts play key roles in the injury response, tumorigenesis, fibrosis, and inflammation through secreting different factors in different physiological or pathological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avery et al., 2018</xref>). Myofibroblast marker α-SMA has been shown to be one of the important markers of early decidualization in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 1999</xref>), and sterile inflammatory secretion of products such as ATP and uric acid after injury has been shown to stimulate fibroblast activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolmatova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao et al., 2018</xref>) and uterine decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>), so we speculate that fibroblast activation is strongly correlated with decidualization. Because α-SMA, TNC, SPARC, S100A4, and ACTIVIN A were all identified during fibroblast activation, we examined the role of each of these markers during mouse decidualization. We found that only ACTIVIN A was able to induce mouse in vitro decidualization. The function of ACTIVIN A during human decidualization was also confirmed in our study. ACTIVIN A has been shown to be important for human decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). ACTIVIN A, its functional receptors, and binding proteins, are abundant in human endometrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 1999</xref>). Our study indicated that AA-PGI<sub>2</sub>-PPARδ axis stimulated fibroblast activation and induced decidualization through ACTIVIN A.</p><p>The adequate molecular interaction between the endometrium and the blastocyst is critical for successful implantation and decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Massimiani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Latifi et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, there was a big difference of both markers of fibroblast activation and P-CPLA2α between pregnancy and pseudopregnancy, and between delayed and activated implantation, strongly suggesting the involvement of embryos in these processes. Although S100A9, HB-EGF, and TNF are previously shown to be secreted by blastocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamatani et al., 2004</xref>), TNF was the only one to stimulate both S100A4 and TNC, and to phosphorylate CPLA<sub>2α</sub> in our study. CPLA<sub>2α</sub> is a major provider of AA. <italic>Pla2g4a</italic>–/–mice results in deferred implantation and deranged gestational development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Song et al., 2002</xref>). We also showed that AA concentration in luminal fluid was significantly increased in day 4 evening when the embryos just implanted. TNF is present in the reactivated blastocyst and human blastocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lv et al., 2022a</xref>), and may play a critical role during embryo implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">You et al., 2021</xref>). In our study, we confirmed that TNF stimulated the phosphorylation of CPLA<sub>2α</sub> and AA release from luminal epithelium. A proper interaction between embryo attachment and decidualization is critical for successful pregnancy.</p><p>Activated fibroblasts play an important role in many physiological and pathologic processes. Excessive fibroblast activation can lead to fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Truffi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giusti et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yeo et al., 2018</xref>). Fibroblast activation may be present and balanced during normal pregnancy without ultimately leading to fibrosis or other diseases. S100A4 is hypomethylated and overexpressed in grade 3 endometrioid tumors compared with benign endometrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xie et al., 2007</xref>). Genetic and proteomic analysis of surgical specimens from 14 patients with uterine leiomyoma showed that TNC is significantly upregulated in patient samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jamaluddin et al., 2019</xref>). Fibrosis mostly occurs in pathological conditions. Intrauterine adhesions (IUA), also known as Asherman’s syndrome, are caused by endometrial fibrosis as a result of injury to the uterus’s basal lining, resulting in partial or total adhesions in the uterine cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Healy et al., 2016</xref>). IUA can interfere with the embryo’s implantation and development, resulting in decreased or even full loss of intrauterine volume, female infertility, and recurrent miscarriages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leung et al., 2021</xref>). The thin endometrial model exhibits a higher degree of fibrosis than normal controls, which is thought to be a crucial component in embryo implantation failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). The key question is why fibrosis doesn’t occur during normal early pregnancy? Both activins and inhibits are expressed in pregnant uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ni and Li, 2017</xref>). In our study, <italic>Fst</italic> was significantly up-regulated under in vitro decidualization although ACTIVIN A was able to stimulate in vitro decidualization. FST is a secreted glycoprotein and can neutralize the profibrotic and proinflammatory actions of ACTIVINS. FST has a strong antifibrotic effect in various organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patella et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, FST is shown to be critical for mouse decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fullerton et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, AA was able to induce fibroblast activation and promote decidualization in our study. A recent study showed that 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid, a metabolite of AA can alleviate pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). It is possible that a physiological level of fibroblast activation is beneficial for decidualization and the long-lasting fibroblast activation could be balanced by certain molecules, like FST or AA metabolite.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we identified that embryos-derived TNF is able to phosphorylate CPLA<sub>2α</sub> for releasing AA from luminal epithelium. AA can physiologically induce fibroblast activation and promote decidualization via PGI<sub>2</sub>-PPARδ-ACTIVIN A axis. This regulatory mechanism is also conserved in mice and humans. Overall, this study should shed a light on the novel mechanism underlying decidualization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ricardo Azziz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Günter P. Wagner (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The abstract need to be restructured, specifically the section objective does not list objectives as such, but is rather a series of unconnected sentences that have more to do with an introduction. The objectives paragraph should include the objective. The authors finish the section with the hypothesis, but the objective is not directly mentioned.</p><p>2. The authors must rewrite the introduction. The current introduction is full of different ideas not interconnected, which makes it difficult to follow the background for understanding methods and results. Perhaps, the authors can use the same style that in the Discussion section which is clearer and better structured. I suggest the next flow:</p><p>Start with endometrial decidualization, which is the major topic of the paper, and finish this part by mentioning that although the underlying mechanisms are not fully described there is a similarity with fibroblast activation. Then, the authors can explain the background of fibroblast activation, including the markers that are assessed in the study. The question in the discussion &quot;why fibrosis doesn't occur during normal early pregnancy?&quot; can be included to remark on a striking point of their hypothesis. Finally, once the authors set up what is known and unknown, they can finish with the last paragraph which is appropriate if the information exposed before is improved.</p><p>3. Cheng et al., have used several techniques to test their hypothesis. However, there are some aspects of material and methods that should be addressed to promote the understanding and reproducibility of results. First of all, in every section, it must be clarified the type of sample on which the technique is applied. For example, in line 165, immunofluorescence in which frozen sections are applied. Additionally, in immunohistochemistry and immunostaining, it must appear the antibody dilution in each molecule tested as well as secondary antibodies. In this section, it is very important to detail the experimental steps in order to be able to repeat the test if necessary. In the section &quot;Isolation and treatment of mouse endometrial cells&quot; there is a lack of information regarding the cell types used and the concentrations of molecules tested. Although they appear in the Results section, they should also be included in this section specifying that different concentrations were used and even naming a reference article where these concentrations are used, if available.</p><p>4. Technical and biological replicates must appear in Materials and methods and results to check the robustness and reproducibility of the assays performed and the results presented. Especially, they should include the sample size of human donors.</p><p>5. Concentration of the reagents used must be included in the methodology to ensure the reproducibility of the assays.</p><p>6. Authors should always refer to treatment days in the same way. For example, when they refer to day 4 or day 5 of pregnancy (line 292) the fists time should appear day 4 (D4) and the rest of the time should always be referred to as D4 as well as in the case where they refer to hours, in some cases they use the terminology morning, midnight and other times the specific hour, authors may use always the same term.</p><p>7. In figure 1 (line 299) the molecule POSTN does not appear in the results.</p><p>8. In line 315 authors mentioned SPARC overexpression, why it does not appear in the Materials and methods section? and why they use a plasmid in this case with this molecule? It seems that is out of context, authors should clarify this decision.</p><p>9. Why do authors not test the classical Prl8a2 and Alpl as classical decidualization markers in mice decidualization? The base of the paper is culture cell decidualization, thus the authors should robustly demonstrate their cultures are decidualized. The Prl8a2 just appears in figure 4.</p><p>10. In the presentation of the results the authors refer to changes in some genes or proteins as &quot;significant&quot; where they presumably mean a p-value of &lt;0.05. However, it is more important to report the estimated effect size (fold change, difference, or similar) than just &quot;significance.&quot; Limiting the reporting of experimental results to p-values is a major problem in the scientific literature and needs to be changed to include reference to effect sizes.</p><p>11. The authors should use siRNA knockdown experiments to prove Activin A role in the process. The authors should reevaluate the epithelial coculture experiments and Ishikawa experiments. Maybe including no epithelial cells in the coculture experiments as a control will validate their use of these cells Finally remove the Trisomy 16 experiments or develop them further.</p><p>The authors should use siRNA knockdown experiments to prove Activin A role in the process.

The Materials and methods section is not well structured, and the level of detail does not allow the replication of the experiments carried out (dose, time, dilutions, statistics performed) to check the robustness and reproducibility of the assays performed and the results presented. There is a lack of consistency between the time of exposure in different experiments (3h, 6h, 12h, 24h), as well as, decidualization stimulus (E2+P4 or cAMP+MPA) used and time of exposure (24h, 2d, 4d, 5d…) that is a basic requirement for the comparison between experiments. Finally, the experiments need to show more detail in the graphs bar showing the values for each sample and indicating if it is a sample or experimental replicate, controls/normalization values used in each experiment, quantification of IHC and IF experiments, and all the western blot used for calculated protein quantification in the supplemental material (from the different experiments performed). Finally, the experiment using decidua samples with fetal 16 trisomy is very interconnected and there is a lack of clinical detail of these samples and which objective is being followed to include them.</p><p>1.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Diane Harper (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Lack of effect of PGE2 on FB activation: the effect of PGE2 depends on the PTGER that is expressed in those cells. It has been shown that decidualization is specifically dependent on PTGER2/EP2. In human ESF EP2 expression is induced by progesterone, so the question is whether the PGE2 experiment was done in the presence of progesterone/MPA.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This revision is addressing most of my concerns and my assessment is that this is an important paper. The main finding is that endometrial stromal cells undergo a two step transformation during decidualization, first a step that leads to a state homologous to fibroblast activation and in a second step the activated fibroblast state converts into the decidual cell type. This model has been suggested before, but this paper is adding a large amount of experimental evidence and maps a particular causal pathway involved in this process.</p><p>While this work is well done and important, it does raise obvious questions with respect to previous results that at least should be discussed, even if only so briefly. In their paper the authors say that the signal for decidualization is arachidonic acid (AA) produced in the luminal epithelial cells and show that AA in vitro is sufficient to induce at least FB activation. In the classical in vitro model human ESF are decidualized by MPA and cAMP, and there is no AA present as far as one would expect. How do the authors explain that discrepancy? Is the AA pathway parallel to the MPA cAMP, where the latter stands for some kind of signal acting through a GPCR?</p><p>Line 51: the phrase &quot;local cAMP&quot; is still not adequate, since it is specifically the production of cAMP in the ESF activating PKA. &quot;Local&quot; is too unspecific.</p><p>Line 84: &quot;attachment to the luminal epithelium&quot; rather than &quot;attachment onto the uterus&quot;. The latter could mean to the outside of the uterus.</p><p>Line 102: what does CD1 is referring to here? CD1 is a protein, and PPARd is not CD1.</p><p>Line 109: Embryo-derived.</p><p>Line 118: FSP1 is not a clear designation, since there are at least three genes with this alias (S100A4, ATL1, AIFM2). Please use unique signifiers. On line 412, the authors reveal that they are talking about S110A4, but that is way too late in the manuscript. And confusing aliases should be avoided generally.Figure 3 A, and line 181: again, these experiments with PGE2 seem to be done in the absence of P4 and are thus irrelevant since PGE2 receptor expression is controlled by progesterone.</p><p>The textual description of the results in Figures 3 D to G hides a much more complex picture of concentration dependent up and downregulation.</p><p>Line 208: write out “Arachidonic Acid” at least in the title of a section and only then use an acronym.</p><p>Line 427: the term “COX2 induced PGI2” is inaccurate. COX2 does not “induce” PGI2, but produces the precursor for ALL prostaglandins. In this context “PGI2” alone is sufficient.</p><p>Line 458: better “A proper coordination between embryo attachment and decidualization…&quot;. Relate two processes (attachment and decidualization) rather than a thing (the embryo) and a process (decidualization).</p><p>Lines 459 to 468: all of that is correct but seems tangential to the findings reported in this paper.</p><p>Line 47“: &quot;Ashman's&quot; or &quot;Asherman's&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82970.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

In this section, it is very important to detail the experimental steps in order to be able to repeat the test if necessary. In the section &quot;Isolation and treatment of mouse endometrial cells&quot; there is a lack of information regarding the cell types used and the concentrations of molecules tested. Although they appear in the Results section, they should also be included in this section specifying that different concentrations were used and even naming a reference article where these concentrations are used, if available.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the detailed information was provided in our revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Technical and biological replicates must appear in Materials and methods and results to check the robustness and reproducibility of the assays performed and the results presented. Especially, they should include the sample size of human donors.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the information on replicates was provided in our revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Concentration of the reagents used must be included in the methodology to ensure the reproducibility of the assays.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the concentration of the reagents used was provided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Authors should always refer to treatment days in the same way. For example, when they refer to day 4 or day 5 of pregnancy (line 292) the fists time should appear day 4 (D4) and the rest of the time should always be referred to as D4 as well as in the case where they refer to hours, in some cases they use the terminology morning, midnight and other times the specific hour, authors may use always the same term.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the concentration of the reagents used was provided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In figure 1 (line 299) the molecule POSTN does not appear in the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for this mistake. POSTN was deleted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In line 315 authors mentioned SPARC overexpression, why it does not appear in the Materials and methods section, and why do they use a plasmid in this case with this molecule? It seems that is out of context, authors should clarify this decision.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree with you. We newly bought recombinant SPARC protein and redid this treatment. The results from SPARC overexpression was replaced by recombinant SPARC in Figure 2E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Why do authors not test the classical Prl8a2 and Alpl as classical decidualization markers in mice decidualization? The base of the paper is culture cell decidualization, thus the authors should robustly demonstrate their cultures are decidualized. The Prl8a2 just appears in figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree with you. Data from Prl8a2 were provided in Figures 2B, 2D, 2F, 2I, 3F, and 3H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In the presentation of the results, the authors refer to changes in some genes or proteins as &quot;significant&quot; where they presumably mean a p-value of &lt;0.05. However, it is more important to report the estimated effect size (fold change, difference, or similar) than just &quot;significance.&quot; Limiting the reporting of experimental results to p-values is a major problem in the scientific literature and needs to be changed to include reference to effect sizes.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree with you. The fold changes were provided in our revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors should use siRNA knockdown experiments to prove Activin A role in the process. The authors should reevaluate the epithelial coculture experiments and Ishikawa experiments. Maybe including no epithelial cells in the coculture experiments as a control will validate their use of these cells Finally remove the Trisomy 16 experiments or develop them further.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, siRNA knockdown on Activin A was performed and data was provided in Figure 8F and 8G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Lack of effect of PGE2 on FB activation: the effect of PGE2 depends on the PTGER that is expressed in those cells. It has been shown that decidualization is specifically dependent on PTGER2/EP2. In human ESF EP2 expression is induced by progesterone, so the question is whether the PGE2 experiment was done in the presence of progesterone/MPA.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree with you. When mouse stromal cell were treated with PGE2 under in vitro decidualization (estrogen and progesterone), there was an increase of TNC and SPARC, but PGE2 had no obvious effect on αSMA (A). This result was provided in Figure 3A. When human stromal cells were treated with PGE2 under in vitro decidualization (MPA and dbcAMP), PGE2 had no obvious effects on the protein levels of αSMA, TNC and SPARC (B).</p><p>Based on these results, it seems that PGI2 action on fibroblast activation is stronger than PGE2. The effects of PGE2 on fibroblast activation should be slightly different from decidualization induction. As you mentioned, PGE2 should be important for human in vitro decidualization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This revision is addressing most of my concerns and my assessment is that this is an important paper. The main finding is that endometrial stromal cells undergo a two step transformation during decidualization, first a step that leads to a state homologous to fibroblast activation and in a second step the activated fibroblast state converts into the decidual cell type. This model has been suggested before, but this paper is adding a large amount of experimental evidence and maps a particular causal pathway involved in this process.</p><p>While this work is well done and important, it does raise obvious questions with respect to previous results that at least should be discussed, even if only so briefly. In their paper the authors say that the signal for decidualization is arachidonic acid (AA) produced in the luminal epithelial cells and show that AA in vitro is sufficient to induce at least FB activation. In the classical in vitro model human ESF are decidualized by MPA and cAMP, and there is no AA present as far as one would expect. How do the authors explain that discrepancy? Is the AA pathway parallel to the MPA cAMP, where the latter stands for some kind of signal acting through a GPCR?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree with you. Although our study indicated that AA-PGI2 pathway induce fibroblast activation and decidualization, previous studies also showed that PGI2 is able to activate cAMP signaling pathway (Beck et al., 2014; Fetalvero et al., 2008). It is possible that PGI2 may also induce fibroblast activation and decidualization through cAMP pathway. Additionally, our study also confirmed AA secretion during either mouse or human in vitro decidualization (Figure 8H for mouse and I for human in vitro decidualization, respectively), which may have positive feedback during in vitro decidualization.
