phosphatase receptor-type kappa (PTPRK) is a transmembrane receptor that links extracellular homophilic interactions to intracellular catalytic activity. Previously we showed that PTPRK promotes cell–cell adhesion by selectively dephosphorylating several cell junction regulators including the protein Afadin (Fearnley et al, 2019). Here, we demonstrate that Afadin is recruited for dephosphorylation by directly binding to the PTPRK D2 pseudophosphatase domain. We mapped this interaction to a putative coiled coil (CC) domain in Afadin that is separated by more than 100 amino acids from the substrate pTyr residue. We identify the residues that define PTP specificity, explaining how Afadin is selectively dephosphorylated by PTPRK yet not by the closely related receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTPRM. Our work demonstrates that PTP substrate specificity can be determined by protein–protein interactions distal to the active site. This explains how PTPRK and other PTPs achieve substrate specificity despite a lack of specific sequence context at the substrate pTyr. Furthermore, by demonstrating that these interactions are phosphorylation-independent and mediated via binding to a non-catalytic domain, we highlight how receptor PTPs could function as intracellular scaffolds in addition to catalyzing protein dephosphorylation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phosphatase</kwd><kwd>enzyme-substrate</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>protein complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome and Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>109407/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharpe</surname><given-names>Hayley J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>219447/Z/19/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deane</surname><given-names>Janet E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UF100371</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deane</surname><given-names>Janet E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Kinases (PTKs) and phosphatases (PTPs) act in concert to maintain cellular phosphotyrosine (pTyr) levels. Dysregulation of this balance is associated with disease, including tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arora and Scholar, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hunter and Sefton, 1980</xref>). The importance of these pathways is exemplified by the clinical use of PTK inhibitors and efforts to therapeutically target PTPs. It has been challenging to develop PTP inhibitors due to their highly charged active sites, as well as their lack of selectivity at the peptide level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 2009</xref>). Despite a lack of specific consensus sequences for pTyr substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ren et al., 2011</xref>), PTPs show marked substrate specificity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fearnley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Saxena et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, understanding how PTPs engage their substrates could lead to the development of alternative strategies to target them in the clinic.</p><p>Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type kappa (PTPRK) is a member of the R2B family of transmembrane receptor (R)PTPs that supports cell adhesion and has been implicated as a tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McArdle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shimozato et al., 2015</xref>). Like other receptor PTPs, PTPRK possesses two intracellular PTP domains, one catalytically active proximal to the plasma membrane (D1) and a distal inactive, pseudophosphatase (D2). We previously showed that for several PTPRK substrates the active D1 PTP domain itself appears not to be the sole determinant of substrate binding. Instead, the inactive D2 domains of PTPRK and its paralog PTPRM were shown to have critical roles in substrate recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fearnley et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, we identified Afadin (MLLT4/AF6) as a PTPRK substrate and identified that it is recruited via the PTPRK D2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fearnley et al., 2019</xref>). In a similar paradigm, structural studies of the PTPRC-ICD suggested a potential role for the D2 domain in substrate recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nam et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that the presence of the PTPRC-D2 is critical for the recruitment and dephosphorylation of several proposed substrates, including the T cell receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kashio et al., 1998</xref>) and the Lck Src-family tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Felberg et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Afadin is a conserved junctional plaque protein, important for linking cell surface adhesion molecules to the cytoskeleton, and is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Niessen and Gottardi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yu and Zallen, 2020</xref>). Afadin deletion in mice is embryonically lethal and leads to dysregulated junctions and polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhadanov et al., 1999</xref>). It is a large (&gt;200 kDa) protein possessing multiple folded domains and extended regions of predicted disorder. The annotation of these domains, as described in UniProt (UniProt ID: P55196), is in good agreement with predictions of ordered/structured regions as calculated by AlphaFold2 (AF2) and IUPred3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Erdős et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This modular domain structure allows Afadin to engage in multivalent interactions through distinct domains. Afadin is an effector of GTP-bound Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goudreault et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Smith et al., 2017</xref>), placing it downstream of activated receptor tyrosine kinases. It can also play a structural role, linking adhesion receptors, such as nectins, to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Takai and Nakanishi, 2003</xref>). It participates in additional scaffolding functions, for example, its PDZ domain binds the plekstrin homology (PH) domain-containing adherens junction protein PLEKHA7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kurita et al., 2013</xref>). Its interaction with LGN, a protein involved in spindle orientation during cytokinesis, was characterized structurally and showed binding to a C-terminal disordered region of Afadin, adjacent to its F-actin binding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carminati et al., 2016</xref>). This structure clearly demonstrates that these disordered regions of Afadin can engage in specific interactions via formation of elongated peptide interfaces along extended surfaces of partner proteins. Within one of these extended, disordered regions of Afadin lies residue Y1230, the tyrosine that was identified as the putative target for dephosphorylation by the PTPRK D1 domain as it was hyperphosphorylated in PTPRK knockout (KO) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fearnley et al., 2019</xref>). Phosphorylation of Afadin is required for its interaction with SHP-2 and is important for downstream signaling by platelet-derived growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nakata et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, Afadin is an essential regulator of adherens junctions that mediates phosphorylation-dependent and multivalent protein–protein interactions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PTPRK interacts directly with the Afadin C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) region.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: schematic of full-length human Afadin, with domain annotation based on UniProt ID P55196, showing Ras-association (RAS, yellow), CC (green), forkhead-associated (FHA, orange), dilute (DIL, blue), PDZ (pink), F-actin binding (magenta) domains, and LGN-binding peptide motif (black).

This raises the question of whether the interaction is mediated by a region of Afadin that does not encompass the phospho-peptide or is mediated via an additional binding partner. Interestingly, the paralogous PTPRM did not recruit and dephosphorylate Afadin, indicating distinct specificities even within the same family of receptors. In contrast, the D2 domain of an inactive paralog PTPRU was sufficient to recruit Afadin to the PTPRK D1 for dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hay et al., 2020</xref>). To define the molecular details of R2B PTP substrate specificity, the interaction of PTPRK with its substrate Afadin was investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PTPRK dephosphorylates Afadin Y1230 in a D2 domain-dependent manner</title><p>Previous work has shown that the Afadin residue Y1230 is hyperphosphorylated in PTPRK KO epithelial cells, suggesting that this is a tyrosine targeted for dephosphorylation by PTPRK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fearnley et al., 2019</xref>). To test this, we generated an antibody against a synthetic tyrosine phosphorylated peptide corresponding to amino acids 1224–1235 of Afadin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Consistent with our previous tyrosine phosphoproteomics data, a band at the predicted molecular weight of the longest isoform of Afadin is detected at higher levels in PTPRK KO compared to WT MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This band is increased by pervanadate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huyer et al., 1997</xref>), a cell treatment that globally increases protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and is decreased by knockdown of Afadin using siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). It should be noted that phosphorylation appears to interfere with the signal when using an anti-Afadin (epitope: 1091–1233) antibody from BD Transduction Laboratories on immunoblots, resulting in decreased intensity when Afadin is phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and C</xref>). To further validate the site specificity of the Afadin-pY1230 antibody, we generated tyrosine to phenylalanine (YF) mutants of mScarlet-tagged Afadin. The antigenic phosphopeptide used as an epitope possesses two tyrosine residues, Y1226 and Y1230, which we mutated alone or in combination. mScarlet-Afadin phosphorylation, as detected by our antibody, increased with pervanadate treatment and was completely reversed by calf intestinal phosphatase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). However, there was no detectable increase in signal upon pervanadate treatment of mScarlet-Afadin-Y1230F mutants, supporting that this is the predominant phosphosite recognized by our Afadin phosphoantibody. We previously demonstrated that the PTPRK ICD, but not the PTPRK D1 domain alone, dephosphorylates Afadin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fearnley et al., 2019</xref>). This is recapitulated using the pY1230 Afadin antibody after incubation of recombinant domains with pervanadate-treated, DTT-quenched, MCF10A lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Over a time course, PTPRK-ICD shows greater activity against Afadin pY1230 than PTPRK-D1. In contrast, p120<sup>Cat</sup> was dephosphorylated equally by the two domains, with minimal dephosphorylation of the non-substrate control, paxillin-pY118. Finally, the observed hyperphosphorylation of Afadin Y1230 in PTPRK KO MCF10A cell lysates could be reduced by doxycycline-induced expression of PTPRK to wildtype levels, but not by a catalytically inactive mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F and G</xref>). Together, these data confirm that this new antibody is specific to Afadin phosphorylated at Y1230 and that pY1230 is targeted for dephosphorylation by PTPRK in a D2 domain-dependent manner. This pTyr residue is located in the C-terminal half of Afadin within an extended region of predicted disorder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Therefore, to assay direct binding of Afadin to PTPRK, recombinant full-length Afadin was expressed in vitro using a wheat germ-based cell-free translation system. Bacterially expressed and biotinylated PTPRK intracellular domain (ICD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) was immobilized on streptavidin beads for pull-downs from wheat germ lysate containing full-length Afadin. We observed clear binding of full-length Afadin to the PTPRK-ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), consistent with a direct interaction. To determine whether PTPRK binds a region of Afadin incorporating tyrosine 1230, pull-downs were performed using C-terminal truncations of Afadin produced in wheat germ lysate. Deletion of the Afadin C-terminal disordered tail was sufficient to abolish binding to PTPRK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, aa. 1–1097). However, additional truncations showed substantial nonspecific binding to the streptavidin resin hindering further interaction mapping using this strategy (e.g., aa. 1–972, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>We next mapped PTPRK binding to the Afadin C-terminus in more detail using GST-fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). A GST-fusion construct encompassing the entire C-terminal disordered region of Afadin, shown to be important in the wheat germ system, also showed direct binding to PTPRK, supporting the identification of this region as sufficient for binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Several truncation constructs within this region were tested for binding to PTPRK, clearly identifying that only constructs containing a short, 63-residue predicted coiled-coil (CC) region spanning residues 1393–1455 was able to bind PTPRK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Therefore, this CC region is both necessary and sufficient for binding to the PTPRK-ICD. The sequence composition of this region of Afadin (Afadin-CC) includes a high proportion of charged residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that the PTPRK–Afadin interaction could be electrostatically mediated. In support of this, the PTPRK–Afadin interaction was sensitive to salt concentration, with less GST-Afadin-CC present in PTPRK pull-downs at increasing NaCl concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Further, PTPRK-ICD and Afadin-CC have complementary predicted isoelectric points (pI = 5.3 and 10.2, respectively), suggesting that these fragments would retain charge complementarity at physiological pH. Together, these data show that the PTPRK-ICD interacts directly and specifically with the C-terminal Afadin-CC region.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Afadin-CC and PTPRK D2 form a 1:1 complex</title><p>CC domains consist of heptad repeats (designated a–g), in which residues ‘a’ and ‘d’ are generally nonpolar, forming a hydrophobic seam that facilitates oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Truebestein and Leonard, 2016</xref>). The primary sequence of the Afadin-CC region is highly charged and does not maintain this pattern of hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that it may not be a bona fide CC. To test whether the Afadin-CC forms higher oligomers, the GST tag was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the Afadin-CC alone was analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS). This technique allows for the direct measurement of the molar mass of a particle in solution and demonstrated that the Afadin-CC is a monomer, with a molecular mass of ~8 kDa (predicted mass = 8.3 kDa, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The chromatography trace also revealed a small amount of truncated Afadin-CC, suggesting that following removal of the GST tag this region may be prone to some degradation. To further characterize the interaction of the PTPRK-ICD with Afadin-CC, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed to measure the binding affinity and stoichiometry. Afadin-CC (without the GST tag) forms an equimolar complex with PTPRK-ICD with a binding affinity in the low micromolar range (K<sub>D</sub> = 3.2 ± 0.6 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and E</xref>). This binding affinity is consistent with a reversible, transient protein–protein interaction as expected for an enzyme-substrate complex. The high ΔH of this interaction (–17.6 ± 0.7 kcal/mol) indicates it is enthalpically driven, consistent with the highly charged nature of the Afadin-CC region.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>PTPRK:Afadin-CC forms an equimolar complex with micromolar affinity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis of Afadin-CC.

To investigate the contribution of the D2 domain to Afadin binding, pull-downs against Afadin-CC were performed using biotinylated PTPRK ICD, D1 and D2 domains. The PTPRK-D2 domain alone was sufficient to bind Afadin-CC to similar levels observed for the full ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). No interaction of Afadin-CC with the PTPRK-D1 domain was observed, highlighting that the D2 domain is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with this part of Afadin. To confirm this, ITC experiments were performed monitoring the binding of the Afadin-CC to the PTPRK-D2 domain. These data produced very similar results to those for the full ICD, specifically the Afadin-CC forms an equimolar complex with the PTPRK-D2 domain with a binding affinity in the low micromolar range (K<sub>D</sub> = 6.3 ± 0.3 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>).

Therefore, we exploited recent advances in deep learning neural network techniques by using AlphaFold2 (AF2)-Multimer to model the complex based on the truncation mapping data. Initial structural predictions were performed using the PTPRK-D2 domain (aa. 1154–1446) with Afadin-CC (aa. 1393–1455) as inputs. The AF2 model of PTPRK-D2 in complex with the full Afadin-CC fragment used for biochemical characterization highlighted that many residues at both the N- and C-termini of the Afadin-CC may not be contributing to the putative interaction interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, further mapping experiments to refine the binding region of the Afadin-CC were conducted. Both N- and C-terminal truncations of GST-Afadin-CC were expressed, purified, and tested in pull-downs for their ability to bind PTPRK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For N-terminal truncations of Afadin-CC, residues 1393–1400, which are predicted to be unstructured and outside the core helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), were replaced with an equivalent glycine/serine linker sequence to avoid the possibility of steric hindrance with the N-terminal GST-tag during mapping experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In agreement with the initial AF2 model, regions at both the N- and C-termini of Afadin-CC were dispensable for the interaction, while disruption of the core sequence encompassing the charged residues (aa. 1408–1448) resulted in a lack of detectable binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Importantly, additional mutations to residues distal from the interface (R1410, Q1443, T1446) do not interfere with binding to PTPRK.

Interestingly, a cluster of four residues mapped to a region of the PTPRK-D2 surface that is predicted to be the binding site for Afadin-CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and are located adjacent to several Afadin-CC residues that we have shown to be necessary for complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). This binding site is located on the opposite face relative to the cysteine of the would-be ‘active’ site in the PTPRK-D2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Although these residues of PTPRK (Y1270, G1273, E1332, and L1335) are not all highly charged, within the context of the PTPRK model they form an acidic pocket into which the Afadin-CC is predicted to bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). To investigate potential molecular differences at this site, a PTPRM-D2 (aa. 1160–1452) AF2 model was generated to allow comparison to PTPRK-D2. Strikingly, in a model of the PTPRM-D2 the altered residues in this region result in a different surface topology and charge, having lost the acidic pocket observed for PTPRK-D2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). These changes in surface properties may therefore account for the differential binding to Afadin.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>PTPRK binds Afadin-CC via an acidic pocket distal from the D2 ‘active’ site.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Conservation mapping of the PTPRK-D2:Afadin-CC interface.

Specifically, PTPRK-G1273 was mutated to histidine (G1273H) and L1335 to arginine (L1335R). These changes to PTPRM-equivalent residues are predicted to cause steric hindrance (G1273H) or introduce a basic residue into the acidic pocket (L1335R). Each of these single-point mutations were sufficient to abolish the interaction of the PTPRK-D2 with the GST-Afadin-CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, the introduction of both mutations (double mutant [DM]) into the PTPRK-D2 or full PTPRK-ICD prevents binding to Afadin-CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). To quantify the loss in affinity due to these point mutations, ITC binding experiments were repeated using the PTPRK-D2-DM with Afadin-CC and no binding was detected, confirming loss of the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). To further confirm that these mutations could interfere with Afadin binding in the context of the full-length protein, wheat germ lysate pull-downs were repeated with WT and DM PTPRK constructs. While PTPRK-ICD and PTPRK-D2 bind Afadin, introduction of these two mutations into PTPRK reduces Afadin binding to background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Two additional mutations were introduced into the PTPRK-D2 domain to test the predicted complex model. The first, F1225A, alters the PTPRK residue that is predicted to interact with the W1418-Y1419 residues in Afadin that were essential for binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This single-point mutation (F1225A) in PTPRK-D2 vastly reduces binding to the Afadin-CC domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). This residue is conserved across the R2B family so although it contributes to the binding affinity and validates the complex model, it does not contribute to specificity. Another mutation (labeled the ‘M-loop’) was introduced at the edge of the interface, changing residues CEE in PTPRK (aa. 1372–1374) to the PTPRM-equivalent YNG (aa. 1378–1380) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This mutation retains binding, suggesting that this loop does not contribute to specificity of Afadin binding to PTPRK versus PTPRM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). The cysteine residue of the M-loop is distal to Afadin in the predicted PTPRK complex and the EE to NG substitution would not introduce significant steric hinderance or charge repulsion, consistent with retained binding. For all mutant forms of the PTPRK-D2 domain, correct folding was confirmed by monitoring their thermal stability and comparing melting temperatures (T<sub>m</sub>) to wildtype PTPRK-D2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Wildtype and mutant PTPRK-D2 domains possessed T<sub>m</sub> values between 39 and 41°C, supporting that any loss of binding was not driven by misfolding. These data strongly validate the predicted model for the PTPRK-D2:Afadin-CC complex and identify two key residues within PTPRK D2 that are crucial for binding to full-length Afadin and, based on their lack of conservation in PTPRM, are likely to be important for determining binding specificity.</p><p>To determine whether the PTPRK-D2:Afadin-CC interaction is necessary for PTPRK-mediated dephosphorylation of Afadin, dephosphorylation assays were performed using both WT and DM PTPRK-ICDs. Since we and others have observed allosteric modulation of RPTP D1 domains by D2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fearnley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wen et al., 2020</xref>), we tested whether introducing D2 domain mutations affects PTPRK-ICD phosphatase activity. The WT and DM PTPRK-ICDs were compared in activity assays using the generic phosphatase substrate 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP), which confirmed that both proteins have identical activity profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Dephosphorylation assays were then performed using PTPRK-ICD WT and DM proteins incubated with quenched, pervanadate-treated lysates. Afadin was dephosphorylated at Y1230 by WT PTPRK-ICD, but not PTPRK-ICD DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Comparatively, another PTPRK substrate, p120-Catenin, which has been shown previously to be dephosphorylated efficiently by the PTPRK-D1 domain alone, was dephosphorylated by both proteins – independent of D2 domain mutation status. Results using our Afadin-pY1230 antibody were also confirmed by immunoprecipitation (IP) of pTyr proteins from WT and DM dephosphorylation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Afadin was depleted in pTyr-IPs from lysates treated with WT PTPRK-ICD, showing dephosphorylation had occurred, while the levels of phosphorylated Afadin remained unchanged in PTPRK-ICD DM-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Again, both WT and DM PTPRK were equivalently able to dephosphorylate p120-Catenin. These data show that D2 domain recruitment of Afadin is critical for efficient dephosphorylation by the D1 domain, and that PTPRK uses distinct surfaces to recruit different substrates for dephosphorylation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mutation of residues at the interaction interface inhibit dephosphorylation of Afadin by PTPRK.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time course of pNPP dephosphorylation by WT (black) and double mutant (DM, red) PTPRK-ICD.

This interaction is mediated via a single helix within an extended disordered region of Afadin that binds directly to the pseudophosphatase D2 domain of PTPRK. Experimental mapping of the binding interface involved truncation mapping of Afadin using different protein production strategies. The cell-free wheat germ-based system allowed for the efficient testing of large Afadin constructs and the rapid mapping down to a region more compatible with large-scale cell-based protein production, such as <italic>E. coli</italic>. This additional mapping allowed for the identification of relevant, smaller regions and domains of both Afadin and PTPRK. By gaining this information experimentally, it was then possible to exploit deep learning techniques via AF2 to make reliable predictions of the interaction interface. Interestingly, if larger regions of either protein, such as the full ICD of PTPRK or longer segments of Afadin, are used for AF2-based complex predictions, a range of different assemblies are predicted with lower confidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Therefore, at present, these predictive tools are at their most valuable when coupled to experimental approaches that identify the relevant protein fragments to be used as inputs. When this requirement is satisfied, the power of these predictions is clearly demonstrated here by the identification of a testable interface that proved to be highly accurate in informing subsequent experimental assays.</p><p>SEC-MALS analysis shows the purified Afadin-CC region that binds PTPRK to be monomeric in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), demonstrating that binding to PTPRK does not compete with potential dimerization of Afadin via this region. The CC region of Afadin that is shown here to be critical for binding to PTPRK is distal to the tyrosine residue that is targeted for dephosphorylation (Y1230). We also demonstrate that the interaction with the CC region is critical for efficient dephosphorylation, showing that this interaction is important for bringing Afadin within close proximity to PTPRK but does not directly position the relevant pTyr in the active site of the PTPRK-D1 domain. This role for the D2 pseudophosphatase domain in specific substrate recruitment helps to explain the apparent lack of specificity of phosphatases for phosphopeptide substrates, indicating that it is not necessarily a motif near the pTyr that determines substrate targeting.</p><p>Our previous observation that Afadin binding is independent of its phosphorylation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fearnley et al., 2019</xref>) is consistent with the data presented here. Specifically, Afadin binds PTPRK via a site that is over 100 amino acids downstream of the target phosphosite and the interaction interface is distinct from the nonfunctional ‘active site’ on the D2 domain. These data support that the pseudophosphatase domain has been repurposed in evolution for specific protein–protein interactions. However, it is also possible that even active PTP domains mediate such interactions. Additional substrates, such as PARD3, showed some dependence on the D2 for dephosphorylation by PTPRK and PTPRM, whereas other substrates of PTPRK, such as p120<sup>Cat</sup>, do not require the D2 domain for recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fearnley et al., 2019</xref>). This raises interesting questions about simultaneous binding of substrates to PTPRK and potential competition for access to the active site. Furthermore, if the phosphorylation state is not critical for binding, PTPRK might play a scaffolding role connecting multiple junctional components as well as F-actin. Consistent with a scaffolding role for receptor PTPs, structural studies on the R2A receptor PTPRF revealed an interaction interface with Liprin-α spanning both the D1 and D2 domains, adding further complexity to potential binding modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xie et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, Liprin is not a PTPRF substrate, thus RPTPs could form multiprotein complexes independent of protein phosphorylation status. This might also help to explain reported phosphatase-independent functions of RPTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Juettner et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, the region of Afadin that interacts with PTPRK has been shown to also mediate binding to αE-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maruo et al., 2018</xref>), a core component of the E cadherin-catenin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Niessen and Gottardi, 2008</xref>). Further studies are required to understand how RPTPs regulate cell adhesion while recruiting core adhesion molecules, such as Afadin, potentially in competition with canonical adhesion complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and constructs</title><p>Amino acid (aa) numbering used throughout is based on the following sequences: PTPRK, UniProt ID: Q15262-3; PTPRM, UniProt ID: P28827-1; Afadin, UniProt ID: P55196-4.

reported the identification of a series of pTyr protein targets for the protein–tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity of the receptor-like PTP, PTPRK. Here they identify a docking site in the catalytically inactive D2 pseudophosphatase domain that promotes substrate dephosphorylation by the D1 phosphatase domain. The evidence for the docking interaction is convincing, and the study is important because it suggests that the D2 pseudophosphatase domains of other RPTPs may similarly function in substrate recruitment and selectivity. The article will be of interest to biochemists studying protein phosphorylation–dephosphorylation and signal transduction mechanisms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79855.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Hunter</surname><given-names>Tony</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03xez1567</institution-id><institution>Salk Institute for Biological Studies</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Hunter</surname><given-names>Tony</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03xez1567</institution-id><institution>Salk Institute for Biological Studies</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Knapp</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04cvxnb49</institution-id><institution>Goethe University Frankfurt</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.04.27.489754">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.27.489754v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Tony Hunter as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Stefan Knapp (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agree that your new insights into how Afadin interacts with the D2 pseudophosphatase domain of PTPRK and how this may serve as a recruitment mechanism through which the D1 active phosphatase domain of PTPRK can dephosphorylate Afadin are of significant interest, particularly because they could be the harbinger of a general mechanism for twin domain RPTP substrate recruitment. However, in the absence of a genuine Afadin CC/PTPRK D2 structure, some additional validation of the proposed Afadin CC/PTPRK D2 interface is required to bolster your conclusions before publication.</p><p>The essential revisions requested are:</p><p>1. The use of additional mutations of key residues in the predicted Afadin CC/PTPRK D2 interface to functionally validate the structural significance of the proposed Afadin recruitment interaction.</p><p>2. Further characterization of the pY1230 antibodies to demonstrate their specificity for pY1230 Afadin.</p><p>Some additional suggestions for improvement can be found in the individual reviews, where one particular concern is that the anti-pY1230 Afadin antibodies have not been sufficiently well characterized. We look forward to receiving a revised version of your paper describing this exciting new mechanism in which the poorly understood pseudophosphatase domain in PTPRK acts to recruit pTyr substrate proteins.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The AF2 model of the Afadin 1393-1455 region bound to the PTPRK D2 domain is supported by the properties of the acidic pocket DM D2 mutant, but, in the absence of a co-crystal structure, it would be reassuring if some additional mutations in the D2 domain as well as in the Afadin core binding motif were analyzed.</p><p>2. The DM mutant data show that the D2 domain interaction is important for Afadin pTyr dephosphorylation in vitro, but one would also like evidence that the DM PTPRK mutant lacks Afadin pY1230 dephosphorylating activity in cells. The authors have the PTPRK KO MCF10A cells they generated in their first <italic>eLife</italic> paper that could be used to re-express the WT and DM PTPRK and then monitor Afadin dephosphorylation with their new anti-pY1230 antibodies.</p><p>3. From the model structure in Figure 3B, it is not clear whether the Afadin helix binds to the backside or frontside of the D2 domain. In other words, where is the Afadin binding pocket relative to the &quot;active&quot; site of D2, and would oxidation of the active cite Cys be expected to alter Afadin binding? Some further discussion is called for.</p><p>4. The blotting data for the Afadin band in Figures 5F and G are not very clean and need quantifying. In the experiment in panel F it is not clear why the authors did not immunoblot an Afadin IP with their new pY1230 antibodies, instead of precipitating with anti-pTyr antibodies and then blotting with anti-Afadin antibodies. This would enable them to demonstrate that the Afadin/D2 interaction specifically promotes dephosphorylation of pY1230 as opposed to dephosphorylation of other pTyr residues in Afadin (admittedly panel G suggests that pY1230 is not dephosphorylated by the DM mutant). With regard to these experiments, the authors should indicate in the text that the pervanadate in the lysate was neutralized by addition of an excess of DTT (presumably before addition of the recombinant PTPRK proteins).</p><p>5. The anti-pY1230 Afadin antibodies should be more thoroughly characterized for their specificity. For instance, based on the top panel of Figure S2, it is not clear what band the reader is supposed to focus on – presumably the upper band but the &quot;pY1230&quot; signal in this band did not go down as much as the Afadin protein band in the second panel in the Afadin siRNA sample. The authors need to use a Y1230F mutant Afadin and YopH PTP treatment of the pV lysate as a negative controls, etc., to validate the specificity of these antibodies. If the new pY1230 antibodies can be shown to be specific, it would be interesting to know whether they can be used to detect pY1230 phosphorylated Afadin by IF, and whether it colocalizes with PTPRK.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Would recommend reporting in the figure legend how many experimental replicates have been collected for each experiment.</p><p>2. Related to #1, it is noted that the mean and SEM in Figure 2E are based on only two replicates.</p><p>3. The statement that the binding of the anti-afadin antibody is affected by phosphorylation could be better supported by experiments via transfection of tagged afadin followed by blotting with anti-tag vs anti-afadin antibodies.</p><p>4. Is the &quot;reverse&quot; mutation of PTPRM residues homolog to PTPRK aa 1273 and 1335 respectively into H and L sufficient to rescue the interaction with afadin and its dephosphorylation by PTPRM?</p><p>5. Could the authors check the numbering of residues in Supplementary Figure 9: residue 1273 appears to be an L in that figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I think this is an interesting study that reports an exciting new mechanism involving the poorly understood pseudophosphatase domain in this PTP. I think however since the foundation of the study heavily relies on in silico predictions, more experimental data should be provided to confirm the docking and interaction hypothesis. Some of the suggested experiments, for instance demonstrating that the CC domain in Afadin is indeed helical would be easy to confirm experimentally. Also, key residues in the substrate should be mutated. In general, including a mutant (Y/P mutant) in Afadin would help to confirm many of the experimental data as pY specific peptide antibodies are notoriously unselective.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79855.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The essential revisions requested are:</p><p>1. The use of additional mutations of key residues in the predicted Afadin CC/PTPRK D2 interface to functionally validate the structural significance of the proposed Afadin recruitment interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now made and tested several additional mutations within both the Afadin-CC and PTPRK-D2 domains to further validate the AF2 predicted model of the complex.</p><p>For Afadin-CC we introduced several single and double mutations along the helix including residues predicted to be in the interface and residues distal from the interface. These mutations and the pulldown with PTPRK are described in the text and are included as additional panels to a modified Figure 3. All mutations have the expected effect on the interaction based on the predicted complex structure. To help illustrate the positions of these mutations we have also included a figure of the interface with the residues highlighted.</p><p>For the PTPRK-D2 we have also introduced two new mutations, one buried in the interface (F1225A) and one on the edge of the interface encompassing a loop that is different in PTPRM (labelled the M-loop). GST-Afadin WT protein was bound to GSH beads and tested for their ability to pulldown WT and mutated PTPRK. These new mutations (illustrated in the new Figure 4 —figure supplement 2) further support the model prediction. F1225A almost completely abolishes binding as predicted, while the M-loop retains binding. These mutations and their effects are now described in the main text and the pull-down data, including controls and retesting of the original DM mutant, are included as panel H in a newly modified Figure 4 focussed solely on the PTPRK interface.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Further characterization of the pY1230 antibodies to demonstrate their specificity for pY1230 Afadin.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like this antibody to be a useful and freely accessible tool in the field and have taken on board the request for additional validation. To this end we have significantly expanded Supplementary Figure 2 (now Figure 1 —figure supplement 2) and included a dedicated section of the results as follows:</p><p>1. We have now included information about all of the Afadin antibodies used in this study, since Afadin(BD) appears to be sensitive to phosphorylation (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2A).</p><p>2. We have demonstrated that the Afadin pY1230 antibody detects an upregulated band in PTPRK KO MCF10A cells, consistent with our previous tyrosine phosphoproteomics (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2B). This indicates that the antibody can be used to detect endogenous Afadin phosphorylation.</p><p>3. We have included two new knock down experiments demonstrating the recognition of Afadin by our antibody (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2C). There appear to be two Afadin isoforms recognised in HEK293T cells by both the BD and pY1230 antibody, consistent with previous reports (Umeda et al. MBoC, 2015). We have highlighted these in the figure.</p><p>4. We have performed mutagenesis to demonstrate the specificity of the antibody. We tagged Afadin with a fluorescent protein tag, reasoning that it would cause a shift in molecular weight that could be resolved by SDS PAGE, as is the case. We noted that the phosphopeptide used spans an additional tyrosine, Y1226, which has been detected as phosphorylated (although to a much lower extent than Y1230) on Phosphosite plus. The data clearly show that Afadin cannot be phosphorylated when Y1230 is mutated to a phenylalanine (compared to CIP control), indicating that this is the predominant site recognised by the antibody. In addition, the endogenous pervanadate-stimulated signal is completely abolished by CIP treatment (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2D).</p><p>5. We have included densitometric quantification of the dephosphorylation assay shown in Figure 1B, which was part of a time course and shows preferential dephosphorylation by the PTPRK ICD compared to the PTPRK D1. The signal stops declining with time, which could indicate antibody background, or an inaccessible pool of Afadin-pY1230 (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2E).</p><p>6. To further demonstrate that this site is modulated by PTPRK in post-confluent cells, we have used doxycycline (dox)-inducible cell lines generated in Fearnley et al., 2019. Upon treatment with 500 ng/ml Dox for 48 hours PTPRK is induced to lower levels than wildtype, however, normalized quantification of the Afadin pY1230 against the Afadin (CST) signal clearly indicates downregulation by PTPRK WT, but not the catalytically inactive mutant (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2F and 2G).</p><p>Together these data strengthen our assertion that this antibody recognises endogenously phosphorylated Afadin at site Y1230, which is modulated in vitro and in cells by PTPRK phosphatase activity. For clarity, we have highlighted and annotated the relevant bands in figures. We have also included identifiers for each Afadin total antibody was used in particular experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some additional suggestions for improvement can be found in the individual reviews, where one particular concern is that the anti-pY1230 Afadin antibodies have not been sufficiently well characterized.

Although we do have the PTPRK KO line these experiments would require careful control of PTPRK mutant expression levels therefore needing generation of new stable cell lines. This work will require substantial time and resources delaying the publication of this current work. As this has not been requested as an essential revision we respectfully acknowledge that these would be excellent experiments for future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Some further discussion is called for.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made a series of additional figures (included as a panel in new Figure 4A) to clearly illustrate that the D2 “active” site is on the opposite face from the Afadin binding site. Due to the localisation of the “active” site so far from the binding face we would not expect oxidation of this cysteine to alter binding. All experiments were done in the presence of DTT or TCEP, representing binding under reducing conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

If we had IP’d Afadin, we would also have had to IP p120-catenin and paxillin as controls. We agree that the DM mutant does not dephosphorylate pY1230 (now quantified in new Figure 5 —figure supplement 1) when measured directly. The DM mutant clearly impairs the ability of PTPRK to dephosphorylate Afadin.</p><p>We have now indicated in the Results section that DTT is used to quench any excess pervanadate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

This may require further optimisation, or may not be a viable application for the antibody.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Would recommend reporting in the figure legend how many experimental replicates have been collected for each experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>Where appropriate we have added the number of replicates for experiments. Several of the pulldowns were done using different combinations of constructs but all were tested a minimum of three times therefore we have stated that gels shown are “representative of n ≥ 3 independent experiments”. We have now included time course quantifications for dephosphorylation assays. For cell line experiments, replicates are either shown explicitly or reported in figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Related to #1, it is noted that the mean and SEM in Figure 2E are based on only two replicates.</p></disp-quote><p>ITC experiments require very large quantities of highly pure protein samples making them extremely resource intensive. Multiple measurements are made throughout the titration meaning that each single experiment involves 12 data points that are fit to a single binding model. We carried out the experiment twice with proteins purified independently for each experiment and obtained excellent agreement for the calculated affinity. We therefore did not consider additional ITC experiments to be necessary, especially in light of their resource-intensive nature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The statement that the binding of the anti-afadin antibody is affected by phosphorylation could be better supported by experiments via transfection of tagged afadin followed by blotting with anti-tag vs anti-afadin antibodies.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to essential revisions point 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Is the &quot;reverse&quot; mutation of PTPRM residues homolog to PTPRK aa 1273 and 1335 respectively into H and L sufficient to rescue the interaction with afadin and its dephosphorylation by PTPRM?</p></disp-quote><p>Although well-designed single point mutations can disrupt a protein-protein interaction it is very rare to identify a gain-of-function mutation as it is not truly a “reverse” experiment. An interaction interface is the sum of many individual interactions that all contribute to the overall binding strength. Dropping the affinity below a certain threshold is relatively straight forward if the correct mutation is selected. However, introducing a mutation that can, on its own, mediate a new interaction is much less likely. As this experiment was not included as an essential revision we respectfully decline to mutate PTPRM into a more PTPRK-like molecule for this manuscript. To further support that it is the protein-protein interaction, and not the phosphosite, that is key to specificity, we have previously demonstrated that a chimeric recombinant PTPRM-D1-PTPRK-D2 protein is competent to dephosphorylate Afadin (Fearnley et al. 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Could the authors check the numbering of residues in Supplementary Figure 9: residue 1273 appears to be an L in that figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this mistake, it is now corrected.
