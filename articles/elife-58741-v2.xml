Most strikingly, they have developed rapidly changing and complex cultures that have allowed them to become more numerous and widespread than any other primates and closely related hominins such as Neandertals. This unique historical development has at least to some extent biological roots. However, although large numbers of traits have been identified as being unique to humans or been suggested to be so (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tomasello, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varki and Altheide, 2005</xref>), it has proven difficult to identify the genetic and biological underpinnings of such traits. One reason may be that many of them are genetically complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Phillips, 2008</xref>) and represent differences in degree rather than absolute differences between humans and other groups. In particular, it is unclear if any single nucleotide substitution or other genomic change that occurs in all or almost all humans today, but is not seen among the closest evolutionary relatives of present-day humans, the Neandertals, and Denisovans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pääbo, 2014</xref>), has biological consequences. A duplicative transposition in modern humans of the gene <italic>BOLA2</italic> which is involved in iron metabolism has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nuttle et al., 2016</xref>) in a region associated with autism but the functional consequences are unknown. A recent study introduced a modern human-specific amino acid substitution in the splice factor NOVA1 and suggested that it has drastic effects on the differentiation of brain organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trujillo et al., 2021</xref>), an observation that warrants further study.</p><p>To identify traits that may have comparatively simple genetic architectures yet influence the biology of modern humans, we focus here on metabolic differences. By analyzing the metabolomes of muscle, kidney and three different regions of the brain from humans, chimpanzees and macaques, we find that many aspects of amino acid metabolism differ between humans and the other two primates in all tissues analyzed. Among metabolic pathways, purine biosynthesis is less active in several human tissues including the brain. In purine biosynthesis, we find that metabolites downstream of the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase [ADSL (EC 4.3.2.2)] occur at lower concentrations in humans than in the other primates. ADSL carries an amino acid substitution that is unique to modern humans relative to apes and Neandertals and Denisovans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Castellano et al., 2014</xref>) and has been shown to affect the stability of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Van Laer et al., 2018</xref>). By introducing the modern human-like substitution in the genome of mice, and the ancestral, Neandertal-like substitution in the genomes of human cells, we show that this substitution contributes to much or all of this metabolic change in present-day humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Metabolite changes unique to humans</title><p>To identify metabolites that have changed their concentration in humans relative to monkeys and apes, we measured compound concentrations in prefrontal cortex, primary visual cortex, cerebellum, skeletal muscle and kidney in four humans, four chimpanzees, and four macaques using mass spectrometry coupled with capillary electrophoresis (CE-MS), a technique suitable for detection of small hydrophilic compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). The number of metabolites annotated in the five tissues varied between 166 and 197, 160 and 209, and 145 and 192 in the three species, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Primate metabolome analysis.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Sketch depicting species and tissues used for metabolite measurements.

Whereas we find no such metabolites in skeletal muscle and kidney, we find metabolites peak intensities and thus concentrations differ in humans relative to the other two primates in two of the three parts of the brain analyzed.</p><p>In cerebellum, 22 metabolites have higher concentrations in humans whereas no metabolites have lower concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Eighteen of the 22 metabolites are amino acids. In prefrontal cortex, we detected five metabolites with lower concentrations in humans and none with higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Three of the five metabolites are purines (inosine monophosphate [IMP], guanosine monophosphate [GMP], adenosine monophosphate [AMP]) and the other two are NAD<sup>+</sup> and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Metabolic pathways</title><p>To identify metabolic pathways that may be more or less active in humans than in other primates, we linked metabolites with higher or lower concentrations in humans compared to both chimpanzees and macaques (even if not significantly so) to genes and metabolic pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary files 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">5</xref> give pathways that contain more genes than expected (p&lt;0.01) that are associated with metabolites present in either higher or lower concentrations in humans in each of the five tissues.</p><p>Between 8 and 12 pathways are associated with higher metabolite concentrations in the five human tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). All eight pathways identified in the prefrontal cortex involve amino acid metabolism, eight out of nine pathways in the visual cortex and nine out of 10 in the cerebellum also involve amino acids. In muscle and kidney, 7 and 5 of the 11 and 12 pathways identified, respectively, involve amino acid metabolism. Thus, several aspects of amino acid metabolism seem to be increased in humans relative to other primates.</p><p>Between 4 and 11 pathways are associated with lower metabolite concentrations in the five tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Amino acid and peptide metabolism make up one to five of these pathways in the different tissues, suggesting that amino acid metabolism has changed in several ways in humans relative to the other primates. Hence, metabolites in these pathways are present in increased as well as decreased concentrations, often in the same pathways. For example, significant numbers of metabolites in arginine and proline metabolism are present in higher concentrations while other metabolites in the same pathways are present in lower concentrations, sometimes in the same tissues, suggesting that the flux through these pathways has changed.</p><p>Metabolites in two pathways are consistently present at lower rather than higher concentrations in humans. One of these pathways is oxidative phosphorylation, which shows decreased metabolite concentrations in the three brain regions. Because oxidative phosphorylation is not affected in muscle and kidneys, it seems that the human brain differs from ape brains in that oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria is less active. This may deserve future investigation.</p><p>The second pathway that stands out is purine biosynthesis where a number of metabolites are present at lower levels in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Based on the KEGG definition of the pathway, purine biosynthesis is decreased in humans relative to apes in the brain as well as in other organs. If we focus on a more restrictive definition of purine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marie et al., 2004</xref>), a significant decrease is seen in the three brain regions and not in muscle and kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Further, three of the five metabolites, IMP, GMP and AMP, which individually have significantly lower concentrations in humans, are products of de novo purine biosynthesis. Taken together, metabolites involved in purines biosynthesis have significantly lower concentrations in humans than in non-human primates in all three brain regions than do metabolites in the other metabolic pathways, (Wilcoxon test, p=0.049 (PFC), p=0.002 (CB), p=0.001 (VC); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Similarly, we find the significantly lower concentrations of purine biosynthesis metabolites in humans compared to chimpanzees and macaques relative to other metabolic pathways when analyzing previously published metabolite data from the PFC of three species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kurochkin et al., 2019</xref>) (Wilcoxon test, p=0.019; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).

The gene encoding ADSL in humans is located on chromosome 22q13.1–13.2 and is one of only approximately one hundred protein-coding genes that carry substitutions inferred to change amino acids that are fixed or almost fixed in present-day humans but occur in their ancestral, ape-like state in the genomes of the closest extinct relatives of modern humans, Neandertals and Denisovans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pääbo, 2014</xref>).

Neandertals, Denisovans, all other primates and most mammals carry an alanine residue at this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The substitution is located in a protein domain that forms part of the substrate channel over the active site of the enzyme.

Out of 1883 metabolite peaks that differ significantly (Wilcoxon test, BH-adjusted p&lt;0.05) between the human and chimpanzee wild-type cells, four correspond to purine biosynthesis metabolites (guanosine, inosine, hypoxanthine, xanthine) and are present at lower levels in human cells compared to chimpanzee cells.

Seven of them are present in lower amounts in the human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>) and as a group they are present in lower concentrations in the human than in the chimpanzee cells when compared to metabolites in other pathways (Wilcox test, p=0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>).</p><p>Six of the 10 purine biosynthesis metabolites are present at significantly lower concentrations in humans than in macaques when analyzed individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>) and as a group they are present at lower concentrations than metabolites in other pathways (Wilcoxon test, p=0.04, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>).

About 10 times further back the ancestors of hominins diverged from the ancestors of chimpanzees and bonobos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Langergraber et al., 2012</xref>). Whereas some phenotypic differences between present-day humans and apes have been shown to be due to genetic features unique to humans, especially gene duplications (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charrier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nuttle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Florio et al., 2018</xref>) and changes involving gene expression (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doan et al., 2018</xref>), no organismal traits that distinguish present-day modern humans from Neandertals and Denisovans have been associated with specific nucleotide changes. Whereas most phenotypic features that distinguish present-day humans from the apes and from their extinct hominin relatives are likely to be genetically complex, metabolic differences may sometimes have a comparatively simple genetic background because genomic changes that affect genes encoding enzymes may affect flux in metabolic pathways.</p><p>To find metabolic differences that set humans apart from their closest evolutionary relatives we investigated the metabolomes of the brain, muscle, and kidney in humans, apes, and monkeys. Whereas we find no such differences among the metabolites analyzed in muscle and kidney, in the brain, steady state abundance of many compounds involved in amino acid metabolism are present in higher or lower levels in humans versus other primates and metabolites involved in oxidative phosphorylation are present in lower amounts. In the future, it may be of interest to investigate more samples and the consequences of these human-specific metabolic features. Metabolites in purine biosynthesis stand out in that they are present in lower concentrations in humans than in the other primates analyzed in all tissues analyzed, although most drastically in brain.</p><p>Humans and apes diverged so long ago that almost every gene carries changes that may potentially alter its function by affecting its regulation or the structure of the encoded gene product. In contrast, modern humans and Neandertals and Denisovans diverged so recently that for about 90% of the genome, the two archaic human groups fall within the variation of present-day humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Green et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, when modern and archaic humans met about 50,000 years ago, they interbred. This resulted in that Neandertal DNA fragments that together make up about half of the Neandertal genome exist in present-day humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sankararaman et al., 2014</xref>). The number of proteins that carry amino acid substitutions in all or almost all humans that differ from Neandertals and apes is therefore only about one hundred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pääbo, 2014</xref>). It is unclear if any of these substitutions have any functional consequences.</p><p>The alanine to valine substitution at position 429 in ADSL is one of this small number of substitutions. Position 429 is conserved as alanine in most tetrapods suggesting that it may be of importance. Position 429 is also located only three positions away from position 426, where an arginine to histidine substitution causes the most common form of adenylosuccinase deficiency in present-day humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edery et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kmoch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maaswinkel-Mooij et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marie et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Race et al., 2000</xref>). Further evidence suggesting that a change in <italic>ADSL</italic> may have been of importance in the evolution of modern humans comes from a screen for genomic regions that have experienced selective sweeps in humans after their split from Neandertals but before the separation of Africans and Eurasians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Racimo, 2016</xref>). In that study, a genomic region centered around <italic>ADSL</italic> is among the top 20 candidate regions, although it also contains other genes. Furthermore, previous work has shown that the A429V substitution reduces the thermal stability of the ADSL protein in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Van Laer et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore decided to analyze if it might be involved in the reduced purine biosynthesis seen in present-day humans by investigating the function of the ancestral, Neandertal-like and the derived, modern human-like forms of ADSL in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>We confirm the previous finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Van Laer et al., 2018</xref>) that the A429V substitution does not affect the kinetic properties of the ADSL enzyme but decreases its thermal stability and show that the substitution also decreases the stability of the tetrameric complex of the enzyme. When introduced in the mouse ADSL protein in conjunction with a primate-specific substitution at the adjacent position 428, it reduces the enzymatic activity detected in nine tissues analyzed, most drastically in the brain, and results in a reduction in purine biosynthesis, thus recapitulating differences seen between humans and chimpanzees and macaques.</p><p>To investigate how the A429V substitution may affect the metabolism of human cells, we used CRISPR-<italic>Cas9</italic> to introduce the ancestral, Neandertal-like substitution into human cells. The concentrations of nine out of 10 detected metabolites downstream of ADSL in purine biosynthesis are increased in human cells carrying the ancestral substitution. In chimpanzee and macaque cells, most of the same 10 metabolites are similarly increased resulting in that the pathway as a whole is increased relative to other pathways. Notably, the expression of ADSL messenger RNA does not differ between human and chimpanzee cells, nor between wild type and ancestralized cells (not shown). Thus, the A429V substitution is responsible for much or all of the difference in purine biosynthesis observed when human tissues are compared to ape and monkey tissues, indicating that this change in metabolism occurred in humans after their separation from the ancestor shared with Neandertals and Denisovans.</p><p>It is interesting that although ADSL is expressed and functions in all tissues, the down-regulation of purine biosynthesis in humans relative to apes, and in humanized mice relative to wild-type mice, is most pronounced in the brain. It is also interesting that mutations in humans that affect enzymes involved in purine metabolism have more pathological consequences in the nervous system than in other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fumagalli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Micheli et al., 2011</xref>). Although no overt morphological or other brain-related phenotypes are observed in the mice humanized at pos. 428 and 429 (data not shown), it is thus possible that the A429V substitution in ADSL has contributed to human-specific changes in brain development and function. Future work will have to address this and other possibilities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Tissue samples</title><p>Human samples were obtained from the Netherlands Brain Bank, Amsterdam, Netherlands.

The authors show how one human-specific alteration affects purine biosynthesis through a series of comparisons among primates, the generation of humanized mice, and ancestral mutations in human cells. In particular, the metabolic changes are robust in brain tissue and future studies will evaluate how such changes might related to brain function.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Reduced purine biosynthesis in humans after their divergence from Neandertals&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Genevieve Konopka as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>This study is one of the first to investigate how human-specific coding changes have a functional impact, in this case upon amino acid metabolism. The data support the idea that the A429V change in modern humans has played a part in brain function, notably with regards to purine biosynthesis.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript explores the functional consequence of amino acid substitutions in modern humans compared to archaic humans. It is likely the first manuscript to functionally study one of the few such changes that have been noted among these species. The authors investigate the metabolomes of human and non-human primate tissues, noting prominent differences in purine biosynthesis in brain regions. They focus on an enzyme, adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL), which is one of about 100 proteins which have sustained human-specific changes in their coding sequences. The functional impact of this human-specific mutation is interrogated by making a humanized mouse model which reflects reduced ADSL activity in tissues as well as reduced purine biosynthesis in brain regions. The authors also assess biochemistry of this mutation, finding it impairs protein stability, which confirms prior findings. The authors finally show that this amino acid in human iPSCs, relative to those carrying an ancestral mutation or to chimpanzee cells, confers a reduction in purine biosynthesis. Overall, the amount of experimental work is impressive and makes an important contribution to understanding molecular evolution. However, the manuscript could be improved by either providing additional support for some of the claims or revising the text, and the statistical analyses require a good deal of attention.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The introduction and the discussion need to discuss how this study builds on or otherwise informs previous work. Are these results unexpected based on the literature? What were the benefits of these extensive experiments over previous work?</p><p>2. Human iPSCs (409B2 cells) are used to assess the function of the A429V mutation by comparing metabolites between human cells, cells mutated to have the ancestral sequence, and chimpanzee cells. However, these experiments are only done in iPSCs, and this is a missed opportunity to evaluate species differences in cells relevant for the brain. This is a surprising gap in the story, given that significant metabolic differences between human and other primates, as well as in humanized mice (p. 7), are mainly significant in the brain. The authors should address in the discussion how using a non-neuronal cell line is informative, in light of their finding that the metabolites are highly enriched in the brain. Alternatively, the authors could relax the emphasis that these results are brain specific. Also, no mention of the chimpanzee cells occurs in the supplemental document, so this needs to be addressed and clarified.</p><p>3. The text highlights differences in oxidative phosphorylation throughout, but the evidence for changes in this pathway are not included in any of the main text figures or statistics provided in the text. This conclusion also does not seem to be supported by the supplemental tables either. It is unclear why oxidative phosphorylation is mentioned.</p><p>4. The statistical analyses chosen need to be better explained in the text and in the figures. In figures 1, 3, and 7, please provide the statistical test and cut-off in the figure legend that determined significance. Perhaps sizes of pie charts, or numbers could be added to make these more informative. As shown, these figures make a case that many metabolites of the same pathway are affected but not the extent to which they are species divergent. The authors report concordant findings in metabolomics between human-primates and the humanized mouse models. But they only report directionality, and it is unclear how the fold changes observed in activity in humanized mice compare to metabolite measurements between human and primates and also in specific brain regions? This measure may reinforce the value of the humanized model. In figures 2 and 8, it is unclear what the dots and error bars represent and which statistical tests were used. In Figure 2, only a single p value is included to describe results in the text, but they should also perform post-hoc analyses to assess significant differences within tissues. In figure 4 it is also unclear what the error bars indicate and there are no error bars in panel 4B and 6A. It is unclear to what extent these assays reflect multiple experiments, which is needed to be rigorous. In the supplemental methods, the metabolite differences were determined by a t-test – are they normally distributed?</p><p>5. In the discussion the authors indicate that it is possible the A429V substitution in ADSL has contributed to human-specific differences in brain development and function. They go to the effort of making humanized mouse models but only report there are no overt phenotypic differences. To what extent have they examined the brains of these mice? A full behavioral study is beyond this paper however some insights and discussion (of even the negative data) here would be useful.</p><p>6. In figure 8 the authors assess phosphorylation levels of AMPKa in both ancestralized and chimpanzee cells. The value that is most meaningful here is normalized to total levels, which doesn't show significant change in the ancestral sequence. Further the relative differences are smaller than that seen comparing human and chimpanzee cells. The value of these data is questionable, as there are many factors which could activate AMPK, that may be present in the chimpanzee cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58741.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The authors report concordant findings in metabolomics between human-primates and the humanized mouse models. But they only report directionality, and it is unclear how the fold changes observed in activity in humanized mice compare to metabolite measurements between human and primates and also in specific brain regions? This measure may reinforce the value of the humanized model.</p></disp-quote><p>The new figures 2, 5 (replaces previous Figure 3), and 9 (replaces previous figure 7) now show analyses where the fold-changes purine metabolites are compared to all other metabolites detected. The new Supplementary Tables 1-3 give the fold-changes of all metabolites that differ significantly between humans and either chimpanzee or macaques in prefrontal cortex or cerebellum.</p><p>For technical and logistic reasons, the measurements of the metabolomes of the tissues from primates, from the mice, and from the cells were done on different technical platforms and at different times. Therefore, the magnitude of the differences cannot be compared between the different sets of experiments. For the cellular experiments (Figure 9), the edited cells were measured together with human and chimpanzee cells so that quantitative comparisons are possible. In that case, the increase in purine metabolites in the cells carrying the ancestral ADSL are if similar magnitude as the difference between chimpanzee and human cells, suggesting that substitution in ADSL explains much or even all of the difference observed between the species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In figures 2 and 8, it is unclear what the dots and error bars represent and which statistical tests were used. In Figure 2, only a single p value is included to describe results in the text, but they should also perform post-hoc analyses to assess significant differences within tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 4 (previous Figure 2) bars in the box plots represent the range of the data and dots outlier observations. This is now explained in the figure legend. Similarly in Figure 9 (previously Figure 8).</p><p>The “single” p-value in the text refers to that all tissues and ages are significant. This is now clarified in the text (page 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In figure 4 it is also unclear what the error bars indicate and there are no error bars in panel 4B and 6A. It is unclear to what extent these assays reflect multiple experiments, which is needed to be rigorous.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 6 (previous Figure 4), the legend now explains the errors bars in panel a. The legend also clarifies that these represent three experiments using two batches of proteins. The legend also clarifies that the experiments in panel b represents the average of four experiments.</p><p>Similarly, the legend to Figure 8b (previous Figure 6b) now clarifies the number of experiments summarized by the graph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the supplemental methods, the metabolite differences were determined by a t-test – are they normally distributed?</p></disp-quote><p>To test whether metabolite intensity data are normally distributed we used the Shapiro test. The null hypothesis is that the data are normally distributed, so if the p-value is greater than 0.05, then the null hypothesis is not rejected. For the majority of metabolites the p-values are greater than 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). After multiple test correction, the adjusted p-values are greater than 0.05 for all metabolites except three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). In general, the distribution of metabolite abundances is close to normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). Thus, we assume that the t-test can be applied in this case.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Distribution of metabolite abundances.</title><p>(A) Shapiro test p-values calculated for each metabolite.

In the discussion the authors indicate that it is possible the A429V substitution in ADSL has contributed to human-specific differences in brain development and function. They go to the effort of making humanized mouse models but only report there are no overt phenotypic differences. To what extent have they examined the brains of these mice? A full behavioral study is beyond this paper however some insights and discussion (of even the negative data) here would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We observe no obvious morphological or behavioral phenotypes in the mice. It would require detailed and careful work to look into this in a rigorous way. Such work will be initiated in collaboration with others. In the last sentences of the Discussion we now just say that no overt phenotypes are seen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In figure 8 the authors assess phosphorylation levels of AMPKa in both ancestralized and chimpanzee cells. The value that is most meaningful here is normalized to total levels, which doesn't show significant change in the ancestral sequence. Further the relative differences are smaller than that seen comparing human and chimpanzee cells. The value of these data is questionable, as there are many factors which could activate AMPK, that may be present in the chimpanzee cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this may requires further work and have removed the AMPK analyses from the paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
