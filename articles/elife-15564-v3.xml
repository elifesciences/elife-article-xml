required for disassembling intron-lariat spliceosomes (ILS) and defective earlier spliceosomes. However, the Prp43 binding site in the spliceosome and its target(s) are unknown. We show that Prp43 fused to Ntr1's G-patch motif (Prp43_Ntr1GP) is as efficient as the NTR in ILS disassembly, yielding identical dissociation products and recognizing its natural ILS target even in the absence of Ntr1’s C-terminal-domain (CTD) and Ntr2. Unlike the NTR, Prp43_Ntr1GP disassembles earlier spliceosomal complexes (A, B, B<sup>act</sup>), indicating that Ntr2/Ntr1-CTD prevents NTR from disrupting properly assembled spliceosomes other than the ILS. The U2 snRNP-intron interaction is disrupted in all complexes by Prp43_Ntr1GP, and in the spliceosome contacts U2 proteins and the pre-mRNA, indicating that the U2 snRNP-intron interaction is Prp43’s major target.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15564.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15564.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>spliceosome</kwd><kwd>helicases</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 860</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ficner</surname><given-names>Ralf</given-names></name><name><surname>Lührmann</surname><given-names>Reinhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Prp43 binds to the pre-mRNA and contacts predominantly U2 proteins in the budding yeast spliceosome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The spliceosome assembles de novo for each new round of pre-mRNA splicing by the sequential recruitment of the U1, U2 and U4/U6.U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and numerous non-snRNP proteins to the intron. It undergoes a series of remodeling steps that are driven by eight conserved DExD/H-box ATPases or RNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cordin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordin and Beggs, 2013</xref>). Initially, U1 snRNP recognizes and forms a base-pairing interaction with the 5’ splice site (SS) of the intron. Recruitment of the U2 snRNP to the branch-site (BS) yields the A complex. U2 snRNA forms a base-pairing interaction with the BS nucleotides, while several U2 SF3a and SF3b proteins stabilize U2 snRNP binding to the intron by interacting with intron nucleotides upstream and downstream of the BS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gozani et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>). The U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP associates with the A complex, and a short helix between the 5’ end of U2 and 3’ end of U6 snRNA (U2/U6 helix II) is formed. Subsequently, the U1/5'SS interaction is disrupted, allowing base-pairing of the 5’SS with U6 snRNA, resulting in the formation of the pre-catalytic B complex. Activation of the spliceosome, yielding the B<sup>act</sup> complex, involves unwinding of the U4/U6 duplex by the RNA helicase Brr2, and displacement of U4 snRNA from the spliceosome. This allows U6 snRNA to interact with U2 snRNA to form U2/U6 helix I. The resulting U2/U6/pre-mRNA interaction network forms the heart of the spliceosome’s catalytic center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Datta and Weiner, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu and Manley, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Madhani and Guthrie, 1992</xref>). Concomitant with these RNA rearrangements, more than twenty new proteins, including the Prp19 complex (NTC), are stably integrated into the B<sup>act</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fabrizio et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>For catalytic activation, the B<sup>act</sup> complex is remodeled by the RNA helicase Prp2 in cooperation with its G-patch protein co-factor Spp2, yielding the B* complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim and Lin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Silverman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Warkocki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2015</xref>), in which step 1 catalysis occurs, whereby the 2’ hydroxyl group of the BS adenosine attacks the 5’SS, generating the cleaved-off 5’ exon and the intron-lariat (IL)-3’exon intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Warkocki et al., 2009</xref>). The newly formed C complex catalyzes step 2 of splicing, leading to exon ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Horowitz, 2012</xref>). The mature mRNA is then dissociated from the intron-lariat spliceosome (ILS).</p><p>The ILS is dismantled by the DEAH-box NTPase Prp43, which is necessary for recycling snRNPs and splicing factors, and thereby promotes efficient splicing in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arenas and Abelson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tsai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fourmann et al., 2013</xref>). In yeast, Prp43 associates with two co-factors to dismantle the ILS, the G-patch protein Ntr1 (also termed Spp382) and Ntr2, which together form the NTR complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pandit et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tsai et al., 2007</xref>). Ntr1 binds through its N-terminal G-patch motif (GP) to the C-terminal domain of Prp43 and thereby stimulates Prp43’s ATPase and RNA helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christian et al., 2014</xref>). Their productive interaction in the NTR is also required to dissociate the ILS in yeast splicing extracts, where Ntr2 is thought to recruit Ntr1 and thus also Prp43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tsai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In a purified yeast splicing system, Prp43 and its co-factors are sufficient to dissociate not only the intron lariat (IL) RNA from the ILS, but also the snRNPs from each other, yielding free U6 snRNA, a 20S U2 and an 18S U5 snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fourmann et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, while the effects of NTR action on the ILS and the nature of the dissociation products have been well characterized, the mechanism how Prp43 dismantles the ILS and, most importantly, the target structure(s) that are disrupted (remodeled) by Prp43 in the spliceosome are completely unknown. As the complex RNA interaction network formed by the intron and U2/U6 snRNAs is still in place in the post-catalytic ILS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yan et al., 2015</xref>), several RNA duplexes, including the U2/BS and U2/U6 helices I and II must be dissociated during ILS disassembly by Prp43. This raises the question whether Prp43 has several RNA duplex targets in the ILS and if so, whether it dissociates them in a sequential manner. Moreover, the ILS is a large RNP complex and DEAH-box ATPases can also act as RNPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jankowsky et al., 2001</xref>). Thus the target(s) of Prp43 in the ILS may also involve protein–RNA interactions.</p><p>Identifying Prp43's target structure(s) is also of special interest as Prp43 is not only required for ILS disassembly, but is also implicated in the discard pathway of spliceosomes associated with suboptimal pre-mRNA substrates, which become stalled at earlier stages of the spliceosomal cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pandit et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Semlow and Staley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koodathingal and Staley, 2013</xref>). Thus, Prp43 is also involved in the disassembly of early spliceosomes that not only differ significantly from the ILS in their biochemical composition, but also in the nature of their RNA interaction network. The role of Ntr2 and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Ntr1 in facilitating Prp43’s recognition of its spliceosomal target structures, is also not well understood. It has been suggested that Ntr2 may help to recruit Ntr1 and Prp43 to the ILS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tsai et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, or in addition, they may also play a role in regulating the productive interaction of Ntr1’s GP with Prp43 in the spliceosome and help to prevent dissociation of properly assembled spliceosomes other than post-catalytic ILSs.</p><p>To address these questions, we first set out to define the minimal factor requirements for Prp43 to efficiently dismantle purified ILSs in vitro. We show that a fusion protein of Prp43 and the G-patch motif of Ntr1 (Prp43_Ntr1GP) efficiently dismantles the ILS, yielding the same dissociation products as the NTR. Thus, Prp43_Ntr1GP is a disassembly factor that recognizes its natural target structure(s) in the ILS even in the absence of Ntr1’s CTD and Ntr2. Prp43_Ntr1GP also efficiently dismantles activated (B<sup>act</sup>) spliceosomes, while NTR does not. This indicates that Ntr2 and Ntr1’s CTD act as a 'doorkeeper' that prevents dissociation by NTR of properly assembled spliceosomes other than ILSs. Prp43_Ntr1GP also dissociates purified B and A complexes. Characterization of the Prp43_Ntr1GP-mediated dissociation products of the B<sup>act</sup>, B and A complexes revealed that in all complexes U2 snRNP is disloged from the pre-mRNA, indicating that the interaction of U2 snRNP with the extended branch site is the major target of Prp43 in the spliceosome. The latter is further supported by our finding that Prp43_Ntr1GP binds to the pre-mRNA and contacts predominantly U2 proteins in the spliceosome. Our data are consistent with the idea that Prp43 specifically displaces U2 snRNP from the BS by moving along the intron in a 5’ to 3’ direction or acting locally by disrupting RNA structures without significant translocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ntr1’s G-patch motif is sufficient to promote dissociation of purified ILSs in the same manner as the NTR</title><p>Previously, it was shown that a fusion protein, in which the C-terminal amino acid of Prp43 is connected to the N-terminal amino acid of the Ntr1 G-patch (termed Prp43_Ntr1GP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), also displays high RNA-stimulated ATPase and RNA helicase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christian et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore we investigated whether Prp43_Ntr1GP is also sufficient to dismantle the ILS and thus represents a minimal spliceosome disassembly system. Purified ILSs were obtained as described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fourmann et al., 2013</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, incubation of the ILS with ATP and recombinant Prp43 plus Ntr1 and Ntr2 (forming the NTR complex, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tsai et al., 2007</xref>) resulted in the release of ~80% of the IL RNA and dissociation of the remaining spliceosomal RNP core into free U6 snRNA, 18S U5 and 20S U2 snRNPs, while in the absence of the NTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) or in the presence of Prp43 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), only a very low level of the ILS was released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fourmann et al., 2013</xref>). Remarkably, disassembly of the ILS by Prp43_Ntr1GP yielded the same snRNP and RNA dissociation products (i.e., IL RNA, free U6 snRNA, 18S U5 and 20S U2 snRNPs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) as those obtained when the NTR was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Addition of Ntr2 to the reaction mixture did not influence the efficiency of ILS disassembly by Prp43_Ntr1GP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating that Ntr2 and the C-terminal domain of Ntr1 are not needed for recruiting Prp43_Ntr1GP to the spliceosome. In summary, these results demonstrate that Ntr1’s GP is essential and sufficient to promote ILS disassembly by Prp43 in the same manner as the NTR complex. This in turn suggests that Prp43_Ntr1GP recognizes the same target structure(s) in the ILS as the NTR.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15564.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Prp43 fused to the G-patch motif of Ntr1 is sufficient to promote dissociation of the ILS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Upper panel, schematic representation of the NTR complex, composed of Prp43, Ntr1 and Ntr2; lower panel, Prp43_Ntr1GP in which the G-patch of Ntr1 is fused to the C-terminal domain of Prp43.

Indeed, immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments carried out with antibodies specific for the U5 snRNP protein Snu114 and fractions across the gradient revealed that pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA co-precipitates together with the U5 snRNP; while very little or no U2 and U6 snRNAs were found in the IPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). Interestingly, the U5 snRNA and pre-mRNA (but not U2 and U6 snRNAs), were also co-precipitated from the gradient with anti-Prp19 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, lanes 8 and 9), suggesting that the NTC proteins are bound to the U5 snRNP after disassembly of the B<sup>act ΔPrp2</sup> complex. This conclusion is also supported by mass spectrometry (MS) analyses of the purified 35S U5-pre-mRNA complex, showing that the majority of NTC proteins migrated in fractions 13–16, together with U5 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Finally, a more detailed characterization of the disassembly products of the B<sup>act ΔPrp2</sup> complex by UV protein-RNA crosslinking and MS revealed that all U2 SF3a and SF3b proteins, which contact the BS region of the intron within the B<sup>act</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>), are dissociated from the intron and remain associated with the released 20S U2 snRNP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2E—source data 1</xref>). Indeed, we found that Hsh155 (human SF3B1/SAP155) can be crosslinked to the pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA in the intact B<sup>act ΔPrp2</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, lane 2), but after B<sup>act ΔPrp2</sup> disassembly, crosslinking of Hsh155 to the pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA was no longer observed (lane 4). This indicates that Hsh155 is completely displaced from the pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA by Prp43_Ntr1GP. To validate the quantitative dissociation of the U2 snRNP from the pre-mRNA, we carried out IP experiments using the Cus1-TAP extract (human SF3B145/SAP145). Disassembled B<sup>act ΔPrp2</sup> spliceosomes were incubated with Protein A–Sepharose beads that carried IgG, to which the TAP tag binds efficiently. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> (lanes 3,4) shows a selective immunoprecipitation of the U2 snRNP, indicating quantitative dissociation of the U2 particle from the pre-mRNA, which is thus not coprecipitated together with the U2 snRNP. In conclusion, Prp43_Ntr1GP dismantles the B<sup>act ΔPrp2</sup> complex and ILS in a similar manner, suggesting that it also recognizes similar target structure(s) in both complexes (see also Discussion below). Furthermore, the striking finding that Prp43_Ntr1GP, but not the NTR, efficiently dismantles the B<sup>act ΔPrp2</sup> complex, suggests that in the B<sup>act ΔPrp2</sup> complex the CTD of Ntr1 and/or Ntr2 negatively regulate Prp43 and prevent disassembly of an activated spliceosome which is assembled on a wild-type pre-mRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The U2 snRNP-intron interaction is a major target of Prp43 in the spliceosome</title><p>As Prp43_Ntr1GP, in contrast to the NTR, appears to disassemble spliceosomes in an unconstrained manner, we next investigated whether it is also capable of dismantling pre-catalytic B complexes.

Brr2 is responsible for U4/U6 snRNAs unwinding, a critical step in spliceosomal activation, which can only occur at higher ATP concentrations (i.e. ~100–200 µM ATP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fabrizio et al., 2009</xref>). To exclude any effect of Brr2 RNA helicase, which is strictly ATP-dependent, we incubated purified B complexes either with the NTR or with Prp43_Ntr1GP in the presence of UTP. The vast majority of B complexes remained stable during incubation with UTP alone, and addition of the NTR did not lead to a significant increase in dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). In contrast, in the presence of Prp43_Ntr1GP and UTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), 67% of the B complexes were disassembled. One third of U2 snRNA co-migrated during glycerol-gradient centrifugation with U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs (peaking in fractions 13–15), but clearly separated from the pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA, which peaked in fractions 9–11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The remaining fraction of U2 snRNA migrated in fractions 7–11, while U1 snRNA exhibited a broad peak in fractions 10–15. Importantly, and in contrast to the disassembly of B<sup>act</sup> complexes, only negligible amounts of U6 snRNA were found in the top fractions of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>To investigate which snRNPs are still associated with each other and/or with pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA after the action of Prp43_Ntr1GP, we first performed IPs with anti-Snu114 antibodies and fractions across the gradient. Immunoprecipitates from fractions 13–15 contained similar amounts of U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs, but only minor amounts of pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA and U1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, lane 5), indicating that predominantly a U2.U4/U6.U5 tetra-snRNP was present in these fractions, consistent with its Svedberg value of ~35S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gottschalk et al., 1999</xref>). Immunoprecipitates from fractions 10–12 contained similar amounts of U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs but little U1 and U2 snRNAs, and low amounts of pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA, indicating the presence of predominantly 25S U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, lane 4). The presence of low amounts of U1 in both immunoprecipitates suggests that the U1 snRNP, which is present in substoichiometric amounts in purified B complexes, but no longer base paired to the 5’SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fabrizio et al., 2009</xref>), may be loosely-associated with the tri- and tetra-snRNPs in these fractions.</p><p>MS analysis of the glycerol gradient fractions was consistent with the presence of intact U2, 25S U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNPs and 35S U2.U4/U6.U5 tetra-snRNPs in the corresponding fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). MS also revealed a bipartite distribution of the NTC proteins which co-migrated with the pre-mRNA and the tetra-snRNP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Upon IP with anti-Prp19 antibodies, significant amounts of pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA – but only minor amounts of U2 and the other snRNAs – were precipitated from fractions 10–12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, lane 8), whereas tetra-snRNPs were precipitated from fractions 13–15 (lane 9). This indicates that i) NTC proteins bind directly to pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA – which may also explain why the pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA migrates with an S value of ~20S and not in the top fractions of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) – and ii) the U2 snRNPs migrating in fractions 9–11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) are not bound to the pre-mRNA.</p><p>The latter was supported by UV RNA-protein crosslinking experiments. That is, the U2 protein Prp9 (human SF3A60/SAP61) could not be crosslinked to pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA in fractions 9–11 (i.e 20S U2) of the gradient containing B complexes disassembled by Prp43_Ntr1GP and UTP, while in intact B complexes it was crosslinked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 4). Likewise, no crosslinks between Prp9 and pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA were observed in the U2.U4/U6.U5 tetra-snRNP peak fractions (lane 6). Pulldowns using IgG-Sepharose and the Cus1-TAP extract confirmed that the pre-mRNA is not coprecipitated together with the U2 snRNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, lanes 3,4), and only slightly from fractions 13–15 containing the U2.U4/U6.U5 tetra-snRNPs and some U2 and U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNPs (lane 5). We conclude that disassembly of B complexes by Prp43_Ntr1GP involves the complete displacement of U2 snRNP from the pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA BS region. U2 snRNP is very probably displaced as a tetra-snRNP particle, which partially dissociates into free 20S U2 snRNPs and 25S U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNPs during gradient centrifugation. Taken together, these results are consistent with the idea that Prp43_Ntr1GP disrupts primarily the U2 snRNP-BS interaction.</p><p>The earliest spliceosomal complex containing U2 snRNP stably bound to the pre-mRNA BS, is complex A. We therefore investigated whether Prp43_Ntr1GP can dislodge U2 snRNP from the pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA even at this early stage. The majority of the A complex remained intact after incubation with Prp43 and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) or ATP alone (data not shown), so that the U1 and U2 snRNPs sedimented together with the pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA on the gradient as a ~37S complex. In contrast, after incubation with Prp43_Ntr1GP and ATP, the majority of U2 migrated in the 20S region of the gradient, whereas U1 and pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA co-migrated at ~27S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). IP of gradient fractions after incubation with Prp43_Ntr1GP and ATP, using an antibody against the U1 protein Nam8, showed significant co-precipitation of pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA with U1 snRNP, but only negligible co-precipitation of U2 snRNP in fractions 10–12 and 13–15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, in contrast to the U1 snRNP, U2 snRNP is displaced from the pre<bold>-</bold>mRNA by Prp43_Ntr1GP. These results are supported by the distribution of proteins across the gradient after disassembly of the A complex with Prp43_Ntr1GP and ATP, as analyzed by MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Thus, these results support strongly that the main target of Prp43_Ntr1GP in the spliceosome is the U2 snRNP–BS interaction.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15564.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Prp43_Ntr1GP disassembles A complexes.</title><p>10–30% glycerol gradient sedimentation of purified A complexes incubated with ATP and (<bold>A</bold>) Prp43 or (<bold>B</bold>) Prp43_Ntr1GP.

Thus, specific protein-protein interactions likely aid in recruiting Prp43 to its docking site on the intron close to the U2 snRNP. To identify Prp43 interacting partners in the spliceosome, we performed protein–protein crosslinking experiments with the homobifunctional chemical crosslinker BS3 and B<sup>act ΔPrp2</sup> complexes incubated with Prp43_Ntr1GP in the absence of ATP and then separated from excess Prp43_Ntr1GP by gradient centrifugation. Crosslinks between Prp43_Ntr1GP and other spliceosomal proteins were identified by MS. Prp43_Ntr1GP was reproducibly crosslinked at multiple lysines to the U2 proteins Cus1 and Hsh155, with crosslinks mapped to residues of the C-terminal OB-fold domain of Prp43 and the G-patch of Prp43_Ntr1GP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. Additional crosslinks were observed between Prp43_Ntr1GP and the NTC protein Clf1, the RES proteins Bud13 and Pml1, and several other splicing factors, albeit in a non-reproducible manner (i.e. in only 1 out of 3 experiments). Taken together, these results suggest that the U2 SF3b proteins Cus1 and Hsh155 help to recruit Prp43_Ntr1GP to the spliceosome and aid in its positioning on the intron near the U2 binding site.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Disassembly of the post-catalytic intron-lariat spliceosome (ILS) is catalyzed by the DEAH-box ATPase Prp43 in cooperation with Ntr2 and the G-patch co-factor Ntr1. However, the target structure(s) of Prp43 in the spliceosome, as well as the mechanism whereby Prp43 is specifically recruited to its target site(s) is not known. To address these questions we initially determined the minimal domain requirements of Ntr1 and Ntr2 to promote disassembly of the ILS by Prp43 in a purified system. A fusion protein of Prp43 and the Ntr1 G-patch (Prp43_Ntr1GP) was as active as the NTR in ILS disassembly and yielded identical snRNP and RNA dissociation products, demonstrating that Prp43 plus the Ntr1 GP are necessary and sufficient, and perform the same function as the NTR during ILS disassembly.</p><p>Previous studies indicated that Ntr2 mediates the binding of the NTR to the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tsai et al., 2005</xref>). However, in our purified system, Ntr2 and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Ntr1 are not required for Prp43 to bind to its correct target site(s) on the ILS. Moreover, both Prp43 alone and Prp43_Ntr1GP could be crosslinked to the pre-mRNA in B<sup>act</sup> complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), indicating that their recruitment is not dependent on Ntr2 or the CTD of Ntr1. Indeed, although Prp43, Ntr1 and Ntr2 form a trimeric complex, it is not very stable and thus, NTR components can bind independently of one another, as shown previously for Ntr1/Ntr2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) and shown here for Prp43 and Prp43_Ntr1GP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Taken together, our results are most compatible with a model in which Prp43 recognizes its target site(s) in the spliceosome alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and that Ntr1/Ntr2 recognize their spliceosome binding site(s) independently of Prp43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). In the ILS they must bind at neighboring positions to ensure that Ntr1's GP can interact productively with Prp43, leading to ILS disassembly.</p><p>Our observation that Prp43_Ntr1GP can dismantle purified wild-type B<sup>act</sup> complexes efficiently, whereas in the presence of Ntr1/Ntr2 the B<sup>act</sup> complex is not disassembled by Prp43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicates that Ntr2 and Ntr1's CTD play an important role in ensuring a productive interaction of Prp43 (i.e. leading to complex disassembly) only with spliceosomes that should be discarded or disassembled. As Prp43 alone can bind the B<sup>act</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the lack of disassembly activity by the NTR suggests that Ntr1/Ntr2 do not bind productively or do not have an available binding site yet in the B<sup>act</sup> complex, and thus Prp43 activity is not stimulated. Accordingly, the Ntr1-bound Ntr2 protein appears to act as a 'doorkeeper', allowing a productive interaction of the Ntr1 GP with Prp43 only when a cognate binding site for Ntr1/Ntr2 exists or is available next to the Prp43-binding site in the spliceosome - as is apparently the case for the ILS.</p><p>Our data indicate that the Prp43_Ntr1GP fusion protein is a disassembly factor that recognizes its natural target site on the ILS, but is not under 'access control' by the Ntr1 CTD and Ntr2. Strikingly, not only the pre-catalytic B<sup>act</sup>, but also B and A complexes were dissociated by Prp43_Ntr1GP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). The only structure common to each of these complexes and also the ILS, is the U2 snRNP bound to the intron at/near the BS, suggesting it is the direct target of Prp43. This conclusion was also supported by the observation that (i) intron nucleotides downstream of the BS are not required for docking Prp43_Ntr1GP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and (ii) Prp43_Ntr1GP could be crosslinked to U2 SF3b proteins in purified B<sup>act</sup> complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Similar to ILS disassembly, in the B<sup>act</sup>, B and A complexes binding of U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA BS was completely disrupted. The action of Prp43_Ntr1GP not only disrupted the base-pairing interaction between U2 snRNA and the BS, but also interactions between U2 proteins and the intron. In contrast, UV RNA–protein crosslinking, IP experiments and MS showed that in all cases, the U2 SF3a und SF3b proteins remained associated with the U2 snRNA. This indicates that Prp43_Ntr1GP dislodges U2 snRNP from the pre-mRNA BS region as an intact particle and thus that the release of U2 from the BS does not result from prior disassembly of the U2 snRNP.</p><p>Prp43 alone preferentially, though inefficiently, unwinds model RNA duplexes in vitro in a 5’ to 3’ direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tanaka and Schwer, 2006</xref>). The presence of Ntr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>) enhances Prp43 activity and allows it to unwind model substrates in both 5’ to 3’ and 3’ to 5’ directions. Given that Prp43 binds the pre-mRNA and the U2 snRNP proteins Cus1 and Hsh155 and can efficiently disassemble ActΔ6Bact complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), our data are consistent with the idea that Prp43_Ntr1GP translocates along the pre-mRNA in a 5’ to 3’ direction, thereby displacing pre-mRNA<italic>-</italic>bound U2 proteins and disrupting the U2 snRNA/BS base-pairing interaction. Thus, Prp43 likely acts as a canonical RNPase, most probably coupled with RNA duplex unwinding activity, as shown for the DExH-box RNA helicase NPH-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jankowsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jankowsky et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, Prp43 could function similarly to DEAD-box proteins, which act locally, disrupting or in some cases promoting RNA structures without significant translocation, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guenther and Jankowsky, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jarmoskaite and Russell, 2014</xref>). Indeed DEAH-box proteins that translocate load onto ssRNA and translocate 3’ to 5’, disrupting RNA structures and displacing proteins as they translocate, as for example Prp2 and Prp22, for which targets have been identified. Prp2 requires nucleotides of pre-mRNA downstream of the BS, suggesting 3’ to 5’ translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu and Cheng, 2012</xref>). Along the way, Prp2 is suggested to remodel the binding of the U2 SF3a/b proteins and a number of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Warkocki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lardelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ohrt et al., 2012</xref>). Likely, destabilization of SF3a/b leads to the exposure of the BS and also to remodeling of the catalytic center of the spliceosome so that RNA elements can interact to initiate the first catalytic reaction. Also the action of Prp22 most likely involves directional movement 3’ to 5’ on the mature mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wagner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tanaka and Schwer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schwer, 2008</xref>). Following splicing, Prp22 releases the mRNA from the spliceosome by disrupting base pairs between the U5 snRNP and the mRNA thus breaking several RNA–RNA and RNA–protein contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Company et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wagner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tanaka and Schwer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schwer, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In the ILS and B<sup>act</sup> complex, Prp43_Ntr1GP also disrupted (i) the base-pairing interactions between the U6 and U2 snRNAs (helices I and II), (ii) the base-pairing between the 5' end of the intron and the U6 snRNA ACAGA box, in both cases releasing free U6 snRNA, and (iii) the interaction(s) between the U2 and U5 snRNPs. Thus, Prp43_Ntr1GP could potentially act sequentially on several targets. Alternatively, the U2/BS interaction might serve as a structural 'keystone' that once disrupted by Prp43, destabilizes other interactions in the spliceosome, leading to their passive dissociation. Although we cannot exclude the first possibility, we favor the second, as it is more consistent with the identity of the dissociation products from the various complexes. That is, U2 snRNP is completely displaced from the BS when the B complex is disassembled by Prp43_Ntr1GP, but one third of the U2 snRNP remains stably bound to the tri-snRNP in the form of a U2.U4/U6.U5 tetra-snRNP. Binding of U2 snRNP to the tri-snRNP is stabilized in part by the U2/U6 helix II base pairing interaction. If this helix, which also exists in the B<sup>act</sup> complex and in the ILS, were a target for Prp43_Ntr1GP, then one would expect complete dissociation of the tetra-snRNP into tri-snRNP and U2 snRNP – which however does not occur. Moreover, the U6 snRNA remains base-paired with the U4 snRNA, both in the tri-snRNP and in the tetra-snRNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Finally, after dissociation of B<sup>act</sup>, the U5 snRNP remains stably bound to the pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C,D</xref>). Likewise, the binding of U1 snRNP to the 5’SS is not disrupted by Prp43 after dislodging U2 snRNP from complex A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The latter observations confirm that Prp43_Ntr1GP is not a promiscuous disassembly enzyme. Taken together, our results support the idea that the U2 snRNP/BS interaction is the principal target of Prp43 in the spliceosome and that all other Prp43-mediated spliceosome dissociation products are generated as a consequence of the dissociation of this main building block.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Spliceosome purification and reconstitution</title><p>Yeast A, B, B<sup>act ΔPrp2</sup> or ActΔ6B<sup>act</sup> complexes were assembled in yeast whole cell extracts by incubating with the indicated pre-mRNA containing MS2 aptamers at 23°C for 45 min.

Prp43 mediated spliceosome disassembly is catalyzed in the context of a complex between Prp43 and two other proteins, Ntr1 and Ntr2. A surprising finding here is that a Prp43-Ntr1 G-patch fusion protein can function in disassembly in the absence of Ntr1 and 2. Using this fusion protein the authors show through a careful set of experiments that the target of Prp43's helicase activity is the U2 snRNP/pre-mRNA branch site interaction. In essence Prp43 acts as an RNPase to dissociate U2 snRNP from the pre-mRNA. The fusion protein is capable of dissociating U2 snRNP in all complexes where it is bound to pre-mRNA including the earliest complex, complex A.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) After discussion the reviewers agreed that the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> were not compelling.

I recommend acceptance without significant revision in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Previous work from the Lührmann and Ficner labs established that the NTR complex (composed of Prp43, Ntr1 and Ntr2) is necessary and sufficient for spliceosome recycling by promoting the dissociation of intron-lariat spliceosomes (ILS), and that a fusion protein between the DEAH-box NTPase Prp43 and part of the Glycine patch domain of Ntr1 displays elevated RNA-stimulated ATPase and RNA helicase activities, suggesting that this domain of Ntr1 activates Prp43 function. Fourmann et al. now report a detailed study of the biochemical properties of the Prp43_Ntr1GP fusion, and show that 1) the fusion protein promotes ILS disassembly as efficiently as the complete NTR complex; 2) the fusion protein promotes efficient disassembly of stalled B<sup>actΔPrp2</sup>, B or A complexes, activities that the NTR complex do not display; 3) the fusion protein does not require pre-mRNA sequences downstream from the branch point (BPS) (which are however required for Prp2 helicase-mediated spliceosome activation), while RNA-protein and protein-protein crosslinking suggest that Prp43_Ntr1GP is targeted to the pre-mRNA through interaction with U2 snRNP components and contacts with pre-mRNA sequences upstream of the BPS.</p><p>Collectively, the results nicely support the notion that Prp43 is activated by the GP domain of Ntr1, promoting the disassembly of various spliceosomal complexes, most likely by targeting -at least initially- the interaction between U2 snRNP and the pre-mRNA. These results have general implications for the targeting mechanisms of DEAH box helicases and for how their associated factors can modulate the timing and specificity of their activities.</p><p>In my opinion the manuscript could be improved if the following issues would be addressed/further discussed:</p><p>1) The experiments are generally well-controlled and the results are crisp and convincing. However, while one supplementary figure of the previous Fourmann et al. G&amp;D 2013 paper documented low intrinsic ILS disassembly activity of Prp43 in the absence of Ntr proteins, for the sake of completeness it would be useful to show a direct comparison between Prp43_Ntr1GP and Prp43 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. A more intriguing question, relevant to the mechanism of helicase activation, is the extent to which the effect of the Glycine Patch is specific of Ntr1's domain or whether any other Glycine Patch would work if similarly fused to Prp43.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: the conclusion that U2 snRNP is preferentially dissociated from B<sup>act</sup> complex is based upon a) closer sedimentation profile of pre-mRNA with other snRNAs and b) lack of immunoprecipitation of U2 components using antibodies against components of other complexes (Snu114, Prp19). Can the authors rule out that more than one dissociation pathway/intermediate exists and that in a subset of complexes, Prp43_Ntr1GP may dissociate first other snRNPs? To assess this, it could be helpful to carry out immunoprecipitation assays with antibodies against U2 snRNP components, to validate the quantitative disassembly of the particle from the pre-mRNA while other snRNPs stay. While the result of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> indeed suggests decreased interaction of Hsh155 with the pre-mRNA, the lower levels of the protein in the Prp4343_Ntr1GP-induced complexes, together with the relatively low autoradiography signal, makes it difficult to judge whether the interaction is really absent or just decreased in proportion to the levels of Hsh155 in the complex.</p><p>3) A similar caveat could apply to the result of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>: given the relatively weak RNA crosslinking signal observed for complex B (despite the high levels of Prp9-TAP in the complex), it is unclear whether a proportionally equivalent autoradiography signal corresponding to the substantially lower levels of Prp9-TAP present in the other complexes would be detectable in this assay.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: as for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, immunoprecipitation with anti-U2 components could be helpful to validate their quantitative disassembly from pre-mRNAs.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: given the pattern of RT stops induced by UV irradiation of purified in vitro transcribed RNA (lane 14), it is not easy to see how the very similar pattern observed in the presence of complexes and Prp43_Ntr1GP can unambiguously prove that these are sites of direct interaction with this protein.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The study demonstrates that the Prp43_Ntr1GP fusion protein, characterized previously by Christian et al., 2014, can disassemble intron-lariat containing splicing complexes (ILS) as efficiently as the NTR (Prp43/Ntr1/Ntr2). Importantly, the products of the reaction are the same – IL RNA, U6 snRNA and U2 and U5 snRNPs. The authors go on to show that Prp43_Ntr1GP can also dissociate U2 snRNP from pre-mRNA in purified A, B and B<sup>act</sup> spliceosomes, which are normally not substrates for disassembly by NTR [except at specific stages of the splicing pathway (Chen et al., 2013)]. A common element in all the cases is the U2 snRNP engaged at the branchpoint and the authors suggest a model wherein Prp43_Ntr1GP binds in the intron upstream of the branchsite and translocates in the 5' to 3' direction to displace the U2 snRNP. The authors show that Prp43_Ntr1GP and, with greatly reduced efficiency, Prp43 can be UV cross-linked to pre-mRNA in purified B<sup>act</sup> spliceosomes and using primer extension assays, they map crosslinks in the RNA. The basis for concluding that the crosslinks in the intron (-33 to -25) indicates Prp43_Ntr1GP binding at this position is unclear. The same primer extension stops are present in the Input lanes, independent of whether or not Prp43_Ntr1GP was added and enrichment upon immunoprecipitation with anti-Prp43 only means that Prp43_Ntr1GP is associated with the complex (IP for any of the U2 proteins would likely yield the same picture). The argument that 'no other proteins are known to interact with this region of the intron' (Results) seems rather weak without a reference to data substantiating this statement. Moreover, doesn't the finding that Prp43_Ntr1GP cross-linked more efficiently to the pre-mRNA than Prp43 indicate that binding might be via the G-patch? (Christian et al., 2014 mapped an RNA binding site within the Ntr1 G-patch).</p><p>In summary, the finding that Prp43_Ntr1GP suffices to disassemble ILS in a purified system is very interesting and the model is plausible (although there is not a strong basis for proposing translocation – well-characterized DExH proteins that translocate do so in a 3' to 5' fashion). However, the data (using the B<sup>act</sup> complex, which is not a natural substrate for disassembly by NTR) shown in support of Prp43's interaction with the intron nucleotides upstream of the branchsite are, in my opinion, not convincing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15564.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) After discussion the reviewers agreed that the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> were not compelling.

Mol Cell 36: 537-538) and also indicated by reviewer #3 (Discussion, sixth paragraph).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>We have revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and added an additional panel (panel D), which shows a direct comparison between Prp43_Ntr1GP and Prp43, along the lines recommended by the reviewer.</p><p><italic>A more intriguing question, relevant to the mechanism of helicase activation, is the extent to which the effect of the Glycine Patch is specific of Ntr1's domain or whether any other Glycine Patch would work if similarly fused to Prp43.</italic> This is indeed a very interesting question, which will be addressed in our future studies.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: the conclusion that U2 snRNP is preferentially dissociated from B<sup>act</sup> complex is based upon a) closer sedimentation profile of pre-mRNA with other snRNAs and b) lack of immunoprecipitation of U2 components using antibodies against components of other complexes (snu114, Prp19). Can the authors rule out that more than one dissociation pathway / intermediate exists and that in a subset of complexes, Prp43_Ntr1GP may dissociate first other snRNPs? To assess this, it could be helpful to carry out immunoprecipitation assays with antibodies against U2 snRNP components, to validate the quantitative disassembly of the particle from the pre-mRNA while other snRNPs stay. While the result of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> indeed suggests decreased interaction of Hsh155 with the pre-mRNA, the lower levels of the protein in the Prp4343_Ntr1GP-induced complexes, together with the relatively low autoradiography signal, makes it difficult to judge whether the interaction is really absent or just decreased in proportion to the levels of Hsh155 in the complex.</italic> In our revised manuscript, to validate the quantitative dissociation of the U2 snRNP from the pre-mRNA, we carried out IP experiments using the Cus1-TAP extract. Disassembled B<sup>act ΔPrp2</sup> spliceosomes were incubated with Protein A–Sepharose beads that carried IgG, to which the TAP tag binds efficiently. We show a selective immunoprecipitation of the U2 snRNP, indicating quantitative dissociation of the U2 particle from the pre-mRNA, which is thus not coprecipitated together with the U2 snRNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, subsection “Prp43_Ntr1GP, but not the NTR, disassembles B<sup>act</sup> complexes”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) A similar caveat could apply to the result of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>: given the relatively weak RNA crosslinking signal observed for complex B (despite the high levels of Prp9-TAP in the complex), it is unclear whether a proportionally equivalent autoradiography signal corresponding to the substantially lower levels of Prp9-TAP present in the other complexes would be detectable in this assay.</italic> Similarly, in our revised manuscript we show new pull-down experiments using IgG-Sepharose and the Cus1-TAP extract, which confirmed that after disassembly of the B complex by Prp43_Ntr1GP, the pre-mRNA is not coprecipitated together with the U2 snRNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, lanes 3,4), and it is only slightly precipitated from fractions 13-15 containing the U2.U4/U6.U5 tetra-snRNPs and some U2 and U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNPs (lane 5)(subsection “The U2 snRNP-intron interaction is a major target of Prp43 in the spliceosome”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: given the pattern of RT stops induced by UV irradiation of purified</italic> in vitro</p><p> <italic>transcribed RNA (lane 14), it is not easy to see how the very similar pattern observed in the presence of complexes and Prp43_Ntr1GP can unambiguously prove that these are sites of direct interaction with this protein.</italic> In our revised manuscript we have deleted <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the primer extension assays, as the reviewing editors and the reviewers had the opinion that the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> were not convincing. Please see our answer to comment 1 of the reviewing editors.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The study demonstrates that the Prp43_Ntr1GP fusion protein, characterized previously by Christian et al., 2014, can disassemble intron-lariat containing splicing complexes (ILS) as efficiently as the NTR (Prp43/Ntr1/Ntr2). […] The argument that 'no other proteins are known to interact with this region of the intron' (Results) seems rather weak without a reference to data substantiating this statement. Moreover, doesn't the finding that Prp43_Ntr1GP cross-linked more efficiently to the pre-mRNA than Prp43 indicate that binding might be via the G-patch? (Christian et al., 2014 mapped an RNA binding site within the Ntr1 G-patch).</p><p>In our revised manuscript we have deleted <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the primer extension assays, as the reviewing editors and the reviewer #2 had the opinion that the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> were not convincing. Please see our answer to comment 1 of the reviewing editors.</p><p>In summary, the finding that Prp43_Ntr1GP suffices to disassemble ILS in a purified system is very interesting and the model is plausible (although there is not a strong basis for proposing translocation – well-characterized DExH proteins that translocate do so in a 3' to 5' fashion). However, the data (using the B<sup>act</sup> complex, which is not a natural substrate for disassembly by NTR) shown in support of Prp43's interaction with the intron nucleotides upstream of the branchsite are, in my opinion, not convincing.</p><p>We agree that there is not a strong basis for proposing translocation and that other characterized DExH proteins that translocate do so in a 3' to 5' fashion. For this reason we added a new paragraph in our Discussion were we point out that “Prp43 could function similarly to DEAD-box proteins, which act locally, disrupting or in some cases promoting RNA structures without significant translocation, as suggested previously (Guenther and Jankowsky 2009; Jarmoskaite and Russell 2014). Indeed DEAH-box proteins that translocate load onto ssRNA and translocate 3’ to 5’, disrupting RNA structures and displacing proteins as they translocate, as for example Prp2 and Prp22, for which targets have been identified.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
