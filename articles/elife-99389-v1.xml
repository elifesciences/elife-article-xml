and immunotherapies. In HIS mice that generate T cells de novo from hematopoietic progenitors, T cell-dependent multisystem autoimmune disease occurs, most rapidly when the human T cells develop in the native NOD.Cg- <italic>Prkdc</italic>scid <italic>Il2rg</italic>tm1Wjl (NSG) mouse thymus, where negative selection is abnormal. Disease develops very late when human T cells develop in human fetal thymus grafts, where robust negative selection is observed. We demonstrate here that PD-1<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> peripheral (Tph) helper-like and follicular (Tfh) helper-like T cells developing in HIS mice can induce autoimmune disease. Tfh-like cells were more prominent in HIS mice with a mouse thymus, in which the highest levels of IgG were detected in plasma, compared to those with a human thymus. While circulating IgG and IgM antibodies were autoreactive to multiple mouse antigens, in vivo depletion of B cells and antibodies did not delay the development of autoimmune disease. Conversely, adoptive transfer of enriched Tfh- or Tph-like cells induced disease and autoimmunity-associated B cell phenotypes in recipient mice containing autologous human APCs without T cells. Tfh/Tph cells from mice with a human thymus expanded and induced disease more rapidly than those originating in a murine thymus, implicating HLA-restricted T cell-APC interactions in this process. Since Tfh, Tph, autoantibodies, and lymphopenia-induced proliferation (LIP) have all been implicated in various forms of human autoimmune disease, the observations here provide a platform for the further dissection of human autoimmune disease mechanisms and therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T follicular helper cell</kwd><kwd>human immune system</kwd><kwd>T peripheral helper cell</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>autoimmunity</kwd><kwd>B cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 AI 045897</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sykes</surname><given-names>Megan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 DK 123559</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sykes</surname><given-names>Megan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functional analyses identify Tfh-like and Tph-like CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as drivers of a spontaneous autoimmune syndrome characterized by autoreactive B cells in human immune system mice.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human immune system (HIS) mice provide unique opportunities to investigate human immune biology and therapies. Many different versions of these models exist, the simplest of which involves infusion of human lymphocytes from human donors into immunodeficient mouse recipients. Such models, however, are limited by graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) initiated by adoptively transferred human xenoreactive T cells that recognize murine host antigens, thereby limiting the duration and type of information that can be obtained from such models. Additional HIS mouse models involve the de novo generation in immunodeficient mouse recipients of HIS from human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells injected intravenously. When NOD mice deficient in T, B, and NK cells such as NOD.Cg-<italic>Prkdc</italic>scid <italic>Il2rg</italic>tm1Wjl (NSG) mice are used as recipients, human T cells develop in the murine thymus, while B cells and myeloid antigen-presenting cells develop in the recipient bone marrow. However, we recently demonstrated that human T cells developing de novo in the NSG mouse thymus do not undergo normal negative selection for self-antigens and lack normal thymocyte diversity. We further showed that the thymus does not develop normal structure and contains a paucity of medullary epithelial cells. These T cells induce a multiorgan disease characterized by human immune cell infiltrates in multiple organs, usually within 5â8 months after transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>). Because the causal T cells develop de novo in the recipient mice, we describe this as an autoimmune disease rather than GVHD, which is induced by mature T cells transferred to immunodeficient mice in human hematopoietic cell grafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brehm et al., 2019</xref>). Following transplantation of an autologous or partially HLA-matched (to intravenously administered fetal CD34<sup>+</sup> cells) human fetal thymus graft, the developing thymocytes undergo negative selection for self-antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>), reflecting the presence of both human and murine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kalscheuer et al., 2012</xref>) APCs in the thymus graft and the presence of a normal human cortico-medullary thymic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>). T cells developing in a human thymus graft eventually cause autoimmune disease, but with a significant delay if the native murine thymus has been removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>). The slowly evolving autoimmune disease induced by T cells developing de novo in human thymus grafts is independent of direct recognition of murine antigens, as it develops with similar velocity in NSG mice expressing murine MHC and those completely lacking murine Class I and Class II MHC antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The original descriptions of this model involved the use of human fetal thymus and liver tissue engrafted under the kidney capsule along with intravenous administration of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from the same FL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Melkus et al., 2006</xref>). While the term âbone marrow, liver, thymus, BLTâ mouse has been widely used to describe this model, the model does not include bone marrow and we found the FL fragment to be unnecessary for immune system development. Consequently, âBLTâ does not adequately describe the essential components of the model. Instead, we have adopted the term âHu/Huâ to denote HIS mice constructed with human (Hu) fetal thymus and autologous human FL CD34<sup>+</sup> cells administered i.v. Denoting the origin of the thymus and CD34<sup>+</sup> cells separately has allowed us to specify variations on the model in which, for example, the thymus tissue originates in fetal swine (the âSw/Huâ model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nikolic et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shimizu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Khosravi Maharlooei, et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kalscheuer et al., 2014</xref>]) or when the native mouse thymus is used to generate human T cells (the âMu/Huâ model described here) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>We have now examined the role of B cells, autoantibodies, and T cell help for B cells in the development of autoimmune disease in HIS mice. Our results demonstrate that B cell help from follicular (Tfh)- and peripheral (Tph) helper-like T cells drives B cell differentiation and autoantibody responses and that these T cells are sufficient to cause disease in the absence of B cells or antibodies. Furthermore, a global lack of T cell tolerance to murine and human self-antigens is a major driver of autoimmune disease among HIS mice whose T cells develop in a murine thymus. In contrast, the disease that develops later in HIS mice whose T cells develop in a human thymus is likely dependent on a lack of tolerance to tissue-restricted murine antigens presented on human APCs. These studies provide novel insights with utility for dissecting mechanisms of autoimmune disease induction by human T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mouse-reactive T cells in HIS mice with mouse or human thymus</title><p>We have previously demonstrated that a thymus-dependent multiorgan autoimmune disease occurs in HIS mice generated by intravenous injection of human fetal liver (FL) CD34<sup>+</sup> cells into NSG mice and that this disease develops more rapidly in mice containing a native murine thymus (termed âMu/Hu miceâ [murine thymus/human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells]) than in thymectomized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2020</xref>) NSG mice receiving a human thymus graft, termed âHu/Hu miceâ (human thymus/human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>). While Mu/Hu mice rely on the native mouse thymus for human T cell development, T cells in Hu/Hu mice develop in the human fetal thymus graft. At 20 weeks after transplantation, animals in both groups were sacrificed and their splenocytes were CFSE-labeled and tested for reactivity to autologous FL-derived human dendritic cells (DCs) and for responses to NSG mouse bone marrow-derived DCs (anti-host response) as well as responses to autologous human DCs pulsed with apoptotic NSG mouse DCs (indirect anti-host response). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, T cells from Hu/Hu and Mu/Hu mice showed proliferation to autologous human DCs that was not significantly augmented by pulsing of human DCs with murine antigens. Since the responder splenocyte preparations were not depleted of murine cells, we cannot distinguish whether the baseline proliferation represents responses to human antigens or to murine antigens presented by these DCs. However, proliferation of both CD4 and CD8 T cells to NSG mouse DCs was greater in Mu/Hu mice than in three of four Hu/Hu mice, which showed little, if any, direct proliferation to murine antigens. Proliferation of Mu/Hu CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to murine DCs was significantly greater than proliferation in the absence of DCs, in contrast to Hu/Hu CD4 cells, suggesting a lack of tolerance to NSG antigens only in Mu/Hu CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This observation is consistent with the lack of cortico-medullary structure or normal negative selection in the native murine thymi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lack of tolerance to murine recipient antigens of CD4 T cells developing in mouse thymus compared to those developing in human thymus.</title><p>Mu/Hu (n=4) and Hu/Hu (n=4) mice were sacrificed 20 weeks after transplantation and their splenocytes were CFSE-labeled and tested for reactivity to various antigen-presenting cells.

While no significant differences in Tph-like cell frequency and absolute numbers were detected between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), percentages of Tfh-like cells were significantly greater in spleens of Mu/Hu compared to Hu/Hu mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The numbers of both Tph-like and Tfh-like cells increased over time in both HIS mouse groups and staining for Ki67 revealed high proliferative rates for both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that Tph and Tfh differentiate and expand over time and do so more rapidly in Mu/Hu than Hu/Hu mice. These data correlate with the more rapid onset of autoimmune disease in Mu/Hu than Hu/Hu mice, consistent with a role for these T cell types in disease development.</p><p>To further characterize Tph-like and Tfh-like cells in HIS mice, we measured ICOS expression and IL-21 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>). These cells expressed higher levels of ICOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) and, upon phorbol myristic acid (PMA)/ionomycin stimulation, secreted more IL-21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) compared to control, CD45RA<sup>+</sup> T cells, consistent with helper function and with their role in humans. The majority of Tfh-like and Tph-like cells in Mu/Hu and Hu/Hu mice expressed ICOS, though the percentage of ICOS<sup>+</sup> cells was significantly higher in Mu/Hu Tfh-like and Tph-like cells compared to their Hu/Hu counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).</p><p>We also compared the levels of FOXP3 within splenic Tfh-like and Tph-like populations in Hu/Hu and Mu/Hu mice.

autoantibody production, we performed phenotypic analysis of B cells. These studies revealed increased proportions of activated or age-associated B cells (IgDâ»CD27<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>) and atypical B cells (IgDâ»CD27â»CD11c<sup>+</sup>) in Mu/Hu mice compared to those from Hu/Hu mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p>To assess the possible role of B cells in the development of autoimmunity in HIS mice, we treated Hu/Hu mice with rituximab (anti-CD20) once every 3 weeks from 20 to 38 weeks post-transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, this treatment successfully depleted B cells from the circulation and eliminated serum IgM. Immunofluorescent analysis of serum IgM from rituximab-treated mice showed an absence of autoreactive IgM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, B cell depletion with this method did not prevent or even delay disease development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting a minor, if any, role for antibodies in disease progression. However, since it remained possible that serum antibody was critical in presenting antigen to T cells and/or initiating inflammation that caused later disease, we also evaluated the impact of rituximab treatment early post-transplant. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, starting rituximab treatment 1 week post-transplant and continuing through the post-transplant course also failed to delay or reduce the development of disease and, surprisingly, significantly accelerated its development. From these results, we concluded that antibodies were not required for disease development.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>B cell depletion does not prevent disease development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Human immune system (HIS) mice with mouse thymus were generated as described in Materials and methods and were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg of rituximab (anti-CD20) or PBS every 3 weeks from W20 to W38.

We first generated a cohort of Mu/Hu and Hu/Hu mice from the same human FL CD34 cell donor. Twenty-two weeks later, after T cells had reconstituted the spleen, we euthanized both groups of HIS mice and FACS-sorted splenic CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>-</sup> CD45RO<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup> Tfh-like and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>-</sup>CD45RO<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>-</sup> Tph-like cells. These T cells were adoptively transferred intravenously into thymectomized NSG mouse recipients that had received FL CD34<sup>+</sup> cells 12 weeks earlier from the same human donor. Since these latter recipients lacked an endogenous (murine) thymus and had not received a thymus graft, they reconstituted only with B cells and myeloid APCs derived from the fetal HSC donor and did not generate T cells, as we have previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, there were five different recipient groups: (a) no T cell transfer (APC only, n=3), (b) mice that received Tph-enriched (n=5) or (c) Tfh-enriched cells (n=3) from Hu/Hu mice, and mice that received (d) Tph-enriched (n=5) and (e) Tfh-enriched cells (n=3) from Mu/Hu mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> illustrates the gating strategy used to isolate Tfh and Tph cells from donor spleens.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Expansion of donor T cells in thymecomized recipient human immune system (HIS) mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schema for adoptive transfer experiment.

This difference largely reflected an increase in the percentage of atypical B cells (IgDâ»CD27â»CD11c<sup>+</sup>, DN2) in the recipients of Hu/Hu T cells.

Clinical disease was also more apparent in recipients of Hu/Hu T cells, with the most rapid onset in recipients of Hu/Hu Tfh-like cells. In contrast, most recipients of Mu/Hu T cells did not develop clinically apparent disease during the follow-up period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Together, our data suggest that T cells developing in an autologous human thymus graft interact more effectively with peripheral B cells and other APCs, presumably reflecting thymic positive selection on the same HLA molecules as those in the peripheral APCs, resulting in T cell expansion, increased CD11c expression on B cells, and eventually disease development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We recently demonstrated that human T cells play a requisite role in inducing a multiorgan autoimmune disease that develops in HIS mice that have a native murine or grafted human thymus and receive human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells intravenously. The disease is characterized by organ infiltration by human T cells and macrophages and develops more rapidly in mice with a native murine thymus (Mu/Hu mice), where they fail to undergo normal negative selection, apparently due to the lack of a normal thymic structure, including a paucity of medullary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, thymectomized HIS mice that receive human fetal thymus grafts (Hu/Hu mice) demonstrate negative selection for self-antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>), have normal human cortico-medullary thymic structure and develop autoimmune disease significantly later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>). The marked delay in disease development in Hu/Hu compared to Mu/Hu mice is mitigated by the presence of a murine thymus in non-thymectomized recipients of human thymus and CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>), partially explaining the slower disease development in our model compared to studies in non-thymectomized âBLTâ mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Greenblatt et al., 2012</xref>). Another reason for the delay in disease development in our model is the measures taken to deplete thymocytes preexisting in the thymus graft at the time of transplantation, as these also accelerate disease development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>). Unlike GVHD induced by mature T cells transferred in human PBMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brehm et al., 2019</xref>), the slowly evolving autoimmune disease (termed autoimmune because it is mediated by T cells developing de novo in the recipient rather than by cells carried in the graft) in Hu/Hu mice is independent of direct recognition of murine antigens, as it develops with similar velocity in NSG mice that express MHC and in those that completely lack (due to Î²2m and CIITA knockout) murine Class I and Class II MHC antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We have now demonstrated that autoimmunity in both Mu/Hu and Hu/Hu mice is associated with the appearance of Tph-like memory T cells and, to a greater extent in Mu/Hu than Hu/Hu mice, of Tfh-like cells in the circulation and spleen. Development of these T cell subsets is associated with differentiation of memory and class-switched B cells and characterized by the presence in serum of human IgM and IgG autoantibodies. The development of IgG autoantibodies was dependent on human T cells in HIS mice, consistent with previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Danner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>). While mice lacking T cells also generated low levels of IgM autoantibodies, IgM levels were markedly increased by the presence of T cells.</p><p>Importantly, our data indicate that neither B cells nor antibodies are required for disease development. All HIS mice in our studies contained IgM autoantibodies, regardless of the presence or absence of T cells, though total IgM levels were increased in the groups containing T cells. In mice, the majority of natural IgM autoantibodies are produced by splenic B1 cells. Many of these are polyreactive, demonstrate autoreactivity and may play a predominantly regulatory, protective role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lobo, 2016</xref>). The high levels of IgM against specific antigens that were detected in sera of our HIS mice were consistent with polyreactivity, since the sum of their levels against three antigens was greater than total IgM levels in some cases. The lack of a functional C5 complement component, rendering membrane attack complex and C5a anaphylatoxin production impossible, may help to explain the lack of pathogenicity of autoantibodies observed in our studies and different results might be obtained in NSG recipients engineered to correct the C5 deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Verma et al., 2017</xref>). However, C3 and C4 cleavage products of more proximal complement component activation might be expected to mediate significant pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Goldberg and Ackerman, 2020</xref>) and we are therefore surprised that B cells did not play a more readily apparent role in driving disease. In fact, the acceleration of disease in animals depleted of B cells from the beginning of the post-transplant period suggests that B cells may play a predominantly regulatory role in this model. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that adoptive recipients of Tph-like and Tfh-like cells from Hu/Hu mice demonstrated an increase (compared to counterparts receiving T cells from Mu/Hu mice) in CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cells, an effector B cell population otherwise known as age-associated B cells that is increased in association with human autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mouat et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Karnell et al., 2017</xref>). These data directly demonstrate the capacity of Tfh- and Tph-like cells from Hu/Hu, and to a lesser extent, from Mu/Hu mice, to induce the differentiation of this unique B cell subset. Our adoptive transfer studies also directly demonstrate the capacity of Tfh- and Tph-like cells generated in HIS mice to induce class-switched IgG-expressing and IgG-secreting B cells.</p><p>In vitro studies demonstrated effective help for differentiation of autologous B cells by T cells that differentiate in an autologous human thymus graft and less effective T-B interactions for T cells that differentiated in the xenogeneic murine thymus. These results are consistent with the interpretation that positive selection in an autologous thymus generates T cells that interact more effectively with autologous human APCs and B cells than T cells generated in a murine thymus lacking HLA molecules. Indeed, T cells have been shown to be essential for B cell maturation in HIS mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lang et al., 2013</xref>) and increased IgG levels are detected in association with greater T cell reconstitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brainard et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, introduction of an HLA Class II molecule into the mouse has been reported to enhance human T-B cell interactions in HIS mice with a murine thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Danner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In view of the improved T cell-B cell interactions in Hu/Hu compared to Mu/Hu mice, it is somewhat paradoxical that Mu/Hu mice demonstrate increased levels of class-switched IgG antibodies and increased activated/atypical B cells compared to Hu/Hu mice. However, we believe the failure to negatively select human autoreactive T cells in the murine thymus, as we have previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>), may provide an explanation for this paradox. If human T cells developing in a murine thymus are not centrally tolerized to murine antigens presented by human APCs, they may be expected to react with human APCs loaded with murine antigens, including human B cells, in the periphery in a manner that resembles an alloresponse. Alloresponses can activate B cells and induce polyclonal class-switched antibody responses that include autoantibodies, as shown in MHC heterozygous (F1) mice receiving MHC homozygous parental T cells, eliciting a GVH response that manifests as autoimmunity with autoantibodies, referred to as âlupus-likeâ GVHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Soloviova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tschetter et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with this possibility, responses of Mu/Hu splenic CD4 T cells to mouse antigen-loaded human DCs were stronger than those of Hu/Hu splenic T cells. Additionally, the increase in activated/age-associated (IgD<sup>-</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>) and atypical (IgD<sup>-</sup>CD27<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>) B cells in Mu/Hu compared to Hu/Hu mice points to increased B cell activation in Mu/Hu mice.</p><p>The observed absence of a role for B cells in disease development thus requires alternative explanations for the more rapid disease development in Mu/Hu than Hu/Hu mice. Additional studies indicate that lymphopenia-induced proliferation (LIP) of T cells entering the periphery is increased in Mu/Hu compared to Hu/Hu mice, in which thymopoiesis and peripheral T cell reconstitution is more robust, and that LIP plays a significant role in the development of disease (M Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., manuscript in preparation). Consistently, studies in mice have strongly implicated LIP in autoimmune disease development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">King et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Le Campion et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McPherson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang and Bevan, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The adoptive transfer studies described here, in which Tfh- and Tph-like cells from Hu/Hu mice induced more rapid disease than those from Mu/Hu mice, demonstrated the relative disease-causing potential of these cells in the absence of variations in T cell reconstitution, as the cells were introduced to identical, completely T cell-deficient environments. Adoptive transfer of Hu/Hu T cells led to more rapid expansion than that of Mu/Hu T cells, suggesting that recognition of the same HLA antigens in the periphery as those mediating thymic positive selection optimizes LIP. This increased LIP may account for the more rapid disease development in the recipients of Hu/Hu than Mu/Hu Tfh- and Tph-like cells. Consistent with this interpretation, we have previously demonstrated that human peripheral APCs are absolutely required for survival, LIP, and effector differentiation of Hu/Hu T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Onoe et al., 2010</xref>). As reported for murine T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Min et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Surh and Sprent, 2008</xref>), rapid LIP of human T cells is likely to be antigen-driven. Given that indirect presentation of murine antigens on human APCs is sufficient to drive disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>), we conclude that incomplete negative selection of indirectly xenoreactive mouse-specific T cells (possibly recognizing tissue-restricted antigens normally produced by murine thymic epithelial cells, which are absent in human thymus grafts) in a human thymus allows these T cells to recognize murine peptides presented on human APCs. This interpretation is consistent with our in vitro findings of tolerance to murine antigens presented directly on murine DCs, since murine APCs are present in the human thymic medulla of Hu/Hu mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kalscheuer et al., 2012</xref>) and of weak but measurable reactivity to autologous DCs capable of presenting murine antigens indirectly.</p><p>While lack of tolerance to murine antigens in the primary Mu/Hu mice reflects the lack of medullary structure and of central tolerance in the native mouse thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>), the number of these T cells that expand in the periphery may be constrained by their positive selection on murine cortical epithelium and MHC, resulting in a more oligoclonal (compared to Hu/Hu mice) expansion of T cells recognizing murine peptides presented on human APCs expressing HLA. This situation is exacerbated by the markedly reduced diversity of the human TCR repertoire selected in the native murine thymus vs the human thymus graft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>). The extensive expansion of a smaller population of peripheral T cells in Mu/Hu compared to Hu/Hu mice may have resulted in exhaustion of Tfh- and Tph-like cells in Mu/Hu mice prior to the time of transfer, delaying disease onset in adoptive recipients. Exhaustion has been reported for human T cells in HIS mice with GVHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tary-Lehmann et al., 1994</xref>) and chronic HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brainard et al., 2009</xref>). The observed inability of direct antigen presentation on murine cells to drive LIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Onoe et al., 2010</xref>) or disease development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khosravi-Maharlooei et al., 2021</xref>), and hence dependence on antigen presentation on human APCs likely reflects failed coreceptor, costimulatory, adhesive, and/or cytokine interactions between human T cells and murine cells. While this in vivo result may seem inconsistent with the increased reactivity to murine antigens in vitro of T cells from Mu/Hu compared to those from Hu/Hu mice, human APCs were also present in these cultures, resulting in an inability to specifically assess direct xenoreactivity.</p><p>An additional possible contributor to accelerated autoimmune disease development in Mu/Hu compared to Hu/Hu mice may be inferior Treg function in the Mu/Hu group due to the incompatibility of the MHC of the murine thymic epithelium and the paucity of medullary epithelium responsible for positive selection of Tregs, resulting in a deficiency of Tregs that are capable of interacting with human APCs in the periphery or capable of recognizing murine antigens directly. This interpretation is consistent with the known role of Tregs in regulating Tfh activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Walker, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Tfh and Tph are subsets of human effector T cells that are closely related and have been implicated in autoimmune diseases, yet have distinct phenotypes and functions, with Tfh providing help for naÃ¯ve B cell differentiation and Tph acting predominantly on memory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yoshitomi and Ueno, 2021</xref>). Tfh are found largely in lymphoid tissues while Tph are generally found in inflamed tissues, though both seem to have a circulating component. Ratios of Bcl-6 to Blimp1 transcription factors are lower for Tph than Tfh and Tph have been suggested to drive extrafollicular differentiation of age-related B cells in autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yoshitomi and Ueno, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Jenks et al., 2019</xref>). While it is unknown whether there is plasticity/interchangeability between these subsets, our adoptive transfer studies are the first, to our knowledge, to suggest that there may be. In these studies, Tph-enriched T cells showed greater proliferative capacity overall than Tfh-enriched populations from Hu/Hu and Mu/Hu mice. Remarkably, the final number of Tph-like cells was quite similar and more than an order of magnitude higher than that of Tfh in recipients of either Tfh- or Tph-enriched populations, suggesting that Tfh may have the capacity to transition to the Tph phenotype when they expand in a lymphopenic environment. However, we cannot rule out the expansion of a contaminating Tph population in the sorted Tfh preparations, and fate-mapping studies will be needed to definitively address this question.</p><p>In summary, our data directly demonstrate the pathogenicity and capacity to induce antibody secretion of expanded human Tph- and Tfh-like cells and implicate both limitations in thymic selection and LIP as factors driving the development of autoimmune disease in HIS mice. Since Tfh, Tph, autoantibodies, and LIP have all been implicated in various forms of human autoimmune disease, the observations here provide a platform for the further dissection of human autoimmune disease mechanisms and therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and tissues</title><p>NSG (NOD.Cg-<italic>Prkdc</italic>scid <italic>Il2rg</italic>tm1Wjl) mice (Strain #:005557, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:IMSR_JAX:005557">IMSR_JAX:005557</ext-link>) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and were housed and bred in specific pathogen-free helicobacter and Pasteurella pneumotropica-free conditions in the Animal Facility at Columbia University Medical Center.

However, mechanistic studies in humans are necessarily limited. To bridge this gap many groups have worked on developing humanised mouse models in which human immune cells are introduced into mice allowing their fine manipulation. However, since human immune cells will attack murine tissues, it has proven complex to establish a human-like immune system in mice. To help address this Vecchione et al, have previously developed several models using human cell transfer into mice with or without human thymic fragments that allow negative selection of autoreactive cells. In this report they focus on the examination of the function of the B-helper CD4 T-cell subsets T-follicular helper (Tfh) and T-peripheral helper (Tph) cells.

In some cases, the definition of Tph-like does not seem to differentiate well between Tph and highly activated CD4 T-cells in general, partly since the literature around these cells has not fully resolved this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99389.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Humanized mice, developed by transplanting human cells into immunodeficient NSG mice to recapitulate the human immune system, are utilized in basic life science research and preclinical trials of pharmaceuticals in fields such as oncology, immunology, and regenerative medicine.

While the emergence of T cells in HIS mice increases the size of lymphoid tissues, the structure remains suboptimal and vaccination responses are limited. We believe this is mainly due to the common gamma chain knockout, which results in a lack of murine lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, which require IL-7 signaling to interact with murine mesenchymal cells for normal lymphoid tissue development. Ongoing efforts by our group and others aim to address this challenge by providing the necessary signals. Despite this challenge, these mice do develop Tfh cells, allowing us to study this cell subset.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the distinction between Tph and highly activated CD4 T cells is incomplete.</p><p>However, we have provided several distinctions in our manuscript that support the presence of Tph in HIS mice: (1) Tph cells exhibit very high levels of PD-1 expression, whereas other activated CD4 cells have varying levels of PD-1 expression.

Discussions touching on possible changes in TCR repertoire diversity between Mu/Hu- and Hu/Hu- T cells would have been beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>Consistent with the reviewerâs suggestion, we have previously shown that the TCR repertoire in Mu/Hu mice is less diverse than that in Hu/Hu mice (Khosravi-Maharlooei M, et al., J Autoimmun., 2021). We believe that the narrowed TCR repertoire in the periphery of Mu/Hu mice, combined with the inadequate negative selection in the murine thymus reported in the paper cited above, results in selective peripheral expansion primarily of the few T cell clones that are cross-reactive with HLA/murine self peptide complexes presented by human APCs in the periphery. We have discussed the reasons why these cells, when transferred to secondary recipients containing the same APCs, might not be as active as the more diverse, HLA-selected T cell repertoire transferred from Hu/Hu mice. These possible reasons include exhaustion of the T cells in Mu/Hu mice, limited expression of the few targeted HLA-peptide complexes recognized by the narrow cross-reactive TCR repertoire of Mu/Hu T cells and the consequent relatively impaired T-B cell collaboration in these mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The authors note that they removed an outlier result from Figures 1 B &amp; C. With only 4 mice it seems difficult to see exactly how they determined the result was an outlier. Presumably, it was quite different from the others but in such a small dataset removing data without a very clear statistical rationale seems likely to strongly influence the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised Fig 1 to include the previously-deleted outlier mouse.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4. The authors describe the follicular area. Were they able to observe any GC-like structures in their data?</p><p>From the examples, I can see that the PNA staining is sometimes diffuse but even if the authors felt they could not observe a distinct GC this should be stated and discussed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We now describe the three colors IF staining in more detail in accordance with this comment. We characterized 4 Hu/Hu and 3 Mu/Hu spleens earlier than 20 weeks post-transplant. In all of these mice, distinct B cell areas (CD20+) were obvious and PNA+ cells were more concentrated in the B cell zones. We stained 4 Hu/Hu and 3 Mu/Hu spleens from mice between 20-30 weeks post-transplant and found that B cell areas were smaller in all these spleens compared to those taken before 20-weeks post-transplant. PNA+ areas are also more diffusely distributed and are not enriched in the B cell areas. Only 2 Mu/Hu mice showed clear B cell zones with some enriched PNA+ areas in the B cell zones. Additionally, we stained 2 Hu/Hu and 2 Mu/Hu mice later than week 30 post-transplant. No distinct B cell areas were observed in any of the spleens of these mice and PNA+ cells were diffusely distributed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3E the authors sort CD25-CXCR5-CD45RA- CD4 T-cells as Tph. This does seem a very loose definition including essentially all non-naÃ¯ve CD4 cells that are not Tregs or Tfh.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the distinction between Tph and highly activated CD4 T cells is incomplete.</p><p>However, we have provided several distinctions in our manuscript that support the presence of Tph in HIS mice: (1) Tph cells exhibit very high levels of PD-1, whereas other activated CD4 cells have varying levels of PD-1 expression. (2) Tph cells express IL-21. (3) Tph cells promote B cell differentiation and antibody production.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Tph is sometimes a hard cell type to separate from more general highly activated CD4 T-cells. The broad CXCR5PD1+ phenotype they have used is common in the literature and the authors have confirmed some enrichment of IL21 production by these cells. However, they should consider if there are ways of further confirming this by examination of other markers such as CCR2 and CCR5 or elimination of other effector identities such as Th1 and Th17 or PD1+ exhaustion phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>For this study, we chose to follow the commonly used definitions in the literature for Tph and Tfh cells. For this reason, we are careful to refer to âTph-likeâ cells rather than Tph cells in this manuscript. Distinguishing Tph cells from other subsets of activated CD4 cells would require further studies such as single cell RNA seq, which we hope to be able to perform in the future with additional funding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 8. The authors perform some analysis of B-cell phenotypes looking at markers such as CD27, IgD in 8B, and CD11c in 8C. Why is CD11c considered in isolation? The level of expression of the other markers would change how this data would be interpreted e.g. IgD-CD27-CD11c+ = DN2/Atypical cells, IgD-CD27+CD11c+ = Activated or ageassociated, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment, we reanalyzed the splenic samples of the donor Mu/Hu and Hu/Hu mice and their adoptive recipients. Interestingly, in the T cell donors, the Mu/Hu B cells included greater proportions of activated/age-associated B cells (IgD-CD27+CD11c+) and atypical cells (IgD-CD27-CD11c+), compared to the Hu/Hu B cells. This is consistent with the increased disease, increased Tph/Tfh and increased IgG antibody findings in the primary Mu/Hu compared to Hu/Hu mice. These results have been added to Figure 5G. We performed a similar analysis in the blood (week 9) and spleen of adoptive recipient mice. These studies showed that activated/ageassociated B cells (IgD-CD27+CD11c+) and atypical cells (IgD-CD27-CD11c+) were significantly increased in the adoptive recipients of Hu/Hu Tph and Tfh cells compared to the adoptive recipients of Mu/Hu Tph and Tfh cells (Fig. 8C). These results are consistent with the disease, T cell expansion and antibody results in the adoptive recipients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data not shown occurs often in this manuscript. In some cases what is not shown is potentially important. The authors note in the text relating to Figure 7 that the &quot;purity of the cell populations as assessed by FCM ranged from 56-60% (data not shown)&quot;. Those numbers are a little alarming. They are referring to the purity of the FCS sorted Tfh and Tph prior to transfer? Currently, some of the discussion of this paper is about the possibility of plasticity, with Tfh switching into a Tph phenotype. If the transferred cell populations are 56-60% pure I don't think it is possible to make any interpretation of plasticity.</p></disp-quote><p>We looked into this further and realized that the purity figure cited in the original manuscript was erroneous due to a misunderstanding on the part of the first author of a question from the senior author. Unfortunately, data on the purity of the FACS-sorted population was not saved. However, we have added panel B to Figure 7 to show the sorting strategy for Tfh and Tph cells. We agree that any discussion of plasticity between these cell types is speculative, as outgrowth of a minor population is possible even from well-purified sorted cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>Some graphs have issues with presentation; Figures 5D and 5E, split scale clips data points. 5F the color representing time would be better replaced with direct labels. 6C and 6C some distortion of text clipping other elements.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed 5D and 5E y axis scales to avoid cutting the data points.
