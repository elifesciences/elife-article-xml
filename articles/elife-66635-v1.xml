Comparing young adult with older adult mice, new protein incorporation was reduced in all tissues. STRING clustering revealed changes in epigenetic modulators across all tissues, a decline in chondroprotective growth factors such as FGF2 and TGFβ in cartilage, and clusters indicating mitochondrial dysregulation and reduced collagen synthesis in bone.

Ageing, the natural decline of cellular and physiological processes during life, is particularly apparent in collagen-rich tissues such as the articular cartilage, bone, and skin, leading to osteoarthritis (OA), osteoporosis, and impaired cutaneous wound healing in the elderly adults. Each of these tissues is characterised by an abundance of extracellular matrix (ECM), a dynamic network composed of collagens, proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and ECM-associated proteins, defined collectively as the matrisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Naba et al., 2016</xref>). The matrisome can constitute the majority of the tissue by volume, up to 95% in the case of articular cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sophia Fox et al., 2009</xref>), and is critically important in controlling the phenotype of the cells embedded within it. The cells responsible for matrix production and homeostasis include those that are post-mitotic after skeletal maturity, such as chondrocytes in articular cartilage and the osteocytes in bone, or those that may be renewable through repopulation (osteoclasts derived from blood mononuclear cells) or through proliferation, for example fibroblasts in skin and osteoblasts in bone (although this is often blunted with age). The ability to examine synthetic activity in these tissues in situ under normal physiological conditions, without disrupting the tissue, is highly valuable.</p><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed that account for changes to the ECM with age, including reduced synthesis, altered turnover (reduced and increased), and post-translational modifications. Of the latter, described processes include accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), deamidation and racemisation of amino acid residues, crosslinking of matrix macromolecules, and accumulation of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hsueh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verzijl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ewald, 2019</xref>). These impact on the biophysical properties and regenerative capacity of the tissue and predispose to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). In bone, the accumulation of AGEs, combined with collagen loss and cellular senescence, are regarded as critical drivers of osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanguineti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shuster, 2005</xref>). Loss of type II collagen turnover in mature cartilage is thought to predispose to poor regenerative capacity and OA. Similarly, reduced turnover of the matricellular proteins in dentin, tendon, and skin likely result in impaired regenerative responses and elsewhere may contribute to tissue fibrosis and cancer risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neill et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to structural and biomechanical impacts of matrisomal changes, signals from ECM protein fragments and growth factors associated with the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hynes, 2009</xref>) can bind directly to cell-surface receptors to modulate cell proliferation and survival, cell morphology, and tissue metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang and Greenspan, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Quantitative proteomic studies provide valuable information regarding molecular composition and abundance of tissue protein, but this only represents a snapshot of the physiological state at a given time and does not accurately account for dynamic protein turnover within tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Claydon et al., 2012</xref>). A number of methodologies have been applied to investigate dynamic protein changes over time. Radiolabelling methods and methods that measure post-translational modifications (racemisation, AGE, and D-aspartate accumulation), in human skin, cartilage, dentin, and tendon, have identified major fibrillar collagens as very stable proteins with reduced incorporation after skeletal maturity and half-lives as long as 117 years in cartilage (type II collagen) and 15 years in skin (type I collagen) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heinemeier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Libby et al., 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verzijl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maroudas et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Verzijl et al., 2001</xref>). A limitation of these methods is that time is not the only factor influencing these changes. For example, high temperatures, common at injury sites, can accelerate racemisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dyer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maroudas et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stabler et al., 2009</xref>). Metabolic labelling is seen as a more direct method to estimate protein lifespans. Incorporation of <sup>14</sup>C using the bomb-pulse method takes advantage of an increase in atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C that resulted from nuclear testing in the 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Libby et al., 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lynnerup et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nielsen et al., 2016</xref>). This method is suitable for estimating turnover of bulk tissue proteins or select protein types but is incompatible with more agnostic approaches using mass spectrometry. Another method using deuterated water (<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O) has been used to estimate protein synthesis and turnover rates in several animal models and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). With this approach, animals incorporate deuterium into C-H bonds, thus labelling newly synthesised proteins and other biomolecules. The increase in peptide mass over time indicates neosynthesis. A limitation of this method is that because <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O is incorporated into multiple biomolecules, labelled amino acids can derive directly from the diet during the labelling period or from recycled, previously labelled, biomolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alevra et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Stable isotope labelling (Lys (6)-SILAC-Mouse Diet, SILANTES GmbH) incorporated into the diet overcomes many of the aforementioned problems and has been used to determine incorporation rates of proteins from blood cells, organelles, and organs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kruger et al., 2008</xref>). In this diet, the six naturally abundant <sup>12</sup>C molecules in Lysine have been replaced with <sup>13</sup>C, conferring a molecular mass shift of 6 Daltons for each lysine in a proteolytically cleaved peptide. This method was originally used to perform quantitative comparisons of the proteome of fully labelled (F2 generation) mice to determine protein dynamics in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kruger et al., 2008</xref>). Quantification of the ‘heavy’ and ‘light’ protein fractions by mass spectrometry over time provides a measure of the incorporation rates of individual proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ebner and Selbach, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schwanhausser et al., 2009</xref>). In the study, we pulse label mice with SILAC diet for 3 weeks at three different post-natal periods: weeks 4–7 (maximum skeletal growth), weeks 12–15 (young adult), and weeks 42–45 (older adult), then apply mass spectrometry to quantify new protein incorporation into three collagen-rich tissues (articular cartilage, bone, and skin) and plasma, which was used as a high-turnover reference tissue, allowing us to estimate and compare new protein incorporation rates at proteome-wide scale across the healthy life course.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Proteome turnover in cartilage, skin, bone, and plasma during skeletal growth</title><p>To measure new protein synthesis and incorporation during the period of maximal skeletal growth, we pulse labelled two groups of mice (groups A and B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) by feeding them heavy SILAC diet for 3 weeks from 4 weeks of age. Group A was culled for tissue collection immediately after the feeding period, whilst group B was fed the light SILAC diet for another 3 weeks (to week 10). Plasma, knee articular cartilage, ventral skin, and tibial bone were collected for analysis at week 7 (group A) or week 10 (group B). Tissues were extracted and analyzed by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design.</title><p>Four groups of four C57BL/6 J male mice were fed with heavy SILAC diet (<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-Lys) or light SILAC diet (<sup>12</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-Lys) for 3 weeks at different ages.

Group A was culled for tissue collection, and group B was switched to light diet from weeks 7 to 10, then culled for tissue collection.

In essence, reflecting proteins that are newly incorporated into the tissue and their stability over time. Each tissue was considered separately. We used the plasma profile to define a fast turnover protein group as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Price et al., 2010</xref>). As the animals are growing during this period, the amount of label remaining after the 3 week washout period reflects both protein turnover and label dilution due to tissue expansion. Proteins that showed over 80% incorporation during the heavy diet period and retained less than 20% after the light diet period were considered fast turnover proteins (hashed blue area, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), while proteins that showed little change in the percentage of isotope incorporation between the end of the heavy diet (week 7) and the end of the light diet (week 10) were regarded as ‘stable proteins’ (hashed pink area, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Over 83% (142/171) of plasma proteins fell within the fast turnover group, while only 3.5% (6/171) proteins were within the stable group. Cartilage showed the lowest proportion of fast turnover proteins (18%, 115/634) when compared with bone (48%, 338/712) and skin (39%, 136/352), and was also the tissue that contained the most proteins with less than 40% isotope incorporation during the heavy diet period (bottom left-hand corner of graphs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The patterns of heavy isotope incorporation were similar across the four biological replicates for each tissue and time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Of these, matrisome proteins dominated the most stable proteins (ratios ≥ 0.8) particularly in cartilage and skin (12/18 proteins in skin, 14/25 proteins in cartilage, 2/14 proteins in bone, and 0/6 in plasma). The three most stable collagens (red dots), proteoglycans (yellow dots), and glycoproteins (blue dots) are highlighted for each tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). During this period of skeletal growth, collagens exhibited variable stability across all tissues, and this included the fibrillar collagens (types I, II, III, V, and XI), which are generally regarded as being the most stable. Proteoglycan synthesis was more dynamic, showing lower fold change levels of the B/A ratio. Glycoproteins spanned a wide turnover range in all tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Age-dependent remodelling of the tissue proteome</title><p>To investigate how new protein synthesis and incorporation changes during ageing, we pulse labelled another two groups of four male mice: groups C and D. Group C represented skeletally mature (young adult) mice fed heavy diet between 12 and 15 weeks of age. Group D mice were fed heavy diet between 42 and 45 weeks of age (older adult). For each animal, plasma, knee articular cartilage, ventral skin, and tibial bone were processed immediately after the 3 week heavy diet as in A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Histograms showing the frequency of incorporation of the heavy isotope into proteins in groups A, C, and D are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Protein synthesis generally decreased in all four tissues with age, as shown by a shift to the left of the histograms. As expected, this shift was more apparent for bone and cartilage between skeletally immature (group A) and young adult animals (group C) than between young (group C) and older adult mice (group D), commensurate with cessation of skeletal maturation. Although all tissues showed an age-related decline in new protein incorporation, protein synthesis was significantly different between the four tissues and at each age group, Kruskal–Wallis test, p&lt;0.0001 for all comparisons.

Here, we describe tissue proteome incorporation rates for proteins in skin, cartilage, bone, and plasma at three post-natal stages of life: during maximum skeletal growth, and at young and older adulthood. Our study shows that although new protein incorporation changes significantly in all tissues after skeletal maturity, it displays distinct temporal and molecular tissue signatures.</p><p>Tissue turnover can be divided into tissue modelling, which occurs during growth and development, and tissue remodelling, which is required to repair or adapt the tissue to maintain homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frantz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karsdal et al., 2016</xref>). Collagen-rich tissues are believed to have a limited reparative capacity, mainly due to the inability to incorporate new fibrillar collagens into mature matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verzijl et al., 2000</xref>). Our results quantified incorporation of multiple collagens in each of the connective tissues, with almost all of them showing decreases in incorporation with age. This was most marked for bone and cartilage. These tissues are largely post-mitotic after skeletal maturity, and although they retain global synthetic activity in adult life, this is blunted in a sizeable fraction of proteins (29% bone, 51% cartilage) by 45 weeks of age compared with skin (8%), in which the tissue is known to renew throughout adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Visscher et al., 2015</xref>). Bone was the only tissue that showed a strong collagen cluster (enriched in 12 collagens) when comparing young with older adult tissue, although, as expected, incorporation of new type II collagen fell to &lt;2% in cartilage in the older group. In skin, significant decreases were also observed in fibrillar collagens, but the transition between skeletally immature and mature tissues was less marked, with substantial on-going incorporation of fibrillar collagens through young and older adulthood.</p><p>Previous age-related research has identified several cellular pathways that are consistently found to be dysregulated. Cell energy and metabolism, including mitochondrial dysfunction, is one of the top processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campisi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Javadov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sprenger and Langer, 2019</xref>). Proteins such as clusterin, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), and apolipoprotein E have previously been found to be dysregulated in ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sabaretnam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sentman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Trougakos and Gonos, 2006</xref>). Although we were underpowered to gain significant insights from IPA and DAVID pathway analysis packages, by STRING analysis bone displayed a very strong metabolic, mitochondrial signature, and we found clusterin dysregulation in plasma, cartilage, and bone of older adult mice, and down-regulation of SOD1 in cartilage. Modulators of protein synthesis such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D, which affects stability and metabolism of mRNAs, were also down-regulated in cartilage and have previously been linked to ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pont et al., 2012</xref>). Our data showed only two proteins where reduced incorporation was seen in all three collagenous tissues. These included the ribosomal protein, RPL12 and Histone H1.0. Moreover, strong down-regulated clusters, rich in ribosomal proteins, were present in bone, cartilage, and skin, indicating a decline in incorporation rates of ribosomal structural proteins across all tissues as the animal ages. This finding agrees with several studies in which progressive decreases in the expression of ribosomal proteins or rRNA has been observed with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D’Aquila et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jung et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In cartilage, 15 of the down-regulated proteins have been associated with OA. Several of these have known protective functions in cartilage tissue homeostasis, such as Prg4 (also known as lubricin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flannery et al., 2009</xref>), Timp3, an inhibitor of disease-associated metalloproteinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakamura et al., 2020</xref>), and LDL receptor-related protein 1 (Lrp1), an important chondrocyte scavenger receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamamoto et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, a number of pro-repair and chondrogenic growth factors, all known to be sequestered in the pericellular matrix, were reduced in older adult cartilage such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), connective tissue growth factor, transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ1), and Frzb, a Wnt antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Der Kraan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evangelou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhong et al., 2017</xref>). These results point towards loss of repair pathways in the pathogenesis of age-related OA, a conclusion supported by recent genome-wide association studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tachmazidou et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The balance between bone formation and resorption is compromised with increasing age, resulting in progressive net bone loss and osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Javaheri and Pitsillides, 2019</xref>). Three proteins whose incorporation rates decreased with age are regarded as biomarkers of osteoporosis. One of these was biglycan, a bone modifying protein in murine osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cui et al., 2019</xref>) and collagen 1a2, the most abundant protein in bone matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nagy et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, we found decreased incorporation in two proteins, 14-3-3 protein epsilon and Cd44. SNPs in these two protein coding genes, <italic>YWHAE</italic> and <italic>CD44</italic>, are associated with low bone mineral density in two recent GWAS studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morris et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Medina-Gomez et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In skin, only 8% of proteins had altered incorporation rates in the older group, considerably lower than in cartilage and bone (29% and 51%, respectively). Six clusters comprising a maximum of four proteins in each were discerned. Wound healing is known to be impaired in the elderly adults, but this phenotype is probably less apparent in ‘middle aged’ individuals which would better represent our older adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gardiner, 2011</xref>). One down-regulated protein in the skin, solute carrier family 3 (SLC3A2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>), has been implicated in wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Falanga, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grande-Garcia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boulter et al., 2013</xref>), and ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tissot et al., 2018</xref>). Although there were several proteins with statistically significant differences in incorporation rates in older skin, the clusters did not predict an overall negative effect on wound healing although this tissue signature might not be expected in non-wounded tissues.</p><p>We recognise a number of limitations in this study. For cartilage and bone, an insoluble pellet remained after sample processing despite multiple refinements to the protocol for each tissue. It is likely that the insoluble fraction is mainly composed of the oldest, highly cross-linked portion of fibrillar collagens that increases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verzijl et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, in the older group, the proportion of newly synthesised collagens might be overestimated. It is also the case that the insoluble pellet may have been influenced by a change in the ratio of cortical to trabecular bone with age. Another limitation was that we only studied mice until 45 weeks of age, approximately half the lifetime of a laboratory mouse. We did not include older mice because they frequently develop spontaneous OA, which would have been a co-founding variable in cartilage, preventing us from discerning effects due to age and those due to disease. Likewise, in bone, insidious loss of tissue density occurs with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jilka, 2013</xref>). In this study, we only examined male mice to keep our initial analysis simple. There is a clear gender difference in the risk of OA and osteoporosis in both humans and mice, so a male/female comparison would be a valuable future proposal to uncover important sex-dependent biological differences that contribute to disease risk. Finally, we limited this analysis to only three contrasting connective tissues, each of which is distinct in terms of cell type and number. As the labelled mouse carcasses are currently frozen, the authors welcome collaborative approaches to extend this analysis to other tissues in line with the three R principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Percie du Sert et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Compared with protein abundance, which only captures a snapshot of a protein at a particular time, this methodology provides insights into dynamic protein synthesis in different tissues and at different ages. Whilst we do not measure the stability of individual proteins, we reveal distinct age-dependent synthetic activities in dividing and post-mitotic connective tissues and identify shared and tissue-specific protein clusters that could represent novel insights into age-dependent disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="middle">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="middle">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="middle">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="middle">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">C57BL/6 J (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, male)</td><td align="left" valign="middle">C57BL/6 J</td><td align="left" valign="middle">4 weeks old mice were from in house breeding colony and 11 and 41 weeks old from Charles rivers laboratories, Oxford, England</td><td align="left" valign="middle">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:MGI:5655520">MGI:5655520</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="middle">Wild type</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="middle"><sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-Lysine-SILAC (97 % atom <sup>13</sup>C)</td><td align="left" valign="middle">SILANTES GmbH, Munich, Germany</td><td align="left" valign="middle">13C-aa-Lys(6)-SILAC-Mouse diet-252923926</td><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="middle"><sup>12</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-Lysine-SILAC diets</td><td align="left" valign="middle">SILANTES GmbH, Munich, Germany</td><td align="left" valign="middle">12C-aa-Lys(0)-SILAC-Mouse diet-230004600</td><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="middle">GraphPad Prism 7</td><td align="left" valign="middle">GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA, USA</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Prism: RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_015807">SCR_015807</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="middle">GraphPad Prism 7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="middle">MaxQuant</td><td align="left" valign="middle">MaxQuant</td><td align="left" valign="middle">MaxQuant: RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_014485">SCR_014485</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="middle">MaxQuant v1.5.7.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Perseus</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Perseus</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Perseus: SCR_015753</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Perseus v1.6.1.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Clinical Knowledge Graph’s analytics core</td><td align="left" valign="middle">CKG</td><td align="left" valign="middle"/><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="middle">STRING</td><td align="left" valign="middle">STRING</td><td align="left" valign="middle">STRING: SCR_005223</td><td align="left" valign="middle">STRING v11</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="middle">IPA</td><td align="left" valign="middle">QIAGEN Inc</td><td align="left" valign="middle">QIAGEN IPA: SCR_008653</td><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="middle">The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID ) v6.8</td><td align="left" valign="middle">DAVID</td><td align="left" valign="middle"/><td align="left" valign="middle">DAVID v6.8</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Samples and reagents</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>All animal experiments were carried out with Institutional Ethical Approval Under Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (Licence Number 30-3129)</title><p>Wild-type C57BL/6 J mice, ages 4, 11, and 41 weeks, were obtained originally from Charles River, Oxford, England.

Therefore, four groups of four male mice were fed with a stable isotope diet for a period of 3 weeks at different ages that spanned from weaning to late adulthood. The labelling scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) was as follows: Two groups of mice (A and B) were fed with the heavy diet from weeks 4 to 7. Then, one of these groups was culled for tissue collection and the other was changed to the light isotope diet (<sup>12</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-Lys) from weeks 7 to 10, then culled for tissue collection. This was used to calculate proteome turnover rates during skeletal growth. The third group (C) was fed with the heavy isotope diet from weeks 12 to 15 (young adult), and the fourth group (D) was fed with the heavy isotope diet from weeks 42 to 45 (late adult). All mice were acclimatised to the SILAC diet formulation by feeding them with the light isotope diet for 1 week before introducing the heavy diet. All mice gained weight in accordance with reference laboratory data for C57BL/6 mice (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>Tissue harvest</title><p>At the end of each labelling period, corresponding to ages 7, 10, 15, and 45 weeks, animals were culled injecting a terminal dose (30 mg/animal) of the anaesthetic Pentoject. Blood, knee articular cartilage, tibial bone, and ventral skin were collected from each animal (n = 4 mice per time point) as follows: blood was collected by cardiac puncture and mixed with 0.5 M anticoagulant EDTA to obtain a final concentration of 5 mM EDTA. The buffered blood was centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm at 4°C. The resulting supernatant (plasma) was transferred to a 0.5 ml tube to be used for analysis. Knee articular cartilage was harvested using a micro-dissection technique previously developed described by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gardiner, 2011</xref>). Articular cartilage from the femoral and tibial surfaces of both knees of one mouse were micro-dissected under the stereo microscope and collected in 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tubes containing 50 μl PBS. Tibial bone samples were sectioned between the crest of the tibia and the insertion of the fibula. The bone marrow was flushed three times with PBS to remove cells using a 25 G needle. The final wash was checked for lack of cells using a stereo microscope. Approximately 0.8 cm<sup>2</sup> of skin was cut from the lower flank of the ventral surface. Hair was removed using hair removal cream (Veet sensitive skin). Adipose tissue and blood vessels were removed from the subcutaneous region under the stereo microscope, and a portion of clean skin was collected using a 6 mm biopsy punch. All tissues were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS [pH 7.4]) and stored frozen at −80°C until further processing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mass spectrometry sample preparation</title><p>Bone and cartilage samples were placed in 180 µl of 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and heated at 65°C for 15 min.

Pairwise comparisons were therefore by Student’s t-tests. For group wise comparisons, where the data were not normally distributed, non-parametric tests were used. For those proteins with a heavy to light ratio (H/L), the percentage of label incorporation was estimated as follows: (H/L/((H/L) + 1)) * 100. To discern protein turnover profiles in tissues, we plotted the percentage of label present in group A versus group B. In those cases where H/L ratios were not reported, we used iBAQ light (iBAQ L) and heavy (iBAQ H) data to impute H/L ratios. Missing iBAQ light in &gt;2 samples in group A was assumed to be a consequence of fully labelled protein while missing iBAQ heavy in &gt;2 samples in group B as a result of complete turnover. H/L ratios from samples with missing iBAQ L values were imputed with the maximum H/L value +0.1 in that column and those with missing iBAQ H values with the minimum H/L value – 0.01 (only proteins with lysine containing peptides were imputed). To define what proteins were differentially incorporated when comparing groups D and C (unpaired t-test), we selected proteins with at least two valid values for H/L, and imputed missing values using the K-nearest neighbour algorithm. Furthermore, to account for full labelling or absence of new protein incorporation, we identified proteins where H/L ratios were reported in one group, but not in any of the four replicates in the other group. In those cases, we used heavy or light iBAQ values present in at least two replicates and imputed H/L ratio using uniform random values near the maximum (maximum, maximum+ std) or the minimum (0, minimum) of the dataset, respectively.</p><p>The recovered proteins that showed changes in incorporation between groups were added to the STRING networks, DAVID, and IPA analyses.</p><p>The STRING networks were built using high confidence interaction score = 0.7, and networks clustered to MCL inflation parameter = 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Szklarczyk et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>none</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>None</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Visualization, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Resources, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animals' care and experimentation was performed in strict accordance with the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and institutional guidelines of the University of Oxford.

Using a Stable Isotope Labeling (SILAC) method to examine new protein Lys6 incorporation rates in three high collage content tissues, the authors show that protein-change is low in older mice in these tissues, but the depth of the data generated provide a detailed examination of the impact of age at a level we have not previously had. This paper would be of interest to a broad range of scientists studying connective tissues in the context of development and ageing.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Age-dependent changes in protein incorporation into collagen-rich tissues of mice by in vivo pulsed SILAC labelling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. A major weakness is the tissue/cell turnover and protein turnover aspect. The authors compared plasma with cartilage, bone and skin which contain a diverse set of distinct cell populations. In addition, labelled proteins from plasma are derived from the liver, which represents a proliferating tissue. Similarly, skin is also a proliferating tissue, while cartilage and bone tissue are most likely post-mitotic. It is not surprising that proliferating tissues have higher Lys6 incorporation compared to non-dividing cells. Unfortunately, the authors did not address this issue, and the comparison unfortunately remains unclear.</p><p>2. A more focused analysis of a particular cell type and its Lys6 incorporation rate at different time points or disease states is a viable alternative approach, which would also be highly informative, if not more so for selected questions. In light of the comment above, a more complete discussion of the limitations of this work is needed. It would be worth it to add a justification of why the methods chosen where chosen over other strategies to address the main thesis of the paper.</p><p>3. Overall, the statistical power is difficult to estimate and the authors should carefully consider the statistical analysis of a non-normal distributed data set. The comparison of young animals with the older stages simply represents growing and dividing tissues, which is naturally more labelled than &quot;mature&quot; tissue.</p><p>4. Throughout this paper, it is stated that trabecular bone was examined. The methods for collecting this bone are spartan. It appears that the part of the tibia collected is very trabecular bone poor and is mostly cortical bone. The turnover rates of these two bone compartments are very different. Please clarify what kind of bone you had and the implications of looking at only trabecular/ only cortical/ a mix for the interpretations of these results. Considering the tissue of interest appears to be trabecular bone, how did you ensure there was no contaminating marrow. Trabeculae are very small and hard to &quot;clean&quot;.</p><p>5. This study is only male mice. Bone turnover is higher in females. In humans, females are more likely to get Osteoarthritis than males and wound healing is slower in females than males. The implications of sex on the interpretation of the results and the limitations of this study design need to be included in the discussion.</p><p>6. The authors claim that incorporation is lower in aged animals (week 45) compared to young animals (week 15). For example, Table S2 shows an incorporation rate of 2.97 +/- 2.13 at week 45 and 3.38+/-0.98 at week 15 for the cartilage tissue and protein collagen 1a1. The ANOVA calculation showed a significant change for this candidate. Do the authors believe that a fold-change of w45/w15 = 1:1.14 is biologically relevant? The same is true for most of the proteins listed in the table. Is it possible to calculate accurate incorporation rates in % of SILAC ratios of H/L = 0.01? This corresponds to an H/L ratio of 1:100 in the MS spectra. It would be helpful to show a real MS spectrum of such incorporation rates at least in the SI data. This would also show if the &quot;heavy&quot; peak is represented by a true isotopic pattern and whether this peak was selected for fragmentation. Alternatively, it might be that the &quot;low&quot; peak represents only a background signal. The calculation of the coefficient of variation could also help to document the variability of the data set. A more complete comparison of this work to similar previous studies in the field would provide both context for these results and validation of the expected ranges of turnover.</p><p>7. The median lifespan of C57BL/6J male mice is ~128 weeks. The growth plate of mice does not fuse and the femur will increase in length past 26 weeks of age and periosteal expansion is still happening at 12 months (PMID: 13678781). A sound rational for using mice under one year of age is provided. But please be careful when describing these mice. The oldest group are at best mature adult male mice and are certainly not &quot;late adulthood&quot; (line 229-230). The middle group are far from finished growing.</p><p>8. Could it be that older animals move less and eat less? This would also explain a slightly reduced Lys6 incorporation. Did the authors observe any possible weight gain or loss during feeding? Did the animals always take-up the same amount of Lys6 during the experiment?</p><p>9. There is a large difference between wound healing and normal skin maintenance/turnover. This this distinction is often blurred when discussing the results for skin and the implications of the results for skin.</p><p>10. Line 329-332. Mice very much lose trabecular bone without losing estrogen (PMID: 17488199) and naturally occurs without immobilization. Please reframe this section reflecting the reality of you model.</p><p>11. It might be better to focus the analysis on a specific tissue/cell type that is either proliferating or post-mitotic. Why did the authors not calculate absolute turnover rates? This would be a better comparison and could help to better assess the statistical power of their method.</p><p>12. Introduction – for completeness, please briefly also describe the use of deuterium labelling to measure proteome dynamics in tissues:</p><p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22915825/, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32393437/ and https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32403418/</p><p>13. It is strongly suggested that the authors establishing if there were any alterations in relative protein abundance between age groups assessed. This will allow identification of any proteins that show both dysregulated turnover and abundance with ageing and are therefore most likely involved in age-related diseases.</p><p>14. Have the authors using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (or similar software) to identify upstream regulators predicted to result in the differential protein synthesis observed with ageing? This could provide potential targets for age-related diseases that could be investigated further in future studies. The detailed bioinfomatic STRING analysis is certainly helpful but many points raised in the discussion are unfortunately very speculative and should be verified by experimental work. All reviewers were in agreement that a more comprehensive bioinformatics data analysis of some type is mandatory.</p><p>15. Is it possible to calculate and report individual protein half-lives/fractional synthesis rates from the data? This would enable more direct comparison of half-lives measured in previous studies.</p><p>16. Materials and methods – different extraction protocols were used for skin, compared to cartilage and bone samples. Please provide a rationale for this. Is this likely to have had an impact of the proteins identified? If so, this needs to be more completely mentioned in the discussion as a limitation of this work.</p><p>17. Results, Ln 160, Figures 3 and 4. It is apparent that incorporation rates decline with ageing across tissues, with most obvious differences between immature and mature animals and much smaller changes between mature and old animals. Are you able to present statistical analysis of these results on the graphs to identify significant differences with ageing?</p><p>18. Although the authors achieved a dilution of the label by a label switch to Ly0, this aspect was unfortunately only very little evaluate. The reviewers felt that this point should be elaborated on.</p><p>19. Protein turnover is always regulated by synthesis and degradation. The labelling of living animals with stable isotopes is a useful technique, but one should be very careful which tissues one compares and whether the incorporation rates are regulated by instrinsic protein stability or by cell division.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Age-dependent changes in protein incorporation into collagen-rich tissues of mice by in vivo pulsed SILAC labelling&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that this manuscript is substantially clearer and very much improved after this extensive revision. Some matters however remain, and it was agreed after much discussion among the reviewers that an additional revision would be requested</p><p>1. The figure provided for A6 would be of benefit as a supplemental figure. However, in its current form it is not usable as the font size is impossible to read.</p><p>2. The largest concern from the reviewers was that the study remains descriptive and the underlying experiments comparing Lys-6 incorporation rates between different tissues or developmental stages remain questionable. While the authors have addressed this to some degree in the discussion (ln 457), further comment on the specific effect of cell division on Lys-6 incorporation would more clearly highlight the limitations of the study. The reviewers would have liked to see an integration of the absolute half-lives as a function of proliferation. Thus, the comparison always remains dependent on cell division, which unfortunately prevents a clear statement of the absolute protein half-life or protein turnover. Therefore, the wording &quot;turnover&quot; should not be used in the manuscript at all, but rather Lys6 incorporation rates (i.e. Figure 2A) in proliferating or postmitotic cells. Lys6 incorporation rates do not necessarily reflect the turnover of a protein and hence this term, while used sparingly, should be avoided overall.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66635.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Yes, it is perfectly true that changes that we observe may well be related to the mitotic status of the cells perhaps commensurate with the renewable nature of each tissue. One might imagine that tissues that continue to turn over during life, such as the skin, will be synthetically more active and this will be reflected in the results. In fact, the total number of proteins incorporating Lys6 (i.e. number of proteins with a measured H/L ratio) across the three mature connective tissues are broadly the same (skin 450, bone 550 and cartilage 599 proteins, also Figure 3) and their range of label incorporation also similar (20-90% in plasma, 10-90% in skin, 2-90% in bone and 2-80% in cartilage), so our results do not appear to be biased by large differences in the global synthetic rates across tissues. Rather, it appears that the difference is in select groups of proteins only.</p><p>It is, of course, difficult to be definitive about how important this is when considering complex and simple tissues as the tissue analyses do not specifically indicate which cells are driving the observed phenotype. In the case of cartilage, we can be fairly confident that most (possibly all) cells are post-mitotic chondrocytes. In bone the cells will be a mixture of post mitotic (osteocytes), renewable (blood derived osteoclasts) and proliferating (osteoblasts) cells (although the latter are thought to fail with age). It is perhaps a surprise that post mitotic tissues like cartilage manage to maintain this level of synthesis at all. The post-mitotic tissues have striking effects in select protein groups suggesting that these cells do have a restricted synthetic lifespan. Our thesis is that this possibly explains age-related disease risk.</p><p>Action (A) 1. We have inserted a paragraph into the introduction (lines 62-67) and further commented on this in the discussion (lines 539-542). In the limitations section we also mention that we are comparing tissues that have a disparate number and type of cells (line 791). We have also substituted old Figure S2 with a new figure (Figure 3) that shows the incorporation levels between tissues and over time more clearly, and also shows the position of key matrisomal proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. A more focused analysis of a particular cell type and its Lys6 incorporation rate at different time points or disease states is a viable alternative approach, which would also be highly informative, if not more so for selected questions.

It would be worth it to add a justification of why the methods chosen where chosen over other strategies to address the main thesis of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that understanding which cell types are driving the ageing phenotype across different tissues would be interesting and valuable. However, this type of analysis is severely limited in collagen rich tissues (in particular) as the cell behaviour is greatly influenced by the native tissue environment i.e. extracellular matrix. For example when articular chondrocytes are isolated they rapidly de-differentiate, start to proliferate and are highly synthetic. Therefore, one of the significant advantages of using this approach is that cellular activities can be examined in situ. It might be possible to combine our proteomic analysis with spatial proteomics/transcriptomics or single nuclear RNA sequencing, but this is technically very challenging in murine connective tissues and has not yet been optimised by our group. With regards to disease states, these studies are ongoing for osteoarthritis in our group and will follow, but we feel detract from the main messages of the current paper.</p><p>We have incorporated a comment to stress the advantage of being able to analyse synthetic activity in complex tissues without disrupting the cells and matrix in the introduction (line 62 and lines 67-68).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Overall, the statistical power is difficult to estimate and the authors should carefully consider the statistical analysis of a non-normal distributed data set. The comparison of young animals with the older stages simply represents growing and dividing tissues, which is naturally more labelled than &quot;mature&quot; tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>Our ‘within group’ datasets where we examined the normality of each individual protein against the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and for variance against the Levene test demonstrated that &gt;80% of proteins were normally distributed. Therefore for protein:protein comparisons we applied Student t-tests for pairwise comparisons. We performed group wise comparisons between young and older adults using non-parametric tests.</p><p>We agree that the differences observed between skeletally immature and mature groups likely represents growing tissues. These data (presented in Figures 2-6) were intended to demonstrate that the in vivo SILAC methodology was fit for purpose i.e. to demonstrate a proof of concept before going on to look in more detail at the differences in skeletally mature tissues with age. In addition we also feel that these data have intrinsic interest. For instance we were able to define a number of matrisomal proteins that appear to switch off after skeletal maturity e.g. keratocan in all three tissues, as well as those that switch on in adult tissues and are not apparently synthesised during growth e.g. type XV collagen in bone and versican in articular cartilage.</p><p>We have added detail to the statistical methods section to clarify the statistical tests used (lines 941-948). We have added in the results that whilst most matrisomal proteins go down after skeletal maturity, some proteins are incorporated for the first time in adult tissues (lines 392-393).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Throughout this paper, it is stated that trabecular bone was examined. The methods for collecting this bone are spartan. It appears that the part of the tibia collected is very trabecular bone poor and is mostly cortical bone. The turnover rates of these two bone compartments are very different. Please clarify what kind of bone you had and the implications of looking at only trabecular/ only cortical/ a mix for the interpretations of these results. Considering the tissue of interest appears to be trabecular bone, how did you ensure there was no contaminating marrow. Trabeculae are very small and hard to &quot;clean&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this error. The bone that we collected was mainly cortical bone, not trabecular. We chose this region firstly because we wanted to avoid parts of the bone that were near cartilage/cartilaginous tissue such as subchondral bone and the growth plate, and also because it had clear tissue landmarks, which enabled consistent tissue collection in each animal irrespective of age. The diaphyseal area of tibia from which bone samples were taken has a high cortex-to-trabecular bone ratio. In humans, trabecular bone has a higher turnover rate than cortical bone and it is possible that changes in the ratio of cortical to trabecular bone with age could have influenced our results.</p><p>The bone marrow was washed through with PBS injected with a fine needle and syringe and washes were checked to ensure that they were acellular using a stereo microscope. It is correct that we cannot guarantee 100% marrow-free bone.</p><p>We have corrected reference to trabecular bone throughout the text and have added a sentence in the limitations section of the discussion to highlight the potential change of cortical to trabecular bone ratio with age that may have influenced the results (lines 731-732). Bone preparation has been clarified in the methods (lines 854-856).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. This study is only male mice. Bone turnover is higher in females.

Time and funding allowing we would have liked to do this in age-matched female mice also. We have added this as a limitation in discussion (737-788).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

We are not in a position to claim biological, nor indeed, clinical relevance from individual protein results, but think that percentages of new protein incorporation are valuable when interpreted as a trend of incorporation rates across protein groups.

We didn’t observe any obvious differences in intake between young and older adults although this wasn’t measured formally.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Weight gain for each of the experimental mice over the period of SILAC heavy diet (3-10 weeks, 11-15 weeks or 42-45 weeks).</title><p>These weight curves are consistent with reference growth curves in C57BL/6 mice.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66635-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We have added a comment about gaining expected weight in the methods section (lines 842-843).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

Why did the authors not calculate absolute turnover rates? This would be a better comparison and could help to better assess the statistical power of their method.</p></disp-quote><p>One of the primary purposes for doing this project was to ask whether change in synthetic rates alter between different collagen rich tissues and whether this could account for very poor repair responses in select tissues that predispose to age-related disease (e.g. cartilage and osteoarthritis). This question is not the same as asking about individual turnover rates of proteins within tissues (reflecting the balance between synthesis and degradation), which is what the field has largely focused on using other methodologies. In order to address protein turnover rates we would have needed to do a second experimental group after a 3 week washout (similar to comparison of group A and B in Figure 2). We hope we have stressed this now in the substantially revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Introduction – for completeness, please briefly also describe the use of deuterium labelling to measure proteome dynamics in tissues:</p></disp-quote><p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22915825/, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32393437/ and https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32403418/</p><p>This has now been added to introduction (lines 202-207).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. It is strongly suggested that the authors establishing if there were any alterations in relative protein abundance between age groups assessed. This will allow identification of any proteins that show both dysregulated turnover and abundance with ageing and are therefore most likely involved in age-related diseases.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important consideration. We therefore re-examined raw data and used total iBAQ values to calculate an abundance score for each protein. Interestingly, very few proteins showed regulated abundance levels when considering total protein levels. Articular cartilage was the only tissue where a few proteins were regulated significantly after multiple correction (five out of six of these were also regulated in the labelled analysis). These results most likely reflect the enhanced sensitivity that the SILAC labelling method affords, although clearly this could also be related to other factors that contribute to protein turnover.</p><p>We have added a new supplementary figure showing raw data correlation and iBAQ volcano plots and have mentioned these briefly in the results (lines 429-433).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Have the authors using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (or similar software) to identify upstream regulators predicted to result in the differential protein synthesis observed with ageing? This could provide potential targets for age-related diseases that could be investigated further in future studies. The detailed bioinfomatic STRING analysis is certainly helpful but many points raised in the discussion are unfortunately very speculative and should be verified by experimental work. All reviewers were in agreement that a more comprehensive bioinformatics data analysis of some type is mandatory.</p></disp-quote><p>We did consider this type of pathway analysis but felt that we would likely be underpowered to draw robust conclusions (these analyses being best validated for transcriptomic datasets that are usually substantially bigger). However, in response to reviewers’ suggestion we have performed pathway enrichment using various proprietary software, including IPA and DAVID. Cluster enrichment using DAVID showed similar results to STRING. Using IPA, several pathways were identified although none reaching statistical significance after correction.</p><p>We have included the IPA pathway enrichment analysis as supplementary information (Figure 7—figure supplementary 3). The results are mentioned in results (lines 472-476) and discussion (559-560).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. Is it possible to calculate and report individual protein half-lives/fractional synthesis rates from the data? This would enable more direct comparison of half-lives measured in previous studies.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we are unable to calculate individual protein half-lives from single time points. As mentioned above, our focus was more on the synthetic activity of the tissue rather than the turnover of individual proteins, although we accept that having this information would have helped to validate results from similar studies using different methodologies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. Materials and methods – different extraction protocols were used for skin, compared to cartilage and bone samples. Please provide a rationale for this. Is this likely to have had an impact of the proteins identified? If so, this needs to be more completely mentioned in the discussion as a limitation of this work.</p></disp-quote><p>Different connective tissues often require different protocols to solubilise the tissue due to variable degrees of collagen cross-linking, mineralisation etc. For each tissue we established protocols to solubilise the tissue prior to doing the labelling study. This is why they have different protocols. Articular cartilage solubilisation was, as expected, most challenging, presumed to be due to accumulation of long-lived cross-linked fibrillar collagens. It is likely that this will underestimate the calculated % collagen that is labelled but it is unlikely to account for the % labels of other proteins as these are generally soluble under such conditions.</p><p>This limitation is discussed in the limitation section of the discussion (line 728).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. Results, Ln 160, Figures 3 and 4. It is apparent that incorporation rates decline with ageing across tissues, with most obvious differences between immature and mature animals and much smaller changes between mature and old animals. Are you able to present statistical analysis of these results on the graphs to identify significant differences with ageing?</p></disp-quote><p>The statistical significant differences are presented in new figure 4 and 5, with explanation to code in the figure legends. The information can also be found in Figure 4-source data and Figure 5-source data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18. Although the authors achieved a dilution of the label by a label switch to Ly0, this aspect was unfortunately only very little evaluate. The reviewers felt that this point should be elaborated on.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept this criticism. When designing these experiments we did the first part of this paper (groups A and B in skeletally immature animals) as a proof of concept that in vivo SILAC would provide a valid robust measure of protein synthesis in tissues in vivo. We agree that these results deserve more attention, so have (conscious of space restraints) added further discussion around these results.</p><p>Further granularity of these results is given in results, lines 339-344.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19. Protein turnover is always regulated by synthesis and degradation. The labelling of living animals with stable isotopes is a useful technique, but one should be very careful which tissues one compares and whether the incorporation rates are regulated by instrinsic protein stability or by cell division.</p></disp-quote><p>We take the point that incorporation rates will be in part regulated by intrinsic protein stability (which could change with age), although are not clear how cell division affects incorporation rates except in proteins specifically implicated in replicative activities. Our data clearly show that cartilage and bone continue to synthesise proteins across the healthy lifecourse albeit that the reduction in synthetic activity appears to be more age-sensitive and selective for long-lived proteins such as collagen type II.</p><p>We stress that we are only measuring incorporation, not stability of proteins in the final paragraph of the discussion (lines 795-796). [Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The figure provided for A6 would be of benefit as a supplemental figure. However, in its current form it is not usable as the font size is impossible to read.</p></disp-quote><p>We have created a new supplementary figure to Figure 4 which we have spread out over 4 pages to improve clarity, with reference to this in the text lines 287 and 572-3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The largest concern from the reviewers was that the study remains descriptive and the underlying experiments comparing Lys-6 incorporation rates between different tissues or developmental stages remain questionable. While the authors have addressed this to some degree in the discussion (ln 457), further comment on the specific effect of cell division on Lys-6 incorporation would more clearly highlight the limitations of the study. The reviewers would have liked to see an integration of the absolute half-lives as a function of proliferation. Thus, the comparison always remains dependent on cell division, which unfortunately prevents a clear statement of the absolute protein half-life or protein turnover. Therefore, the wording &quot;turnover&quot; should not be used in the manuscript at all, but rather Lys6 incorporation rates (i.e. Figure 2A) in proliferating or postmitotic cells. Lys6 incorporation rates do not necessarily reflect the turnover of a protein and hence this term, while used sparingly, should be avoided overall.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept that the term “turnover” is misleading when we have not measured the half-lives of individual proteins, and where we are comparing tissues that have different cell renewal rates which may also change with age. We have therefore gone through the manuscript carefully and have edited “turnover” to 13C6 Lys incorporation or equivalent in each of these places. These changes can be found on lines 34, 37, 165, 192, 485, 590, 594, 871, 1031, and are highlighted in green for ease of reading.</p><p>There are two cases where we feel the term “turnover” is still appropriate. Firstly in the introduction, where we refer to other published studies, and secondly in Figure 2 where we broadly categorise high and low turnover protein groups within an individual tissue. As mitotic activity is controlled for within each tissue at baseline and after the washout period, we believe this to be a reasonable interpretation of the data. We reinforce this distinction by adding “high turnover for a given tissue” to line 187.</p><p>Conversely, later in Figure 2 where we compare profiles between tissues we have removed the term “turnover” and substituted it for 13C6 Lys incorporation or equivalent. We hope this is acceptable.</p><p>We have further tried to clarify this by adding the following to line 315 of the discussion:</p><p>“The tissue turnover, which is likely to reflect both protein turnover and cellular renewal, can be divided into tissue modelling….”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
