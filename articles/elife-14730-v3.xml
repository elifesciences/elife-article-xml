cancer-causing alterations. Here we report a new mechanism by which premature cleavage and polyadenylation (pPA) of RNA can produce an oncogenic protein. We identify a pPA event at a cryptic intronic poly(A) signal in <italic>MAGI3</italic>, occurring in the absence of local exonic and intronic mutations. The altered mRNA isoform, called <italic>MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup></italic>, produces a truncated protein that acts in a dominant-negative manner to prevent full-length MAGI3 from interacting with the YAP oncoprotein, thereby relieving YAP inhibition and promoting malignant transformation of human mammary epithelial cells. We additionally find evidence for recurrent expression of <italic>MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup> </italic>in primary human breast tumors but not in tumor-adjacent normal tissues. Our results provide an example of how pPA contributes to cancer by generating a truncated mRNA isoform that encodes an oncogenic, gain-of-function protein.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14730.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14730.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14730.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer is a disease that is caused by the uncontrolled growth of cells. Normal cells can become cancerous if they acquire genetic mutations that allow them to divide more rapidly and ignore certain growth-halting signals from other cells in the body. Therefore, researchers are studying and cataloguing all the genetic changes found in cancers with the hope that this information will provide a clearer understanding of how they start to develop. Some types of mutations are well studied and easily identified by current technologies. However, some tumors contain few of these well-known mutations, which suggests that other types of mutations may be involved.</p><p>Ni and Kuperwasser set out to discover some of these other types of genetic mutations in cancer cells and to find out how they contribute to cells becoming cancerous. Initial experiments showed that human breast cancer cells contain variants of proteins not found in healthy cells. In particular, there was a protein called MAGI3 that was abnormally short, but not due to any well-known mutations. This, in turn, led to the discovery of a type of mutation – called premature polyadenylation – affecting the gene that encodes MAGI3. Next, Ni and Kuperwasser used biochemical techniques to show that the shortened MAGI3 protein inappropriately switches on another protein called YAP, which causes cells to grow more quickly.</p><p>Approximately 7.5% of breast cancer patients have the shortened version of MAGI3 due to premature polyadenylation, which indicates that this might be a more widespread mutation than previously thought. Future studies will have to determine exactly how premature polyadenylation occurs in cancer cells, and whether it affects other genes and is found in other types of cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14730.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14730.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cleavage and polyadenylation</kwd><kwd>cryptic poly(A) signal</kwd><kwd>MAGI3</kwd><kwd>Hippo pathway</kwd><kwd>YAP</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship, PF-14-046-01-DMC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ni</surname><given-names>Thomas K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001006</institution-id><institution>Breast Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuperwasser</surname><given-names>Charlotte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA170851</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuperwasser</surname><given-names>Charlotte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ArtBeCAUSE</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuperwasser</surname><given-names>Charlotte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Raymond &amp; Beverly Sackler Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuperwasser</surname><given-names>Charlotte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HD073035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuperwasser</surname><given-names>Charlotte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The study of a recurrent breast cancer MAGI3 truncation reveals the role of MAGI3 in regulating the Hippo effector YAP and highlights premature mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation as a mechanism underlying cancer development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genetic mutation, copy number gain/loss and chromosomal rearrangement are major mechanisms of genome alteration that underlie cancer pathogenesis. Frequent alteration of a gene by one or more of these mechanisms represents <italic>prima facie</italic> evidence for its role as a <italic>driver</italic> – a gene whose alterations are causative in cancer. As such, within the last decade, tremendous efforts have focused on the systematic, genome-wide surveys for these events in cancer. Interestingly, results from these analyses indicate that many tumors harbor alterations in only 1–2 known drivers, and ~15% of tumors lack alterations in even a single known driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Imielinski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garraway and Lander, 2013</xref>). Since solid tumors arise due to oncogenic cooperation between alterations in multiple drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000</xref>), a significant number of cancer-relevant genes are currently being missed by genomic analyses because so many genes are ostensibly altered at frequencies below the threshold for driver detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lawrence et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While it has been posited that unidentified drivers are difficult to identify because they are infrequently altered in cancer, it is equally plausible that additional mechanisms, beyond those regularly interrogated by current genomics platforms, may be responsible for generating driver alterations. In fact, as new mechanisms of alteration relevant to cancer are discovered, a number of 'infrequently altered' genes are reclassified as frequently altered. For example, the discovery of promoter mutations in the gene encoding telomerase has resulted in the reclassification of <italic>TERT</italic> as a frequently altered melanoma driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Horn et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, identifying cancer-specific alterations generated by previously unappreciated mechanisms represents a fundamentally important prerequisite for driver gene identification.</p><p>Ni et al. previously identified several dozen candidate cancer driver genes from a forward genetics screen for tumorigenesis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ni et al., 2013</xref>). Despite being functionally implicated in tumorigenesis, some of these candidate drivers were rarely mutated, amplified or deleted in human cancer. This incongruence led us to hypothesize that some of these candidate drivers may appear to be infrequently altered because their driver alterations may be caused by mechanisms that are not regularly interrogated. Here, we report that one of these candidate drivers, <italic>MAGI3</italic>, is indeed recurrently altered in breast cancer by premature cleavage and polyadenylation (pPA), a mechanism not widely appreciated for its involvement in cancer, and the resulting truncation of the <italic>MAGI3</italic> gene products functionally contributes to malignant transformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A premature polyadenylation event generates a truncated MAGI3 protein in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells</title><p>Many mechanisms are involved in conveying genetic information from genes to their mRNA and protein products. When gone awry, any of these mechanisms could alter cancer-relevant genes or their gene products. To investigate our hypothesis that some candidate drivers may be altered by underlying mechanisms not widely thought to be involved cancer, we considered strategies capable of broadly capturing many types of alteration events. While there is no standard strategy for this purpose, we reasoned that changes in genetic information, in most cases, must ultimately manifest at the protein level in order to contribute to cancer. Thus, our strategy focused on identifying novel, unannotated protein products of a limited number of genes that we suspected to be involved in cancer due to their previous identification by a forward genetics screen for tumorigenesis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ni et al., 2013</xref>). We focused specifically on products exhibiting detectable size differences from wild-type protein isoforms since these may be more likely to cause significant functional effects. Once such a product was identified, we would determine whether the altered protein is generated by a genetic mutation in the coding regions of the corresponding gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). If not due to coding region genetic mutation, we would attempt to identify the alteration mechanism, establish recurrence for the specific alteration event in cancer and investigate its functional importance in malignant transformation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14730.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Premature polyadenylation of <italic>MAGI3</italic> in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line causes the expression of a truncated MAGI3 protein.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Strategy for identifying protein products altered by previously overlooked mechanisms. Protein products of previously identified candidate driver genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ni et al., 2013</xref>) were screened by immunoblotting. Altered products were identified by electrophoretic mobility shift and confirmed by affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS). Exons of corresponding genes were sequenced. Genes not affected by coding-region DNA mutations were analyzed by 3′ RACE and sequencing to identify the nature of the altered product and the associated mechanism of alteration. Alteration events caused by mechanisms not widely appreciated in cancer were subsequently investigated for tumor-specific recurrence and functional relevance.

Immunoblotting across this cell line panel for one such candidate, MAGI3, revealed a number of extra bands in addition to the two full-length protein isoforms, α and β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We found that one of these bands, faintly appearing in most of the cell lines, was non-specific to MAGI3 since it could not be depleted by multiple shRNA targeting <italic>MAGI3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, a strong band of lower molecular weight was observed and could be specifically depleted by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Notably, this truncation was not expressed in the non-transformed MCF10A mammary cell line or <italic>TERT</italic>-immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>).</p><p>MAGI3 is a scaffolding protein with 2 WW and 6 PDZ domains, along with a catalytically inactive region of homology to the yeast guanylate kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Funke et al., 2005</xref>). Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the immunoprecipitated truncation mapped many peptides corresponding to the N-terminal half of MAGI3, but detected no peptides from the PDZ domains 3–6 that consist of the C-terminal half of MAGI3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To identify the genetic alteration responsible for this truncation, we sequenced all 22 exons and flanking intron sequences of <italic>MAGI3</italic> but found no mutations. This indicated that the truncation is not generated by DNA mutation of the <italic>MAGI3</italic> coding sequence or splice sites. We subsequently used 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) to isolate the transcript responsible for the truncated MAGI3 protein. This yielded a truncated <italic>MAGI3</italic> mRNA isoform corresponding to the size and mapped regions of the truncated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Sequencing the 3′ end of the mRNA revealed a cleavage and polyadenylation event involving a cryptic poly(A) signal (PAS) located in <italic>MAGI3</italic> intron 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consequently, the normal splicing event from exon 10 to exon 11 of <italic>MAGI3</italic> does not occur in the truncated mRNA (<italic>MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup></italic>), resulting in a stop codon several nucleotides into intron 10 and premature transcription termination following the cryptic intronic PAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>Local cis-acting DNA mutations in upstream U1 snRNA binding sites or downstream U-rich elements (URE) can affect splicing as well as cleavage and polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almada et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Proudfoot, 2011</xref>). Therefore, we sequenced the entire <italic>MAGI3</italic> intron 10 from MDA-MB-231 cells but were unable to find any mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also sequenced the entire region of the <italic>MAGI3<sup>pPA </sup></italic>3′ RACE product corresponding to intron 10 and the flanking exon 10 sequence, but again uncovered no mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, the known cis-acting sequences involved in proper splicing and repression of pPA, including the upstream/downstream splice donors, upstream U1 snRNA binding site and downstream URE, were intact in the sequencing analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). We thus conclude that this pPA event in intron 10 of <italic>MAGI3</italic> arises independently of local genetic mutations. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that a long-range, non-coding mutation in <italic>MAGI3</italic> might play a role in this phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Evidence for recurrent generation of <italic>MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup></italic> in human breast cancer</title><p>To determine whether the pPA product of <italic>MAGI3</italic> is physiologically relevant in the context of primary human breast tumors, we analyzed whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) data made available by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and a previously published RNA-Seq study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Varley et al., 2014</xref>). We focused on data collected from primary breast tumors and matched normal tissues in order to establish whether pPA of <italic>MAGI3</italic> is tumor-specific and recurrent. In total, these data included 160 primary breast tumors along with 160 matched, tumor-adjacent normal samples.</p><p>Since large differences in <italic>MAGI3</italic> sequencing depth between the two sets of samples might bias detection of pPA events, we first compared sequencing depth of <italic>MAGI3</italic> between tumor and normal RNA-Seq data and found it to be comparable, with only a 1.1-fold median increase in tumor samples. We subsequently used a three-tiered strategy to identify occurrences of <italic>MAGI3<sup>pPA </sup></italic>in the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To start, we calculated the genome coverage of total mappable reads for each sample and then asked if intronic reads are present in <italic>MAGI3</italic> intron 10. The vast majority of tumor-adjacent normal samples (157 out of 160) had either no intronic reads or a few, isolated reads; only three samples exhibited long stretches of overlapping intronic reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Therefore, our next goal was to rule out any samples with intronic read patterns due to intron retention. While reads unique to pPA events are expected to fall within the pPA-specific intronic interval, reads arising from intron retention should exhibit a more uniform distribution throughout the entire intron. Thus, for intron retention, the expected distribution of reads upstream and downstream of the cryptic PAS in <italic>MAGI3</italic> intron 10 can be compared to the empirical read distributions in the 29 samples with tracts of overlapping intronic reads (26 tumor, 3 normal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, seventeen of these samples (16 tumor, 1 normal) showed read distributions that were inconsistent with intron retention (p&lt;0.05, χ<sup>2</sup> test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Next, we evaluated the evidence for <italic>MAGI3<sup>pPA </sup></italic>expression in these seventeen samples by examining the continuity of read coverage across the pPA-specific region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In this analysis, we defined continuity as having overlapping read coverages across the pPA-specific interval with four or fewer small (&lt;75 nt) gaps. This eliminated five samples (4 tumor, 1 normal) that had either larger gaps or more than four small gaps in coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We considered the remaining twelve tumor samples, displaying continuous read signals across the pPA region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), to express the <italic>MAGI3<sup>pPA </sup></italic>isoform. The relative expression levels of the truncated isoform was between 2% to 6% of <italic>MAGI3α</italic> expression levels, but was generally higher than or comparable to <italic>MAGI3β</italic> expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The occurrence of the <italic>MAGI3</italic> pPA event in 7.5% (12 out of 160) of primary breast tumors and the absence of this event in matched tumor-adjacent normal tissues (0 out of 160) suggest that it is a tumor-specific and recurrent event that may play an important role in breast cancer pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup> and other breast cancer-associated <italic>MAGI3</italic> truncations contribute to malignant transformation</title><p>To determine whether pPA at the <italic>MAGI3</italic> locus in human breast cancers might affect features of malignancy, we evaluated the role of <italic>MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup></italic> on anchorage-independent growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). We took advantage different RNAi sequences targeting <italic>MAGI3</italic> that varied in their efficacy in knocking down levels of the full-length protein.

This caused a greater than four-fold increase in the relative expression levels of full-length MAGI3 versus MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup> (FL:truncated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Intriguingly, the loss of MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup> impaired the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells on soft agar compared to non-silencing Scr control, as shown by the reduced size and number of colonies (p=1.1 x 10<sup>–4</sup> and 3.4 x 10<sup>–5</sup> for shMAGI3.4 and shMAGI3.5, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).

Indeed, we found that YAP co-immunoprecipitated with MAGI3 and likewise, MAGI3 co-immunoprecipitated with YAP from MCF10A cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We next determined the critical domains necessary for interaction between MAGI3 and YAP by ectopically expressing various epitope-tagged full-length and deletion mutants of MAGI3 and YAP in HEK293T cells. To determine whether this interaction required PDZ domain-binding, we performed co-IP experiments with V5-tagged MAGI3 and either Flag-tagged full-length YAP or a YAP mutant lacking the PDZ-binding motif (YAPΔC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oka et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with the endogenous co-IP results, Flag-tagged full-length YAP co-immunoprecipitated with V5-tagged MAGI3 in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, Flag-YAPΔC and MAGI3-V5 could not be co-immunoprecipitated by either anti-Flag or anti-V5 IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that the PDZ-binding motif of YAP is necessary for the physical interaction between the two proteins. To further confirm that the interaction between YAP and MAGI3 requires PDZ domain-binding, we first utilized a computational predictor to map the PDZ-binding peptide of YAP against all human PDZ domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hui and Bader, 2010</xref>) and found that the sixth PDZ domain (PDZ6) of MAGI3 was the highest-scoring interactor on the list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We thus expressed a Flag-tagged <italic>MAGI3</italic> construct lacking PDZ6 (MAGI3ΔPDZ6) in HEK293T cells and performed co-IP experiments for YAP to determine the necessity of PDZ6 for MAGI3 and YAP interaction. Deletion of PDZ6 curtailed MAGI3 interaction with YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the PDZ-binding motif of YAP and the PDZ6 domain of MAGI3 are necessary for protein-protein interaction.</p><p>Having shown that full-length MAGI3 and YAP interact endogenously, we next investigated whether manipulating MAGI3 levels affects the ability of YAP to act as a transcription co-activator. When MCF10A cells were depleted of <italic>MAGI3</italic> by RNAi, the expression of YAP target genes <italic>ANKRD1</italic> and <italic>CYR61</italic> were induced (p=9.9 x 10 <sup>–3</sup> and 2.5 x 10<sup>–4</sup>, respectively), as determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The rescue of <italic>MAGI3</italic> levels restored the expression of <italic>ANKRD1</italic> and <italic>CYR61</italic> to baseline levels (p=0.012 and 3.5 x 10<sup>–4</sup>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), thus demonstrating the specificity of YAP regulation by <italic>MAGI3</italic>. We next developed a phenotypic assay to determine whether the molecular interactions between MAGI3 and YAP are physiologically relevant. Because RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>MAGI3</italic> in MCF10A-SV40 cells causes anchorage-independent growth (p=1.4 x 10<sup>–3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>), and overexpression of YAP in MCF10A cells also causes transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Overholtzer et al., 2006</xref>), we used the transformed phenotype to conduct epistasis analysis between <italic>MAGI3</italic> and <italic>YAP1</italic>. Knockdown of <italic>YAP1</italic> in <italic>MAGI3</italic>-depleted cells restored the normal phenotype (p=4.9 x 10<sup>–5</sup> and 8.9 x 10<sup>–4</sup> for shYAP1 #1 and #2, respectively), as did restoring <italic>MAGI3</italic> expression in <italic>MAGI3</italic>-depleted cells (p=6.5 x 10<sup>–7</sup> and 2.0 x 10<sup>–5</sup> for MAGI3α and MAGI3β, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>).

YAP functions as a transcriptional coactivator, and the regulation of its subcellular localization is a major determinant of protein activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). In HEK293T cells, YAP activity exhibits highly robust responses to serum deprivation, which promotes cytoplasmic accumulation of YAP, and subsequent serum stimulation, which rapidly induces YAP nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, we examined the subcellular localization of YAP in cells transfected with either truncated or full-length MAGI3. Consistent with the <italic>MAGI3</italic> loss-of-function data, overexpression of full-length MAGI3 led to YAP cytoplasmic accumulation despite serum stimulated cell culture, whereas nuclear translocation of YAP was induced in untransfected control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). By contrast, the expression of truncated MAGI3 caused the opposite effect by increasing nuclear YAP localization in cells even under the serum deprived conditions that normally preclude YAP from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). The increased nuclear YAP localization was indicative of heightened YAP activation, since the amount of phosphorylated/inactive YAP was reduced in lysates from cells expressing MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup> and MAGI3ΔC-GFP compared to GFP control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, in contrast to the inhibitory effect of full-length MAGI3 on YAP, these data demonstrate that truncated MAGI3 is positively associated with YAP activation. We further asked whether the transformed phenotype caused by expression of truncated MAGI3 is YAP-dependent. Indeed, knockdown of YAP in MCF10A-SV40 cells expressing MAGI3ΔC-GFP resulted in a significant reduction of colony formation on soft agar (p=7.4 x 10<sup>–5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>), suggesting that the increase in YAP activity caused by truncated MAGI3 is functionally important for transformation.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14730.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Expression of truncated MAGI3 leads to increased YAP activation and YAP-dependent transformation.</title><p>(<bold>A-B</bold>) Immunofluorescence of serum-stimulated HEK293T cells showing YAP (red) localization.

Both pools of cells were orthotopically implanted into female NOD/SCID mice, and tumor growth was monitored over a seven-week timespan. Consistent with the mechanism, the growth of tumors expressing high ratios of FL:pPA was significantly impaired compared to FL:pPA ratio-unmodified control tumors (p=5.8 x 10<sup>–5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>).

We have shown that truncations of MAGI3 generated by pPA as well as other mechanisms of alteration promote increased activation of the Hippo effector YAP and induce YAP-dependent malignant transformation. These effects are mediated by the dominant-negative activity of MAGI3 truncations, which physically associate with full-length MAGI3 and antagonize the inhibitory protein-protein interaction between full-length MAGI3 and YAP. Thus, the interaction between full-length MAGI3 and YAP plays a central role in suppressing malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

For example, oncogenic human papillomaviruses, which have evolved to target critical tumor suppressors necessary for transformation such as p53, also target MAGI3 for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Thomas et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, <italic>MAGI3</italic> was found to be part of a downregulated gene signature associated with breast tumor-initiating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Creighton et al., 2009</xref>). However, a specific role for <italic>MAGI3</italic> as a tumor suppressor in human cancer has remained elusive, due to the apparent infrequent alteration of the gene in cancer and the lack of cancer-relevant mechanistic evidence.</p><p>In human cancer, <italic>MAGI3</italic> is not frequently altered by nonsynonymous mutations or copy number losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cerami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2013</xref>), and has not been previously nominated as a driver. Here, we have found evidence that a single alteration event in <italic>MAGI3</italic>, caused by the utilization of a cryptic intron 10 PAS by premature cleavage and polyadenylation, occurs in approximately 7.5% of 160 breast cancers analyzed, and the resulting truncated <italic>MAGI3</italic> product contributes to the malignant transformation of human mammary epithelial cells. Transformation caused by an independent MAGI3 truncation, also found in breast cancer, provides additional functional evidence for the cancer relevance of MAGI3 truncations. Moreover, the ability of these truncations to function as dominant-negative proteins and prevent the inhibition of YAP by full-length MAGI3 suggests that the generation of truncated <italic>MAGI3</italic> products by pPA or chromosomal rearrangement may more potently deregulate YAP activity and drive transformation compared to the mutation or loss of a single <italic>MAGI3</italic> allele. Collectively, these data indicate that <italic>MAGI3</italic> alterations in cancer may occur much more frequently than previously appreciated and support the clinical relevance of MAGI3 truncations as driver alterations.</p><p>By defining the protein-protein interaction network of MAGI3, we have uncovered the previously unknown interaction between MAGI3 and YAP, an oncoprotein that represents the major downstream effector of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnson and Halder, 2014</xref>). We have demonstrated that these YAP-inhibitory interactions play an important role in suppressing malignant transformation, since reduction of these functional complexes by depleting full-length MAGI3 leads to increased YAP-dependent transcriptional activation and transformation. Importantly, we found that the C-terminal PDZ6 domain of MAGI3 is essential for MAGI3/YAP interaction, whereas the two independent breast cancer-associated MAGI3 truncations studied here – MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup> and MAGI3ΔC – lack this domain and fail to interact with YAP. Nevertheless, the truncations dominantly suppressed interactions between full-length MAGI3 and YAP, resulting in YAP activation and malignant transformation. We further determined that MAGI3 truncations can physically associate with full-length MAGI3 proteins, and thus posit that this aberrant complex interferes with the interaction between full-length MAGI3 and YAP. Our results underscore the importance of the MAGI3/YAP interaction in suppressing malignant transformation and implicate MAGI3 as a new potential component involved in the regulation of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway. In addition, our identification of other candidate protein-protein interactors of MAGI3 establishes a resource for future investigation into other biological processes regulated by full-length MAGI3 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Premature cleavage and polyadenylation as a cancer-relevant alteration mechanism</title><p>An emerging phenomenon in cancer is the generation of gene expression alterations by localized mutational or transcriptome-wide events affecting cleavage and polyadenylation. In mantle cell lymphoma, for example, mutations that generate novel, gene-proximal PAS in the <italic>CCND1</italic> 3′ UTR have been discovered. In these tumors, the production of shorter, prematurely polyadenylated cyclin D1 mRNA isoforms, which exhibit dramatically extended half-lives, drive the overexpression of cyclin D1 oncoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wiestner et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, a number of studies on genes with tandem PAS arrangements in the 3′ UTR have shown that shorter 3′ UTRs utilizing the gene-proximal PAS are favored by cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sandberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Singh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mayr and Bartel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xia et al., 2014</xref>). This increased tendency in cancer cells to utilize gene-proximal PAS for cleavage and polyadenylation corresponds to increased mRNA half-life as well as protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Singh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mayr and Bartel, 2009</xref>), suggesting that 3′ UTR shortening may be a general mechanism of evading regulation by tumor suppressive microRNAs.</p><p>Our study extends these previous findings by showing that, in cancer, premature cleavage and polyadenylation can occur in the intron of a gene despite the absence of mutations in the immediate exon/intron sequences flanking the cryptic PAS. While alternative 3′ UTR PAS selection does not alter the mRNA coding potential, pPA can cause gene-truncating alterations that produce pre-mRNAs with potential to encode constitutively active or dominant-negative proteins. Such pre-mRNAs are naturally able to evade post-transcriptional quality-control surveillance mechanisms such as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. By producing constitutively active or dominant-negative proteins, pPA transcripts may cause significant functional and phenotypic consequences even if expressed at lower levels than wild-type mRNA isoforms. Determining whether pPA events in cancer occur in other genes beside <italic>MAGI3,</italic> and whether pPA is triggered widely throughout the transcriptome or focally restricted to susceptible intronic PAS, are important future directions but beyond the scope of the current study. However, pPA truncation of other cancer-relevant genes is a strong possibility considering the previous studies that have identified dominant-negative proteins arising from pPA events. Prominent examples of these pPA-generated dominant-negative proteins include an EPRS isoform in peripheral blood monocytes that blocks translational repression by full-length EPRS following γ-interferon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yao et al., 2012</xref>), and a VEGFR2 truncation that inhibits HUVEC tube formation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vorlová et al., 2011</xref>). Given these precedents, it will be important to conduct transcriptome-scale studies to identify other genes affected by premature polyadenylation in cancer. Such studies, however, must await the development of custom pPA-finding computational methods.</p><p>The results of our study also pose several intriguing mechanistic questions. For example, how do pPA events arise independently of local, cis-acting genetic mutations? Previous work has shown that, under certain conditions, pPA events can be induced in cells. For example, U1 snRNP function is essential for protecting pre-mRNAs from pPA at cryptic intronic PAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almada et al., 2013</xref>), and experimental depletion of U1 snRNP levels can lead to the production of novel, pPA-truncated isoforms that encode dominant-negative proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vorlová et al., 2011</xref>). Overexpression of polyadenylation factors has also been shown to mediate alternative intronic PAS usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Takagaki et al., 1996</xref>). These findings raise the possibility that alteration of a <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor in cancer cells could result in either focal or transcriptome-wide pPA. Moreover, because the relative abundance of U1 snRNP to nuclear pre-mRNAs is a critical factor for determining whether global pPA events occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg et al., 2012</xref>), alterations that drive global transcriptional amplification, a phenomenon frequently observed in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sabò et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cunningham et al., 2014</xref>), might also induce pPA. In addition, whether broad pPA induction enables cancer cells to sample and select specific pPA events that confer functional growth advantages – such as <italic>MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup></italic> – and how pPA events at the functionally relevant loci are passed from mother cell to daughter cells, are outstanding questions that will require further investigation into the phenomenon of pPA in cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning and plasmid construction</title><p>Full-length <italic>MAGI3</italic> isoforms concordant with NCBI RefSeq transcripts were amplified from MCF10A cDNA and subcloned into pLenti7.3-V5-DEST (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) or CS-CG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miyoshi et al., 1998</xref>) for MAGI3-V5 and MAGI3-GFP, respectively.

This was performed by splitting <italic>MAGI3</italic> intron 10 into two regions: (A) the pPA-specific region from the start of the intron to the cryptic PAS; (B) the intronic region downstream of the cryptic PAS. A p&lt;0.05 was considered a significant deviation from the expected read distribution and therefore a rejection of the null hypothesis. Samples with p&lt;0.05 were further analyzed for continuity of read coverage throughout Region A. To account for non-uniformity biases inherent in RNA-Seq read distributions, we set a threshold for continuity defined by overlapping read coverage with fewer than 5 small (&lt;75 nt) gaps. Samples passing all the above criteria were considered to express the pPA-truncated <italic>MAGI3</italic> isoform, and relative expression levels of <italic>MAGI3<sup>pPA </sup></italic>versus either of the full-length isoforms (<italic>MAGI3α</italic> and <italic>MAGI3β</italic>) were measured by counting the number of reads mapping uniquely to each isoform and dividing the length-corrected reads mapping to the pPA isoform by those mapping to each full-length isoform.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A power analysis program for comparing two means (two-sample, two-sided equality) was used to determine the sample size needed for experiments, with significance criteria being α = 0.05 and power = 0.8. For these calculations, we assumed a difference between means of 30 and 50 along with standard deviations of 10 and 20 for transformation assays and tumor xenograft experiments, respectively. Data were analyzed and compared between groups using two-tailed Student’s t-tests. A p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank S Kwok and A Parmelee for performing FACS; R Tomaino and the Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility at Harvard Medical School for mass spectrometry analysis; J Elman for technical assistance; A Vilborg for insightful discussions regarding premature transcription termination; and W Zhou and J Li for critical reading of the manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision. <italic>eLife</italic> is open to reviewing a revised version of the paper, though substantial new data will be required to address the reviewer comments.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have identified a C-terminal truncated form of MAGI3 protein as a cancer-promoting variant. Interestingly, the novel form of MAGI3 results from translation of a product of premature cleavage and polyadenylation (pPA) of the transcript at a cryptic intronic poly(A) signal. The truncated form of MAGI3 acts as a dominant-negative to inhibit a newly-discovered function of MAGI3 as an inhibitor of YAP. The paper is interesting both for this example of the role of pPA in cancer and for the new insights into YAP regulation. However, the reviewers have raised several major concerns. Substantial new data will be needed to address the reviewers' comments. Since the new data will mostly come from further in-depth analysis of sequencing data, together with a few new experiments, we are offering you the opportunity to modify the paper and resubmit. However, if you cannot provide the data within the two months we normally allow for return of a revised submission, you should write back to indicate how you plan to proceed and indicate the length of time you expect it would take to comply with the required additional work. Alternatively, we understand that you may feel it is not possible to comply in which case you may choose to withdraw and submit this work elsewhere.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The cause of the pPA event in MAGI3 is unknown, and may be due to a cis-acting mutation within the <italic>MAGI3</italic> gene or to a broad effect on many genes. The authors emphasize that the pPA is not due to mutation. To address this: (a) the entire <italic>MAGI3</italic> gene, not just the exons, must be sequenced; (b) the data from MDA-MB-231 cells and other cells with pPA of <italic>MAGI3</italic>, as well as some pPA-negative lines (e.g. MCF10A), should be mined for the occurrence of pPA events in other genes; and (c) the RNASeq data needs to be presented more clearly, statistical methods explained, and the relative abundance of RNA and protein isoforms in normal and cancer cells determined.</p><p>2) The prevalence of pPA of <italic>MAGI3</italic> in breast cancer is unclear. Analysis of TCGA data or other published data sets is required.</p><p>3) The literature on pPA in cancer should be discussed.</p><p>The comments of each reviewer are provided below for your information. The major comments have been distilled into the above essential revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>1) It should be possible to access more RNASeq data to get better statistics on the frequency of tumors in which magi3 RNA is truncated.</p><p>2) Better data on YAP subcellular localization should be provided.</p><p>3) The authors should discuss previous evidence for premature cleavage/polyadenylation in cancer in more depth. In addition to the Mayr and Bartel 2009 paper, other seminal papers are Sandberg et al. 2008 Science 320:1643 and Singh et al. 2009 Cancer Res 69:9422. Previous examples of dominant negatives arising through transcript truncation include Yao et al. 2012 Cell 149:88 and Vorlova et al. 2011 Mol Cell 43:927.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>1) The authors strongly emphasize that they searched for abnormal proteins that were /not/ the result of genetic changes. However, it is unclear whether they have, in fact, ruled out the possibility that intronic mutations are responsible for the truncated MAGI3 isoform. They state: &quot;We sequenced MAGI3 but found no mutations in coding regions or exon-flanking intron sequences, indicating that this truncation was not generated by DNA mutation.&quot;</p><p>However, as far as I can tell, that they didn't sequence the entire intron containing the cryptic poly(A) site. Therefore, they can't conclude that local intronic mutations aren't responsible for the observed truncation. (Conversely, it's formally possible that a trans-acting cleavage or poly(A) factor could also be mutated. This possibility is difficult to rule out.) The bottom line is that the authors should not claim so strongly that they are studying unusual proteins that don't result from mutations.</p><p>2) The analyses illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are neither well-described nor statistically robust. It's unclear whether the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is normalized w.r.t. total read coverage, which is an obvious potential confounding factor. Normalized read coverage plots are the relevant visual illustration. More importantly, the statistical thresholds that the authors used are insufficiently described. The description in &quot;Bioinformatic Analysis of RNA-Seq Data&quot; is not detailed enough to assess whether the authors are correctly distinguishing between premature polyadenylation and intron retention, etc. For this kind of analysis – where they're comparing occurrence of an unusual isoform between primary cancers and peritumoral normal – using a robust statistical procedure is essential.</p><p>3) The authors need to clearly measure and describe the relative quantitative levels of the truncated vs. full-length isoforms of MAGI3. For example, the authors should have a single Western blot against MAGI3 showing their positive (MDA-MB-231) as well as negative (MCF10A, HMEC) samples (currently in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref>). Similarly, the authors should quantitatively measure relative expression levels of the truncated isoform in their analyses of primary samples (see comment #2 above). Quantitative comparisons are important because it's relatively rare for an aberrant isoform to be completely absent from normal cells, but highly expressed in cancer cells. Quantitative differences are much more common.</p><p>4) The authors overemphasize the novelty of their results. For example, they state in the Abstract that: &quot;Our results suggest that pPA, by generating truncated and oncogenic mRNA isoforms, contributes to cancer as a previously overlooked mechanism of alteration.&quot;</p><p>Similarly, they state in the Discussion that: &quot;Premature cleavage and polyadenylation has not previously been known to alter genes in cancer.&quot;</p><p>However, alternative polyadenylation, including premature polyadenylation, has been extensively studied in the literature. For example, gene-proximal poly(A) sites are preferentially used in cancers (e.g., Sandberg et al., Science, 2008). Other authors have also studied truncated isoforms of specific cancer-relevant genes (e.g., Wiestner et al., Blood, 2007). Unusual isoforms generated by alternative splicing and premature polyadenylation have been particularly well-studied in the context of ligand-independent isoforms of the androgen receptor (e.g., Antonarakis et al., NEJM, 2014).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>1) The authors used 3' RACE to implicate premature polyadenylation of MAGI3 in just one breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). It would be more convincing if the same analysis can be done in the three primary tumors which the authors believe have similar aberration based on RNA-seq. This will exclude the possibility that the premature polyadenylation is something that happens during in vitro culture of cancer cell lines.</p><p>2) The RNA-seq data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is incomplete. It does not show coverage after the cryptic polyadenylation site. It is important to show coverage through the whole <italic>MAGI3</italic> gene, including all exons and introns, especially the ones after the cryptic polyadenylation site.</p><p>3) The study left open the question of how such premature polyadenylation happens. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms may be the subject of a future study), it might be informative to analyze the RNA-seq data at whole genome level for the three primary tumors to determine whether premature polyadenylation happens in other genes. At least this will tell us whether this is a local or genome-wide phenomenon.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, the authors showed xenografts of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing full-length MAGI3. The expression level of MAGI3 full-length vs. truncated form should be examined to show their stoichiometry.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Premature Polyadenylation of MAGI3 Produces a Novel Driver of Human Breast Cancer&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The authors need to clarify whether the RNA-seq data that they analyze in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is controlled for sequencing depth and expression of the <italic>MAGI3</italic> gene. If MAGI3 is much more highly expressed in cancer than in peritumoral normal cells, then they will a priori be much more likely to detect rare premature polyadenylation in the tumors than in the normals. This concern was raised in the previous review.</p><p>2) The authors still overstate the novelty of their results in the Abstract, where they state: &quot;Here we report a new mechanism also capable of altering gene products to produce cancer drivers.&quot; This is incongruous with their Discussion, which places their work in the broader context of the field more appropriately. The discovery of premature polyadenylation in cancer is not new. The novelty is in the specific molecular mechanism of YAP regulation, not in pPA. The title is also too strong. Stating that a gene product is a &quot;driver&quot; of cancer typically means that it is sufficient transform cells in vivo, which the authors have not shown. One solution may be to substitute &quot;dominantly-acting oncogene&quot; for &quot;driver&quot; in the title, and replace the second sentence of the abstract with &quot;Here we report a new mechanism by which premature polyadenylation can produce an oncogenic protein.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14730.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The cause of the pPA event in MAGI3 is unknown, and may be due to a cis-acting mutation within the MAGI3 gene or to a broad effect on many genes.

This analysis shows a clear picture of <italic>MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup></italic> in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-D</xref>). Overall, 12 out of 160 (7.5%) tumors show evidence of pPA truncation of MAGI3 at intron 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). By contrast, intronic reads in MAGI3 intron 10 from peritumoral normal samples were limited to mostly rare events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-B</xref>), and none of these samples showed any evidence of <italic>MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These findings in the larger TCGA dataset are consistent with the frequency reported in our original manuscript (6%) that was based on a smaller non-TCGA dataset.</p><p>In light of these significant findings for tumor-recurring premature polyadenylation of MAGI3 in TCGA data, we felt that the importance of the pPA isoform – as a novel driver isoform of breast cancer – should be conveyed by the title of the paper. As such, we have revised the title of the manuscript to reflect this (now entitled “Premature Polyadenylation of MAGI3 Produces a Novel Driver of Human Breast Cancer”).</p><p><italic>2) Better data on YAP subcellular localization should be provided.</italic></p><p>We have provided better YAP subcellular localization images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) The authors should discuss previous evidence for premature cleavage/polyadenylation in cancer in more depth.

In the revised Discussion section of the manuscript we discuss in greater depth the previous evidence for alternative 3’ UTR polyadenylation in cancer and previous examples for dominant-negative proteins arising from pPA truncation (entitled “Premature Cleavage and Polyadenylation as a Cancer-Relevant Alteration Mechanism”).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors strongly emphasize that they searched for abnormal proteins that were /not/ the result of genetic changes. However, it is unclear whether they have, in fact, ruled out the possibility that intronic mutations are responsible for the truncated MAGI3 isoform. They state: &quot;We sequenced MAGI3 but found no mutations in coding regions or exon-flanking intron sequences, indicating that this truncation was not generated by DNA mutation.&quot;</italic></p><p><italic>However, as far as I can tell, that they didn't sequence the entire intron containing the cryptic poly(A) site.

The bottom line is that the authors should not claim so strongly that they are studying unusual proteins that don't result from mutations.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comments and agree that it is important to rule out the presence of local intron 10 mutations in MAGI3. Because the <italic>MAGI3</italic> gene is extremely large (~300 kb), we hope that the reviewers will agree with us that sequencing its entirety would be quite costly and provide little further value in interpreting the results. However, to address this important issue more directly, we have now sequenced the entire intron 10 of MAGI3 and found no mutations. In addition, we have sequenced the entire intron 10 region, along with the preceding exon 10, present in the MAGI3 pPA product isolated by 3’ RACE. This also uncovered no mutations. Both analyses confirm that the major cis-acting sequence features known to dictate proper splicing and repression of cryptic intronic polyadenylation (5’/3’ splice sites, upstream U1 snRNA binding sites, downstream U-rich elements) are not mutated. These data have been added to the Results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>.</p><p>We also agree that is difficult to rule out the presence of mutations in trans-acting cleavage and polyadenylation factors. Likewise, while we have sequenced all 22 exons of MAGI3 and found no mutations, it would be difficult to rule out (or interpret the significance of) long-range, non-coding mutations elsewhere in the very large 300-kb <italic>MAGI3</italic> gene locus. Thus, we have revised our statements regarding the absence of mutations to indicate the absence of mutations in the local exonic and intronic regions surrounding the cryptic PAS in intron 10, since these are supported by our findings.</p><p>As the reviewer suggested, we also discuss the possibility of mutation/alteration to a trans-acting cleavage and polyadenylation factor in the revised Discussion section.</p><p><italic>2) The analyses illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are neither well-described nor statistically robust. It's unclear whether the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is normalized w.r.t. total read coverage, which is an obvious potential confounding factor.

Similarly, the authors should quantitatively measure relative expression levels of the truncated isoform in their analyses of primary samples (see comment #2 above). Quantitative comparisons are important because it's relatively rare for an aberrant isoform to be completely absent from normal cells, but highly expressed in cancer cells. Quantitative differences are much more common.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the comments and suggestions for the RNA-Seq analysis. We have revised the text to provide detailed descriptions of the RNA-Seq analysis scripts/tools, statistical methods, and thresholds used (Results section 2 and Materials and methods). To further improve overall clarity, we have also added visual depictions of our analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and included a running tally of tumor and matched normal samples at each level of analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As suggested, we also provide read coverage plots for the entire intron 10 of MAGI3, including the region after the cryptic PAS, for tumor-normal pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their suggestions to quantify the stoichiometry/relative expression levels of FL isoforms versus the pPA isoform.

We were unable to detect the pPA-truncated MAGI3 in whole cell lysates obtained from normal cell lines (MCF10A, HMEC), even with longer exposures and higher total protein loaded for these samples compared to MDA-MB-231 cells. We have thus reproduced our original results, reaffirming our conclusion that the pPA truncation is not expressed in the normal mammary cell lines.</p><p><italic>4) The authors overemphasize the novelty of their results. For example, they state in the Abstract that: &quot;Our results suggest that pPA, by generating truncated and oncogenic mRNA isoforms, contributes to cancer as a previously overlooked mechanism of alteration.&quot;</italic></p><p><italic>Similarly, they state in the Discussion that: &quot;Premature cleavage and polyadenylation has not previously been known to alter genes in cancer.&quot;</italic></p><p><italic>However, alternative polyadenylation, including premature polyadenylation, has been extensively studied in the literature. For example, gene-proximal poly(A) sites are preferentially used in cancers (e.g., Sandberg et al., Science, 2008). Other authors have also studied truncated isoforms of specific cancer-relevant genes (e.g., Wiestner et al., Blood, 2007). Unusual isoforms generated by alternative splicing and premature polyadenylation have been particularly well-studied in the context of ligand-independent isoforms of the androgen receptor (e.g., Antonarakis et al., NEJM, 2014).</italic> </p><p>Please see response to Reviewer 1, point 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors used 3' RACE to implicate premature polyadenylation of MAGI3 in just one breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). It would be more convincing if the same analysis can be done in the three primary tumors which the authors believe have similar aberration based on RNA-seq. This will exclude the possibility that the premature polyadenylation is something that happens during in vitro culture of cancer cell lines.</italic></p><p>We agree that this would be a useful analysis, but it requires unavailable raw material from primary tumors. In addition, given the genetic heterogeneity of tumors and the complexity of tumor subtype in breast cancer, analysis of any random 3 primary tumors may not actually be that informative. Thus, to address this issue, we analyzed a larger, paired tumor-normal dataset from TCGA (that consists of &gt;100 primary tumors) and identified additional patient breast cancers that express <italic>MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup></italic>. Also, we probed multiple breast cancer cell lines for MAGI3 truncation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and the pPA truncation of MAGI3 does not appear to be a frequent event in cultured cancer cell lines suggesting this is not an artifact of ex vivo adaptation.</p><p><italic>2) The RNA-seq data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is incomplete. It does not show coverage after the cryptic polyadenylation site. It is important to show coverage through the whole MAGI3 gene, including all exons and introns, especially the ones after the cryptic polyadenylation site.</italic></p><p>Please see response to Reviewer 2, points 2 and 3.</p><p><italic>3) The study left open the question of how such premature polyadenylation happens. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms may be the subject of a future study), it might be informative to analyze the RNA-seq data at whole genome level for the three primary tumors to determine whether premature polyadenylation happens in other genes. At least this will tell us whether this is a local or genome-wide phenomenon.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that determining the nature of premature polyadenylation in cancer – as a focal or transcriptome-wide phenomenon – is important. However, bioinformatics methods for identifying novel pPA events on a transcriptome-wide scale are currently lacking. In addition, methodology-building studies similar in scale to the proposed study represent major works in their own right (such as Vaquero-Garcia et al., e<italic>Life</italic>, 2016, and Xia et al., Nat. Commun., 2014). Thus, examining other genes for premature polyadenylation will have to await the development of pPA-finding computational methods, which we are currently working towards and is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>However, in this revised manuscript we focused our efforts on (1) improving our RNA-Seq analyses for identifying the <italic>MAGI3<sup>pPA</sup></italic> event, and (2) ascertaining the frequency of pPA truncation of MAGI3 in a larger dataset of tumor-normal paired breast cancers from TCGA. In addition, given the importance of these findings, in the revised manuscript we devote a lengthy discussion of the potential impact of studying pPA events in cancer.</p><p>References:</p><p>Vaquero-Garcia et al.

If MAGI3 is much more highly expressed in cancer than in peritumoral normal cells, then they will a priori be much more likely to detect rare premature polyadenylation in the tumors than in the normals. This concern was raised in the previous review.</italic></p><p>We apologize for this omission. We compared upper quartile-normalized TPM or FPKM values for MAGI3 between tumor and tumor-adjacent normal tissues. The relative <italic>MAGI3</italic> expression is only slightly higher in tumors versus adjacent normal tissues (median ~ 1.1-fold increase), and this modest increase in sequencing depth of MAGI3 in tumor samples is unlikely to bias detection of premature polyadenylation of MAGI3. The methods and results are now reported in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) The authors still overstate the novelty of their results in the Abstract, where they state: &quot;Here we report a new mechanism also capable of altering gene products to produce cancer drivers.&quot; This is incongruous with their Discussion, which places their work in the broader context of the field more appropriately. The discovery of premature polyadenylation in cancer is not new. The novelty is in the specific molecular mechanism of YAP regulation, not in pPA. The title is also too strong. Stating that a gene product is a &quot;driver&quot; of cancer typically means that it is sufficient transform cells in vivo, which the authors have not shown. One solution may be to substitute &quot;dominantly-acting oncogene&quot; for &quot;driver&quot; in the title, and replace the second sentence of the abstract with &quot;Here we report a new mechanism by which premature polyadenylation can produce an oncogenic protein.&quot;</italic> </p><p>Thank you for the helpful suggestions. We have made these changes to the title and Abstract of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
