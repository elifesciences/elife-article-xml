We have investigated the dynamic contribution of prelimbic cortical neuronal projections to the periaqueductal grey (PrL-P) to the development of neuropathic pain in rats using combined opto- and chemogenetic approaches. We found PrL-P neurons to exert a tonic inhibitory control on thermal withdrawal thresholds in uninjured animals. Following nerve injury, ongoing activity in PrL-P neurons masked latent hypersensitivity and improved affective state. However, this function is lost as the development of sensory hypersensitivity emerges. Despite this loss of tonic control, opto-activation of PrL-P neurons at late post-injury timepoints could restore the anti-allodynic effects by inhibition of spinal nociceptive processing. We suggest that the loss of cortical drive to the descending pain modulatory system underpins the expression of neuropathic sensitisation after nerve injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>descending pain modulation</kwd><kwd>periaquductal gray</kwd><kwd>neuropathic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P00668/X1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drake</surname><given-names>Robert A R</given-names></name><name><surname>Apps</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name><name><surname>Lumb</surname><given-names>Bridget M</given-names></name><name><surname>Pickering</surname><given-names>Anthony E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Alterations to brain network communication leading to a progressive loss in descending inhibitory modulation of the spinal cord is a key determinate of pain state development following peripheral nerve injury.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is a pressing need to better understand the causal mechanisms of chronic pain and develop effective therapeutic strategies that will alleviate its societal burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breivik et al., 2006</xref>). The brain, as opposed to the periphery, has received increasing focus as a critical contributor to chronic pain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ossipov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baliki and Apkarian, 2015</xref>). The descending pain modulatory system (DPMS) links brain and spinal cord to provide potent and targeted regulation of nociceptive processing at multiple levels of the neuroaxis, including the spinal dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Millan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tracey and Mantyh, 2007</xref>). Importantly, the DPMS can affect the perception of pain and is a critical regulator of the development of the pain state following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eippert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hughes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drake et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hirschberg et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Typically, following acute injury, this descending regulation functions to inhibit spinal dorsal horn circuits that subserve damaged tissue and, in doing so, moderate central sensitisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vanegas and Schaible, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drake et al., 2014</xref>). However, net loss of inhibitory control has been noted in a wide variety of human chronic pain disorders, and descending inhibitory systems are depleted and non-functional in animal models of persistent pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yarnitsky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hughes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hughes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Staud, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bannister et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, trait deficiencies in endogenous inhibitory control and/or its engagement by peripheral injury are thought to impart individual vulnerability to chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edwards, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yarnitsky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Granovsky, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">González-Roldán et al., 2020</xref>). What causes this deficit/loss in the function of the DPMS is not well understood but could help identify critical and generalisable mechanisms of chronic pain development that lay the foundation for the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.</p><p>In humans, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) displays specific activity related to acute pain processing, pain expectation, and endogenous pain modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lorenz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wager et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wiech and Tracey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Legrain et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brooks et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, the mPFC shows alterations in structure and function that are related to and, sometimes, predictive of the transition to chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apkarian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baliki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baliki et al., 2012</xref>). Direct corticofugal projections from the mPFC to the midbrain link it to the DPMS to provide a route to pain state regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). The midbrain periaqueductal grey (PAG) is a core component of the DPMS able to facilitate and/or inhibit spinal nociceptive processing via pain modulatory brainstem nuclei including the rostral ventromedial medulla and locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mantyh, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Waters and Lumb, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ossipov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drake et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, altered functional connectivity between the mPFC and PAG is observed in human patients with musculoskeletal, neuropathic, and inflammatory chronic pain, suggesting that altered cortical control may contribute to maladaptation of the DPMS and that this mechanism may be relevant to chronic pain in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cifre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mills et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Segerdahl et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Recently, preclinical investigation has demonstrated the prelimbic (PrL) cortex, a division of the rodent mPFC, is able to affect noxious thresholds in neuropathic rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). However, whether the contributions of PrL neurons that target the PAG (PrL-P) in sensory and/or affective aspects of the pain state are dynamically altered during the development of neuropathic pain is not known. To assess this question, we transfected PrL-P neurons with excitatory optogenetic and inhibitory chemogenetic actuator proteins to allow selective manipulation of their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sternson and Roth, 2014</xref>). This enabled their contribution to sensory and affective aspects of pain-like behaviour to be charted before and, at regular intervals, following peripheral nerve injury in rats. We also used electrophysiological methods to investigate whether PrL-P neurons exert effects on spinal dorsal horn nociceptive circuit activity to establish whether these effects are mediated by descending control.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Targeting mPFC → PAG neurons in the PrL cortex</title><p>To make selective manipulations of mPFC neurons that project to the PAG, we expressed the excitatory light- activated ion channel, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), and the inhibitory ligand gated G protein–coupled receptor, hM4Di, in mPFC pyramidal neurons using an intersectional and Cre-dependent approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In uninjured animals, we found PrL-P neurons to exert tonic inhibitory control over evoked noxious withdrawal responses, suggesting they were involved with the moment-to-moment regulation of nocifensive behaviour. Following tibial nerve injury, rats developed mechanical and thermal allodynia that plateaued at around 14 days post injury. Chemo-inhibition of PrL-P neurons at 3 and 7 days post-injury revealed latent hypersensitivity both ipsilateral and contralateral (day 3 only) to nerve injury and produced place aversion in a conditioned place preference paradigm. However, chemo-inhibition of PrL-P neurons at more than 14 days post-injury failed to significantly affect mechanically or thermally evoked pain-like behaviour. These findings are consistent with there being a tonic activity in PrL-P neurons that suppresses hypersensitivity early after nerve ligation, but this is lost with time as the neuropathic pain phenotype emerges. Despite the loss in function, opto-activation of PrL-P neurons during later stages of neuropathic pain produces anti-allodynic effects in neuropathic animals achieved, at least in part, by inhibitory effects on spinal nociceptive processing. We postulate that this cortical–midbrain–spinal network allows executive control of nociception and regulation of pain, and that it is the loss of cortical drive to the DPMS, which is a major contributor to the expression of neuropathic sensitisation after nerve injury.</p><p>Loss of endogenous inhibitory control of CNS pain processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Staud, 2012</xref>) and altered functional connectivity between the mPFC and the PAG is a shared feature of a wide variety of human chronic pain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Segerdahl et al., 2018</xref>)—our findings suggest these changes are causally related. The human mPFC, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), is increasingly recognised as a key locus in the development and maintenance of chronic pain, with changes in structure and function that are associated with, and sometimes predictive of, the transition to chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apkarian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baliki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hashmi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baliki and Apkarian, 2015</xref>). The PAG is not only a key node in the DPMS but also an important orchestrator of autonomic and sensorimotor systems that is engaged to support mPFC function in aversive learning, emotional modulation, and pain modulation, which are all relevant to the chronic pain phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Keay and Bandler, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franklin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rozeske et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). In humans, changes in functional connectivity between the mPFC/ACC and PAG are commonly observed in experimental paradigms that produce emotional, attentional, and placebo/nocebo influences on pain as well following the delivery of analgesic drugs and often interpreted as reflecting engagement of the DPMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wager et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wiech et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wanigasekera et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oliva et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, changes in the functional connectivity between regions of the mPFC and the PAG are often correlated with changes in pain perception and/or disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cifre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hemington and Coulombe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harper et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Segerdahl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wanigasekera et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">González-Roldán et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we provide evidence in rodents that the PrL, a component of the rodent mPFC, can engage the DPMS to affect nociception, and loss in PrL-P neuron function is causally related to the development of the neuropathic pain state in rats. We suggest that changes in functional communication between the mPFC and PAG, whether trait-, age- or disease-related, likely manifest as alterations in the descending control of spinal nociception.</p><p>Preclinical findings suggest that loss of mPFC–PAG functional communication is explained by both local and inter-regional network alterations. In neuropathic rodents, at 7–10 days post-nerve injury, there is a decline in spontaneous and evoked PrL layer five pyramidal cell activity including those that project to the PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheriyan and Sheets, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mitrić et al., 2019</xref>). This reduction in PrL projection neurons excitability is produced in part by enhanced feedforward inhibition from local GABAergic interneurons and driven by inputs from the basolateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheriyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kiritoshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheriyan and Sheets, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Opto-inhibition of BLA inputs to the PrL releases PrL-P neurons to engage descending inhibitory control from the PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). PrL-P neurons are glutamatergic and target both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franklin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2019</xref>) but engage descending inhibitory control from the PAG that is associated with the release of local GABAergic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). We suggest that the BLA–PrL–PAG–spinal network is central to the expression of neuropathic pain and therapeutics that reengage cortical control of descending pain modulation may be effective in treating both sensory and affective disturbances in chronic pain. However, while BLA inputs to the PrL drive sensory hypersensitivity and negative affect by reducing descending inhibition of the spinal dorsal horn, BLA inputs to the dorsal cingulate regions mitigate pain-related aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meda et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, in neuropathic rodents, the E/I ratio of BLA inputs into infralimbic projections to the PAG remain unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheriyan and Sheets, 2018</xref>). Thus, there appears region-specific alterations to BLA–mPFC–PAG neuronal network that must be considered if novel and effective CNS therapeutic strategies are to be realized.</p><p>We found that PrL-P neurons alter sensory and affective aspects of neuropathic pain, at least in part, via actions on spinal dorsal horn nociceptive processing. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2019</xref> dissected BLA–PrL–PAG circuitry and demonstrated contributions of spinal noradrenergic alpha-2 adrenoceptor and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1/2 signalling to PrL effects on pain-like behaviour in neuropathic rats; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2019</xref>. However, the expression of these receptors in the spinal ventral horn confounds interpretation of effects on sensory/nociceptive versus motor processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Perrier et al., 2013</xref>). Here we show that, in neuropathic animals, peripherally evoked spinal dorsal horn WDR neurons are inhibited by PrL-P neuronal activity confirming that the PrL cortex is able to engage DPMS that originate in the PAG. Spinal WDR neurons are a known target of descending modulatory systems and their activity correlates well with both withdrawal reflexes and pain perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maixner et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">You et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McMullan and Lumb, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drake et al., 2016</xref>). It is significant from a therapeutic perspective that the PrL is able to affect nociceptive information early in the ascending pathway, likely prior to extensive integration with other nociceptive/non-nociceptive information, which would allow for selective and potent actions on the pain experience and pain state development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heinricher et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Spinal noradrenergic alpha2adrenoceptor signalling masks latent mechanical and cold allodynia at early, but not late, timepoints post-tibial nerve injury and shows a remarkably similar chronology to that observed in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hughes et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, in addition to affecting the sensitivity of the injured paw, antagonism of spinal alpha2-adrenoceptors reveals contralateral allodynia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hughes et al., 2013</xref>), something also observed after chemo-inhibition of PrL-P neurons. This indicates that nerve injury drives central sensitisation that affects the response to nociceptive inputs from the uninjured paw to produce contralateral hypersensitivity that can be revealed by blockade of the descending modulation of spinal processing originating from the PrL cortex.</p><p>These observations, supported by those of Huang et al, suggest that spinal noradrenaline (NA) release mediates a large part of the PrL analgesic actions in the spinal dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hughes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hughes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings indicate that the progressive loss of spinal noradrenergic tone in this neuropathic model is due to the loss in top-down executive control from PrL-P neurons, but this is yet to be definitively tested. Despite this loss in function, potentiation of spinal NA signalling with reuptake inhibitors can prevent the development of neuropathic pain and reverse neuropathic hypersensitivity in late-stage neuropathic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hughes et al., 2015</xref>), and NA reuptake inhibitors are currently used to treat neuropathic pain in human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finnerup et al., 2015</xref>). Therapeutic strategies aimed at lifting the enhanced feedforward inhibition in the PrL combined with potentiation of spinal NA signalling could provide a novel approach to treat neuropathic pain in humans. However, targeted approaches are likely necessary as chemo-activation of locus coeruleus projections to the spinal dorsal horn and mPFC produce pain relief and conflicting negative affect in neuropathic rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hirschberg et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>At early post-injury timepoints, chemo-inhibition of PrL-P neurons produced place aversion indicating that loss of cortical control over the PAG and associated DPMS worsens the affective state of injured animals. This change in affective state is likely secondary to effects on spinal nociceptive processing as neuropathic animals show ongoing pain-like behaviour and its relief, for instance by stimulating spinal NA receptors, produces place preference in neuropathic rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">King et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hirschberg et al., 2017</xref>). However, direct effects of PrL-P neurons on affective processing should not be overlooked given the role of the PAG in fear, anxiety, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">George et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rozeske et al., 2018</xref> showed dorsal mPFC projections to the PAG regulate the appropriate expression of aversive memories suggesting that loss of functional communication between the PrL and PAG may lead to generalised aversion and negative affect; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rozeske et al., 2018</xref>.

We consider the impact of these on animal behaviour to be minimal as tapered fibres produced negatable tissue damage in post-mortem histological sections. However, a consideration of any ‘off-target’ effects is presented for the reader. Lesion or pharmacological inactivation of the equivalent CG1 region has been shown to not affect sensory thresholds and/or pain-like behaviour in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johansen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johansen and Fields, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Navratilova et al., 2015</xref>); therefore, we are confident that effects observed in our chemo-inhibition experiments are specific for CNO. Furthermore, the CG1/ACC region has been shown to generate change in affective state to guide adaptive behavioural and learning, particularly place avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johansen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johansen and Fields, 2004</xref>). Our data demonstrate that rats implanted with tapered optic fibres are still able to undergo place conditioning, indicating that any cortical disruption produces by our fibres does not impact CG1/ACC function relevant to our investigation.</p><p>In summary, we have identified specific contributions of PrL-P neurons to regulate nociception in healthy animals and charted their dynamic contributions to neuropathic pain state development following injury. Our findings suggest that PrL-P neurons engage descending inhibitory control of the spinal dorsal horn to regulate CNS nociceptive processing and moment-to-moment noxious threshold to affect behaviour. Following nerve injury, tone in PrL-P neurons initially constrains the spatiotemporal development of neuropathic hypersensitivity, but there is a progressive loss in the functional communication between the PrL and PAG as the pain state develops. Our findings aid interpretation of human clinical observations that demonstrate altered functional connectivity between the mPFC and PAG is an important mechanism in the development of chronic pain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background</td><td valign="top">Wistar (rat) <break/>male</td><td valign="top">Envigo, NL</td><td valign="top">RCCHan</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct</td><td valign="top">Canine adenoviralvector</td><td valign="top">IGMM, FR</td><td valign="top">CAV2-CMV-CRE</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct</td><td valign="top">Adeno-associatedviral vector</td><td valign="top">UNC Vector Core, USA</td><td valign="top">AAV2-EF1a-DIO- <break/>hChR2-EYFP</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct</td><td valign="top">Adeno-associatedviral vector</td><td valign="top">Addgene, USA</td><td valign="top">AAV2-hSyn-DIO- <break/>hM4Di-mCherry</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound</td><td valign="top">Clozepine-N-oxide</td><td valign="top">Tocris Bioscience, UK</td><td valign="top">4936</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-GFP (chicken polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam, USA</td><td valign="top">Ab13970</td><td valign="top">(1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-mCherry (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">BioVision</td><td valign="top">5993</td><td valign="top">(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Optic fibre</td><td valign="top">Optogenix, IT</td><td valign="top">Lambda-B</td><td valign="top">NA 0.66, length 4.4 mm, and <break/>light-emitting length 2 mm</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Q-probes</td><td valign="top">Neuronexus, USA</td><td valign="top">Q1 × 1-tet-10mm-121-Q4</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Headstage chip</td><td valign="top">Intan Technologies, USA</td><td valign="top">RHD2132</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Diode laser</td><td valign="top">Omricon Laserage, DE</td><td valign="top">LuxX445-100</td><td valign="top">445 nm/100 mW</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">OpenEphys Acquisition System</td><td valign="top">OpenEphys, USA</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">OpenEphys GUI</td><td valign="top">OpenEphys, USA</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">EthovisionXT</td><td valign="top">Noldus, NL</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Prism</td><td valign="top">GraphPad, USA</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">GNU Image Manipulation Program</td><td valign="top">GIMP, USA</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">BORIS event logging software</td><td valign="top">BORIS, IT</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experimental and surgical procedures were conducted in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1998) and local ethical review. Adult male Wistar rats (n=56, 250–275 g; Envigo, NL) were housed in the University of Bristol’s Animal Services Unit with cage enrichment (e.g. cardboard tubes and wooden chews) on a reversed light cycle and with food/water provided ad libitum.

To achieve this, opto- and chemogenic actuator proteins were expressed in PrL-P neurons to enable interrogation of the behavioural and neurophysiological consequences of their selective and specific opto-activation and chemo-inhibition. To selectively express actuator proteins in only PrL-P afferents, we used an intersectional, Cre-dependent viral vector approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boender et al., 2014</xref>). Twelve animals were used to develop the intersectional viral vector methodology in vivo. Briefly, Cre-dependent adenoviral vectors encoding ChR2 or the inhibitory DREADD, hM4Di, were delivered to the PrL. To restrict their expression to only those PrL neurons that project to the PAG, we delivered a retrograde canine adenoviral vector (CAV2) that encodes Cre-recombinase to the PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hnasko et al., 2006</xref>). CAV2 gains access to neurons primarily via their synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Soudais et al., 2001</xref>) before being transported retrogradely to the neuronal cell body leading to Cre expression. Thus, Cre-dependent expression of actuator proteins will only occur in those PrL neurons that synapse in the PAG. Control animals had injection of Cre-dependent vectors to the cortex but no CAV-CMV-CRE to the PAG. Without Cre, there should be no expression of actuator proteins allowing the evaluation of off-target effects of CNO (as well as identification of nonspecific expression of actuators). Following the expression of actuator proteins, the effect of selective opto-activation and chemo-inhibition of PrL-P neurons on sensory (n=24) and affective aspects (n=20) of pain-like behaviour was assessed in neuropathic (TNT<sup>PrL-P.ChR2-hM4Di</sup> and TNT<sup>PrL-P.Control</sup>) and uninjured (Naive<sup>PrL-P.ChR2-hM4Di</sup> and Naive<sup>PrL-P.Control</sup>) rats. This investigation used a longitudinal design in which the contribution of PrL-P neurons to pain-like behaviour and nociceptive processing were assessed before and up to 42 days following peripheral nerve injury. Five neuropathic rats were then used in acute spinal electrophysiological experiments to assess the effects of PrL-P neurons on nociceptive processing in the spinal dorsal horn.</p><p>Animals were assigned to experimental groups from different cages and selected at random but with no explicit randomisation protocol.

The tibial nerve contralateral to the transfected PrL-P pathway was exposed and transected before the wound closed. An incision was made from below the hip, parallel to the femur, and toward the knee. The underlying connective tissue was dissected away, and the fascial plane between gluteus superficialis and bicep femoris was dissected to expose the branches of the sciatic nerve. The Tibial nerve was identified and carefully freed from connective tissue. Two ligatures of sterile 5.0 braided silk (Fine Science Tools, Germany) were tightly ligated ∼5 mm apart. The length of nerve between the two sutures was then transected and removed leaving the ligatures in place. The overlying muscle and skin were closed using adsorbable suture.

TNT<sup>PrL-P.ChR2:hM4Di</sup> and TNT<sup>PrL-P.Control</sup> rats were habituated to a three-compartment box with a neutral central compartment connecting two larger conditioning chambers. Chambers differed in their visual and tactile cues (‘bars’ or ‘holes’ for flooring and vertically or horizontally striped wallpaper with equal luminosity) to maximise their differentiation. A Baslar camera (acA1300-60 gm) with a varifocal lens (Computar H3Z4512CS-IR) connected to EthovisionXT (Noldus, NL) was used to record the time rats spent in each compartment. Rats were allowed to freely explore all three compartments for 20 min on day 1 to obtain baseline preference. No rats exhibited excessive chamber bias (&gt;80% total time in a single chamber). After habituation, rats had TNT surgery and 2 days later started conditioning sessions (over 4 days) in which a compartment was paired with CNO (2.5 mg·<underline>kg</underline><sup>−1</sup> i.p.) or vehicle (two sessions each). The chamber–drug pairings and the order in which they were presented were randomised and counterbalanced among animals. For each pairing session, rats received CNO or vehicle and were returned to their home cage for 10 min to prevent any negative association between restraint/injection and conditioning compartment. Rats were then placed in the conditioning compartment for 35 min. A single pairing session was conducted on each of the 4 days to prevent carry over of any CNO effects. Pairing sessions for each rat were conducted at the same time on each day. On the test day, animals were placed in the neutral compartment and allowed to freely explore all three compartments for a total of 20 min and the time spent in each compartment recorded. A ‘preference score’ was calculated by taking the percentage of time spent in the CNO-paired compartment on the test day (relative to the total time spent in all three chambers), normalised by the percentage time spent in the same chamber on pre-test day (relative to total time spent in all three chambers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meda et al., 2019</xref>). Preference scores for CNO- and vehicle-paired chambers were compared within each animal. Preference or aversion to CNO-paired chamber is expected to be influenced by the valence of chemo-inhibition of PrL-P neurons.

Coronal sections were cut at 40 µm using a freezing microtome and left free floating for fluorescent immunohistochemistry or mounted on slides to identify optic fibre tracts and/or injection sites for viral vector delivery using light microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Tissue sections were incubated free floating on a shaking platform with PB containing 0.3% Triton-X100, 5% normal goat serum (Sigma), and primary antibodies to detect EGFP (ab13970, Abcam) or mCherry (5993–100, BioVision) for 24 hr at room temperature. After washing with PB, sections were incubated for 3 hr at room temperature with an appropriate Alexa Fluor secondary antibody. Then, sections were washed before mounting on glass slides in 1% gelatin solution and, once dried, cover slipped using FluroSave reagent (345789; Merck-Millipore, Germany). Sections were imaged on a Leica DM16000 inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with Leica DFC365FX digital camera and LAS-X acquisition software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Transduction mapping</title><p>To create maps of the distribution of transfected neurons within the mPFC, a series of coronal mPFC sections from three animals were manually plotted. Each section was paired to a matching coronal diagram from the Rat Brain Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Paxinos and Watson, 2007</xref>), at ~120 µm intervals (every third section). Using an epiflurescent microscope (Zeiss Axioskop II inverted microscope equipped with a CooLED pE-100 excitation system, filter blocks – red: filter set number 15 [DM 580 nm, BP 546/12 nm, LP 590 nm] and green: filter set number 09 [DM 510 nm, BP 450–490 nm, LP 515 nm]), mCherry+ cells were plotted. The diagrams were digitised into the photo editing software GIMP.2 (Creative Commons), allowing superimposition to create conjunction maps indicating the extent of labelled areas of the mPFC within each cohort. A digital grid was used to divide up the cortical field and the number of positively labelled neurons counted within each 0.2 mm<sup>2</sup> grid from each animal. The consistency of positively labelled neurons within each grid square was represented on a grayscale with black indicating positively labelled cells in all rats and white indicating no cells. To determine the proportion of transfected neurons that co-expressed both ChR2-EYFP and hM4Di-mCherry composite widefield images were taken at 20× magnification of every sixth section in a series of consecutive mPFC section from ~+5.10 to +2.8 mm from bregma and from three experimental animals. From these images, the distribution of EYFP, mCherry, and colocalised neurons were quantified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Drugs</title><p>ClozepineN-Oxide (Tocris, UK) was purchased and made up on the day of use in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted with 0.9% NaCl to a final concentration of 2.5 mg·ml<sup>−1</sup> and 5% DMSO.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Quantification and statistics</title><p>All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 8. All data are presented as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). Sample sizes were calculated using online power calculators with alpha set at 0.05, power &gt;0.9 and using effect sizes and sample variation estimated from previous experience and with reference to literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hughes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drake et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hirschberg et al., 2017</xref>). Student's t-test (paired and unpaired), RM one- and two-way ANOVAs, or mixed model were used to compare groups as appropriate. This mixed model uses a compound symmetry covariance matrix and is fit using restricted maximum likelihood (REML). Sidak’s or Dunnett’s post-test was used for comparisons between multiple groups and where appropriate. The number of replications (n) is the number of data points used in the statistical test that is either the number of animals for behavioural testing or the number of neurons for electrophysiological experiments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Mrs Rachel Bissett for her assistance with histological processing and the Wolfson Bioimaging Facility for their support and assistance with image acquisition.

review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Loss of cortical control over the descending pain modulatory system determines pain state development in rats&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mary Heinricher (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Using optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches, the present paper builds on and extends earlier work by demonstrating that the loss of cortical drive (from prelimbic cortex) to the periacqueductal grey-engaged descending pain modulatory system underpins, at least in part, the expression of neuropathic sensitization after nerve injury. The paper, on the whole, is cogently written and easy to follow, and the analysis of the efficacy of techniques used is thorough.</p><p>However, there are minor concerns that should be addressed in a revised manuscript:</p><p>1) In the Materials and methods section; the authors state &quot;The IR beam intensity was adjusted so that animals withdrew their paws at a latency of ~8s.&quot; Please include whether this intensity was adjusted separately per each animal's response, or if it was averaged across animals, as well as what the absolute value of IR intensity was.</p><p>2) For Figure 3F, &quot;For the contralateral (uninjured) paw PrL-P chemo-inhibition significantly reduced mechanical withdrawal thresholds at day 3 post-TNT from 13.5±0.7 to 9.0±1.4 grams (2Way ANOVA. CNO F(1,30) = 5.77 p=0.02, Sidak's post-test day 3 pre-CNO vs. CNO p=0.03, n=16) but not thereafter (Figure 3F).&quot; – since CNO alone did not reduce withdrawal thresholds in naive animals, please include that this may indicate the effect of injury (and possibly decussating projections) on sensitivity in the contralateral paw.</p><p>3) In the Introduction section, there is a typographical error in the following sentence: &quot;Following expression of actuator (n=24) and affective aspects (n=20) of pain like behaviour in neuropathic (TNT<sup>PrL-P.ChR2-hM4Di</sup> and TNT<sup>PrL-P.Control</sup>) and uninjured (Naive<sup>PrL-P.ChR2-hM4Di</sup> and Naive<sup>PrL-P.Control</sup>) rats.&quot;</p><p>4) The authors provide the numbers of rats that were excluded from each group due to various experimental issues; this is much appreciated. However, a supplementary table or short insert into the text providing the exact number of animals used per group per experimental paradigm would also be very useful for readers.</p><p>5) Discussion, sixth paragraph: revise to “overlooked”.</p><p>6) Can the authors be certain that the presence of an optic fiber in a region adjacent to the PrL (presumably either the ACC or IL), and the resulting mechanical damage or alteration in neuronal activity associated with this, itself had no effect on rat behaviour in the chemo-inhibition experiments? Some discussion of potential off target effects should be included.</p><p>7) The authors state &quot;PrL-P projections extend bilaterally from each hemisphere with the ipsilateral projection bring denser that the contralateral projection (~60 v 40% of total labelled cells from retrograde tracing (Floyd et al., 2000)).&quot; They need to make it clear here which side (i.e. left or right) they are referring to with the term “ipsilateral” (presumably relative to the side of nerve injury but this should be clarified explicitly here and left or right equated to ipsilateral/contralateral.</p><p>8) The authors state in a few places that &quot;Activation of PrL-P neurons produces analgesia in neuropathic rats by inhibition at a spinal level&quot;. The use of the term “analgesia” is usually best reserved for clinical/human studies and might be better replaced with antinociceptive, antiallodynic or antihyperalgesic.</p><p>9) The Discussion is well-written overall. The authors state &quot;it is the loss of cortical drive to the descending pain modulatory system that underpins the expression of neuropathic sensitisation after nerve injury.&quot; I think their results demonstrate that this is likely to be a mechanism that underpins such expression, but their data don't confirm that it is the only mechanism. Thus, the authors should revise/tone down this phraseology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65156.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] There are minor concerns that should be addressed in a revised manuscript:</p><p>1) In the Materials and methods section; the authors state &quot;The IR beam intensity was adjusted so that animals withdrew their paws at a latency of ~8s.&quot; Please include whether this intensity was adjusted separately per each animal's response, or if it was averaged across animals, as well as what the absolute value of IR intensity was.</p></disp-quote><p>The intensity was adjusted for each animal individually and this has now been stated clearly and a mean intensity value ± SEM provided (subsection “Stereotaxic injection/implants”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For Figure 3F, &quot;For the contralateral (uninjured) paw PrL-P chemo-inhibition significantly reduced mechanical withdrawal thresholds at day 3 post-TNT from 13.5±0.7 to 9.0±1.4 grams (2Way ANOVA.

This indicates that nerve injury drives central sensitisation that affects the response to nociceptive inputs from the uninjured paw to produce contralateral hypersensitivity that can be revealed by blockade of the descending modulation of spinal processing originating from the pre-limbic cortex.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the Introduction section, there is a typographical error in the following sentence: &quot;Following expression of actuator (n=24) and affective aspects (n=20) of pain like behaviour in neuropathic (TNT<sup>PrL-P.ChR2-hM4Di</sup> and TNT<sup>PrL-P.Control</sup>) and uninjured (Naive<sup>PrL-P.ChR2-hM4Di</sup> and Naive<sup>PrL-P.Control</sup>) rats.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been corrected:</p><p>“Following expression of actuator proteins, the effect of selective optoactivation and chemoinhibition of PrL-P neurons on sensory (n=24) and affective aspects (n=20) of pain like behaviour was assessed in neuropathic (TNT<sup>PrL-P.ChR2-hM4Di</sup> and TNT<sup>PrL-P.Control</sup>) and uninjured (Naive<sup>PrL-P.ChR2-hM4Di</sup> and Naive<sup>PrL-P.Control</sup>) rats.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors provide the numbers of rats that were excluded from each group due to various experimental issues; this is much appreciated.

[…] Our data demonstrate that rats implanted with tapered optic fibres are still able to exhibit aversive place conditioning indicating that any cortical disruption produced by our fibres does not impact CG1/ACC function relevant our investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors state &quot;PrL-P projections extend bilaterally from each hemisphere with the ipsilateral projection bring denser that the contralateral projection (~60 v 40% of total labelled cells from retrograde tracing (Floyd et al., 2000)).&quot; They need to make it clear here which side (i.e. left or right) they are referring to with the term “ipsilateral” (presumably relative to the side of nerve injury but this should be clarified explicitly here and left or right equated to ipsilateral/contralateral.</p></disp-quote><p>The statement above is accurate and we have attempted to make the text clearer. We transfected the ipsilateral projection between the prelimbic cortex and the periaqueductal grey, and we counterbalanced the experiments by transfecting either the left or right PrL-P and applying stimuli to the ipsilateral or contralateral hind paw. Therefore, experiments conducted in uninjured animals, in which the effects of pathway activation/inhibition on hind paw withdrawal thresholds were determined, ipsilateral and contralateral refers to the hind paw with respect to the side of transfected PrL-P projection. This is clearly stated in the figure panel above the relevant data (Figure 2B and C).</p><p>In TNT animals we again counterbalanced (left and right) and ligated the tibial nerve contralateral to the transfected pathway (as has been done in similar investigations), and this is clearly stated in the relevant Materials and methods section. In experiments conducted in TNT animals ipsilateral and contralateral refer to injured and uninjured paw (as is common in pain literature) and this is clearly stated in the relevant figure panels (Figure 3E-J).</p><p>To further clarify for the reader, we have added in this information earlier in the Materials and methods section to bring all the relevant information together in one place.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors state in a few places that &quot;Activation of PrL-P neurons produces analgesia in neuropathic rats by inhibition at a spinal level&quot;. The use of the term “analgesia” is usually best reserved for clinical/human studies and might be better replaced with antinociceptive, antiallodynic or antihyperalgesic.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the text to the following:</p><p>“Restoration of PrL-P neuronal tone attenuated allodynia in established neuropathic sensitisation.” and “PrL-P produces antinociception in neuropathic pain by inhibition of dorsal horn nociceptive responses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The Discussion is well-written overall.

Thus, the authors should revise/tone down this phraseology.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now revised this statement to the following:</p><p>“We postulate that this cortical – midbrain – spinal network allows executive control of nociception and regulation of pain, and that the loss of cortical drive to the descending pain modulatory system is a major contributor to the expression of neuropathic sensitisation after nerve injury.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
