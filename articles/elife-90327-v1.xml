activated by blue light, whereas blue-shifted ChRs are minimally responsive to longer wavelengths. Here, we took advantage of this feature to create a system which allows high-frequency activation of neurons with pulses of red light, while permitting the suppression of action potentials (APs) with millisecond precision by blue light. We achieved this by pairing an ultrafast red-shifted ChR with a blue light-sensitive anion channel of appropriately matching kinetics. This required screening several anion-selective ChRs, followed by a model-based mutagenesis strategy to optimize their kinetics and light spectra. Slice electrophysiology in the hippocampus as well as behavioral inspection of vibrissa movement demonstrate a minimal excitation from blue light. Of significant potential value, in contrast to existing tools, the system we introduce here allows high-frequency optogenetic excitation of neurons with red light, while blue light suppression of APs is confined within the duration of the light pulse.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>channelrhodopsin</kwd><kwd>mutagenesis</kwd><kwd>membrane channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22736</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nabavi</surname><given-names>Sadegh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Danish Research Institute of Translational Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19958</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nabavi</surname><given-names>Sadegh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001732</institution-id><institution>Danish National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DNRF133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nabavi</surname><given-names>Sadegh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FT160100056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>John Yu-luen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21EY027620</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>John Yu-luen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeck Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R360-2021-650</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>John Yu-luen</given-names></name><name><surname>Nabavi</surname><given-names>Sadegh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeck Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R273-2017-179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>John Yu-luen</given-names></name><name><surname>Nabavi</surname><given-names>Sadegh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeck Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R346-2020-1793</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sørensen</surname><given-names>Andreas Toft</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An optogenetic system capable of precise, high-frequency neuronal excitation using red pulsed light and rapid, millisecond inhibition using blue light.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite the short history of optogenetics, optical manipulation of neuronal activity has become an indispensable tool in the studies for functional analysis of brain circuits. The increasing needs for a more precise temporal and spatial manipulation of the neurons along with the untapped potentials of optogenetics have been driving forces in expanding the repertoire of the optogenetic toolbox. Main development among these expansions is the discovery of opsins of diverse excitation spectra, with the current excitatory opsins showing light sensitivity ranging from near UV to near far-red spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deisseroth and Hegemann, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marshel et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A major concern in the use of opsins with longer excitation spectra is that all opsins, in addition to their own excitation spectral peak, are activated by blue light, a problem known in the field as cross-talk or bleed-through. Attempts to create blue light-insensitive opsins will likely be unsuccessful due to the intrinsic blue absorption by the retinal molecule, the non-encoded chromophore, which captures light energy in channelrhodopsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Waddell et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>There have been several standouts attempts to overcome the problem of cross-talk. One uses a variant of blue-shifted ChR with fast kinetics in combination with a slow kinetics red-shifted ChR (R-ChR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>).The reasoning is that short pulses of blue light will activate only fast ChR. Since it requires a tight regulation of the protein expression as well as the light intensity, this method has not been adopted for in vivo application. Another approach is to expose axons expressing an R-ChR to prolonged photostimulation, during which axons become unresponsive to light pulses and cease to fire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hooks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Faress et al., 2024</xref>). This method is limited to axonal regions as prolonged optical stimulation of the soma induces trains of action potentials (APs). Additionally, prolonged stimulation of the axons of neurons with slow spike-frequency adaptation, such as fast-spiking interneurons, may result in repetitive activity rather than depolarization block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hooks et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A potential solution to the problem of cross-talk is to co-express a blue-shifted anion channelrhodopsin (B-ACR) along with the R-ChR to ‘suppress’ the excitation of R-ChR by blue light. The intention is to have a neuron co-expressing such opsins selectively produce APs to red light and not blue light. A recent study achieved this, by pairing GtACR2 and Chrimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vierock et al., 2021</xref>). Due to its relatively slow kinetics, this system is more suitable for optical manipulation of lower frequency stimulation. Additionally, optical activation of these opsins, which have a long opening lifetime, may elevate the concentration of intracellular ions with unintended physiological complications (see Discussion).</p><p>For these reasons, we created a system with fast closing kinetics. We chose vfChrimson – currently the fastest R-ChR – to gain precise temporal control of red-light excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mager et al., 2018</xref>). To generate a B-ACR with vfChrimson matching kinetics we used a model-based mutagenesis approach to modify the kinetic properties of ZipACR, an ultrafast blue light-activated chloride channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Govorunova et al., 2017</xref>). It must be noted that due to the high intracellular chloride concentration in the axonal terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Turecek and Trussell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Messier et al., 2018</xref>) the use of a chloride channel-based expression system must be restricted to the somato-dendritic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mahn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Messier et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We describe several variants of ZipACR, focusing on two, I151T and I151V, which display appropriate kinetics, light spectra, and photocurrent magnitudes for the purposes of our co-expressing system. We then paired the optimized anion channels with a membrane-trafficking optimized vfChrimson (IvfChr) in a single expression unit. The new system, Zip-IvfChr, when expressed in neurons, can drive time-locked high-frequency APs in response to red pulses (635 nm). On the other hand, in response to blue pulses (470 nm), Zip-IvfChr produces no APs.</p><p>As expected, blue light pulses transiently suppress APs in Zip-IvfChr-expressing neurons, but the suppression is fully reversed within 5 ms after termination of light pulses due to the use of fast ZipACR mutants. When tested in the facial motor nucleus in the brainstem, Zip-IvfChr activation by red but not blue light triggered vibrissa movement of large amplitudes. Due to its high temporal precision of activation and suppression, this tool could be further developed for independent optical excitation of distinct neural populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The strategy to reduce blue light-mediated excitation by red-shifted channelrhodopsins</title><p>We initially tested our strategy using existing variants of excitatory and inhibitory channelrhodopsin. The channelrhodopsin Chrimson and its variants have the most red-shifted spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>), and their response to 470 nm has a slower on-rate compared to the 590 nm light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A , B</xref>). Despite this, 470 nm light is equally effective in inducing APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To overcome this limitation, we decided to take advantage of blue light-gated inhibitory chloride channels which effectively block AP upon exposure to blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Govorunova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Govorunova et al., 2017</xref>). By co-expressing the B-ACR variant GtACR2, along with a Chrimson variant, photostimulation of targeted neurons by red light would be expected to only activate R-ChR, which causes photoactivation of these neurons. Blue light, however, activates R-ChR as well as GtACR2. This allows the chloride channel to induce shunting inhibition of the neurons which in turn would be expected to prevent firing of the neurons by blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reducing blue light-mediated excitation in red-shifted channelrhodopsins – proof of concept.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the approach. A red-shifted channelrhodopsin (R-ChR) is co-expressed with a blue-shifted anion channel (B-ACR). When red light is ON, there is an overall excitation of the cell due to the more dominant R-ChR response. When blue light is ON, the shunting inhibitory effect of B-ACR reduces the excitation induced by R-ChR to blue light.

We created this system by pairing a B-ACR with the ultrafast red-shifted ChR, IvfChr. This requires the B-ACR to have a significantly larger photocurrent compared to R-ChR as well as a faster channel opening and slightly slower channel closing. As we discuss later, we considered anion channels with slow decay of inhibition are not suited for many experimental manipulations of long duration. For this reason, we chose ZipACR, currently the fastest B-ACR, as the template for further modifications. Based on our homology modeling and multiple alignments with the kinetically slower B-ACRs, GtACR1, and GtACR2, we identified potential residue replacements within the putative retinal binding pocket which would result in slightly slower kinetics without impairing the channel function.</p><p>To our surprise, many mutations of ZipACR around the all-trans retinal do not alter the channel properties or compromise channel conductance very strongly. This is contrary to our past experiences with channelrhodopsins where conductance is highly sensitive to mutations around the retinal binding pocket (data not shown). ZipACR double mutants appear to have more compromised conductance or altered properties. Among the tested positions, the I151 residue appears to have significant influences in kinetics and spectral properties. Indeed, we found that two variants, Zip(151T) and Zip(151V), have properties optimal for our purpose. More specifically, the channels off-rate kinetics have the desirable property of being slightly but sufficiently slower than IvfChr without compromising the opening rate, photocurrent and light spectrum. Thus, when paired with IvfChr, they prevent AP induction by blue light, without interfering with red light-induced high frequency neural spiking.</p><p>Of the two variants, we observed Zip(151T), and consequently ZipT-IvfChr, to be more consistent in blocking blue light-induced APs, which could be explained by its slightly slower closing rate. Although Zip(151T) is the more red shifted of the two, within the tested range of light intensities and expression, only rarely did we observe a block of APs at 635 nm. However, we do not recommend the use of orange light pulses with ZipT-IvfChr, as we observed a significant photocurrent in this wavelength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D1, D2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Comparing the ZipV-IvfChr and the ZipT-IvfChr constructs, we would recommend users to use the ZipT-IvfChr for most general experiments if fast light source with wavelength &gt;600 nm is available given the reduced probability of neuronal spiking at the end of blue light pulse. The ZipV-IvfChr system is faster in kinetics and is suitable in situation where kinetics is critical but there is some tolerance in spiking at the end of blue light pulse in some neurons.</p><p>A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vierock et al., 2021</xref>) proposed an R-ChR expression system by relying on the pairing between GtACR2 and Chrimson, as we did in our early stage work with <italic>Drosophila</italic>. For experimental reasons linked to controlling neuronal physiology, the priority we set was to create a system with fast closing kinetics to minimize any physiological disruption after the termination of light illumination. All channelrhodopsins have the potentials to alter osmotic balance, ion gradient and pH of small neuronal compartments and this is exacerbated by long light pulses and prolonged channel opening. This can be problematic in long-term neuroplasticity experiments. Cationic channelrhodopsins are known to conduct calcium ions, long opening can evoke significant elevation of intracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lin et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lin et al., 2009</xref>) and potentially activate second messenger pathways.</p><p>The alteration of pH, osmotic balance, and ion gradient (either directly or secondary to elevated transporter activity) applies to both cationic and anionic channelrhodopsins and can have unpredictable biological consequences. Hence, channelrhodopsins with rapid kinetics such as the ones used in our system and brief stimulation light pulses are more ideal for experiments where neuronal or synaptic plasticity are of importance. We were able to demonstrate that neurons expressing ZipT-IvfChr can recover from this inhibition within 5 ms after light termination and ZipV-IvfChr recovers almost instantaneously. If we model our results to a B-ACR with slower kinetics such as GtACR2 used in BiPOLES, we could expect the inhibitory effects of blue light to last up to 10–20 ms. This could disrupt normal neuronal physiology and signal processing that occurs in millisecond time scale, as well as alter intracellular ion concentrations which may lead to short- and long-term alteration in physiology.</p><p>From an experimental viewpoint, a fast photostimulation system has the flexibility to perform a wide range of optical manipulations. Ultimately, ZipT-IvfChr and ZipV-IvfChr will allow dual optical activation of segregated groups of neurons when co-expressed with a fast blue-shifted channelrhodopsin such as oChIEF in the same brain region. In these experiments, it is critical to minimize the blue light-mediated inhibition due to possible disruption of responses resulting from local monosynaptic connection that may have important modulatory effects on postsynaptic cells. Spike-timing-dependent experiments requiring high temporal precision would be one of the experiments that would benefit from our system. Blue light-activated cationic channelrhodopsin such as oChIEF can be expressed presynaptically to control neurotransmitter release and ZipV/T-IvfChr can be expressed postsynaptically to control spiking to induce long-term potentiation or long-term depression.</p><p>In cortical experiments, blue cationic channelrhodopsin and ZipV/T-IvChr can be expressed in projection neurons and interneurons to study the effects of excitation/inhibition balance in cortical processing of information or decision making. In the striatum, the independent control of neurons of direct and indirect pathways would benefit from the dual wavelength manipulation. Many of these experiments would require the use of retrograde AAV, cell-type-specific enhancer/promoter or transgenic animals with defined driver line. Although ZipV/T-IvfChr can theoretically be used with single-photon jGCaMP imaging, this would require blue light illumination with duration greater than several milliseconds which will lead to prolonged inhibition of ZipV/T-IvfChr-expressing neurons.</p><p>The main limitation of our current approach is that there is limited control of the IvfChr and ZipV/T expression. Although the 2A approach should achieve better translation ratio compared to the use of IRES, the levels of respective proteins would also depend on the amount of protein degradation and the fraction of channelrhodopsins that failed to fold or incorporate the retinal chromophore correctly. This can vary with different neurons in different regions. Therefore, similar to other optogenetic systems, it is important for the users of our system to validate the approach in their cells of interest before commencing behavioral experiments.</p><p>There can also be situations where dual virus delivery would be preferable compared to bicistronic expression cassette. As shown in our testing, the tethered-tandem expression system used in BiPOLES reduces the photocurrent of vfChrimson compared to our IvfChr, possibly associated with hindered membrane trafficking. Given the reduced conductance of vfChrimson compared to Chrimson, a BiPOLES-based tethered-tandem expression system is also not ideal. The development of an improved tunable dual expression system would therefore be beneficial for the neuroscientific community. Ultimately, the co-expression strategy remains a temporary solution to the spectral cross-talk of opsins and the development of a true spectrally narrow channelrhodopsin would still be the preferred solution. However, whether this is achievable due to the chemical properties of the retinal chromophore is questionable.</p><p>Before concluding, we must note that our approach, which acts based on chloride flux, is unlikely to be suitable for axonal terminal inactivation, where the intracellular chloride concentration is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mahn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mahn et al., 2018</xref>). Potassium-selective channelrhodopsins, having a hyperpolarized reversal potential in all cellular compartments, may appear better positioned for our purpose. However, as we show in our characterizations, none of the wild-type variants would be optimal for the pairing kinetically. WiChR is kinetically too slow but is the most potent inhibitor. HcKCR1 has strong desensitization, is kinetically too slow and spectrally too red shifted. HcKCR2 is the least potassium selective but is spectrally and kinetically closest to the ideal candidate of the three. Overall, further engineering and modification would still be required to identify the ideal mutants for the pairing similar to what we have done with ZipACR in this study.</p><p>At present, for axonal or terminal stimulation, the prior published approaches utilizing differential kinetics and light sensitivity of the opsins or optical manipulation combined with synaptic release properties would still be the preferred options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hooks et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, we refer our readers to a recent work, where we demonstrate effective independent dual optical activation of converging axons, electrophysiologically as well as behaviorally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Faress et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, the system introduced here complements these studies that are unsuitable for somatic photoactivation. This permits researchers to choose complementary methods based on their experimental needs.

In the experiment comparing the IvfChr-citrine photocurrent to the 2A configuration, cells were clamped at –40 mV to reduce the influence of ZipACR response with IvfChr photocurrent.

For potassium-selective ChR recordings, only the K-gluconate-based intracellular solution was used.</p><p>For imaging the expression pattern of channelrhodopsin-expressing HEK 293 cells, cells on coverslips were imaged with an Olympus BX51 equipped with a 40× water immersion objective and a Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4.0LT sCMOS camera and X-cite LED110 light source. Images were acquired using Micromanager 1.4 with no gain and no electron multiplication and exposure time of 250 ms. Citrine and EYFP expression were imaged with a GFP filter cube (Semrock, FF02-470/30 excitation, FF01-520/35 emission and FF495-Di03 dichroic) and tdTomato was imaged with a TRITC filter cube Semrock, FF01-543/22 excitation, FF01-593/40 emission and FF562-Di03 dichroic.

An identical filter set was used as in the Olympus BX51 microscope. Images were acquired using Micromanager 1.4 with no gain and no electron multiplication and exposure time of 250 ms.</p><p>For most channelrhodopsin stimulation experiments 10 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> of 470 and 590 nm stimulation lights from Thorlabs 4 channel LED light source (LED4D118) was delivered to the specimen plane.

In the spectral response experiment, a Sutter VF-5 system with a smart shutter in the neutral density mode was used to achieve cross spectrum stimulation at the same photon flux at 1.586 × 1.015 photons/s/mm<sup>2</sup> (25.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> at 400 nm and 15.4 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> at 650 nm) between 400 and 650 nm (25 nm increments). The VF-5 has the following filters and bandwidth settings: 451–398 nm with 15 nm bandwidth, 503–446 nm with 15 nm bandwidth, 564–498 nm with 14 nm bandwidth, 632–557 nm with 14 nm bandwidth, and 703–627 nm with 13 nm bandwidth. A second Sutter shutter was placed in the light path before the light guide to control the light output. For experiments with ACRs, a 15-s interval was used between stimulation episodes. For ChrimsonR/IvfChr stimulation, stimulation light pulses either have 15-s intervals between stimulation episodes (no preconditioning) or a 15-s interval – 1 s 405 nm light pulse – 15-s interval stimulation pattern for reconditioning of the protein with 405 nm before the subsequent stimulation.

The citrine fluorescence was acquired with a 488-nm laser excitation and 500–550 emission. mCherry images were acquired with a 594-nm laser excitation and 600–700 nm emission. For the analysis, single in-focus z-planes where the membrane boundaries were clearly defined were used. A straight line was drawn across the cell between 2 membrane boundaries devoid of the nucleus.

From that moment, all the steps were performed in a laminar flow tissue culture hood using sterile equipment and in total asepsis. The brain was poured into a petri dish filled with the low sodium ACSF solution for hippocampus dissection under microscope guidance (Stereomicroscope, Olympus x1 objective). After extraction, the hippocampi were sliced at 400 µm thickness using an automatic tissue chopper (McILWAIN) and moved to a dish with pre-heated culture medium containing MEM Eagle medium 78.8% (Gibco), 20% heat-inactivated horse serum (Gibco), 1 mM <sc>L</sc>-glutamine, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 170 nM insulin, 0.0012% ascorbic acid, 12.9 mM <sc>D</sc>-glucose, 5.2 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 300 mM HEPES (Sigma), pH = 7.2–7.3, osmolarity adjusted to 315–325. The slices with intact DG and CA regions were then transferred onto air-fluid interface-style Milli-cell culture inserts (Millipore) in 6-well culture plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 800 µl of sterile medium added below each insert. The slices were kept in a sterile incubator at 37°C degrees with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (Thermo Scientific, Steri-cycle i-160).

The injections were done under a microscope using a Picospitzer III (Parker) connected to a Pulse Pal (10 ms pulse, every 0.5 s). In the process of evaluating the R-ChR expression system in vivo, we noticed variability in the performance between batches from different virus sources. Although we adjusted for the nominal titers given by the providers, some batches produced toxicity while others fared well (data not shown). Therefore, the titers should not be taken as face value, and each batch must be tested in the region of interest before proceeding with the experiment. This concern applicable to any viral expression system has an added complication here. Higher titers, in addition to toxicity, may lead to the leakage of the soma-targeted channels expression in the terminals, which may cause unintended consequences.

To do this, they screen some red light-excitatory/blue light-inhibitory opsin pairs to find ones that are spectrally and temporally matched. They first show that this works with Chrimson and GtACR2, however, they expand their search after finding that the tau-off (inactivation after light cessation) kinetics of these two opsins are not well-matched. They directly examine a small set of options based on a literature search and settle on a variant of red light-excitatory Chrimson and blue light-inhibitory ZipACR. To even more closely match the kinetics of this pair, the authors create a structure homology model of the ZipACR retinal binding pocket and use this to guide generation of a small mutant panel, leading to a more optimized ZipACR mutant. They then show that a bicistronically expressed fusion arrangement of these opsins, plus some functional peptides, can drive action potentials up to 20hz with red light and does not do so with blue light, in hippocampal cells transduced by AAV. They also show function in vivo, in a mouse, using a physiological readout. They conclude that their new tool may be useful for complex experimental designs requiring multiple optical channels for write-in/read-out.</p><p>The major advantage claimed by the authors over existing tools is the temporal time-locking of their inhibitory opsin - this is driven by the contrast between tau-off kinetics of their ZipACR variant compared to gtACR2, which is used by the leading competitor tool (BiPOLES).</p><p>Big thoughts</p><p>While the authors were carefully thoughtful about the potential influence of temporal kinetics on the efficiency of a tool such as this one, there were no experiments conducted that make use of the unique properties of this molecular strategy (although the authors state that these experiments are now underway in their lab). They share some examples of how the tool could be useful in the discussion. Where do I think this could be useful?</p><p>First, experimental designs that require multiple optical channels of control. This appears to be aligned with the author's thoughts, as they state, correctly, that opsins utilizing retinal as a light-sensing chromophore are universally activated by blue light (the so-called 'blue shoulder'). Therefore, their tool may be useful for stimulating multiple populations using a blue excitatory opsin in neuron A and their tool for red excitation of neuron B - or, in the author's own words, &quot;A potential solution to the problem of cross-talk...&quot;. In this manuscript, the authors provide state that there this is possible in theory and that there are no obvious reasons that it would not work, but do not present data that showcases their new tool for this purpose (e.g. Vierock, Johannes, et al. &quot;BiPOLES is an optogenetic tool developed for bidirectional dual-color control of neurons.&quot; Nature communications 12.1 (2021): 4527. Figure 4f-I; 6). The same set-up could be imagined for green GECI (or equivalent) imaging of cells in the same volume that their tool is being used in - for instance, interleaving red stimulation light and blue imaging light, (perhaps) without the typical concern of imaging light bleed-through activating the opsin itself. I agree that it will likely work for multi-channel control, but only time will tell, at this point.</p><p>Second, for high-frequency temporal control over both excitation and inhibition in the same neuron. Red light turns the cell on, and blue light turns the cell off (see, for instance, Zhang, Feng, et al. &quot;Multimodal fast optical interrogation of neural circuitry.&quot; Nature 446.7136 (2007): 633-639. Figure 2; Vierock as above, Figure 4a,b). Again, here the authors are long on theory (&quot;The new system...can drive time-locked high-frequency action potentials in response to red pulses&quot;) and short on explicit data. While they do show that red light = excitation and blue light = inhibition, they neither show (1) all-optical on/off modulation of the same cell; nor (2) high-frequency inhibition or excitation (max stim rate of 20hz, which is the same as the BiPOLES paper used for their LC stimulation paradigm; Vierock, as above, Figure 7a-d). They did provide a response to this critique that data showing excitation and inhibition spread across multiple panels were largely collected from the same cells.</p><p>Despite these major shortcomings, the further development and characterization of tandem opsins, such as this one, is of interest to the community. There is on-going work by the BiPOLES team to create new iterations (e.g. Wahid, J., et al. &quot;P-15 BiPOLES2 is a bidirectional optogenetic tool with a narrow activation spectrum and low red-light excitability.&quot; Clinical Neurophysiology 148 (2023): e16.). The authors have collected a substantial amount of additional data along the course of review and, even aside from the final tool, the overall data and approaches shown are useful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90327.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mermet-Joret</surname><given-names>Noëmie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Aarhus University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aahrus</named-content></addr-line><country>Denmark</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Moreno</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Aarhus</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aahrus</named-content></addr-line><country>Denmark</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zbela</surname><given-names>Agnieszka</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Tasmania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hobart</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nazari</surname><given-names>Milad</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Aarhus University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aahrus</named-content></addr-line><country>Denmark</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ellendersen</surname><given-names>Bárður Eyjólfsson</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Aarhus University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aahrus</named-content></addr-line><country>Denmark</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Baro</surname><given-names>Raquel Comaposada</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Copenhagen</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Copenhagen</named-content></addr-line><country>Denmark</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Krauth</surname><given-names>Nathalie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Copenhagen</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Copenhagen</named-content></addr-line><country>Denmark</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>von Philipsborn</surname><given-names>Anne C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Fribourg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Fribourg</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sørensen</surname><given-names>Andreas Toft</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Copenhagen</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Copenhagen</named-content></addr-line><country>Denmark</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Piriz</surname><given-names>Joaquin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Universidad de Buenos Aires -

However, the suppression of blue-light excitation of ZipV/T-IvfChr-expressing neurons strongly suggests this can be used in experiments exciting populations of neurons similarly shown for BiPOLES. We don’t see a theoretical basis where this experiment cannot be done if sufficient cell targeting mechanisms (such as the use of cre-lox or retroAAV) is utilized. We have started several projects pursuing these utilities in the meantime.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While they do show that red light = excitation and blue light = inhibition, they neither show (1) all-optical on/off modulation of the same cell; nor (2) high-frequency inhibition or excitation (max stim rate of 20hz, which is the same as the BiPOLES paper used for their LC stimulation paradigm; Vierock, as above, Figure 7a-d).</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding point 1, we understand that the reviewer asks if we have optically excited (with red light) and inhibited (with blue light) the same neurons. If so, figure 4B1 (optical excitation of ZipT-IvfCh with red light) and figure 5A (optical inhibition of ZipT-IvfCh with blue light) represent largely the same set of neurons.</p><p>Regarding point 2, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer’s interpretation of Figure 7a-d in Vierock et al. As we understand, in this part the authors apply a 20 Hz optical stimulation protocol to the LC neurons in vivo. However, there is no data showing that individual neurons do follow this stimulation protocol. To be clear, we are not saying that BiPOLES cannot drive 20 Hz APs. Very likely it can. It is based on ChrimsonR which is capable of doing so (Klapoetke et al., Figure 2). Although, in this manuscript we have not shown data for optical stimulation above 20Hz, our system is based on vfChrimson, which is known to drive AP of 100Hz and above (Mager et al., figure 2 and 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>…</italic> they must revise the manuscript to show that their approach is both (1) different in some way when compared to BiPOLES (it is my understanding that they did not do this, as per the supplementary alignment of the BiPOLES sequence and the sequence of the BiPOLES-like construct that they did test) and (2) that the properties that the investigators specifically tailored their construct to have confer some sort of experimental advantage when compared to the existing standard.</p></disp-quote><p>In the latest version of the manuscript, we have compared our ZipV-IvfChr and the BiPOLES construct adapted with vfChrimson (Fig. 2 Suppl 1). The mean photocurrent amplitude of IvfChr in the ZipV-IvfChr construct is ~2.7 x higher than BiPOLES adapted with vfChrimson (14 randomly selected HEK293 cells in each group) (Fig. 2 Suppl 1B). We conducted this experiment in HEK293 cells to ensure accurate voltage-clamping and less biased cell selection. Even adjusting for the smaller photocurrent of vfChrimson vs ChrimsonR, this would still translate to ~1.6 x greater photocurrent with ZipV-IvfChr compared to the original BiPOLES utilizing ChrimsonR. We believe the increased efficiency of excitation is an important aspect of adapting vfChrimson for red-light excitation of neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) In the Introduction or Discussion, the authors could better motivate the need for a red-shifted actuator that lacks blue crosstalk, by giving some specific examples of how the tool could be productively used, e.g. pairing with another blue-shifted excitatory opsin in a different population, or pairing with a GFP-based fluorescent indicator, e.g. GCaMP. The motivation for the current tool is not obvious to non-experts.</p></disp-quote><p>In the discussion, we now provided examples for potential use of the tool. For example, one of the key aspects that can be manipulated by the existing tool is the induction of spike-timing dependent plasticity with 2 wavelengths of light with blue light channelrhodopsin such as oChIEF is used to evoke presynaptic release and ZipT-IvfChr expressed in postsynaptic neuron. In this situation, the rapid termination of inhibitory response is critical so it does not interfere with the induction of LTP or LTD. Another experiment is the alternate control of projection neurons and interneurons in cortical areas, independent controls of neurons of direct and indirect pathways in the striatum to manipulate behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Simultaneous excitation and inhibition are not the same as non-excitation. The authors mentioned shunting briefly. Another possible issue is changes in osmotic balance. Activation of a Na+ channel and a Cl- channel will lead to net import of NaCl into the cell, possibly changing osmotic pressure. Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the notion that osmotic, ionic and pH changes in small neuronal structure can be disruptive to the physiology and this is the reason we developed our approach where the fastest channelrhodopsins are used so we can minimize the channel opening time and the flux of ions through the channels when brief light illuminations are applied. Not only the flux of protons, sodium ions and calcium ions are minimized, the flux of chloride should be minimal as well (as the membrane potential should be close to the reversal potential of chloride reversal potential hence low ion flow). Hence our approach should be minimally disruptive compared to most other existing channelrhodopsin-based approaches when short or minimal light pulses were used in conjunction with our tools. This recommendation is included in the updated manuscript .</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors showed that in ZipT-IvfChr, orange light drives excitation and blue light does not. But what about simultaneous blue and orange light? Can the blue light overwhelm the effect of the orange light? Since the stated goal is to open the blue part of the spectrum for other applications, one is now worried about &quot;negative&quot; crosstalk. Please discuss and, ideally, characterize this phenomenon.</p></disp-quote><p>We now have performed this experiment. Simultaneous blue (470nm) and red light (635nm) stimulation does not produce AP (Fig .4 Suppl 1A). This suggests the inhibitory effect of ACR is more efficient than the excitatory effects of IvfChr due to their higher conductance, this re-emphasizes the rapid termination of the ACR effects is critical for minimal disruption of physiological effects in such pairing strategy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3.1) Does the use of the new tool require careful balancing of the expression levels of the ZipT and the IvfChr? Does it require careful balancing of blue and orange light intensities?</p></disp-quote><p>As with any optogenetic tool, the users should validate the efficacy of the tool in their own system. Our tool solely relies on the balanced expression of the 2A system, the efficiency of the two opsins and their degradation of the time-span of expression. These aspects of the tool would be better addressed in future versions of the tools or improvement of the BiPOLES-type of tandem expression in subsequent versions. From the instrumentation side, the light intensity and differential penetration depth requires careful consideration. However, this holds true in most optogenetic and fluorescence imaging-based approaches as well. In the current update of the manuscript, we have included further discussion on these aspects as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3.2) Also, many opsins show complex and nonlinear responses to dual-wavelength illumination, so each component should be characterized individually under simultaneous blue + orange light.</p></disp-quote><p>We now have performed this experiment (please see our comment to point 3)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3.3) I was expecting to see photocurrents at different holding potentials as a function of illumination wavelength for the coexpressed construct (i.e. to see at what wavelength it switches from being excitatory to inhibitory); and also to see I-V curves of the photocurrent at blue and orange wavelengths for the co-expressed constructs (i.e. to see the reversal potential under blue excitation). Overall, the patch clamp and spectroscopic characterization of the individual constructs was stronger than that of the combined constructs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the IV curves for the co-expressed construct at different holding potentials for 470nm and 635nm wavelengths. This shows reverse potential for the two wavelengths that are intended for in vitro and in vivo applications. Performing a similar experiment for a variety of wavelengths would not be as valuable, in part, due to the enormous amount of data generated. As we have shown in the study, the response of any channelrhodopsins vary with different light duration and light intensities in addition to the wavelengths and holding potentials. The results for each recorded cell could include stimulation by different wavelengths, stimulation by different illumination intensities, stimulation with different light duration in addition to different holding potentials. Not only would the results be highly variable from cell-to-cell, there will be potentially hundreds or thousands of combinations to be tested per cell (e.g., 5 light intensities @1, 2.5 , 5 , 10 and 20 mW/mm&gt;sup&gt;2, 8 different wavelengths @ 450nm, 475nm, 500nm, 525nm, 550nm, 575nm, 600nm and 625nm, 7 light durations @ 1ms, 5ms, 10ms, 50ms, 100ms, 500ms and 1s, and , and 6 holding potentials @ -80mV, -70mV, -60mV, -40mV, -20mV and 0mV would result in 1680 stimulation conditions per recorded cell).Technically, the significant lowering of membrane resistance when both IvfChr and ZipACR variants are activated simultaneously would compromise the quality of voltage-clamping even in HEK293 cells with series resistance compensation. We have yet to see any other studies that had included such ambitious electrophysiology experiment for the channelrhodopsin characterization, likely due to the feasibility of such experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) The enhanced vf-Chrimson could potentially be a highlight of the manuscript, serving broader applications. Yet, gauging the overall improvements of ivf-Chrimson in comparison to other Chrimson variants remains intricate due to several reasons. First, photocurrents from ivf-Chrimson seem smaller than those from C-Chrimson (Supplemental Figure 3), and a direct comparison with standard vf-Chrimson is absent.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s positive view of our modified variant. We did not emphasize this particular modification as it was identical to our previous published modification and similar to that previously published by others (CsChrimson and C1Chrimson). In all these cases, improved membrane expression was consistently detected. We believe that expression data and our comparison of C-Chrimson and IvfChr is sufficient to justify the improved membrane expression and function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, while membrane expression of ivf-Chrimson appears enhanced in provided brightfield recordings, the quantitative analysis would necessitate confocal microscopy and a membrane marker (Supplemental Figure)</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified the results with a membrane palmitoylated mCherry using confocal microscopy shown in Fig 2 Suppl1 A. We measured the Pearson Correlation Coefficient of the mCherry with EGFP or Citrine signal for the 6 constructs (vfChrimson, vfChrimson with trafficking sequence, vfChrimson with N-terminal signaling peptide from oChIEF (C-vfChrimson), vfChrimson with trafficking sequence and N-terminal signaling peptide from oChIEF (IvfChr), BiPOLES with EGFP or citrine and vfChrimson) and the results were identical and consistent with the prior results using epifluorescence microscopy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Finally, other N-terminal modified Chrimson variants, like CsChrimson by Klapoetke et al. in 2014 and C1Chrimson by Oda et al. in 2018, have been generated. Comparing ivf-Chrimson to vf-CsChrimson or vf-C1Chrimson would be important to evaluate the benefits of the applied N-terminal modification.</p></disp-quote><p>Our development of IvfChrimson is similar to the approach of vf-CsChrimson and identical to that of vf-C1Chrimson and we do not claim these modifications to be unique or superior. However, we have developed our design independently of these other studies and we have more extensive functional comparison and characterization data of our IvfChrimson variant than the other studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2.1) The action spectra of ZipACR suggest peak absorption of ZipACR WT and its mutant at 525 - 550 nm (Fig. 3). This is even further red-shifted than previously reported by Govorunova et al. Further action spectra recordings differ for all constructs between recordings initiated with blue or red light (Supplementary Fig. 5). This discrepancy is unexpected and should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment, this was a mistake in the traces used for the figure. The example traces were the spectral response measured from the 400 nm to 650 nm instead of the 650 nm to 400 nm order shown in the spectral data. This has now been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the representative photocurrents of Zip(151V) in Fig. 3D1 do not align with the corresponding action spectrum in Fig. 3D2 as they show maximal photocurrents for 400 nm excitation.</p></disp-quote><p>Please, see point above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors introduce two different bicistronic expression cassettes-ZipT-IvfChR and ZipV-IvfChR-without providing clear guidelines on their conditions of use. Although the authors assert that ZipT is slower and further red-shifted than ZipV, the differences in the data for both ACR mutants are small and the benefits of the different final constructs should be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>In our testing in neurons, ZipT has less ‘escaped’ spikes after the termination of the light pulses in the cells we have tested. However, this is dependent on the membrane properties such as capacitance and resistance of the cells. ZipV has a faster termination time and in some situations may be necessary due to its faster termination time and reduced disruption of physiological processes.</p><p>We have now included this discussion in our updated manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The ZipT/V-IvfChRs are designed as bicistronic constructs; yet, disparities in membrane trafficking and protein degradation between the two channels could lead to divergences in blue and red light photoresponses. For future applicants, understanding the extent of expression ratio variations across cells using the presented expression cassettes could be of significance and should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We now have included this discussion in our responses above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The Figure 1a mV cartoon traces for chloride are confusing.

It looks to me like the current turns inward about half-way through the light pulse and then becomes even stronger after the light turns off. That is also consistent with the CC traces, which appear to show a transition toward depolarization during the light pulse before the AP initiation at light offset.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the reviewer's observation is correct. There are blue light-induced outward and inward current peaks at the onset and offset of the light. Accordingly, we have modified the phrasing for Fig. 2C2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 3D1 shows that Zip(151V) has a peak current at 400nm, with a steady increase in current from red to blue, however, this is not the case in the summary data in 3D2.

This is described in the legend as &quot;high frequency&quot;. Maybe the cart came before the horse in this figure...as it looks like in panel C that using less light power density improves fidelity in the dual opsin configuration with red light stimulation...why not use that power for the characterization? Did you try any higher frequencies? Or longer pulse widths? This is an important characterization to inform further use of the tool. This shortcoming isn't a cell-intrinsic limitation, as the 470nm stim with IVfChr was 100% successful at both 10hz and 20hz.</p></disp-quote><p>It is known that red but not blue light pulses induce desensitization (optical fatigue) in red-shifted ChR variants. Indeed, one can reinstate the response to red light, by giving violet-blue light pulses (Fig 4. Suppl 2). We think this is the reason that the 470nm stimulation was more effective in inducing AP in cells expressing IvfChR. Higher light intensities induce greater desensitization, but are preferred for faster opening of channels and depolarization of neurons. This can explain why, in some situations, lower light intensities were more effective in producing APs when pulse trains were used. We have recordings from cells firing APs at 40Hz (not included). All these cells had high expression levels of the opsin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Figure 4D: why use 100ms pulse width? How do you know that this isn't causing depol block? Or some of the nefarious concerns that are raised in the discussion, such as &quot;...disrupt[ion of] normal neuronal physiology and signal processing that occurs in millisecond time scale&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We used 100ms pulse duration to follow the published protocol that this experiment is based on (Lin et al., 2013, Nature Neuroscience).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Figure 4E-bottom: What is the blue peak at light onset? Is the tool driving early activation before silencing?</p></disp-quote><p>There seems to be an early, sharp and brief activation by blue light. We don’t know the definite cause of this, but we speculate this is driven by blue-light activation of ZipACR and not the IvfChr portion of the construct. The reason is that such a sharp rise is absent when only IvfChr is expressed (Fig. 4E, upper panel). Soma-targeted motif tethered to channelrhodopsins is known to result in preferential expression of channels close to soma but does not exclude the expression of channelrhodopsin in axonal and dendritic compartments, especially when animals are allow to recover for long period of time after viral injection. We believe that ZipACR at axonal terminals where the chloride concentration is high can still cause blue-light evoked depolarization and transmitter release. We observed this phenomenon in two mice in their first trial. The data for individual trials for each mouse are included in a supplementary table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Figure 4G: Earlier in this same figure (B2, C), 470nm light was more effective at stimulating IvfChr than 635nm light. Is it unexpected that 638nm light would in this in vivo context be more effective at driving IvfChr responses than 450 nm light (at least as reflected by the AUC measurements)? Does this reflect fiber placement and light penetration/scattering?</p></disp-quote><p>The spectral peaks of Chrimson-based variants including vfChrimson are all centered around 600 nm, and at 635 / 638 nm light, the amplitudes of photo-response decline, the channel onset slows, and the channels suffer greater desensitization. In isolated preparations where the light penetration is similar between 635 / 638 nm and 470 nm, 470 nm responses can outperform 635 / 638 nm responses due to its lack of desensitization and higher consistency in its response. This is also a strong reason that we have developed our current approach. In <italic>in vivo</italic> preparation shown in Fig. 4D-G, the much higher tissue penetration of 638nm light due to reduced absorption and reduced scattering can offset the performance of IvfChr to 450 nm light.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) In the methods, it is noted that different viral batches appear to generate different levels of neuronal toxicity. If that is the case, how did you differentiate between true differences between constructs vs. differential cell health effects?</p></disp-quote><p>For figure 4D-F (whisker movement), we determined virus toxicity using NeuN staining. In slice recordings, we used the electrophysiological property of the neurons to assess their health. For this manuscript, we had one batch of virus that produced toxicity. We did not include any data from this batch.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>● Define AUC on first use.</p></disp-quote><p>It is now defined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>● Figure 3C2: Please explain how the photocurrents were normalized. As presented, it looks like under strong orange light, the ZipACR has higher photocurrent than the ivfChr.</p></disp-quote><p>This is due to the fact vfChrimson and other Chrimson-based variants do not fully recover in the dark after 590 nm stimulation. We tested IvfChrimson with both reconditioning light pulse of 405 nm and without 405 nm and we can consistently reach a greater ‘maximal’ response from the same cell after 405 nm reconditioning (see Fig. 4 Suppl 2). We therefore normalize the response to the maximal recorded response of the cell often achieved with 10 or 20 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> 590 nm stimulation after 405 nm reconditioning. We understand this can be confusing and have now replaced the light-intensity response in Fig. 3C2 with the one with 405 nm reconditioning which is easier to interpret for the readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>● P. 3: &quot;As expected, blue light pulses induce transient membrane suppression...&quot; Unclear what &quot;suppression&quot; means.

I understand the impetus to normalize by expression to give something proportional to per-molecule conductance, but a user cares about overall photocurrent. Please also give the real photocurrents, either pA or pA/pF.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided the real photocurrent in pA or pA/pF where scientifically appropriate. To avoid selection and experimenter’s bias in our data, we did not set criteria for data elimination for cells with specific fluorescence intensity or photocurrent amplitude. Some resulting response can range from vary up to 20 folds from the same construct in many experiments. We do not believe that averaging absolute photocurrent amplitude would be justified due to the imbalance of weighing in the results. We do acknowledge that not selecting or eliminating data points would introduce higher noise in recordings with smaller responses but this is preferable over the selection or experimenter bias that is likely to be introduced otherwise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>● Please quote illumination intensities wherever possible.</p><p>● P. 7: why was the red light crosstalk into Zip(151T) tested at 635 nm instead of 590 nm? Isn't the relevant parameter 590 nm, since that will be used for the excitatory opsin?</p></disp-quote><p>In all our characterizations of the constructs using slice electrophysiology recordings, we used 635nm instead of 590nm. The reason is that compared to 590nm wavelength, at 635nm the photocurrent for Zip(151T) and Zip(151V) is significantly reduced (Fig. 3D1,D2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>● P. 10: &quot;we examined the power at which responses to 470 nm and 635 nm lights induce APs in neurons expressing ZipT-IvfChr, ZipV-IvfChr, or IvfChr&quot;, but the preceding sentence says you didn't test the ZipT-IvfChr. This is confusing, please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>The previous paragraph refers to the photocurrent recordings in HEK293 cells where our fast LED based illumination system is limited to 590 nm light, whereas the subsequent paragraph refers to the brain slice neuronal recordings. We have now emphasized the difference of the experiments in the rewrite.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>● Fig. 4B1, top: Why don't the blue traces return to the same baseline after the stimulus epochs?</p></disp-quote><p>We observed this shift in baseline (~4mV more depolarized) in cells expressing IvfChR (or vfChR) only with blue light stimulation. This was observed in the neurons recorded in the CA1 as well (data not shown). There was no such a change following red light stimulation (Fig. 4B1). Therefore, this should not affect the applicability of our construct. The original paper introducing vfChR did not test the responses of their constructs to blue light. There could be another photocycle state that is activated stronger by 470nm than 590nm and it has a slow off-rate, but this is only a speculation from our side. It must be noted we did not observe such a phenomenon in cells expressing ChrimsonR (Fig. 1 Suppl 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>● Fig. S3B, right: The two colors are barely distinguishable on the graph.
