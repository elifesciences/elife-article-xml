communication is vital to understand why microbes persist within a host, while others are cleared. Here, we employed a dual-sequencing approach to unravel conversational turn-taking of dynamic host–pathogen communications. We demonstrate that upon hitting a host cell, motile <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> induce a specific gene expression program. This results in the expression of spermidine on the surface, which specifically activates the PIP<sub>3</sub>-pathway to induce phagocytic uptake into primary or immortalized murine cells. Non-motile bacteria are more immunogenic due to a lower expression of <italic>arnT</italic> upon host-cell contact, but do not produce spermidine and are phagocytosed less. We demonstrate that not only the presence of pathogen inherent molecular patterns induces immune responses, but that bacterial motility is linked to a host-cell-induced expression of additional immune modulators. Our results emphasize on the value of integrating microbiological and immunological findings to unravel complex and dynamic host–pathogen interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic></kwd><kwd>host-pathogen interaction</kwd><kwd>flagella</kwd><kwd>motility</kwd><kwd>dual-sequencing</kwd><kwd>spermidine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>COMBAT Project 724290</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Häussler</surname><given-names>Susanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Germany's Excellence Strategy - EXC 2155 RESIST. 390874280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Häussler</surname><given-names>Susanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004875</institution-id><institution>DFG</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP 1879</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Häussler</surname><given-names>Susanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Upon host cell contact, motile but not non-motile <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> exhibit a change in their gene expression program that includes the expression of spermidine, which triggers motility-dependent phagocytosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A comprehensive understanding of host–pathogen interactions is crucial to advance treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. The problematic opportunistic pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is a major cause of infection in patients with underlying or immunocompromising conditions. The opportunistic pathogen may infect virtually any tissue and has evolved as a model to study bacterial adaptation to the conditions within the human host. Therapeutic options of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections are increasingly limited due to the continued rise in antimicrobial resistances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moradali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Streeter et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the ability of the pathogen to build biofilms and to persist e.g. in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients facilitates the establishment of chronic infections, which are largely recalcitrant to antimicrobial therapies. The development of novel drugs, vaccines and other therapeutics that work even in increasingly prevalent multidrug resistant bacteria will be highly dependent on new knowledge gained from investigating host–pathogen interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wagner et al., 2016</xref>). The clinical course and severity of an infectious disease depends on the results of the battle between the host's immune responses, and the pathogen's pathogenicity and virulence traits. Bacteria express pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as LPS or flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janssens and Beyaert, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Molloy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2009</xref>). Their recognition by specific host receptors called pattern recognition receptors (PRR) induces a strong inflammatory response to kill the pathogen. However, clearance of an infection is not only dependent on the ability of the host to induce an immune response following pathogen recognition, but also on the strategies of the pathogen to evade immune defense mechanisms and to express pathogenicity factors allowing them to establish a niche in the host.</p><p>Clearly, for a comprehensive understanding of host–pathogen interactions, knowledge of the behaviors of both the host and the pathogen, and their specific interaction is vital. It has become increasingly evident that host–pathogen interactions are not restricted to a linear sequence of action and reaction, but must involve a more complex crosstalk comprising entire reaction networks to determine the outcome of the disease. A prominent example of such complex crosstalk is linked to the expression of the bacterial flagellum. Flagella are essentially required for the bacterium to reach target sites in the host and to establish an infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duan et al., 2013</xref>). However, the flagellum is also recognized by toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) or intracellular NLRC4 as a PAMP, thereby limiting bacterial establishment of an infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haasken and Sutterwala, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoon et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, it has been argued that bacterial motility may play a vital role in mediating the initiation of specific immune responses and the release of inflammatory cytokines. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains lacking a functional flagellum have been demonstrated to undergo less phagocytosis and are more resistant to clearance in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amiel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lovewell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lovewell et al., 2011</xref>). The lower phagocytosis rate of these non-motile strains was explained by diminished activation of the phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>) pathway in host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demirdjian et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we set out to further decipher the roles of flagella-dependent motility in the opportunistic pathogen <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> on its interaction with the eukaryotic host. By integrating in vitro macrophage phagocytosis assays with a dual-sequencing approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Westermann et al., 2012</xref>), we demonstrate that motile cells induce the expression of bacterial polyamine surface structures upon host-cell contact, while non-motile cells do not. Bacterial polyamines activate the PIP<sub>3</sub> pathway to trigger phagocytic uptake. Our results highlight novel, unforeseen metabolic components that control the molecular crosstalk between motile <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates and the eukaryotic host resulting from complex and dynamic actions and reactions on both the pathogen and the host side.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Selection of flagella/motility variants of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic></title><p>We studied host–cell interactions of the mono-flagellated, fully motile <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> reference strain PA14 in comparison to three isogenic motility mutants.

In line with the results for the PA14 strain, both non-motile clinical isolates were phagocytosed at lower rates by macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) in comparison to the motile clinical isolate.

These 10 functional categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>) represent 55.6% of all enriched functions in the infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and thus indicates that spermidine indeed induces a host response that is similar to that observed upon PA14 infection.</p><p>Of note, genes encoding three CLK kinases (CLK1/3/4) were among the regulated genes in spermidine-treated RAW264 cells. Additional genes encoding serine/threonine kinases were significantly enriched (4-fold, FDR = 0.039) among the top 100 genes (IRAK2, PRKCZ, MAP4K2, MAP3K14, PIM3 in addition to CLK1/3/4). Importantly, serine/threonine kinases were also significantly enriched among the genes that were differentially regulated during infection with PA14. Altogether, the large overlap between the PA14- and the spermidine-induced transcriptional profile supports the hypothesis that spermidine plays a dominant role in the response of macrophages to PA14, which is largely phosphorylation dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To further confirm the role of spermidine, the operon was disrupted in PA14 through the deletion of <italic>PA14_63120</italic>. As measured by HPLC-MS, the Δ<italic>PA14_63120</italic> deletion mutant produced strongly reduced levels of membrane-associated spermidine as compared to PA14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In line with our hypothesis that the induction of bacterial spermidine production triggers phagocytic uptake, the Δ<italic>PA14_63120</italic> mutant strain was significantly less phagocytosed by RAW264.7 cells in comparison to PA14. Phagocytic uptake of the Δ<italic>PA14_63120</italic> mutant by RAW264.7 macrophages could be restored to wild-type levels following the exogenous addition of spermidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Of note, also the addition of norspermidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolard et al., 2019</xref>) restored the phagocytic uptake of the non-spermidine producing mutants at comparable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Norspermidine is a triamine like spermidine but possesses a symmetric structure with two 3-aminopropyl chains while spermidine is asymmetric with one C4-chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michael, 2016</xref>). While spermidine can be found in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, norspermidine appears to be restricted to prokaryotes and a role in antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation was previously discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tabor and Tabor, 1984</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Spermidine and norspermidine restore phagocytic uptake of a spermidine knock-out mutant.</title><p>Spermidine was externally added at the indicated concentrations to the Δ<italic>PA14_63120</italic> mutant (blue).

We found that motile bacteria respond differently to the presence of host cells and induce a gene expression program that determines the subsequent host response. This is a remarkable finding that indicates a dynamic conversation between the pathogen and the host. The pathogen is equipped with a set of PAMPs such as the flagellum which, if present, is recognized by the host. However, as a direct response to the presence of host cells the pathogen expresses further traits adding a new level of complexity to the crosstalk between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Flagellum-dependent <italic>Pseudomonas–</italic>macrophage interaction.</title><p>Upon host contact, changes in flagellar activity (possibly sensed by PmrAB and PhoPQ) trigger a transcriptional program, which results in the synthesis of membrane-associated spermidine and the masking of the Lipid A. In the host, AKT phosphorylation through PIP<sub>3</sub> is stimulated by spermidine to increase phagocytosis.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55744-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Phagocytosis has been demonstrated to be differently triggered by bacterial motility variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amiel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lovewell et al., 2011</xref>), and the search for a host-cell receptor to sense bacterial motility has been a subject of intense research. Here, we ruled out that differences in motility lead to altered adherence, and therefore to lowered phagocytosis rates. We show that the Δ<italic>fliC</italic> and Δ<italic>flgK</italic> mutants do not differentially adhere when centrifuged onto a macrophage cell layer. Only the Δ<italic>motABCD</italic> strain adhered at a lower rate to the eukaryotic cells, potentially due to non-functional <italic>motAB</italic> genes, which have been implicated to play a role in a pili-dependent adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Laventie et al., 2019</xref>). It seems that differences in motility, rather than in adherence, impact phagocytic uptake. As previously demonstrated by Demirdjian et al., the defect in the phagocytosis of non-motile variants could be restored by adding PIP<sub>3</sub> to the host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demirdjian et al., 2018</xref>). PIP<sub>3</sub> is a membrane-associated phospholipid that acts as a signaling molecule for many cellular processes such as the Akt-pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Czech, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Traynor-Kaplan et al., 1988</xref>). Our dual-sequencing approach revealed that calcium transport systems and the signaling pathway leading to the production of PIP<sub>2</sub> and PIP<sub>3</sub> were activated in the host cell upon infection with PA14. Both pathways are known to be involved in phagocytosis, and a lack of their activation in the non-motile strains could explain the lower phagocytosis rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Booth et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nunes and Demaurex, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our findings suggest that the non-motile variants are lacking a factor to stimulate PIP<sub>3</sub> activation and calcium transport. The transcriptional profiling of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> revealed that strains with impaired motility or lack of flagella exhibit altered expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of bacterial surface structures. Of note, the motility variants differentially expressed genes encoding these structures exclusively upon host-cell contact and not under standard lab (LB or BM2 growth) conditions.</p><p>A membrane-associated spermidine biosynthesis operon, which has been previously connected to antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>), was expressed at significantly lower levels in all motility mutant strains compared to PA14 wild-type upon host-cell contact. We furthermore demonstrate that externally added spermidine was able to activate the Akt-pathway, restoring the level of phagocytosis of the flagellar mutants and of a <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain incapable of producing spermidine (Δ<italic>PA14_63120</italic>). We show that spermidine itself induced a transcriptional pattern in the host cell, which was similar to that of a PA14-infected host cell and involves triggering of global phosphorylation cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennetzen et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, serine/threonine kinases, which were enriched in spermidine-treated cells, are known to phosphorylate Akt among other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgering and Coffer, 1995</xref>). Spermidine as a polyamine has been shown to mimic the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koenig et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toninello et al., 2004</xref>), modulate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Latour et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Theoharides, 1980</xref>) and trigger phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">TranVan Nhieu et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, polyamine depletion has previously been shown to result in increased expression of LPS-induced proinflammatory genes, coinciding with our findings of an enhanced production of TNF-α and IL-6 in the motility mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Van den Bossche et al., 2012</xref>). Enhanced expression of proinflammatory cytokines in our motility mutants may additionally be explained by the differential expression of <italic>arnT,</italic> which was significantly downregulated in all non-motile <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains upon host-cell contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Felgner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Needham et al., 2013</xref>). ArnT is a 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose transferase that masks the 4’-phosphate group of the lipid A molecule to avoid immune recognition via TLR-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maeshima and Fernandez, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, both the production of spermidine, and the expression of ArnT are governed by the two-component system PmrAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gooderham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McPhee et al., 2006</xref>) which is located on the same operon as <italic>PA14_63120. PmrAB</italic> was downregulated upon host-cell contact in the mutant strains to the same extent as <italic>arnT</italic> and the spermidine biosynthesis operon. In <italic>E. coli,</italic> the PmrAB homolog is known to regulate motility genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sperandio et al., 2002</xref>), and the <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> PmrAB appears to fine-tune flagellar gene expression in a negative feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Khodor et al., 2009</xref>). Upon host-cell contact PmrAB as well as a second two-component regulatory system, PhoPQ, which regulates the <italic>arn</italic> operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gooderham et al., 2009</xref>) and <italic>PA14_63120</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolard et al., 2019</xref>), were affected in the motility mutants. <italic>PhoQ</italic>, is regulated by the PmrAB two-component regulatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McPhee et al., 2003</xref>) and was previously shown to affect twitching motility, biofilm formation, attachment and cytotoxicity in human lung epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gooderham et al., 2009</xref>). It seems conceivable that PmrAB and PhoQP are induced by shared triggers upon host-cell contact. In <italic>Salmonella</italic>, PhoQ is activated within acidified phagosomes and host tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prost and Miller, 2008</xref>) and both two-component systems are activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guragain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McPhee et al., 2003</xref>). This is interesting as it implicates that the motile bacterial cell may detect changes in the ionic environment, leading to the activation of these two-component systems. Since their activation is dependent on motility and the presence of a host cell, one might speculate that if a motile bacterium hits a cell, changes in bacterial motility in response to the physical barrier may entail altered ion fluxes across the bacterial cell membrane. Changes in pericellular ion homeostasis might serve as a stimulus to activate the two-component systems and the production of polyamines, which are subsequently perceived by the host cell, thereby inducing phagocytosis. Our results highlight that the combined use of cell culture assays with a dual-sequencing approach has the potential to uncover as yet unappreciated dynamic molecular crosstalk between motile <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates and the eukaryotic host. A deeper understanding of host–pathogen interactions on a molecular level will be essential for the identification of new therapeutic targets as the basis to address the important medical need of counteracting bacterial infections.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

For derivatization, 100 µl sample were mixed with 150 µl of derivatization solution (47.5% EtOH; 46.5% Pyridine (Alfa Aesar); 7% PITC (Sigma-Aldrich)) and incubated for 60 min at room temperature with 600 rpm. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm and 50 µl of the supernatant was transferred into an LC–MS-vial and immediately measured. A volume of 5 µl per sample was injected into the LC–MS system. The LC–MS measurements were done with an ABSciex QTRAP 6500 mass spectrometer, equipped with an IonDrive Turbo-V ion source. A 1290 Agilent UHPLC-system with binary pump, thermostated autosampler and column oven were used for the LC separation. A XSelect CSH Phenyl-Hexyl column (Waters; 4.6 × 50 mm, 2.5 µm pore size) were used at 30°C. The flowrate was set to 600 µl per minute. Solvent A was water with 0.1% formic acid, solvent B acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. The gradient started with 1% B, was held at 1% B until 0.1 min and then increased to 100% B within 4 min. The composition with 100% B was held for 30 s, followed by a return to the 1% B starting condition. The overall run time was 7 min.</p><p>The PITC derivatives were measured in positive MRM mode. Quantifier for PITC-Spermidine was the transition from 551.1 to 416.2 Da, and the transition from 551.1 to 193.0 Da was used as qualifier. As general parameters for the MS the following values were used: curtain gas 20 psi nitrogen; ion spray voltage 5500 V; temperature 400°C; gas1 45 psi; gas2 60 psi (both compressed air); entrance potential 10 V.

After 3 hr, RNA of all samples was extracted using RNAprotect and isolated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kordes et al., 2019</xref>). Ribosomal RNA was depleted using the RiboZero Gold Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) and ERCC RNA Spike-In control mixes (Ambion Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) were added to the RNA samples. Libraries were prepared with the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts, USA). For sequencing of BMDMs after the addition of spermidine, the NEB SingleCell Low Input Kit (unstranded) was used.

For eukaryotic RNA, normalization factors were calculated using ERCC RNA Spike-In controls. To filter for genes that are considered as expressed, we kept only genes that have more than one normalized read (count per million (cpm)) in at least n samples (n: number of replicates; infected/PBS treated cells = 2, spermidine-treated cells = 3). These 11129 (infected and PBS treated cells) and 10994 genes (spermidine-treated cells), respectively, were used to calculate differential gene expression applying Genewise Negative Binomial Generalized Linear Models with Quasi-likelihood Tests (edgeR packages glmQLFit and glmQLFTest). Functional enrichment was performed with DAVID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov/">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/</ext-link>) with fold enrichment and FDR added as additional options. For functional enrichment, genes with an FDR ≤ 0.1, or, if only a few genes were below this FDR, top genes with the smallest p values, as indicated in the results section, were used.</p><p>In our general bacterial experiments, data were pre-filtered by removing genes that did not have a cpm &gt;3 in at least two samples (replicates). Differential gene expression was calculated applying Genewise Negative Binomial Generalized Linear Models with Quasi-likelihood Tests (edgeR packages glmQLFit and glmQLFTest). For our infection experiments, we used the more rigorous function glmTreat (edgeR package) to find differentially expressed genes (FDR ≤ 0.05) with a fold change significantly higher than 1.5 fold in the motility mutants that might affect phagocytic uptake. Dispersions and generalized linear model fits (R functions estimateDisp and glmQLFit) were calculated using the robust option.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Data analyses – interspecies correlation</title><p>The differential gene expression of 12298 expressed host genes (one cpm in at least one sample) was calculated for each individual infected replicate compared to the non-infected host-cell group, resulting in log<sub>2</sub>FC data of eight samples (PA14, ∆<italic>fliC</italic>, ∆<italic>flgK</italic>, and ∆<italic>motABCD</italic>, each in two replicates). On the bacterial site, we used the 53 genes that were differentially expressed in all three flagella mutants as compared to PA14 upon host-cell contact (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To determine which genes of the infected host cells correlate with bacterial in vivo gene expression, bacterial reads per gene were normalized using cpm and the weighted trimmed mean of M-values with singleton pairing (TMMwsp, edgeR functions calcNormFactors and cpm). To determine the genes of the infected host cells, whose expression correlate with the bacterial response to the host, the differential gene expression (see above) of all in vivo versus planktonic bacteria was calculated to obtain log<sub>2</sub>FC data for each individual replicate (as for the host). For each of the 53 bacterial genes, host genes with a Spearman correlation coefficient ≥ |0.8| were counted for all expressed host genes, as well as for the 74 expressed PIP<sub>3</sub>-associated genes (from the KEGG pathway mmu04070). Hypergeometric tests (R-function phyper) were used to calculate whether the proportion of PIP<sub>3</sub>-associated genes (that correlated with the individual bacterial genes) was significantly overrepresented. Multiple testing was corrected using FDR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Data analyses – visualizations</title><p>Heatmaps were created with the R package superheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barter and Yu, 2018</xref>).

In our study, we concentrated on the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the differences in phagocytic uptake of motile and non-motile bacteria. We recorded the transcriptional profiles of the wild-type as well as non-motile mutants and observed substantial transcriptional differences between the groups. To demonstrate that this transcriptional reprogramming is not due to the non-/ motility per se, we recorded the transcriptional profiles of the wild-type and the motility mutants also in LB as a standard medium. Here, no major differences in the transcriptional profiles were recorded. We think this is a very important control. We elaborated in the revised version of the manuscript in more detail, how we use the LB transcriptional profiles as a base-line to describe not only a differential gene expression in the motility mutants as compared to the PA14 wild-type strain upon host cell contact, but to also provide information on whether the differentially expressed gene was induced in the wild-type or the mutant upon host cell contact in comparison to the basal LB gene expression profile.</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewers that, if the transcription profiles would have been recorded in cell culture medium, this would have allowed to infer that the observed differential in spermidine production between the strains is not the result of their differential response to cell culture medium. Although we cannot rule out, that the bacteria respond to something specific in the cell culture medium (HEPES, glucose as sole carbon source etc.), spermidine production in PA14 is also not induced in BM2 medium. Furthermore, FCS is not inducing spermidine production, as spermidine production in PA14 was shown to be induced also in FSC-free cell culture medium in the presence of host cells.</p><p>To make this clear we added the following sentence to the revised version of the manuscript: “Of note, the motility variants differentially expressed genes encoding these structures exclusively under the infection experiment conditions – most likely due to host-cell contact – and not under standard lab (LB or BM2 growth) conditions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) PA14 is generally considered to be cytotoxic with the T3SS playing a role in killing.

It is extremely important to guarantee comparable infection conditions between the mutants and the wild-type strain. Thus, we performed an LDH assay as requested by the reviewer. No differences were observed between PA14 Wt, <italic>ΔfliC</italic> and <italic>ΔflgK</italic> 3 h post infection. The increased values of the <italic>ΔmotABCD</italic> mutant may derive from the low contact between the host and the bacteria as demonstrated with the adherence assay. Thus, the bacteria could proliferate better leading to a higher effective bacterial dose over time in comparison to the other strains. The results were added to the new Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><p>The LDH assay was added to the Material and methods section (subsection “Invasion assays”) and the results were included in the revised version of the manuscript (see subsection “Dual-sequencing approach to analyze host-pathogen interactions”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please try to improve the dual RNA-seq analysis by carrying out interspecies correlation analysis of the host and bacterial responses to the different infections (different mutants).

We were able to confirm the role of <italic>arnT</italic> and the spermidine synthesis genes, as well as of <italic>pmrA</italic> and <italic>phoPQ</italic> during infection. Expression of these genes positively correlated (rho ≥ 0.8) with the expression of significantly more PIP<sub>3</sub> associated host genes as we would expect by chance (hypergeometric test, see subsection “Data analyses – Interspecies correlation”). Thus, the correlation analysis underscores the experimental findings and we added the results of this analysis in the revised version of the manuscript. The data are presented in Figure 4—source data 2 and Figure 4—source data 3.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, they also all agree that the following is essential before they can consider acceptance of the manuscript:</p><p>– Additional bacterial reference control, e.g. RNA from bacteria grown in LB to OD 2, but then shifted to DMEM and incubated therein for 3 h at 37°C (in the absence of host cells) is needed.

Briefly, bacterial cultures were grown in LB for 3.5 h and adjusted to the infection dose of 5*10^6 bacteria/ml in order to keep the experimental conditions similar to that of the infection experiments with host cells. The adjusted bacteria were washed, transferred into DMEM and grown for 3 h at 37°C. Afterwards, RNA extraction, downstream processing and data analysis has been done as for the dual-sequencing experiment. The experimental procedure of the medium switch experiment has been added to the Materials and methods section.</p><p>The data demonstrates that neither the spermidine-associated genes nor the <italic>arnT</italic> operon is significantly regulated by switching the medium when comparing PA14 to its <italic>ΔfliC</italic> variant. The results are included in the revised version of the manuscript in subsection “Non-motile <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> have altered expression levels of <italic>arnT</italic> and of genes involved in spermidine and pyoverdine biosynthesis” and in a new table Figure 4—source data 4. Of note, the results are also showing that obviously the differential expression of the pyoverdine biosynthesis operon between PA14 to its <italic>ΔfliC</italic> variant is becoming already apparent upon switching the cultures to cell culture medium and thus is not exclusively the result of host cell contact. We added a statement regarding the differential expression of pyoverdine genes upon medium switch in subsection “Non-motile <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> have altered expression levels of <italic>arnT</italic> and of genes involved in spermidine and pyoverdine biosynthesis” and the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
