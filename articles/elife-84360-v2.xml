decreasing cell size. Mitotic chromosomes also decrease in size during development, presumably to scale coordinately with mitotic spindles, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we combine in vivo and in vitro approaches using eggs and embryos from the frog <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> to show that mitotic chromosome scaling is mechanistically distinct from other forms of subcellular scaling. We found that mitotic chromosomes scale continuously with cell, spindle, and nuclear size in vivo. However, unlike for spindles and nuclei, mitotic chromosome size cannot be reset by cytoplasmic factors from earlier developmental stages. In vitro, increasing nuclear-cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio is sufficient to recapitulate mitotic chromosome scaling, but not nuclear or spindle scaling, through differential loading of maternal factors during interphase. An additional pathway involving importin α scales mitotic chromosomes to cell surface area/volume ratio (SA/V) during metaphase. Finally, single-chromosome immunofluorescence and Hi-C data suggest that mitotic chromosomes shrink during embryogenesis through decreased recruitment of condensin I, resulting in major rearrangements of DNA loop architecture to accommodate the same amount of DNA on a shorter chromosome axis. Together, our findings demonstrate how mitotic chromosome size is set by spatially and temporally distinct developmental cues in the early embryo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>biological scaling</kwd><kwd>embryogenesis</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>chromosomes</kwd><kwd>condensin I</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM118183</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heald</surname><given-names>Rebecca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Coral Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dekker</surname><given-names>Job</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HG003143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dekker</surname><given-names>Job</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches using <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs and embryos reveals how dimensions of mitotic chromosomes scale with decreasing cell size and increasing nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio during early embryogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Upon fertilization, embryos undergo a series of rapid cell divisions in the absence of cell growth, resulting in decreasing cell size. Subcellular structures including the nucleus and mitotic spindle scale to cell size through a defined set of mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heald and Gibeaux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levy and Heald, 2015</xref>). Mitotic chromosomes also shrink in size during development and scale with cell size across metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conklin, 1912</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kramer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Micheli et al., 1993</xref>), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In plants and in fly embryos, fused chromosomes with extended lengths were reported to mis-segregate during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schubert and Oud, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sullivan et al., 1993</xref>). Similar experiments in budding yeast showed that an artificially lengthened chromosome was hyper-compacted during anaphase due to Aurora B kinase phosphorylation of substrates including condensin, a key regulator of mitotic chromosome condensation and resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neurohr et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, a screen for genes required for segregation of an extra-long, fused chromosome identified the centromeric histone CENP-A and topoisomerase II (topo II) as regulators of holocentric chromosome size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ladouceur et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is unclear whether pathways that tune the length of an artificially long chromosome also operate during the physiological process of mitotic chromosome scaling during embryogenesis.</p><p>Mechanisms that scale the spindle and nucleus during development have been well-characterized. As cell volume decreases, structural components become limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Good et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hazel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levy and Heald, 2010</xref>). Additionally, some scaling factors are regulated by the nuclear transport factor importin α, which partitions between the cytoplasm and the cell membrane and serves as a sensor for the cell’s surface area to volume ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brownlee and Heald, 2019</xref>). Previous studies of mitotic chromosome scaling, performed mainly in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> revealed that mitotic chromosome size correlates positively with cell size and nuclear size and negatively with intranuclear DNA density, as haploid embryos contain longer mitotic chromosomes than diploids, and knockdown of importin α or the chromatin-bound Ran guanine exchange factor RCC1 decrease both nuclear and mitotic chromosome size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ladouceur et al., 2015</xref>). However, conserved relationships among genome size, nuclear size, and cell size complicate efforts to distinguish correlation from causation during mitotic chromosome scaling. Furthermore, it is unclear whether similar underlying mechanisms operate during embryogenesis of vertebrates that possess larger, monocentric chromosomes and more complex karyotypes.</p><p>The African clawed frog <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> provides a powerful system for studying the mechanisms of mitotic chromosome scaling. Female frogs produce thousands of eggs that enable isolation of undiluted and cell cycle-synchronized cytoplasm in the form of egg extracts that reproduce many cellular processes in vitro including mitotic chromosome condensation and individualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maresca and Heald, 2006</xref>). In addition, fertilized eggs divide synchronously, allowing extracts to be prepared from embryos at different stages of development. Our previous work suggested that embryo nuclei added to egg extracts can recapitulate a decrease in mitotic chromosome size during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kieserman and Heald, 2011</xref>)<italic>,</italic> but did not uncover underlying scaling mechanisms. It was also unclear how this observation related to scaling of mitotic chromosomes and other subcellular structures observed in vivo. Here, we fully leverage the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system by systematically comparing changes in mitotic chromosome size observed in vivo with perturbations in vitro to distinguish the factors that regulate mitotic chromosome scaling including nuclear size, spindle size, cell size, cell-cycle stage, and nuclear-cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio. We find that mitotic chromosomes scale continuously with spindle size, even in the largest cells of early embryos. We show that scaling occurs primarily through differential recruitment of the DNA loop extruding motor condensin I, which alters DNA loop size and thus length-wise compaction of chromosomes. Finally, we describe how reductive divisions that progressively decrease cell size and increase N/C ratio operate during different phases of the cell cycle to reduce chromosome length over the course of development. Together, these results suggest a multiscale model for how mitotic chromosome size is set in an embryo and open new avenues for deeper exploration of how changes in chromosome compaction and organization contribute to genome functions during early vertebrate embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mitotic chromosomes scale continuously with cell, nuclear and spindle size</title><p>We reasoned that mitotic chromosome size may relate to nuclear size and/or content due to chromatin factors associated with the DNA during interphase. Alternatively, mitotic chromosomes could scale with spindle size through mechanisms operating in mitosis. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed a time course of whole-embryo immunofluorescence through the late blastula stages of <italic>X. laevis</italic> development and measured the dimensions of cells, spindles, and metaphase plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although previous work showed that spindle lengths reach a plateau in cells larger than ~200 μm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wühr et al., 2008</xref>), measurement of spindle volumes by confocal microscopy revealed that spindles continue to scale at larger cell sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), consistent with observations that spindle width correlates more robustly with cell volume than spindle length in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kletter et al., 2021</xref>). The combined volume of all mitotic chromosomes (the metaphase plate) also scaled continuously with cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), similar to published work describing nuclear scaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jevtić and Levy, 2015</xref>). To assess whether the metaphase plate scaled more with nuclear size or with mitotic spindle size, we binned the data by cell size and plotted average volumes of the different subcellular structures. We found that total mitotic chromosome volume scaled in size remarkably similarly with both spindles and nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, the decrease in nuclear volume during early development was far greater than for mitotic structures: nuclei decreased in size approximately 10-fold over early cleavage divisions, while metaphase plate and spindle volumes decreased by approximately 3-fold and 2-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). This comparison suggests that the fold-increase in chromosome compaction as a cell transitions from interphase to metaphase diminishes from 8-fold in early blastula embryos to 1.5-fold in late blastula stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that the metaphase plate scales continuously with cell size in the early embryo, suggesting that mitotic chromosomes share scaling features with both nuclei and mitotic spindles.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Metaphase plates scale continuously with cell size.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental scheme for whole-embryo immunofluorescence.

In both cases, sperm chromosomes were at least 2-fold longer than the endogenous stage 8 chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that stage 8 metaphase cytoplasm is sufficient to remodel sperm nuclei into mitotic chromosomes, but unable to recapitulate embryo chromosome size.

This observation is consistent with the idea that titration of maternal factors had already occurred in the embryo by the time nuclei were collected at G2. Also, when sperm chromosomes were added directly to metaphase egg extracts, thus skipping the initial round of replication, there was again no effect of N/C ratio on chromosome length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Thus, the factors that set mitotic chromosome length as a function of N/C ratio are loaded during interphase, not metaphase.</p><p>Finally, we examined whether the titration effect of chromosome factors observed in vitro corresponded to changes in their abundance during development in vivo by measuring fluorescence intensity levels of condensin I, H3, and histone H1.8 in embryo nuclei isolated at different stages. As predicted, although protein concentrations in embryos did not change over the course of the early cleavage divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>), the levels of all factors found in interphase nuclei decreased as genome copy number increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>).

We previously identified importin α as a factor that coordinately scales nuclei and spindles to cell size by regulating nuclear import of lamin proteins and the activity of a microtubule destabilizing protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brownlee and Heald, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levy and Heald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wilbur and Heald, 2013</xref>). Palmitoylation of importin α drives a fraction of the total protein to the cell membrane, where it can no longer bind to and inhibit its nuclear localization sequence (NLS)-containing cargo that regulates spindle size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As cell size decreases during early cleavage divisions, cell surface area/volume (SA/V) increases, causing a larger fraction of importin α to associate with the plasma membrane, thus releasing more scaling factors into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brownlee and Heald, 2019</xref>). To test whether importin α also plays a role in mitotic chromosome scaling, we treated egg extracts with palmostatin, an inhibitor of the major depalmitoylation enzyme APT1 to increase the pool of palmitoylated importin α, thus mimicking smaller cells with higher cell SA/V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dekker et al., 2010</xref>). We found that mitotic chromosome size decreased with palmostatin treatment and was fully rescued by the addition of purified recombinant importin α that cannot be palmitoylatated (NP importin α), but not by addition of wild-type (WT) importin α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Immunofluorescence of DMSO- or palmostatin-treated chromosomes revealed increased abundance of histone H1.8 on short palmostatin-chromosomes, whereas the levels of condensin I and topo II were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data are consistent with our observation that short embryo chromosomes contain more histone H1.8 than long sperm chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and suggest a model in which importin α partitioning scales mitotic chromosomes to cell size by increasing availability of histone H1.8 in the cytoplasm as cell SA/V increases.

Our data suggest that increasing N/C ratio during interphase is sufficient to scale mitotic chromosomes during the subsequent mitosis through decreased recruitment of condensin I, resulting in increased DNA loop and layer size and length-wise compaction. In metaphase, importin α partitioning additionally scales mitotic chromosomes to spindle and cell size due to changing cell (SA/V) ratios. Our findings have important implications for the interplay between subcellular scaling and genome structure and function during early embryogenesis.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Multi-scale model for mitotic chromosome scaling.</title><p>Mitotic chromosomes scale to two independent cues during development: cell size and nuclear-cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio. In the N/C ratio pathway, exponentially increasing genome copy numbers results in titration of chromatin-bound maternal factors during interphase, leading to decreased condensin I levels on metaphase chromosomes. A decrease in condensin I results in increased DNA loop size, thus allowing the same amount of DNA to be accommodated on a shorter axis. The cell size pathway additionally scales mitotic chromosomes to spindle and cell size during metaphase through increased partitioning of palmitoylated importin α to the cell membrane and release of linker histone H1.8 into the cytoplasm. We speculate that increased H1.8 could result in increased inter-nucleosomal compaction, thus creating a denser chromosome fiber.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84360-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mitotic chromosome size is not directly coupled to nuclear and spindle size</title><p>Previous work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> showed that mitotic chromosome size correlated positively with nuclear size and negatively with intranuclear density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ladouceur et al., 2015</xref>). However, in egg extracts, mitotic chromosome size does not necessarily correlate with either spindle or nuclear size. G2-arrested stage 8 embryo nuclei, which contain both the maternal and paternal genomes, are almost 2-fold larger than replicated sperm nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), consistent with a doubling of genome size. Yet when added to metaphase egg extracts, they form mitotic chromosomes that are 2-fold shorter than replicated sperm chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), demonstrating that in this system, mitotic chromosome size does not scale to either intranuclear density or nuclear size. Although mitotic chromosomes scaled continuously with spindle size in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), this correlation was abolished in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Furthermore, when N/C ratio was varied in egg extracts, mitotic chromosomes shrank 1.3-fold while spindle size increased almost 2-fold and nuclear size remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Together, these data suggest that although spindles, nuclei, and mitotic chromosomes appear to scale coordinately with one another in vivo, the mechanisms regulating their size changes are distinct.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mitotic chromosome scaling involves temporally and spatially distinct cues</title><p>Whereas mitotic spindle size and nuclear size are set by factors operating during metaphase and interphase, respectively, we found that both phases of the cell cycle contribute to scaling of mitotic chromosomes. Experiments performed in cytoplasmic extracts showed that mitotic chromosome size is determined by factors already present in interphase nuclei and cannot be reset by during metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). In contrast, importin α partitioning between the cytoplasm and plasma membrane scaled mitotic chromosomes to spindle and cell size specifically during metaphase. Consistent with this temporal separation of developmental cues, we found that condensin I acts as a scaling factor only in the N/C ratio pathway and not the importin α pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the NLS-containing cargo that scale mitotic chromosomes, unlike cargos that scale nuclei and spindles, cannot freely exchange with other factors in the egg cytoplasm to lengthen short embryo chromosomes. Since these conclusions are drawn from results obtained in vitro using reconstituted chromosomes, it remains to be determined how these two pathways would interplay in vivo. We speculate that the N/C ratio pathway that operates during interphase sets mitotic chromosome size within a certain range, but final mitotic chromosome size is set by importin α partitioning during metaphase, ensuring that metaphase plate size scales with spindle size. This idea is consistent with an early model that proposed mitotic chromosome size must be coordinated with spindle size in order to prevent chromosome mis-segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schubert and Oud, 1997</xref>). Now that we have a more complete understanding of the pathways that regulate both spindle and mitotic chromosome size, it will be interesting to test this model in vivo. Finally, <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos divide asymmetrically, with larger cells on the vegetal side. This raises the possibility that even within the same embryo the importin α and N/C ratio pathways could combine to have different effects on subcellular scaling in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Multiple molecular pathways can regulate mitotic chromosome size</title><p>Based on in silico models of condensin I loop extrusion activity, it was predicted that changing condensin I occupancy on mitotic chromosomes would cause major changes in DNA loop size and chromosome dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goloborodko et al., 2016</xref>). In egg extracts, depleting condensin I by 5-fold decreased chromosome size by almost 2-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shintomi and Hirano, 2011</xref>). However, it was unclear whether such changes occur in vivo to scale mitotic chromosomes. Our results suggest that within the physiologically relevant range of condensin I concentrations present during early embryogenesis, less condensin I correlates with both increased loop size and increased length-wise compaction. Another recent study showed that immunodepletion of H1.8 from <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts decreased condensin I occupancy on sperm mitotic chromosomes, reducing their length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choppakatla et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, we found that an increase in condensin I could act independently of linker histone H1.8 to lengthen embryo chromosomes formed in egg extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>), suggesting that condensin I is the major scaling factor for mitotic chromosomes. The discrepancy between this study and the previous one suggests that the interplay between condensin I and H1.8 on mitotic chromosomes is more nuanced in vivo where total protein concentrations are constant during early cleavage divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). For example, other factors could act upstream of H1.8 to regulate condensin I loading. Our importin α data suggest that chromosome size can also be modulated by H1.8 alone, without any changes in condensin I abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that condensin I is not the only factor determining mitotic chromosome size in vivo. Together, our results reveal a more complex interplay among the factors that shape mitotic chromosomes than previously anticipated, some of which could also be cell-cycle dependent.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>N/C ratio as a universal mechanism for regulating chromatin structure during pre-ZGA cleavage divisions</title><p>Previous work in zebrafish and frogs suggested that progressive titration of maternal factors such as histone H3 due to increasing N/C ratio plays an important role in regulating the timing of Zygotic Genome Activation (ZGA) in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amodeo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>).

Together, these results suggest that N/C ratio could be a universal mechanism for regulating chromatin structure across the cell cycle, but for very different functions: transcriptional regulation during interphase and chromosome segregation during metaphase. Two recent studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish propose a model in which increasing nuclear import rates during early cleavage divisions triggers ZGA as the genome gains access to key pioneer factors that create open chromatin states permissive for transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shen et al., 2022</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alexander E Kelly (Reviewer #1); Jesse C Gatlin (Reviewer #2); Paul S Maddox (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors found that in vivo chromosome volume scales with spindle size, whereas in vitro chromosome length does not. It is possible that this discrepancy is due to differences in the nature of the metrics. The chromosome volumes were calculated from the entire metaphase plate which consists of all of the chromosomes whereas the lengths were measured on individual chromosomes after dilution with buffer. Prior experiments in egg extracts (PMID: 34406118) have shown that the removal of microtubules impacts mitotic chromosome volume by inducing inter-chromosomal entanglements. These entanglements can be relieved by dilution into buffer resulting in individualized chromosomes of apparent similar length. Thus it is possible that chromosome volume is regulated in multiple ways that scale with spindle size, whereas chromosome length is set independently of spindle size. Since it is chromosome volume that changes through developmental stages in vivo, it would be important to know if the presence of the spindle can override or alter the ability of the reported factors (N/C and importin-cargo) to influence chromosome length. If chromosome volumes instead of chromosome lengths are measured in the intact spindles in the experiments performed in Figure 3 (i.e. stage 8 or replicated sperm nuclei in metaphase egg extract), are the relative differences the same between nuclei sources as seen for chromosome length? Or do the spindle forces normalize the chromosome volumes between different nuclei sources?</p><p>2) Related to the above point: There are some concerns regarding the approach used by the authors to measure spindle and metaphase plate volumes in Figure 1, which could be assuaged by providing examples of reconstructed images used to make those measurements. Concerns are based in part on previously published 3-D reconstructions of confocal images of <italic>Xenopus</italic> spindles taken with a higher power objective, which showed a lot of space between chromosomes in the metaphase plate. Along these same lines, it is unclear why the circumference of the cell in the plane of the spindle was used to determine cell diameter. Why not use the largest cell area found in the z-stack instead to estimate the diameter?</p><p>3) When quantifying the fluorescence intensities of factors on chromatin (eg condensin I), the authors should provide plots of the background corrected intensities separately for each channel (e.g. condensin I and DNA) in the supplementary info. It is possible that the DNA dye does not bind to the chromosomes from different sources to the same extent, and thus normalizing by DNA stain may not be the best way to cast the data.</p><p>4) In lines 444-447 the authors state that &quot;Together these observations confirm that maternally loaded factors are titrated onto newly synthesized copies of the genome and that increasing N/C ratio is sufficient to shorten mitotic chromosomes, likely by decreasing levels of condensin I&quot;. However, in Figure 2C/D, they show that the addition of unreplicated sperm to stage 8 extract resulted in chromosome lengths that are similar to those observed when using sperm that has undergone replication in interphase extracts. This would suggest that it is something about the chromatin state (e.g. DNA methylation, histone modifications) that would need to survive maternal remodeling of the sperm chromatin rather than replication that is playing a role in setting chromosome length and condensin I levels. The authors should clarify this or provide evidence for prior replication in interphase in setting chromatid length.</p><p>5) It was sometimes hard to follow exactly how each experiment was performed due to the use of many different combinations of extracts, nuclei, and manipulations. The legends need to be more explicit or the methods section should be broken down into explicit sections for each experiment type (e.g. different nuclei in stage 8 extracts (Figure 2))</p><p>6) In regards to the two mechanisms for chromosome scaling, the logic of the abstract and flow of the paper should be made more clear, as it is essentially two stories. It would be helpful if the authors can discuss the interplay of the two mechanisms in the context of embryogenesis, as they both seem to have roughly the same effect on chromosome length in vitro (i.e. would one be predicted to have a stronger effect in vivo).</p><p>7) Based on spindle volume measurements, the authors state that size scaling occurs in cells up to 600 µm in diameter (contrary to results published by Wühr and colleagues). Little explanation is currently provided in the text, so please state how this limit was determined.</p><p>8) In Figure 1C, D, and Figure 1-S1A, B, why are the biggest cells found in stage 5 and not stage 3? This seems logically inconsistent with reductive divisions and is inconsistent with data shown from Levy and Jevtić. Please address this in the text.</p><p>9) Have karyotypes of mitotic chromosomes been published for cells at different stages of <italic>Xenopus</italic> development? If so, they should be referenced (and if not, a non-essential suggestion would be to include them to address single-cell variability in mitotic chromosome size).</p><p>10) The authors claim to have analyzed single chromosomes, but how was this determined in the absence of a kinetochore marker? Admittedly, in most images it's quite clear but in some, it's not (e.g. image in Figure 2C, &quot;replicated sperm chromosome&quot;. Previous works from the Heald lab used antibodies to INCENP to mark kinetochores and identify single chromosomes unambiguously. Please clarify in the text.</p><p>11) It is unclear how similar magnitudes in fold reduction in mitotic chromosome volume from stages 3-8 and in mitotic chromosome lengths during the same stages indicate that &quot;shortening of the long axis is the predominant metric underlying mitotic chromosome scaling during early embryogenesis&quot;. The authors should provide a more detailed rationale for this claim, particularly in the absence of any other chromosome size or shape metric.</p><p>12) The observations described in Figure 2B show that the median length of replicated sperm chromosomes formed in egg extracts was not statistically different than stage three mitotic chromosomes. The authors claim that this similarity, which might simply be a coincidence, demonstrates that replicated sperm chromosomes in egg extracts are a proxy for mitotic chromosome size during the &quot;earliest cell divisions&quot;. It is not clear that this claim is sufficiently founded – the authors need to explain how this conclusion was reached. Also, are these observations the only basis for the statement in line 238 which reads &quot;Robust recapitulation of chromosome scaling in metaphase arrested egg extracts enabled molecular-level analysis of potential scaling factors&quot;? Please clarify.</p><p>13) Condensin II can bind to chromosomes throughout the cell cycle, whereas condensin I is only present on chromosomes during mitosis. While perhaps outside of the scope of the current manuscript, the authors should consider measuring the levels of condensin II on both interphase nuclei and mitotic chromosomes in the experiments in Figure 3. As condensin II has been shown to influence condensin I function and can load during interphase, this seems like a key candidate that could drive chromosome length indirectly through condensin I. Alternatively, the authors should consider discussing this possibility in the text.</p><p>14) The authors should consider a Hi-C analysis of mitotic chromosomes treated with DMSO and palmostatin. Since condensin levels remain unchanged in the experiments, some quantitative differences in the resulting Hi-C map might validate the looping model. As an alternative, the authors should consider discussing how palmostatin treatment, i.e. the importin α pathway, affects chromatin structure.</p><p>15) Others have shown using nuclei assembled in droplets of <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extracts, that steady-state nuclear size is indeed dependent on the volume of extract in which the nuclei are assembled (e.g. Chen et al. 2019 &amp; Leech et al. 2022). The authors should acknowledge these data and address the discrepancy with their results.</p><p>16) The authors do not reference Conklin 1912(or 15?) for the first reported observation of chromosome size scaling. This historical point is important and should be retained in the literature.</p><p>17) The blot in figure 5s3 is difficult to see and should be fixed.</p><p>18) Some of the graphs are pixelated and should be imported in a manner that retains readability.</p><p>19) The results in the abstract need to be more clearly stated. For instance, the second to last sentence in the abstract is vague, stating that mitotic chromosomes scale through x and y. Which way do they scale, is it larger or smaller? Maybe say scale to match cell size?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors found that in vivo chromosome volume scales with spindle size, whereas in vitro chromosome length does not.

Taking advantage of the unique toolset in this system, the authors conclude nicely that condensin I levels directly correlate with chromosome size. Further, importin levels decrease leading to axial shortening of chromosomes during development. The combined physical outcome is that Mitotic Chromatin looping changes, resulting in axial compression of chromosomes. I have no major issues with this paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84360.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors found that in vivo chromosome volume scales with spindle size, whereas in vitro chromosome length does not. It is possible that this discrepancy is due to differences in the nature of the metrics. The chromosome volumes were calculated from the entire metaphase plate which consists of all of the chromosomes whereas the lengths were measured on individual chromosomes after dilution with buffer. Prior experiments in egg extracts (PMID: 34406118) have shown that the removal of microtubules impacts mitotic chromosome volume by inducing inter-chromosomal entanglements. These entanglements can be relieved by dilution into buffer resulting in individualized chromosomes of apparent similar length. Thus it is possible that chromosome volume is regulated in multiple ways that scale with spindle size, whereas chromosome length is set independently of spindle size. Since it is chromosome volume that changes through developmental stages in vivo, it would be important to know if the presence of the spindle can override or alter the ability of the reported factors (N/C and importin-cargo) to influence chromosome length. If chromosome volumes instead of chromosome lengths are measured in the intact spindles in the experiments performed in Figure 3 (i.e. stage 8 or replicated sperm nuclei in metaphase egg extract), are the relative differences the same between nuclei sources as seen for chromosome length? Or do the spindle forces normalize the chromosome volumes between different nuclei sources?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important point. We have now measured metaphase plate volumes in spindles formed from either replicated sperm or stage 8 embryo nuclei in egg extracts. Since embryo nuclei contain both the maternal and paternal copies of the genome, thus doubling chromosome number compared to replicated sperm nuclei, we reasoned that if the 2-fold decrease in chromosome length observed at stage 8 was retained in the context of metaphase plate volumes in an intact spindle formed in vitro, we would expect to observe similar metaphase plate volumes in the two samples. However, we measured a ~1.3-fold increase (over 4 biological replicates) in metaphase plate volume in spindles formed using embryo nuclei compared to those formed with sperm nuclei, indicating that total embryo chromosome volumes are greater than expected in vitro compared to in vivo (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that the spindle may indeed influence mitotic chromosome size in egg extracts, but there are several technical problems that complicate interpretation of this experiment. Unlike in vivo structure sizes quantified in Figure 1, chromosomes in spindles formed in egg extracts are more heterogenous, often misaligning at the metaphase plate, especially the long, replicated sperm chromosomes. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that the difference in metaphase plate volumes we observe is actually due to differences in chromosome alignment and/or inter-chromosomal packing, both which would affect segmentation of metaphase plates. Furthermore, the buffers and procedures used to fix and spin down single chromosomes vs. whole spindles are different, which could also complicate interpretation of this new data in the context of single-chromosome measurements. Due to these caveats, which would be laborious and distracting to explain in the main text, we have decided not to include these new data in the paper. Instead, we have clearly distinguished experiments comparing metaphase plate volumes from single chromosome measurements and do not draw any quantitative conclusions when comparing in vivo and in vitro data (also mentioned in reviewer point 2).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Metaphase plate volume measurements of stage 8 embryo nuclei and sperm nuclei within spindles formed in egg extract.</title><p>Since embryo nuclei contain both maternal and paternal genomes, a similar metaphase plate size would indicate a 2-fold decrease in volume for embryo chromosomes. However, median embryo metaphase plate volumes are 1.3fold larger, indicating that metaphase plate volumes follow the same trend but do not quantitatively recapitulate scaling of individual mitotic chromosomes. See text above for additional explanation. n = 4 biological replicates.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84360-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the above point: There are some concerns regarding the approach used by the authors to measure spindle and metaphase plate volumes in Figure 1, which could be assuaged by providing examples of reconstructed images used to make those measurements. Concerns are based in part on previously published 3-D reconstructions of confocal images of <italic>Xenopus</italic> spindles taken with a higher power objective, which showed a lot of space between chromosomes in the metaphase plate. Along these same lines, it is unclear why the circumference of the cell in the plane of the spindle was used to determine cell diameter. Why not use the largest cell area found in the z-stack instead to estimate the diameter?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that using metaphase plate volume measurements as a proxy for degree of mitotic chromosome condensation is potentially complicated by inter-chromosomal space. The imaging in this experiment was under low magnification (10x objective), so we did not observe any obvious holes in the metaphase plate, but it is likely that they do exist. This issue emphasizes the value of our approach of using egg and embryo extracts to examine how individual mitotic chromosomes scale, rather than drawing conclusions based on in vivo metaphase plate measurements. We have now provided example z-stacks and a 3D reconstruction of our segmentation in the supplement (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We have also removed all language that quantitatively compares the results of the whole embryo IF experiments in Figure 1 with the scaling of individual mitotic chromosomes in vitro described in subsequent figures.</p><p>The previous method description was incorrect. We indeed used the z-stack with the largest cell area to calculate cell diameter which is now corrected in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) When quantifying the fluorescence intensities of factors on chromatin (eg condensin I), the authors should provide plots of the background corrected intensities separately for each channel (e.g. condensin I and DNA) in the supplementary info. It is possible that the DNA dye does not bind to the chromosomes from different sources to the same extent, and thus normalizing by DNA stain may not be the best way to cast the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added background corrected raw intensities for each channel as supplemental figures (Figure 3—figure supplement 3, 4, 6; Figure 5—figure supplement 2, Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In lines 444-447 the authors state that &quot;Together these observations confirm that maternally loaded factors are titrated onto newly synthesized copies of the genome and that increasing N/C ratio is sufficient to shorten mitotic chromosomes, likely by decreasing levels of condensin I&quot;. However, in Figure 2C/D, they show that the addition of unreplicated sperm to stage 8 extract resulted in chromosome lengths that are similar to those observed when using sperm that has undergone replication in interphase extracts. This would suggest that it is something about the chromatin state (e.g. DNA methylation, histone modifications) that would need to survive maternal remodeling of the sperm chromatin rather than replication that is playing a role in setting chromosome length and condensin I levels. The authors should clarify this or provide evidence for prior replication in interphase in setting chromatid length.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s interpretation of our results presented here, except that we do not specifically invoke replication as the process during interphase that resets chromosome length. To clarify this point, we have added new data showing that adding sperm nuclei at two different N/C ratios directly to metaphase egg extracts, thus skipping interphase, does not lead to any change in chromosome size (Figure 5—figure supplement 4B). These data suggest that replication is an important step in setting mitotic chromosome size in the ensuing metaphase, but more work will be required to confirm this hypothesis, which is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It was sometimes hard to follow exactly how each experiment was performed due to the use of many different combinations of extracts, nuclei, and manipulations. The legends need to be more explicit or the methods section should be broken down into explicit sections for each experiment type (e.g. different nuclei in stage 8 extracts (Figure 2))</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have edited the text for clarity and re-organized the methods section to match the order of experiments presented in the paper, with the figure number explicitly labeled in the title of each section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In regards to the two mechanisms for chromosome scaling, the logic of the abstract and flow of the paper should be made more clear, as it is essentially two stories. It would be helpful if the authors can discuss the interplay of the two mechanisms in the context of embryogenesis, as they both seem to have roughly the same effect on chromosome length in vitro (i.e. would one be predicted to have a stronger effect in vivo).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that examining the interplay between the two mechanisms, ideally in an embryo, is a worthwhile and fascinating future direction. Since the manipulations that led to these two models were all performed in vitro, we hesitate to interpret the magnitude of the two effects as potentially additive in vivo, and rather simply state that the N/C ratio pathway is set during interphase and the cell size pathway is set during metaphase. We added some speculation that perhaps mitotic chromosome size is primarily set by the N/C ratio pathway, but the importin a partitioning pathway ensures that mitotic chromosome size is coordinated with spindle size, which has been proposed to be important to prevent chromosome missegregation. We have edited the discussion to include some of these ideas (page 16, lines 387392).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Based on spindle volume measurements, the authors state that size scaling occurs in cells up to 600 µm in diameter (contrary to results published by Wühr and colleagues). Little explanation is currently provided in the text, so please state how this limit was determined.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the 600 µm limit was somewhat arbitrary. We have now removed this number from the main text (line 106) and modified our language to focus on our major conclusion that scaling of spindles in 3 dimensions does not appear to reach an upper limit as previously reported in <italic>Xenopus</italic> for spindle length (Wühr et al., 2008., Figure 1— Supplement 2A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 1C, D, and Figure 1-S1A, B, why are the biggest cells found in stage 5 and not stage 3? This seems logically inconsistent with reductive divisions and is inconsistent with data shown from Levy and Jevtić. Please address this in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is counterintuitive. Measuring cell size in stage 5 and stage 3 embryos is significantly more challenging than in later stages due to the thickness of the sample and the elongated shape of the cells, making it more difficult to approximate them as spheres. Jevtić and Levy had performed these measurements on dissociated blastomeres rather than in intact embryos, which helped alleviate these challenges.</p><p>To address this point, we have now included a third biological replicate in our data and reanalyzed all of our stage 3 and 5 samples. Taken together, these new data show that despite some variability, the largest cells are found in stage 3 embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Have karyotypes of mitotic chromosomes been published for cells at different stages of <italic>Xenopus</italic> development? If so, they should be referenced (and if not, a non-essential suggestion would be to include them to address single-cell variability in mitotic chromosome size).</p></disp-quote><p>A previous study from our lab (Kieserman and Heald, 2011) found that using established methods to prepare karyotypes from cleavage stage embryos, which requires generating chromosome spreads though harsh fixation with acetic acid and methanol, distorted mitotic chromosome morphology such that scaling was not observable in the early embryo. The only published karyotypes we found compared blastula to the tadpole stage, which is days later in development (Micheli et al., 1993). Thus, in vitro systems using egg and embryo extracts amenable to more gentle fixatives is our method of choice for observing physiological single chromosome scaling during cleavage divisions that recapitulates the overall magnitude of metaphase plate scaling in vivo. We have stated this logic explicitly in the methods section (Page 22, lines 494-497).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors claim to have analyzed single chromosomes, but how was this determined in the absence of a kinetochore marker? Admittedly, in most images it's quite clear but in some, it's not (e.g. image in Figure 2C, &quot;replicated sperm chromosome&quot;. Previous works from the Heald lab used antibodies to INCENP to mark kinetochores and identify single chromosomes unambiguously. Please clarify in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a section in the methods that explicitly states how single chromosomes were chosen for analysis (Page 26, lines 591-594).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) It is unclear how similar magnitudes in fold reduction in mitotic chromosome volume from stages 3-8 and in mitotic chromosome lengths during the same stages indicate that &quot;shortening of the long axis is the predominant metric underlying mitotic chromosome scaling during early embryogenesis&quot;. The authors should provide a more detailed rationale for this claim, particularly in the absence of any other chromosome size or shape metric.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include measurements of chromosome widths of stage 3 and stage 8 chromosomes isolated from embryo extracts (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) and show that chromosomes increase slightly (1.2-fold) in width as they scale smaller. We have now modified the text to include these data, which support our conclusion that chromosomes scale smaller during development primarily through length-wise compaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The observations described in Figure 2B show that the median length of replicated sperm chromosomes formed in egg extracts was not statistically different than stage three mitotic chromosomes. The authors claim that this similarity, which might simply be a coincidence, demonstrates that replicated sperm chromosomes in egg extracts are a proxy for mitotic chromosome size during the &quot;earliest cell divisions&quot;. It is not clear that this claim is sufficiently founded – the authors need to explain how this conclusion was reached. Also, are these observations the only basis for the statement in line 238 which reads &quot;Robust recapitulation of chromosome scaling in metaphase arrested egg extracts enabled molecular-level analysis of potential scaling factors&quot;? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for reminding us of this important point. To reiterate our logic, in vivo measurements demonstrated scaling of metaphase plate volumes, with a 2-3-fold decrease during early cleavage divisions (Figure 1), and consistent with observations that single endogenous mitotic chromosomes isolated from stage 8 embryo extracts were 2-fold shorter than those isolated from stage 3 embryos (Figure 2). Both the fold difference and the distribution of absolute lengths were preserved when substituting sperm chromosomes for stage 3 embryo nuclei in vitro. We agree that comparing stage 3 and stage 8 embryo nuclei would be preferable, but because of the low number of nuclei (4!) per embryo at this stage, we could not easily compare endogenous mitotic chromosomes by imaging, since it was impossible equalize nuclei concentration between stage 3 and stage 8 samples on coverslips, which we empirically discovered to be important for preventing artefacts during immunofluorescence. Nor could we isolate enough nuclei from stage 3 for in vitro reactions. Thus, reviewers are correct that we cannot rule out inherent differences between replicated sperm and embryo chromatin.</p><p>For these reasons, performing immunofluorescence of sperm vs. embryo chromosomes formed in egg extracts was the best that we could do considering technical limitations. We have softened the language to state that sperm chromosomes may serve as a proxy for early embryo chromosomes (page 6, lines 136-137) and now mention this caveat to our methods in the discussion (page 16, lines 385-387).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Condensin II can bind to chromosomes throughout the cell cycle, whereas condensin I is only present on chromosomes during mitosis. While perhaps outside of the scope of the current manuscript, the authors should consider measuring the levels of condensin II on both interphase nuclei and mitotic chromosomes in the experiments in Figure 3. As condensin II has been shown to influence condensin I function and can load during interphase, this seems like a key candidate that could drive chromosome length indirectly through condensin I. Alternatively, the authors should consider discussing this possibility in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and now include data showing that embryo chromosomes recruit less condensin II than replicated sperm chromosomes in egg extracts (Figure 3—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The authors should consider a Hi-C analysis of mitotic chromosomes treated with DMSO and palmostatin. Since condensin levels remain unchanged in the experiments, some quantitative differences in the resulting Hi-C map might validate the looping model. As an alternative, the authors should consider discussing how palmostatin treatment, i.e. the importin α pathway, affects chromatin structure.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed immunofluorescence for additional scaling factors on DMSO- and palmostatin-treated chromosomes, revealing that the only factor that changed significantly was histone H1.8 (Figure 6D). Based on our model of how importin a partitioning regulates subcellular scaling, this result suggested that H1.8 could be a potential mitotic cargo. In this model, as cell SA/V increases during cleavage divisions, a greater fraction of palmitoylated importin a associates with the cell membrane, freeing additional H1.8 to shrink mitotic chromosomes. Our finding that short embryo chromosomes have higher levels of H1.8 than long sperm chromosomes is also consistent with this model. However, it remains unclear whether H1.8 is a bona fide importin a cargo in egg extracts, since importin 7/importin β has been reported to transport linker histones to the nucleus (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10228156/). Further work will be required to confirm if H1.8 is a bona fide cargo of importin a, or if a more complicated mechanism is at play.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Others have shown using nuclei assembled in droplets of <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extracts, that steady-state nuclear size is indeed dependent on the volume of extract in which the nuclei are assembled (e.g. Chen et al. 2019 &amp; Leech et al. 2022). The authors should acknowledge these data and address the discrepancy with their results.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include these references when interpreting our nuclear titration results (page 12 lines 284-289).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) The authors do not reference Conklin 1912(or 15?) for the first reported observation of chromosome size scaling. This historical point is important and should be retained in the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include this reference in the introduction (line 46).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) The blot in figure 5s3 is difficult to see and should be fixed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the Western blots with two biological replicates and now include clearer images in the manuscript (Figure 5—figure supplement 4A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) Some of the graphs are pixelated and should be imported in a manner that retains readability.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-loaded every plot as high-resolution PNG files in this draft.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) The results in the abstract need to be more clearly stated. For instance, the second to last sentence in the abstract is vague, stating that mitotic chromosomes scale through x and y. Which way do they scale, is it larger or smaller? Maybe say scale to match cell size?</p></disp-quote><p>We have altered the language in the abstract and throughout the paper to be more precise when referring to scaling.</p></body></sub-article></article>
