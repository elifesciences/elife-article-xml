rearrangements to produce infectious particles. HIV-1 contains an assembly and maturation switch that spans the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the capsid (CA) region and the first spacer peptide (SP1) of the precursor structural protein, Gag. The crystal structure of the CTD-SP1 Gag fragment is a goblet-shaped hexamer in which the cup comprises the CTD and an ensuing type II β-turn, and the stem comprises a 6-helix bundle. The β-turn is critical for immature virus assembly and the 6-helix bundle regulates proteolysis during maturation. This bipartite character explains why the SP1 spacer is a critical element of HIV-1 Gag but is not a universal property of retroviruses. Our results also indicate that HIV-1 maturation inhibitors suppress unfolding of the CA-SP1 junction and thereby delay access of the viral protease to its substrate.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17063.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17063.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17063.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses like HIV must undergo a process called maturation in order to successfully infect cells. Maturation involves a dramatic rearrangement in the architecture of the virus. That is to say, the virus’s internal protein coat – called the capsid – must change from an immature sphere into a mature cone-shaped coat. Notably, this maturation process is what is disrupted by the protease inhibitors that are a major component of anti-HIV drug cocktails.</p><p>Structural changes in small portions of the capsid protein, termed molecular switches, commonly trigger the viral capsids to reorganize. The HIV capsid has two of these switches, and Wagner, Zadrozny et al. set out to understand how one of them – called the CA-SP1 switch – works.</p><p>Solving the three-dimensional structure of the immature form of the CA-SP1 switch revealed that it forms a well-structured bundle of six helices. This helical bundle captures another section of the capsid protein that would otherwise be cut by a viral protease. The CA-SP1 switch therefore controls how quickly the protein is cut and the start of the maturation process.</p><p>Wagner, Zadrozny et al. then discovered that other small molecule inhibitors of HIV, called maturation inhibitors, work by binding to and disrupting the transformation of the CA-SP1 switch. Finally, further experiments showed that the formation of the CA-SP1 helical bundle controls when the immature capsid shell forms and coordinates the process with the capsid gaining the genetic material of the virus.</p><p>The new structure means that researchers now know what the HIV capsid looks like at the start and end of maturation. The next challenge will be to figure out exactly how the capsid changes from one form to the next as HIV matures.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17063.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17063.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>capsid</kwd><kwd>assembly</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM066087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yeager</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Ganser-Pornillos</surname><given-names>Barbie K</given-names></name><name><surname>Pornillos</surname><given-names>Owen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50-GM082545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yeager</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50-GM103297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pornillos</surname><given-names>Owen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32-GM115007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>Jonathan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Folding and unfolding of a 6-helix bundle controls HIV assembly and maturation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Assembly and maturation of HIV-1 and other retroviruses is driven by the viral structural polyprotein, Gag, which consists of a series of independently folding domains, called MA (matrix), CA (capsid), and NC (nucleocapsid) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bush and Vogt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lingappa et al., 2014</xref>). During assembly, Gag makes a spherical, immature capsid shell that packages the viral genome, directs interactions with the plasma membrane to promote envelopment, and recruits cellular machinery to release the new virus particle from the host cell. The Gag shell has hexagonal paracrystalline lattice symmetry, wherein the central CA region makes two layers of interactions through its two domains (NTD and CTD, for N-terminal and C-terminal domain). During maturation, Gag is cleaved by the viral protease at specific sites. This results in disassembly of the Gag shell and release of new structural proteins, which then rearrange into the mature, infectious virion. In the mature virion, the genome is repackaged inside a cone-shaped capsid made up of the CA protein, with the NTD forming hexameric or pentameric rings that are connected by the CTD.</p><p>As with other animal viruses, the large-scale capsid rearrangements that occur during retroviral maturation are associated with the operation of structural switches that undergo dramatic conformational changes. In HIV-1, two such putative switches flank the CA region of Gag. One switch spans the MA-CA junction, which is in an extended configuration in the immature virion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kelly et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tang et al., 2002</xref>). Upon proteolysis, the new CA N-terminus folds into a β-hairpin stabilized by a buried salt bridge between the new N-terminal proline and a conserved aspartate residue and promotes assembly of the mature capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gitti et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">von Schwedler et al., 1998</xref>). A second putative switch spans the junction between CA and the first spacer peptide (SP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gross et al., 2000</xref>). The CA-SP1 junction is predicted to fold into an α-helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accola et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2002</xref>), and forms the binding site of so-called 'maturation inhibitors,' as exemplified by 3-O-(3’,3’-dimethylsuccinyl)betulinic acid (bevirimat) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Adamson et al., 2009</xref>). These inhibitors delay proteolysis of the CA-SP1 junction and induce aberrant maturation. The importance of the CA-SP1 junction as a regulator of proteolysis during maturation is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kräusslich et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pettit et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wiegers et al., 1998</xref>), but the molecular basis of this function has been unknown.</p><p>Mutagenesis studies also indicate that the CA-SP1 junction is important for assembly of the immature HIV-1 Gag shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accola et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Al-Mawsawi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Datta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kräusslich et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Melamed et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pettit et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rihn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">von Schwedler et al., 2003</xref>). Low resolution electron microscopy studies indicate that the junction forms what appears to be a pillar of density or helical bundle, and so is likely to stabilize the Gag lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schur et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schur et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wright et al., 2007</xref>). However, neither the SP1 spacer nor the putative helical bundle is a universal feature of retroviral Gag shells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bharat et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that the SP1 spacer is not generally important for Gag assembly, or that perhaps the CA-SP1 junction has another, as yet structurally undefined assembly determinant.</p><p>Structural studies of the HIV-1 CA-SP1 junction in context of longer Gag fragments (CTD-SP1 and CTD-SP1-NC) have shown that the junction is primarily disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Newman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Worthylake et al., 1999</xref>). Nevertheless, the backbone NMR chemical shifts of junction residues deviate from expected random coil values, indicating a small propensity towards an α-helical conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Newman et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, the isolated SP1 peptide displays concentration dependent secondary structure in aqueous solution, and folds into an α-helix at the millimolar protein concentrations found in virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Datta et al., 2011</xref>). Nucleic acids (both RNA and DNA) can promote Gag assembly in vitro, presumably because of proximity-induced interactions between multiple copies of Gag that bind to the same nucleic acid molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Campbell and Rein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Campbell and Vogt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gross et al., 2000</xref>). It therefore seems that nucleic acid-induced Gag clustering might also promote folding of the SP1 helix.</p><p>To learn how the CA-SP1 junction functions as a molecular switch during HIV-1 assembly and maturation, we determined the structure of its immature, assembled form by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 3.27 Å. Our analysis elucidates how local conformational changes in the CA-SP1 switch promote Gag assembly, drive large-scale capsid rearrangements, and regulate proteolysis during maturation. We also gained new insights on the mechanism of action of maturation inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HIV-1 CA CTD-SP1 recapitulates the immature Gag lattice</title><p>In the immature HIV-1 Gag shell, the NTD, CTD, and SP1 regions form three layers of lattice-stabilizing interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schur et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wright et al., 2007</xref>). The CTD-SP1 fragment of HIV-1 Gag contains the minimal information required to assemble the immature lattice, whereas the NTD is dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accola et al., 2000</xref>). Accordingly, we found that purified CTD-SP1 protein assembled in vitro into flat sheets with the subunits organized into a hexagonal lattice with the expected unit cell spacing of the CTD layer of the immature Gag lattice (~74 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wright et al., 2007</xref> ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then performed crystallization screens using a large number of commercial and in-house precipitants. We obtained many crystal hits, but invariably these were of the mature-like dimer form of the CTD with disordered SP1 tails, as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Worthylake et al., 1999</xref>). Using electron diffraction, we identified small and scarce plate crystals that gave a hexagonal diffraction pattern and unit cell spacing close to 70 Å (not shown). Upon optimization, these crystals diffracted X-rays to about 3.27 Å resolution (mean I/σI ≥ 1), and we determined the crystal structure to <italic>R/R</italic><sub>free</sub> values of 0.246/0.278 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis is that these crystals were rare because the CA-SP1 junction residues had to fold and become ordered during crystallization. We speculate that this rate limiting step of crystallization reflects the behavior of the junction during assembly of HIV-1 Gag.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17063.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Structure statistics for HIV-1 Gag CTD-SP1.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17063.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17063.003</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" valign="top"><bold>Diffraction</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Beamline</td><td valign="top">APS 22ID</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Wavelength (Å)</td><td valign="top">1.0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Processing program</td><td valign="top">HKL2000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Space group</td><td valign="top">C2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell dimensions</td><td valign="top"><italic>a</italic> = 70.96 Å</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>b</italic> = 122.73 Å</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>c</italic> = 85.41 Å</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">α = γ = 90°, β = 94.3°</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Resolution range, Å</td><td valign="top">50-3.27 (3.42-3.27)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>R</italic><sub>merge</sub> / <italic>R</italic><sub>pim</sub></td><td valign="top">0.22 (0.74) / 0.11 (0.47)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Mean I/σ&lt;I&gt;</td><td valign="top">5.99 (1.28)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Completeness,%</td><td valign="top">87.0 (66.4)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Average redundancy</td><td valign="top">3.7 (2.5)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Wilson B-factor, Å<sup>2</sup></td><td valign="top">85.21</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top"><bold>Refinement</bold></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Refinement program</td><td valign="top">PHENIX</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Resolution range</td><td valign="top">42.59-3.27 (3.45-3.27)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">No. of unique reflections</td><td valign="top">9,710 (908)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Reflections in free set</td><td valign="top">1,009 (88)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>R</italic><sub>work</sub></td><td valign="top">0.246 (0.369)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub></td><td valign="top">0.278 (0.408)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top"><bold>No. of nonhydrogen atoms</bold></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> protein</td><td valign="top">3,865</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> solvent</td><td valign="top">0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top"><italic>Average B-factor, Å<sup>2</sup></italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> protein</td><td valign="top">84.09</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> solvent</td><td valign="top">n/a</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">Coordinate deviations</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> bond lengths, Å</td><td valign="top">0.003</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> bond angles, °</td><td valign="top">0.513</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top"><bold>Validation and Deposition</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top"><italic>Ramachandran plot</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> favored,%</td><td valign="top">98.9</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> outliers,%</td><td valign="top">0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">MolProbity clash score</td><td valign="top">0.13</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">PDB ID</td><td valign="top">5I4T</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><p>Values in parenthesis are for the highest resolution shell.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>The CTD-SP1 plate crystals were made up of stacked sheets of flat hexagonal lattices, with each sheet consisting of CTD-SP1 hexamers connected by CTD dimer linkages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our structure therefore represents a flattened version of the immature HIV-1 Gag lattice. The entire CTD-SP1 hexamer – including both the main CTD fold and ordered SP1 residues – gave an excellent fit to an 8.8 Å resolution cryoEM map of the immature HIV-1 Gag lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schur et al., 2015b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The dimer also gave a good fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>), but in this case the SP1 helix was more laterally displaced from its corresponding density in the cryoEM map (asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This is likely because the cryoEM structure is of a curved Gag lattice, whereas our crystal structure is of a flat lattice. To gain insight on how loss of curvature in our crystal lattice is accommodated by the subunits, we superimposed the crystal structure with the model reported by Schur et al., which was created by flexible fitting of the main CTD fold (but not the CA-SP1 junction) into the cryoEM map (PDB 4USN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schur et al., 2015b</xref>). We found that superposition of the hexamer units resulted in an average root mean square displacement of 1.92 Å over equivalent Cα atoms, whereas superposition of the dimers resulted in a comparable displacement of 1.93 Å. We therefore surmise that any changes in tertiary or quaternary structure that were caused by flattening of the lattice in our crystals have been dispersed across the subunits. Unlike the mature capsid, which contains sharp pentameric declinations and a variably curving lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ganser et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>), the immature HIV-1 Gag shell is a more smoothly curving sphere that is interrupted by large discontinuities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Briggs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wright et al., 2007</xref>).

Proteolytic processing occurs at different rates, with the CTD-SP1 junction processed with the slowest rate, and the downstream SP1-NC junction the fastest (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). The C-terminal boundary of the junction helix tracks precisely with sequence conservation; downstream residues that are disordered in our crystal structure are not conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This is consistent with the notion that the downstream SP1-NC junction has the fastest rate of processing because it is disordered in the immature virion.</p><p>In our structure, the scissile bond (between Leu363 and Ala364) is located inside the helical barrel (yellow spheres in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), where it is sequestered within a pocket covered by a methionine sidechain (Met367) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). When the CA-SP1 junction binds to PR, it adopts a fully extended, β-strand configuration wherein sidechains on either side of the scissile bond occupy sub-pockets within the enzyme active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prabu-Jeyabalan et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, right). In the CTD-SP1 hexamer, these same sidechains mediate the 'knobs-in-holes' interactions of the 6-helix bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, left). Therefore, for PR to gain access to its substrate, the 6-helix bundle must unfold. Since proteolysis rates for the different cleavage sites are comparable when measured with peptide substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), the rate limiting step for the CA-SP1 site is unfolding of the 6-helix bundle. This explains why the CA-SP1 junction displays the slowest rate of proteolysis and is the final trigger that elicits HIV-1 maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The β-turn organizes multiple hexamer-stabilizing elements</title><p>Our structure revealed a second structural component of the CA-SP1 switch, which consists of five amino acid residues that connect the main fold of the CTD and the junction helix (<sub>352</sub>GVGGP<sub>356</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

In contrast, virtually all of the 19 single-point mutations in the structured region of the CA-SP1 switch (residues 352–370) resulted in aberrantly assembled particles and/or protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Two exceptions were G357A and K359A, both of which are located near the N-terminal end of the junction helix. The G357A phenotype was not unexpected because this is a polymorphic position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). K359A, on the other hand, replaced a lysine residue lining the inside of the helical barrel with a hydrophobic residue, and the substitution may have eliminated clashes between like charges inside the 6-helix bundle. Thick-walled immature VLPs were also obtained with the S368A mutation near the C-terminal end of the junction helix.</p><p>Apart from residues close to the C-terminal end of the junction helix, many of the switch mutants appeared to behave in an 'all-or-none' manner (i.e., they either assembled immature VLPs or aberrantly), indicating that both the β-turn and junction helix must be functional for assembly to occur in vitro. Such a behavior was unexpected because in high-order assembly systems, local defects in protein-protein interactions are typically buffered by cooperativity. Therefore, the 'all-or-none' behavior must be due to a defect in nucleation. To test this idea more rigorously, we used tartrate salts to induce assembly of the △MA-CA-SP1-NC VLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The absence of nucleic acids ensured that nucleation was triggered only by protein-protein interactions. In this format, most of the CA-SP1 switch mutants again failed to form immature VLPs, but now instead assembled efficiently into thin-walled mature-like particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The same phenotype is observed when the entire SP1 spacer is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gross et al., 2000</xref>). Since junction residues downstream of the main CTD fold are not required for assembly of the mature lattice and are almost certainly unfolded in the thin-walled particles, these results further indicate that nucleation of the immature particles requires folding of both the β-turn and junction helix.</p><p>Some of the mutants formed both immature VLPs and mature particles in the presence of tartrate, in similar proportions (R286A, G357A, K359A, R361A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Examination of well-separated particles indicated that each particle was either immature-like or mature-like, i.e., we did not observe ones that were partly thin-walled and partly thick-walled. We believe that this is an important observation, because it indicates that the identity of the particle is established at nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gross et al., 2000</xref>), and is more supportive of a disassembly/reassembly pathway of HIV-1 capsid maturation than a displacive or condensation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keller et al., 2013</xref>). Another notable mutant was K359A, which assembled into immature VLPs in the presence of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), but assembled into predominantly mature-like particles by the tartrate method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results indicate that, although the HIV-1 Gag protein does not require nucleic acid to assemble into immature particles in vitro, folding of the CA-SP1 switch can be promoted by nucleic acid, likely due to clustering.</p><p>We then extended our alanine scan to include SP1 residues downstream of the junction helix (residues 371–377). As expected, all of these mutants were competent to form immature VLPs in the presence of DNA, but surprisingly, were still significantly impaired in assembly efficiency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). By the tartrate method, the mutants formed both mature and immature VLPs, with the exception of P373A, which was predominantly mature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5— figure supplement 2</xref>). Our interpretation of these results is that, even though the C-terminal end of SP1 is not highly conserved in sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), the mutants were still defective in folding of the CA-SP1 junction, and again, nucleic acid (DNA) can partially compensate for the folding defect. Alternatively, it is possible that the helical character of SP1 extends downstream all the way to the NC domain, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morellet et al., 2005</xref>). However, our crystal structure, the cryoEM reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1 —figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schur et al., 2015a</xref>), and sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) appear to be in good agreement as to the boundaries of the junction helix. We therefore conclude that our structure defines the core helical bundle, although an extended helix may occur in a fraction of Gag molecules, for example the ones that nucleate assembly.</p><p>Finally, we tested mutations at the MHR loop (P289A, K290A) and the 9/10 loop (P328A, D329A) that surround the Val353 pocket at the bottom of the CTD. These mutants behaved in a similar way as the β-turn and junction helix mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). These results confirm that binding of Val353 to the bottom of the CTD – and by inference, proper folding of the β-turn – is a critical step in nucleation of the immature VLPs. We speculate that the valine pocket at the bottom of the CTD functions as a folding chamber or 'chaperone' for the β-turn.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our crystal structure of CTD-SP1 represents the highest resolution structure of the immature HIV-1 Gag lattice to date, and confirms prediction that the CA-SP1 junction forms a 6-helix bundle to sequester the PR cleavage site. The CA-SP1 junction elicits the slowest rate of proteolysis during maturation because the 6-helix bundle must unfold to bind PR. Binding energy might be sufficient to induce unfolding, but this may be unlikely since PR has low intrinsic affinity for its substrates (mM range in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pettit et al., 1994</xref>)). Another attractive possibility is that PR gains substrate access by transient, cooperative unfolding and refolding of the 6-helix bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bush and Vogt, 2014</xref>). Our proposed mechanism is analogous to the predicted transient unfolding of the collagen triple helix that permits cleavage by matrix metalloproteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu and Stultz, 2013</xref>). In non-enveloped viruses, such a mechanism allows surface exposure of otherwise internal and structured capsid protein segments, which then permits access to antibodies and exogenously added proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bothner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis also supports a model wherein maturation inhibitors like bevirimat deny PR access, not by sequestering the scissile bond (the 6-helix bundle already does this), but rather by stabilizing the 6-helix bundle and inhibiting its unfolding. This model predicts that resistance can develop by means of mutations that destabilize the junction. Such mutations would enhance proteolysis in the absence of the maturation inhibitor, and indeed this seems to be a general property of well-characterized escape mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Adamson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sakalian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2004</xref>). In fact, some escape mutations that have been selected for in tissue culture appear to destabilize the Gag hexamer altogether, and the mutant viruses become dependent on the inhibitor to assemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waki et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, mutations that stabilize the 6-helix bundle would be expected to inhibit proteolysis even in the absence of inhibitor. One such mutation is T371I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fontana et al., 2015</xref>). This residue immediately follows the junction helix, and we speculate that the isoleucine substitution stabilizes and extends the helix. Extending the helix will place this sidechain inside the barrel underneath a ring of methionine residues, where it can provide additional non-native hydrophobic contacts. We have not yet been able to determine whether bevirimat binds outside or inside the bundle, but the compound has been crosslinked to both the junction helix and the MHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2011</xref>), which seems consistent with the second possibility.</p><p>Another important finding in this study is that the HIV-1 CA-SP1 switch has a second structural component: a β-turn that connects the junction helix to the main CTD fold. The β-turn is almost completely buried within an assembly-induced pocket surrounded by three adjacent subunits. Both its location and the fact that it interacts with 7 other hexamer-stabilizing structural elements indicate that the β-turn is a critical Gag assembly determinant, and may act as a 'clasp' that locks the interactions.</p><p>Although our in vitro assembly experiments indicated that virtually the entire CA-SP1 switch region is intolerant of mutations, we did observe that assembly defects were graded – the most severe mutations mapped to the β-turn and severity fell off towards the C-terminus of the junction helix (i.e., the SP1 spacer). A similar trend has been observed in previous studies, and indeed, the gradation in assembly defect is significantly more pronounced in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accola et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Al-Mawsawi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Datta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kräusslich et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Melamed et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rihn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">von Schwedler et al., 2003</xref>). For example, HIV-1 Gag that completely lacks the SP1 spacer can still assemble into large, membrane-associated patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kräusslich et al., 1995</xref>), whereas β-turn mutants do not form plasma membrane-associated patches and remain diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liang et al., 2003</xref>). These observations indicate that SP1 is not strictly required for the fundamental higher-order self-association property of HIV-1 Gag. On the other hand, the β-turn is required very early in assembly, perhaps during nucleation of the viral particle.</p><p>In context of full-length HIV-1 Gag, the entire CA-SP1 switch region was suggested to be unstructured but with weak helical propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Newman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Worthylake et al., 1999</xref>). A fully folded β-turn (but not junction helix) was also observed in the crystal structure of the immature-like dimer form of the CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bartonova et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore speculate that in the unassembled, soluble Gag protein, the β-turn fluctuates between folded and unfolded states, and that the entire CA-SP1 junction folds only upon assembly of the immature lattice. Since we found that an intact β-turn sequence cannot rescue a defective junction helix and vice versa (at least in vitro), we propose that folding of the CA-SP1 switch, and in particular the β-turn, is a critical step in nucleation of the immature Gag lattice.</p><p>Assembly of retroviral particles is thought to initiate when the viral RNA genome dimerizes and exposes high-affinity binding sites for the Gag C-terminal NC domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D'Souza and Summers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keane et al., 2015</xref>). The resulting ribonucleoprotein complex, containing several Gag molecules, is reasonably assumed to nucleate assembly of the immature viral particle. RNA-mediated Gag clustering has been proposed to nucleate assembly by promoting the CTD dimerization interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Amarasinghe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bush and Vogt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ma and Vogt, 2004</xref>). Since the isolated SP1 peptide folds into a helix in a concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Datta et al., 2011</xref>), we suggest instead that RNA-mediated clustering directly promotes folding of the CA-SP1 junction and the 6-helix bundle and, thereby, formation of Gag hexamers. Compared to a dimer, a hexamer is more intuitively appealing as the nucleator of the spherical Gag shell, since it is the smallest unit comprising the set of protein-protein interactions that are exclusive to the immature lattice and not found in the mature capsid or other functional states of the protein. We further speculate that folding of the junction will have the additional role of reeling in the NC domain and its bound genome, increasing the probability that the accumulating Gag molecules will bind to the same RNA. It is likely that the RNA, in turn, exerts some corresponding pulling force on the assembling Gag lattice, helping to promote its encapsidation. Our analysis therefore supports the proposal that the CA-SP1 junction allosterically communicates the status of downstream NC/RNA events to the upstream assembly domains of Gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bush and Vogt, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our studies reveal the molecular details of a bipartite HIV-1 CA-SP1 switch with critical functions in both virus particle assembly and proteolytic maturation. Retroviruses that do not contain a spacer between their CA and NC domains might have eschewed sophisticated protease regulation but have retained the more fundamental assembly determinant at the C-terminal end of CA. An example is Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV), whose immature capsid structure does not contain a 6-helix bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bharat et al., 2012</xref>). Sequence comparison confirms that MPMV does not have a spacer element, but does appear to have a 'clasp' motif that is similar to that of HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) appears to be a contrasting example – it has a well-characterized spacer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bush et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schur et al., 2015a</xref>), but does not have a recognizable turn motif.

Nevertheless, we obtained very high quality maps for model building due to the fortuitous existence of 6-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS), and through the use of modern density modification techniques implemented in PHENIX.

DNA templated assembly: Purified protein (148 μL at 2 mg/mL) was mixed with 26-mer single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide (5’-GGGAGTGGGGGGACTGAAGCAATGAG-3’) (2 μL at 1 mM) and dialyzed for 2 hr at 4°C into 1 L of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM βME. Particles were concentrated by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 10 min at 4°C, and resuspended in 15 μL of dialysis buffer. Tartrate-induced assembly: Protein (50 μL at 10–15 mg/mL) was mixed with 19.25 μL of 1.5 M tartrate and 7.7 μL of 1 M Tris, pH 7.5 and incubated for 2 hr at 37°C. This second approach was more efficient at promoting assembly, and so the centrifugation step was omitted.</p><p>For electron microscopy, each sample (3 μL) was applied to a glow-discharged, continuous carbon-coated grid for 2 min. Excess liquid was blotted off by touching the edge of the grid with filter paper. The grid was washed with distilled water, blotted, stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate for 2 min, and blotted again. Images of the negatively stained samples were recorded using a Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope (Philips/FEI) operating at 120 kV.</p><p>The assembly experiments were performed with two independent protein preparations for each mutant. In the second set of experiments, the grids were randomized so that the individual who acquired the images was unaware of the identity of the samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Accession codes</title><p>Coordinates and structure factors are deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession number 5I4T.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dan Shi and Tamir Gonen for help and advice with electron diffraction experiments.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Volker Dötsch (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Summers (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very nice report of the first direct crystallographic visualization of the HIV-1 Gag CA-SP1 junction. This confirms the long-standing but unproven prediction that the region is a helix, and reveals details of its packing in the immature lattice. The crystallization apparently required heroic efforts. The study is nicely complementary to the Schur et al. cryo-EM study of the immature HIV-1 CA lattice, as the fits shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> look quite reasonable. The functional studies using in vitro reconstitution are quite thorough.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following concerns should be addressed in a revised manuscript:</p><p>1) The crystals of CTD-SP1 were made up of flat hexagonal lattice (subsection “HIV-1 CA CTD-SP1 recapitulates the immature Gag lattice”), and thus &quot;represents a flattened version of the immature HIV-1 Gag lattice&quot;. Considering this, it may not be appropriate to say CTD-SP1 hexamer and dimer give &quot;excellent&quot; fits to the cyroEM map of the immature HIV-1 Gag lattice (aforementioned subsection), which is a spherical shell. These Gag lattices are both made up by hexameric and dimeric interfaces, so which interface is different between the curved and flat Gag lattice? Or both of them are slightly different?</p><p>2) Related to this, do the authors have any idea of what determines the curvature of Gag lattice? Does the N-terminal domain of CA contribute to this? However, as the authors noticed, &quot;The CTD-SP1 fragment of HIV-1 Gag contains the minimal information required to assemble the immature lattice, whereas the NTD is dispensable&quot; (subsection “HIV-1 CA CTD-SP1 recapitulates the immature Gag lattice”). Does that mean there is certain artifact in the reported structure due to crystallization?</p><p>3) The helical structure of single SP1 was previously determined in 30% trifluoroethanol (TFE) using solution NMR (Morellet et al., Protein Sci,14:375-86, 2005), in which the helix is further extended toward the C-terminal of SP1. Do the authors know any data that support that these residues in the disordered region of the authors' crystal structure do not contribute to the assembly of immature virion? For the in vitro assembly experiment, the authors only showed the data for the residues from the half beginning of SP1 peptide (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Mutation of T371 (the first residue form the disordered region) does interfere with in vitro assembly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Such kind of data will further validate the authors' crystal structure and their interpretations.</p><p>4) It seems pertinent to give a brief description of the helical propensity of SP1 in solution (Newman et al., Protein Sci,13:2101-7, 2004; Datta et al., J Virol, 90:1773-87, 2015) in the Introduction section, which may help to understand how the junction region is folded upon binding with RNA.</p><p>5) The file is 41 pages long, and the scientific scope seems appropriate for a full article, not a short report.</p><p>6) What was the crystallization trick that took three years to figure out?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17063.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>1) The crystals of CTD-SP1 were made up of flat hexagonal lattice (subsection “HIV-1 CA CTD-SP1 recapitulates the immature Gag lattice”), and thus &quot;represents a flattened version of the immature HIV-1 Gag lattice&quot;.

Does that mean there is certain artifact in the reported structure due to crystallization?</italic></p><p>The reviewers are correct that we should expect a difference between our structure of the flattened Gag lattice and the cryoEM structure of the curved lattice. We have revised the sentences describing the fitting and clarify that in the dimer fits, the junction helices deviate somewhat from their corresponding densities in the cryoEM map (subsection “HIV-1 CA CTD-SP1 recapitulates the immature Gag lattice”, last paragraph). We also now describe additional comparison with the PDB model by Schur et al., and our interpretation of the results (in the aforementioned subsection). In brief, we could not find a significant difference in comparing hexamers or dimers, indicating that any conformational variations that accommodate loss of curvature in our crystals are dispersed across the different subunits.</p><p><italic>3) The helical structure of single SP1 was previously determined in 30% trifluoroethanol (TFE) using solution NMR (Morellet et al., Protein Sci,14:375-86, 2005), in which the helix is further extended toward the C-terminal of SP1.

Such kind of data will further validate the authors' crystal structures and their interpretations.</italic> </p><p>We have now extended our mutagenesis all the way to the end of SP1. We did find, as the reviewers anticipated, that these mutants were similar to T371A. We have added a new paragraph to the Results section to describe these mutants and our interpretation of the data, taking into account the report by Morellet et al. (subsection “The entire CA-SP1 junction is required for immature Gag assembly in vitro”, sixth paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) It seems pertinent to give a brief description of the helical propensity of SP1 in solution (Newman et al., Protein Sci,13:2101-7, 2004; Datta et al., J Virol, 90:1773-87, 2015) in the Introduction section, which may help to understand how the junction region is folded upon binding with RNA.</italic></p><p>We agree that these are pertinent, and have added a new paragraph to the Introduction (fourth paragraph). We also point out the significance of the helical propensity for RNA-induced folding in the Discussion (sixth paragraph).</p><p><italic>5) The file is 41 pages long, and the scientific scope seems appropriate for a full article, not a short report.</italic></p><p>We agree and request designation as a Research Article.</p><p> <italic>6) What was the crystallization trick that took three years to figure out?</italic></p><p>There was no special trick, it simply took us 3 years to find the appropriate crystal form. We have added a few sentences to the Results section to provide more detail on the crystallization and explain why the appropriate crystals were rare (first paragraph). We also modified the relevant sentences in the Materials and methods section (subsection “X-ray crystallography”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
