resistance to infections. Female and estrogen-treated male mice show greater resistance to pneumococcal pneumonia, seen as greater bacterial clearance, diminished lung inflammation, and better survival. In vitro, lung macrophages from female mice and humans show better killing of ingested bacteria. Inhibitors and genetically altered mice identify a critical role for estrogen-mediated activation of lung macrophage nitric oxide synthase-3 (NOS3). Epidemiologic data show decreased hospitalization for pneumonia in women receiving estrogen or statins (known to activate NOS3). Pharmacologic targeting of NOS3 with statins or another small-molecule compound (AVE3085) enhanced macrophage bacterial killing, improved bacterial clearance, and increased host survival in both primary and secondary (post-influenza) pneumonia. The data identify a novel mechanism for host defense via NOS3 and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce secondary bacterial pneumonia after influenza.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03711.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03711.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03711.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Pneumonia is a disease that is commonly caused by a bacterial infection and results in the lungs becoming inflamed. Pneumonia is a serious condition and can lead to hospitalization and sometimes death. However, women—and other female animals—are less likely than males to get pneumonia and are more likely to survive if they do. Understanding this sex-based difference may help to develop treatments or preventive actions that either reduce the number of people who get pneumonia or help infected patients to recover.</p><p>Bacteria from the nose—including those that cause pneumonia—frequently enter the lungs during sleep. Luckily, the body has very robust defense mechanisms against such invasions; the immune system immediately deploys cells called macrophages as a ‘first response’ to devour and kill invading bacteria in the lungs. However, this system is not perfect, particularly if an individual has a weakened immune system or if they are already suffering with a respiratory infection. Indeed, many individuals with severe influenza infections are hospitalized as a result of pneumonia.</p><p>Yang et al. studied why females are more able to fend off pneumonia and found that estrogen, the main female sex hormone, boosts the ability of the macrophages to kill bacteria. Treating male mice with estrogen also boosted their immune system's ability to kill off bacteria in the lungs.</p><p>Investigating further, Yang et al. found that the estrogen worked by increasing the number of proteins produced from one gene called <italic>NOS3</italic>. Female mice lacking NOS3 proteins lost their pneumonia-fighting advantage. A widely used class of drugs called statins, which are used to treat cardiovascular disease, boosts the activity of the NOS3 gene. Yang et al. therefore wondered whether treatment with either estrogen or statins might prevent pneumonia, or help patients with pneumonia fight off the infection.</p><p>Using a large database of information about healthcare in Denmark, Yang et al. assessed the relationship between taking these drugs and the risk of pneumonia. When several confounding factors (such as unrelated diseases that the patient was suffering from) are taken into account, the data show that the women were less likely to be hospitalized for pneumonia if they were taking statins or estrogens. Those taking both treatments had an even lower risk.</p><p>Yang et al. also found that treating mice with statins or an experimental drug that boosts NOS3 activity increased the ability of the animals to fight off pneumonia-causing bacteria—even if they also had influenza—and increased the likelihood that mice already infected with pneumonia would survive. Further studies will be needed to determine if statins or the experimental drug might also help to prevent pneumonia in human patients with influenza.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03711.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03711.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>pneumonia</kwd><kwd>nitric oxide</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd>gender</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL083436</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kobzik</surname><given-names>Lester</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES0002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kobzik</surname><given-names>Lester</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005640</institution-id><institution>Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kobzik</surname><given-names>Lester</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activation of lung macrophage nitric oxide synthase-3 improves both bacterial clearance and outcome in primary and secondary pneumonia models.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial pneumonia remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mizgerd, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shrestha et al., 2013</xref>). One approach to the problem might be to enhance innate immunity to infection. Normal host defenses are already quite robust, albeit imperfect, as they keep the incidence of pneumonia much lower than possible given the normal nocturnal aspiration of nasopharyngeal bacteria, example <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gleeson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dockrell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Donkor, 2013</xref>).

Epidemiologic studies of human pneumonia observe a greater incidence of community-acquired pneumonia in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gutiérrez et al., 2006</xref>) and show that males are at greater risk than females for pneumonia after admission to hospital after adjusting for other risk factors such as smoking and alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Offner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andermahr et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gannon et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>We chose to address this problem by using a model of pneumococcal infection that approximates the frequent challenge to lung defenses by small numbers of bacteria and comparing responses in male and female mice. We identified greater female resistance to infection, mediated in large part by estrogen-dependent activation of constitutive AM nitric oxide synthase-3 (NOS3). Pharmacologic agents that enhance NOS3 function improved resistance in mouse models of both primary lung infection and post-influenza secondary pneumonia, suggesting a strategy to enhance resistance to common and serious lung infections.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Superior resistance of female mice to pneumococcal pneumonia</title><p>We tested effects of a relatively small bacteria inoculum size to simulate the common, low-level challenge to the lungs from aspiration of upper airway bacteria.

This suggested a role for another NOS isoform, namely the constitutively expressed endothelial type NOS3 found in alveolar and other macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miles et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Straaten et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Connelly et al., 2003</xref>). This postulate was directly tested using mice genetically deficient in NOS3. In vitro, deficiency in NOS3 did not alter the killing by male macrophages, but completely abolished the female advantage in bacterial killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In vivo, absence of NOS3 had minimal effects on male clearance of bacteria, but reduced the female advantage by ∼50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Genetic deletion of NOS3 greatly reduced survival in female mice with pneumonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), and transgenic overexpression of NOS3 increased bacterial clearance in male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), supporting the functional importance of this pathway. The 24 hr in vivo bacterial clearance assay provides enough time for induction of NOS2, which is known to mediate macrophage antimicrobial function in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nathan and Shiloh, 2000</xref>). To test the contribution of this isoform, we measured bacterial clearance in NOS2-deficient mice and in mice treated with the NOS2 inhibitor 1400W. The data show that male mice do rely on NOS2, since clearance of pneumococci was markedly worse in NOS2-deficient or 1400W-treated mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>).

We conclude that estrogen mediates greater host resistance to pneumonia in female mice via effects on the constitutively expressed NOS3 in lung macrophages. The basis for this conclusion includes data in mouse cells or models using pharmacologic agents, inhibitors, and genetically deficient animals. A similar advantage is seen in female human primary AMs and estrogen-treated human macrophages. These observations identify a novel host defense mechanism and a function for the main NOS isoform found in normal human macrophages. Pharmacologic targeting of NOS3 with one type of drug already in clinical use (statins) and another small-molecule lead compound (AVE3085) led to improved bacterial clearance and improved survival from secondary pneumococcal pneumonia.</p><p>The mechanism(s) by which macrophage NOS3 contributes to improved killing of ingested bacteria include direct bactericidal mechanisms, either alone or in combination with superoxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang, 2004</xref>), but NOS3 might also act to mediate salutary intracellular signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hernansanz-Agustín et al., 2013</xref>). The very low amounts of NO generated by macrophage NOS3 prompt the speculation that additional mechanisms act to amplify its contribution to bacterial killing. These may include increased trafficking of NOS3 after estrogen-mediated phosphorylation to phagosomes, selective triggering of calcium-dependent NOS3 production of NO around bacteria by phagocytosis-associated calcium fluxes, and combination of NO with superoxide to generate peroxynitrite, a potent microbicidal agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Darrah et al., 2000</xref>). These possibilities are not mutually exclusive. The data also show an interesting but unresolved finding of incomplete concordance between in vitro and in vivo results using NOS3-deficient mice. Specifically, NOS3 deficiency eliminated the female advantage entirely in studies of bacterial killing by AMs in vitro. In contrast, the female advantage in vivo was diminished by approximately half in NOS3-deficient mice. The mechanism(s) and significance of this persistent component of gender difference in mice are unknown and need further study.</p><p>Another aspect of our study that merits discussion is our use of a low-dose inoculum for the primary pneumonia model. This is intended to model the initial phase of pneumonia that follows the most likely route: aspiration of nasopharyngeal pneumococci or other bacteria. However, the quantity and composition of bacteria that enter the lungs during nocturnal aspiration is unknown. Moreover, while the premise that this is how pneumonia starts in humans is logical, there exists no formal proof. Ultimately, whether this attempt at a pre-clinical model proves relevant will depend on how the results translate to the clinical setting.</p><p>The potential relevance of these findings to human biology is indeed supported by the epidemiologic findings that both statins and estrogen-replacement therapy reduced risk of lung infection in a large cohort of women. There are also interesting reports of association of NOS3 polymorphisms with risk of community-acquired pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salnikova et al., 2013</xref>). However, we consider that the translational potential of these findings may be most relevant for the problem of secondary pneumonia, specifically the increased susceptibility to bacterial lung infections that follows influenza. Using pre-treatment before the bacterial challenge is arguably a limitation of our studies in the primary pneumonia model; this approach is useful for proof-of-principle but does not mirror likely clinical usage. In contrast, pre-treatment in the secondary pneumonia model does represent a realistic scenario for short-term, prophylactic immunomodulatory therapy. This approach could boost resistance to prevent bacterial pneumonias during intervals of increased susceptibility. This could well benefit patients who are identified to be at high risk of secondary pneumonia, example hospitalized individuals with severe seasonal or pandemic influenza.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This study began by seeking to characterize the basis for greater female resistance to pneumococcal pneumonia. A murine model of pneumococcal pneumonia was used to compare male and female bacterial clearance, lung inflammation, and survival in vivo. In vitro assays of macrophage antibacterial function were used to identify killing of internalized bacteria as a critical difference. Pharmacologic inhibitors, genetic mouse models, and in vitro macrophage studies were used to investigate the role of oxidant-generating enzyme systems and estrogen. After identification of NOS3 as an important mediator, we tested pharmacologic agents with translational potential for ability to improve outcomes in primary and post-influenza secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. For in vivo studies, we used male and female mice of the same age, and the studies were not blinded. Sample sizes for all of the experiments were sufficient to detect statistically significant differences between treatment groups, with all measurements included in analyses. To explore whether the effects of estrogen and statins that were observed in the murine models also occur in people, we studied incidence of hospitalized pneumonia associated with the use of estrogen and statins in a population-based case-control study based on medical databases in Denmark. Cases of pneumonia were identified as all women who received a first-time principal hospital diagnosis of pneumonia in the former North Jutland and Aarhus Counties, Northern Denmark (1.2 million inhabitants) between 1997 and 2012. Using the Danish Civil Registration System, each case subject was matched with five population control subjects with same age, female gender, and residence in Northern Denmark on the pneumonia index date. We ascertained use of estrogen and statins in all individuals from population-based prescription databases. To control for confounding by other conditions potentially associated with both estrogen and statin use and pneumonia risk, we retrieved individual-level data on 19 major comorbid disease categories as evidenced in the Charlson comorbidity index, as well as on alcoholism-related conditions, recent antibiotic use, and marital status as a marker of socioeconomic status. We then computed odds ratios (ORs) for a first-time pneumonia admission among women with and without estrogen and statin use, using conditional logistic regression analysis to control for confounders.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mouse models of pneumococcal pneumonia</title><p>Normal eight- to 12-week old male and female mice C57BL/6 mice from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) or Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) were used.

Mice transgenic for human NOS3 were previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones et al., 2003</xref>). All animals were housed in sterile microisolator cages in a barrier facility and had no evidence of spontaneous infection. Prior approval for all experimentation was obtained from the institutional animal use review committee.</p><p>Primary pneumococcal pneumonia was modeled as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arredouani et al., 2004</xref>). Pneumonia was induced by intranasal instillation (i.n.) of 25 µl of a bacterial suspension containing approximately 10<sup>5</sup> colony-forming units (CFU) of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> type 3 of mice under short-term anesthesia with inhaled isoflurane. The bacterial suspension was prepared to contain 10<sup>5</sup> CFU based on optical density calculations. However, results of direct validation of actual CFU in these samples were always performed and showed actual CFU values that ranged from 90–110 % of the calculated 10<sup>5</sup> CFU value. Hence, the dose delivered is stated as ∼10<sup>5</sup> CFU. For analysis at 4 or 24 hr post-infection, mice were sacrificed with/by lethal overdose of intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital (FatalPlus, Vortech Pharmaceuticals, Dearborn, MI) or by excess inhaled isoflurane. To measure total lung bacteria counts (CFU), whole lungs were harvested and homogenized in 1 ml sterile water with a tissue homogenizer (Omni International, Warrenton, VA). Serial 10-fold dilutions in sterile water were made from these homogenates, and 100 µl volumes were plated onto sheep-blood agar plates and incubated at 37°C. CFUs were counted after 18–20 hr. In experiments to assess survival, mice were instilled i.n. with a single 25 µl suspension containing a higher dose of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (∼3 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU) and survival followed as reported in ‘Results’. For analysis of lung inflammation, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in situ with a 22-gauge catheter inserted into the proximal trachea, flushing the lower airways six times with 0.7 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The fluid retrieved from the first lavage was kept for ELISA assays. The BAL cells were separated from the BAL fluid by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS and counted. A fraction was cytospun on microscopic slides for staining with Diff-Quick (Baxter Scientific Products, McGaw Park, IL) for subsequent differential counts. In initial experiments, male mice were analyzed 20 days after subcutaneous implantation according to manufacturer's instructions of slow-release 17-beta-estradiol pellets (∼70 µg/day, Innovative Research, Sarasota, FL). In later experiments, mice received a single dose of estradiol by inhalation exposure for 1 hr to an aerosol generated from a solution of E2-BSA β-Estradiol 6-(O-carboxymethyl)oxime: BSA (75 ng/ml aerosol solution, ∼30 mol steroid per mol BSA, Sigma) using the mouse exposure system described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamada et al., 2003</xref>. Drug treatments to assess effects on 24 hr bacterial clearance were administered 4 hr before and 8 and 20 hr after bacterial challenge included i.p. pravastatin 50–100 mg/kg, and 1400W 10 mg/kg. The NOS3 activator AVE3085 (2,2-difluoro-benzo[1,3]dioxole-5-carboxylic acid indan-2-ylamide, CAS no. 450348-85-3; empirical formula C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>13</sub>F<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wohlfart et al., 2008</xref>)) was administered by gavage at 100 mg/kg/day for 3 days prior to the challenge or by subcutaneous injection of 0.75 mg 24 and 3 hr before the challenge.</p><p>To model post-influenza secondary pneumonia, mice were instilled i.n. on day 0 with a single 25 µl or 50 µl suspension containing influenza virus (A/PR 8/34; H1N1), under general anesthesia by i.p. ketamine (120 mg/kg) plus xylazine (16 mg/kg). Influenza-treated animals routinely lost weight and then recovered by day 7, when the secondary infection was administered. On day 7 after initial influenza infection, mice were subjected to the same anesthesia and then instilled i.n. with a single 25 µl of bacterial suspension containing approximately 500 CFU of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> type 3. Pravastatin (50–100 mg/kg i.p.) or AVE3085 (0.75 mg s.c.) was administered daily starting one day before the pneumococcal challenge. Subsequent analyses were performed as for the primary pneumonia model described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell isolation and culture</title><p>After euthanasia, mouse AMs obtained by repeated lung lavage with sterile PBS were centrifuged at 150×<italic>g</italic> and resuspended in HBSS<sup>+</sup> (Hanks' Buffered Salt Solution with calcium, 0.3 mM, and magnesium, 1 mM). Primary mouse AMs were used immediately without exposure to culture media components that contain estrogen (e.g. serum) or (weakly) estrogenic phenol red. The mouse and human macrophage cell lines J774A.1 and U937 were obtained from ATCC and maintained in phenol-free RPMI with 10% FBS. In experiments testing effects of estrogen addition in vitro, a charcoal-stripped FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT) was used for macrophage culture to eliminate exposure to serum hormones. Human alveolar macrophages were obtained from non-smoking volunteers by bronchoalveolar lavage and resuspended in HBSS<sup>+</sup> when tested immediately or cultured in phenol-free RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) overnight. The potential confounding effects of estrogen in FBS were not observed in human AM samples cultured overnight, that is gender differences observed in cells used immediately after isolation were preserved. All human subject experimentation was conducted under approved protocols reviewed by the institutional review boards. Estrogen was added to macrophage cultures as β-Estradiol-Water Soluble (Sigma) at 0.05–0.3 ng/ml. All other reagents not otherwise specified were obtained from Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Bacteria</title><p><italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> serotype 3, <italic>E.

A stock suspension was prepared and aliquots kept at −80°C. For each experiment, an aliquot was grown overnight on a blood agar plate and resuspended in sterile PBS. Bacterial concentration of the obtained suspension was estimated by OD<sub>600</sub> measurements, comparing to a prior standard curve of OD<sub>600</sub> vs CFU. The appropriate dilution was prepared in sterile PBS to be administered to mice, and this estimate was checked in parallel by CFU assay to determine the precise concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Phagocytosis and bacterial killing assay</title><p>Macrophage binding, internalization, and killing of internalized bacteria were measured using CFU assays of cell samples lysed by 10-fold excess H2O (pH 10, 3 min). Macrophages (1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/1.5 ml HBSS<sup>+</sup>) were mixed with bacteria (15 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU: 10 bacteria per 1 macrophage) for 1 hr at 37°C. After centrifugation the cell pellet was re-suspended and an aliquot taken to measure the total cell-associated CFU (bound and internalized). After brief incubation of the cell suspension with gentamicin (200 µg/ml, 15 min at 37°C) to kill external, bound bacteria, the macrophages were washed and an aliquot taken for lysis and CFU assay to quantitate the number of internalized, live bacteria. The macrophages were then incubated an additional hour to allow killing of internalized bacteria and aliquots taken again for CFU quantitation. The CFU data obtained at various time points allow calculation of the number of bacteria bound, internalized, and killed. Effects of pharmacologic inhibitors or hormones were tested by including agents or their vehicles in the assay buffers. Respiratory burst function in normal mouse AMs was measured by quantitation of the H2O2-catalyzed oxidation of Amplex Red (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to a fluorescent product after stimulation with adsorbed antibodies (anti-FcR, CD18) or PMA (100 nM) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Józefowski and Kobzik, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Western blot and ELISA analysis</title><p>Western blot analysis was performed on macrophage lysates lysis buffer 1% NP-40 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors using the protocols described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gonzalez et al., 2002</xref>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following questions and comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We believe the question you have addressed is an important one, the experiments have been well conceived, and the results are novel.</p><p>The figures are central to the report and they need standardization (e.g. use of bold lines for treatment). The figure legends need clarification and better explanation (e.g. doses used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the significant differences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition:</p><p>1) Please clarify the gender of the mice for each experiment and each figure.</p><p>2) Please clarify the following: from the Materials and methods section it states under “cell isolation and culture” that macrophage cultures were incubated with estrogen.

We will be glad to work with the editorial office to further standardize the figures, once given specific instructions. There are only two agents in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for which ‘doses used’ applies. We are uncertain whether this request for clarification applies to one or the other or both, so we have tried to improve both. The dose of bacteria delivered to the lung is given as “∼10<sup>5</sup> CFU”. We have elaborated on the reason why the CFU value is approximate by including new text in the methods section. Regarding the comment “lung samples from female mice (and estrogen-treated male mice)”, to clarify the dose of estrogen directly within the figure legend, we have modified the text to add the details also presented in the Methods section.</p><p>We have clarified the meaning of the symbol for significant differences in the figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> as follows: (D) In vivo, absence of NOS3 reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the female advantage in bacterial clearance (n = 15, * = p &lt; .015 vs. all 3 other groups) N.B. Additional change, not requested by the review: During the review for this point about <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, we noted that one of the p values is actually p = .015, rather than all of them being &lt; .01 as originally stated. Hence for accuracy we have modified the p value here as p &lt; .015. We consider that this accurately summarizes all the values without introducing unnecessary clutter, but will be glad to itemize each comparison if needed.</p><p><italic>1) Please clarify the gender of the mice for each experiment and each figure</italic>.</p><p>We have reviewed all the figures and figure legends as requested. We have added additional information regarding mouse gender in the figure legends 3E, 5F and 6 (not copied here as they are the simple insertion of a single adjective, e. g. ‘male’). We consider that the gender is clear for the other figures and experiments, but will be glad to revise further if needed.</p><p><italic>2) Please clarify the following: from the Materials and methods section it states under “cell isolation and culture” that macrophage cultures were incubated with estrogen. The estrogen receptor beta that is equally expressed on male and female cells and thus addition of exogenous estrogen would activate both (given macrophages from both sexes seem to express the same level of NOS3)? Is this the case or was estrogen only added to the macrophage cell line studies? If this is the case and no exogenous estrogen is added, are the authors stating that the primary macrophages obtained from males/females are wired post isolation by their exposure to estrogen whilst in situ?</italic></p><p>We have clarified these points by first noting in the Methods that all experiments done with primary macrophages were performed immediately after lavage (for all mouse samples). We only added exogenous estrogens to the cell lines as stated in the same Methods section. To partially address the final point here, we note that for human AMs the potential effects of estrogen in FBS (that prompted the use of charcoal-stripped, hormone-free FBS in our macrophage cell line cultures) were not observed. So the primary macrophages obtained from males/females do appear to be “wired” by their in situ exposures, at least for a period of 12-24 hours. We have not addressed the duration of the effect in detail, but have noted that the effect of exogenous estrogen of the macrophage cell lines persists thru 24 hours but does decline after that (only studied at 48 hours, but this may be influenced by cell division, etc.). This is now stated more explicitly in the Methods section (“Human alveolar macrophages were obtained…”).</p><p><italic>3) What is the likely mechanism by which elevated NOS3 activation in females leads to increased bactericidal activity? Please review briefly polymorphisms within NOS3 being associated with pneumonia</italic>.</p><p>For the first point, we attempted in the original submission to cover this point by a section in the Discussion that we consider to address the question sufficiently. We will be glad to elaborate further if needed, but consider that the references provided are comprehensive.</p><p>For the second point, we can find 4 articles in PubMed that study NOS3 polymorphisms and pneumonia. There are 3 English-language papers, all from the same group of investigators. They do find some association of NOS3 SNPs with community acquired pneumonia, but their populations are mostly male (e.g. &gt;90% in the study cited below) and the associations are not significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Hence to address this point, and as a convenience for the interested reader, we have added this sentence and one of the three references to the Discussion: “There are also interesting reports of association of NOS3 polymorphisms with risk of community-acquired pneumonia (Salnikova, 2013).”</p><p><italic>4) AVE3085 acts by increasing NOS3 transcription but the NOS3 would still need to be activated</italic>. <italic>How is this achieved in the male mice?</italic></p><p>This is a very good point, and the hardest question for us to answer. Several post-translational mechanisms have been described increasing or decreasing NOS3 activity, primarily from studies of vascular endothelium (for a review see Qian and Fulton, Front Physiol; 2013, 4, 347). Although we have not investigated such posttranslational mechanisms in lung macrophages so far, we speculate that similar signals might be involved, e.g. physical signals analogous to shear stress, such as generated by macrophage movement within the alveolus or cyclic stretch of the lung during breathing, or activation signals generated during the act of phagocytosis. In addition, uptake of certain bacteria is associated with activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway (e.g. for Staph. aureus, Infect Immun. 2011 Nov;79(11):4569-77; for Shigella, Sci Signal. 2011 Sep 20;4(191):ra61). However, a short and accurate answer is that we don’t know the mechanism. This would need to be addressed by future studies.</p><p><italic>5) Please comment on the following; inoculating volume in which bacteria are administered can affect the phenotype/potency of the response</italic>. <italic>Perhaps utilizing the same volume may result in bacteria not reaching the same depths of the lung in females versus males because of their different size?</italic></p><p>We are very grateful for this comment because we actually tested this point early on in these studies, but neglected to report the findings. Hence, we have added this point to the first section of the Results section (“Pilot experiments compared efficiency of delivery…).</p><p><italic>6) How and why are the Charlson index or other factors confounding factors in the relationship between estrogen use and pneumonia?</italic></p><p>To examine the association between estrogen and statin use (exposure) and risk of pneumonia hospitalization (outcome), we aimed to control for confounding by conditions potentially associated with both estrogen and statin use and pneumonia risk. These conditions were defined by us as a priori potential confounding factors, based on previous findings in the literature, and biological considerations.</p><p>Comorbidity increases risk of pneumonia (Søgaard M, Respiratory Medicine 2014). As a measure of overall comorbidity, we computed the Charlson comorbidity index score for each subject (Charlson ME, J Chronic Dis 1987). The Charlson comorbidity index was originally validated for prediction of mortality, but has the advantage of including almost all known major risk factors for pneumonia (Thomsen RW, Diabetes Care 2004), such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other pulmonary diseases, previous cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, chronic heart failure, diabetes, cancer, renal and liver disease, dementia, and HIV/AIDS (Mor A et al, Clinical Epidemiology 2013). Many of these chronic diseases are related to age, unhealthy lifestyle, and socioeconomic status (Barnett K, Lancet 2012). As other markers of health consciousness and socioeconomic status, we therefore retrieved data on alcoholism-related conditions, recent antibiotic use, and marital status, which are also known risk factors for pneumonia (Kornum JB, Eur Resp J 2012; Mor A, Clinical Epidemiology 2013). People who use preventive medications such as estrogen and statins may be more “healthy”, that is, have higher health consciousness and a healthier lifestyle and thus fewer lifestyle related diseases than other people (Brookhart A, Am J Epidemiol 2007; Shrank WH, J Gen Intern Med 2011). On the other hand, medical indications for these drugs during the study period included comorbidities that may have been already present in the patient (e.g. osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease). Since the above factors are a priori expected to be skewed both according to risk of pneumonia and chance of being drug exposed - which our analyses of 2 x 2 tables confirmed (Table S1 shows association with pneumonia case status) – we included them as potential confounders. To evaluate the actual confounding caused by the above factors, we calculated crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for a first-time pneumonia admission among women with and without estrogen and statin use, while using conditional logistic regression analysis to control for the confounders: Charlson comorbidity index level (19 different comorbidities), alcoholism-related conditions, antibiotics before admission, and marital status). The changes in risk estimates, e.g. from a crude pneumonia OR in estrogen users of 0.99 (0.95-1.04) to a confounder-adjusted pneumonia OR in estrogen users of 0.82 (0.78-0.86) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), show that these factors confounded the association between estrogen use and pneumonia risk. In other words, estrogen users and non-users appeared to have similar pneumonia risk in crude analyses. When adjusting for differences in prevalence of confounding factors, estrogen users had a decreased pneumonia risk. We have added a few explanatory comments on this in the revised manuscript, Results section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
