However, we still lack a full characterization of transmission dynamics in settings with similar and different burdens. Genomic epidemiology can greatly help to quantify transmission, but the lack of whole genome sequencing population-based studies has hampered its application. Here, we generate a population-based dataset from Valencia region and compare it with available datasets from different TB-burden settings to reveal transmission dynamics heterogeneity and its public health implications. We sequenced the whole genome of 785 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> strains and linked genomes to patient epidemiological data. We use a pairwise distance clustering approach and phylodynamic methods to characterize transmission events over the last 150 years, in different TB-burden regions. Our results underscore significant differences in transmission between low-burden TB settings, i.e., clustering in Valencia region is higher (47.4%) than in Oxfordshire (27%), and similar to a high-burden area as Malawi (49.8%). By modeling times of the transmission links, we observed that settings with high transmission rate are associated with decades of uninterrupted transmission, irrespective of burden. Together, our results reveal that burden and transmission are not necessarily linked due to the role of past epidemics in the ongoing TB incidence, and highlight the need for in-depth characterization of transmission dynamics and specifically tailored TB control strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>transmission</kwd><kwd>genomic epidemiology</kwd><kwd>whole-genome sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>638553-TB-ACCELERATE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Comas</surname><given-names>Iñaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101001038-TB-RECONNECT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Comas</surname><given-names>Iñaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2016-77346-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Comas</surname><given-names>Iñaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2019-104477RB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Comas</surname><given-names>Iñaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Commission – NextGenerationEU (Regulation EU 2020/2094), through CSIC's Global Health Platform (PTI Salud Global)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SGL2021-03-008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Comas</surname><given-names>Iñaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Low-burden does not mean low local transmission, and tailor-made strategies are needed to control TB based on the knowledge of the local transmission dynamics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) has been the first cause of death by an infectious disease for years surpassing HIV according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2019 were reported 10 million new TB cases and 1.4 million deaths, with these numbers likely to increase due to the COVID-19 pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glaziou, 2020</xref>). Recognizing heterogeneity across settings in the population-level dynamics of TB is key to advance to new stages in local and global TB control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mathema et al., 2017</xref>). Recent transmission significantly contributes to the global TB-burden mostly in the high incidence regions and its control is imperative to achieve the goal of the End TB Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auld et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guerra-Assunção et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yates et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>On the contrary, in low-burden countries the assumption is that transmission plays a minor role, supported by the fact that in countries close to the pre-elimination phase (&lt;5/100,000 cases) TB cases are mainly contributed by re-activations of latent TB infection (LTBI) from recently arrived migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Menzies et al., 2018</xref>). However, whether the minor role of transmission in pre-elimination phase countries can be extrapolated to other low-burden countries is currently unknown. Understanding the correlation between burden and transmission and country specific dynamics is key if tailor-made control strategies are needed.</p><p>Measuring transmission is still challenging. Genomic epidemiology, based on comparative pathogen genomics, has been successfully applied in some settings, but usually not at a population scale, needed to profile the transmission dynamics in a setting. Using genomic epidemiology is not exempt from limitation, e.g., as transmission cases associated with LTBI are missed as well as cases without culture (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">López et al., 2020</xref>). However, it allows us to compare transmission clustering rates and dynamics across settings in a standard way. A common approach to characterize transmission with whole genome sequencing (WGS) is to use pairwise single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gardy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tagliani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walker et al., 2013</xref>). The WGS displays higher resolution, provides accurate results tracking recent transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jajou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marais et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meehan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nikolayevskyy et al., 2019</xref>), and reports greater agreement with epidemiological results than previous molecular markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meumann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nikolayevskyy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roetzer et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, Bayesian dating allows us to correlate genetic differences between strains and time of transmission clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meehan et al., 2018</xref>). Even more, the higher resolution of genomic data also allows us to go beyond standard clustering of cases and can reveal individual transmission links (TLs) and timing of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Despite WGS reliability, there exists controversy regarding the SNP threshold employed to delineate genomic clusters (gClusters). A cut-off of 5 SNPs has been widely accepted for the clustering of recently linked cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meehan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nikolayevskyy et al., 2019</xref>) while an upper value of 12 SNPs also incorporates older transmission events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walker et al., 2013</xref>); however, the extent to which the identification of those cases can aid epidemiological investigations remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bjorn-Mortensen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jajou et al., 2018</xref>). It is also unclear the extent to which those cutoffs apply to all settings given differences in social, host, and pathogen factors across settings. Even if universal, understanding transmission dynamics goes beyond recent transmission events, which have an actionable value for public health, but that do not capture the long-term dynamics in a population.</p><p>The lack of WGS studies at the population level represents the main limitation to the validation of these thresholds across clinical settings, and to understand the transmission dynamics in different areas. Here we use available datasets from a low burden setting (Oxfordshire, incidence 8.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) and from a high burden setting (Malawi, incidence 87 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) and compare to a newly generated dataset in Valencia region (incidence ~8 cases per 100,000 inhabitants).</p><p>In the Valencia region, the contribution of recent transmission to local TB burden remains largely unknown. First, we investigated the epidemiology and dynamics of TB transmission in the Valencia region, the fourth most populated region of the country, over 3 years. Second, we evaluated the general use of an SNP threshold in cluster definition and public health investigations, in this particular setting. Third, we compared the transmission dynamics in the Valencia region with similar population-based studies from locations with different TB burdens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guerra-Assunção et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walker et al., 2014</xref>). Our results demonstrate that current TB incidence in Valencia region mainly derives from sustained transmission similar to a high-burden setting. Comparison among settings highlight little correlation between burden and transmission and suggest the need of tailor-made control strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Extended and detailed methods in Appendix 1.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sample selection and study design</title><p>About 1388 TB cases were reported between 2014 and 2016 by the Valencian Regional Public Health Agency (DGSP), 1019 with positive culture.

Finally, SNPs falling in genes annotated as PE/PPE/PGRS, ‘maturase,’ ‘phage,’ and ‘13E12 repeat family protein’; those located in insertion sequences; those within InDels or in higher density regions (&gt;3 SNPs in 10 bp) were removed due to the uncertainty of mapping.

The rationale for this approach is based on the assumption that if few pathogen mutations are expected to be observed during a host’s infection, as is the case of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, lineages split only at transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, as <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is an obligate pathogen, every strain is by definition, linked to others by recent or historical transmission events. In this sense, each node in the phylogeny represents a minimum one, and likely many, person-to-person transmission. Tips in the tree are the result of decades of transmission or, which is the same, multiple transmission events occurring along the branch; however, most of the secondary cases generated are missing, as they do not develop active TB or were cured before sampling (among other reasons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2A</xref>). Thus, only those lineages persisting until sampling time were recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, the greater the transmission and the more sustained over time, the greater the chance of recovering secondary cases today. In addition, to estimate the time of the TLs, we used the time of the node, or the common ancestor, as this is the lower bound when the strain starts to circulate. Thus, each TL summarizes the number and time of the transmission along each tree branch. This analysis was conducted in the time trees generated with Beast, including both local and foreign cases; in order to avoid introductions we excluded nodes in which foreign samples appeared as ancestors, and only counted nodes including local-born tips occurring within 150 years before 2016 (yB 2016).</p><p>This analysis does not intend to define the direction of transmission or the exact moment when it occurred, as can be done with TransPhylo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Didelot et al., 2017</xref>), but instead to profile ancestral TLs through time and trace since when, the lineages recovered nowadays, have been circulating. Note that the concept ‘TL’ in this context does not indicate person-to-person contagion, instead it is the summary of multiple contagions occurring in a period of time, and indicates that a particular extant strain has been involved in transmission during that period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> population structure and demographic characteristics in Valencia region</title><p>We sequenced 77% of the TB culture-positive cases reported between 2014 and 2016 in Valencia region with a 4.3 million population.

Thus, we inferred the age of the local gClusters for the three settings. Dating results of the youngest and the oldest gClusters are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, while complete results are detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1 fig3sdata2 fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 1–3</xref>. We can trace gClusters 31 years back from the most recent sample collected for both the Valencia region and Malawi; however, we only retrieved samples that formed part of gClusters, 19 years before the most recent Oxfordshire sample. The alternative time calibration samples included (Appendix 1) displayed similar results, thereby allowing comparisons among datasets. Our inference of clusters’ ancestors are in agreement with previous studies, using a similar Bayesian approach, and defining a timespan of up to 10 years for 5 SNP cut-offs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meehan et al., 2018</xref>). Thus many genomic links based on 12 SNP distance are beyond the action of public health interventions. Using data from Valencia region, we further investigated the role of genomic distances in public health by evaluating the age of epidemiologically linked cases. Most of the epidemiologically linked cases have a common ancestor less than 10 years before the most recent sample, and the distance between samples typically ranged between 0 and 4 SNPs, with only one individual link separated by 11 SNPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). While the ROC curve indicated a 12 SNP threshold to capture most epidemiological links, the reality is that strains linked by more than 5 SNP are beyond the action of public health interventions as they involve too old TLs. Our results imply that events useful for public health investigations are better captured by a 5 SNP threshold even though some epidemiological links are missing. But the reverse is also true, and more dramatic. Even when using a 5 SNP threshold public health only identifies around 15% of the cases in gClusters. This holds true even for pairs of isolates with 0 SNP differences. The many genomic links missed by public health investigations in Valencia region reminds of what is seen in high-burden countries, where contagion occurs outside the traditional household or work settings.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Dating of local genomic clusters (gCluster).</title><p>Times of the oldest and youngest local gClusters obtained by a Bayesian analysis are presented, with values in years (AD) and 95% highest posterior density given in brackets.

To notice, we did not try to quantify how many transmission events have happened over the last 150 years. Our rationale is that many person-to-person transmission events likely occurred along branches between nodes or nodes and terminals, they are impossible to quantify, but we can summarize all these events as one TL, as we are confident that at least one transmission event occurred along the branch. The exact time of the transmission is not possible to estimate either, instead our rationale is that when two circulating strains had a common TL in the past, this ancestor represents a lower-bound for when the strains started to circulate. Thus, we compare how many links have occurred during a period of time among different settings, as an approach of long term transmission dynamics analysis. In our approach, we only considered genomic data from local-born patients to avoid the influence of imported genotypes in our analysis.</p><p>Then, we counted the TLs in different time windows, in the three settings evaluated. In the case of Oxfordshire, we identified 14 links between 5 and 25 yB 2016, with the next TL being inferred between 100 and 150 yB 2016 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata4">Figure 3—source data 4</xref>). Thus, a gap of 75 years occurs between the most recent and the oldest TLs, explaining why the 12 SNP threshold performs well in this setting as a transmission marker. In the case of Malawi, we counted 70 links dating back to 50 yB 2016 and 46 dated between 50 and 150 yB 2016 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata5">Figure 3—source data 5</xref>). For the Valencia region, we counted 143 links that dated back 50 yB 2016 and 43 between 50 and 150 yB 2016 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata6">Figure 3—source data 6</xref>). The gap detected in Oxfordshire is not observed in Malawi or Valencia.</p><p>In the above analysis we had two strong assumptions. First, that the historical link shared by two strains happened in the setting under study and not elsewhere. We do believe this is the case as we only considered links involving local-born cases, thus minimizing the impact of importation/exportation in the analysis. In addition, a local origin is the most likely geographic location of historical TLs when analyzed in the context of a representative sample of global diversity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata6">Figure 3—source data 6</xref>). Second, that two strains not only shared a historical link but also their sampling today reflect continuous transmission, not reactivation from a remote infection. Recent reanalysis of annual risk of infection in TB settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dowdy and Behr, 2022</xref>) as well as the incubation period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behr et al., 2018</xref>) suggests that most cases of TB are due to recent transmission. Likewise, we reasoned that if old reactivations contribute to strains in the Valencia region, we should see an increment in the age of the TB patients belonging to the older clusters (i.e. patients infected 20 years ago and have reactivated recently). We found no difference when comparing the age of the patients belonging to a gCluster with the inferred age of the cluster (Welch two-samples t-test, p-values&gt;0.1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>), suggesting that the strains included in this study do not represent reactivations and that uninterrupted transmission is the most likely explanation for the old links observed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we present the first population-based study of TB transmission in Spain based on WGS. We sequenced the whole genome of a representative proportion of all the TB notified cases in the Valencia region that provides an accurate picture of the bacterial population structure, during 3 years. We exhaustively researched TB transmission linked to local epidemiological data and, by comparing to other settings, highlighted four main characteristics defining dynamics and influence on TB incidence.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Transmission can play a significant role in low-burden countries, especially among local-born patients</title><p>The percentage of genomically linked cases (12 SNPs) of around 43% in the total population, increases to 47% among the Spanish-borns being 31% among imported cases, suggesting that transmission among locally born patients majorly contributes to disease burden. These percentages remain high when considering a stricter threshold of 5 SNPs for clustering (35 vs. 39%, respectively). We found higher transmission in the Valencia region compared to other population based studies conducted in low-burden settings, where clustering rates ranged between 14 and 16% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jajou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walker et al., 2014</xref>) and somewhat closer to that reported in mid and high TB-incidence settings (39–85%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guerra-Assunção et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gygli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saavedra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Walker et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yates et al., 2016</xref>). High transmission among Spanish-born individuals is a major contributor to disease burden in Valencia. By contrast, reactivation of infections in imported cases from high-burden settings is the significant driver in other low-burden settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jajou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamper-Jørgensen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meumann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walker et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, our results reveal the heterogeneity of the TB epidemic among settings, highlighting the lack of correlation between a region’s TB burden and the level of local transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Community transmission can majorly contribute to TB cases in a low burden setting</title><p>In low-burden TB settings, comparison between contact tracing and WGS revealed that between 38 and 57% of genomically linked cases had also an epidemiological link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jajou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walker et al., 2014</xref>). In high-burden settings, which suffer from rampant community transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yates et al., 2016</xref>), the agreement between both approaches is significantly lower (8–19%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auld et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Middelkoop et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Verver et al., 2004</xref>). In the Valencia region, we observed an agreement similar to high-burden settings (15.4%), meaning that almost 80% of transmission is missing by the health system, despite contact tracing being conducted in 78% of cases. As has suggested for high-burden settings, contact tracing among household close contacts will not have a significant effect on TB incidence at a community level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCreesh and White, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Surie et al., 2017</xref>), since much of transmission may result from casual contact in community settings between individuals not known to one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auld et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guerra-Assunção et al., 2015</xref>) and also, transmission associates more with social drivers, including the ways in which individuals interact and congregate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mathema et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, our results support that community transmission is behind the lack of agreement between genomic and epidemiological clusters observed in the Valencia region, and highlights its relevance in low burden settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Genomic links are older than epidemiological links</title><p>The Valencia region’s oldest gClusters dated to around 30 years before the sampling period. When considering only strains epidemiologically linked, the oldest most recent common ancestor can be traced less than 10 years. Thus, a 12 SNP threshold identifies both recent and older transmission events. A 5 SNP threshold dates clusters between 1999 and 2015 in agreement with recent transmission rendering more actionable results for public health, as was previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jajou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meehan et al., 2018</xref>). However, a 5 SNP threshold still misses a percentage of cases linked by epidemiological data and vice versa, highlighting transmission complexity and the relevance of understanding its dynamics in each setting. Thus, a strict threshold has limitations and communicating a range, incorporating degrees of confidence, will be more valuable for public health interventions. This is particularly true in settings where transmission still has a prominent role. Communicating different thresholds allows to reveal not only very recent links, but also older TLs, which allows to evaluate the transmission burden, the impact of transmission control programmes, as well as, reveal transmission hotspots and unanticipated risk factors or community transmission, beyond the limits of contact tracing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Continuous pairwise genetic distance distributions reflect sustained transmission over the last decades</title><p>The evaluation of local-born cases in the Valencia region revealed continuous clustering across genetic distances, similar to Malawi. In both settings, differentiation between linked and unlinked cases seems arbitrary, as a clear SNP cut-off to delineate genomic transmission could not provide precise results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This contrasts with the results of Oxfordshire, where clustering does not change in the range of 12–150 SNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In this sense, the SNP threshold choice used to differentiate transmission from unrelated cases remains challenging even in low-burden settings and provides only tentative information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meehan et al., 2019</xref>). An in-depth evaluation of clustering in each setting is needed to understand its particular transmission dynamics. Furthermore, the Valencia region and Malawi also display continuous and sustained TLs over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Those events outside the genomic transmission clusters likely reflect older contagion chains that still contribute to TB incidence today, as a consequence, clustering is continuous in settings exhibiting this transmission dynamics. The lack of effective past efforts to halt transmission may represent a plausible explanation. Epidemiological data demonstrates that Spain will likely attain a country profile similar to the UK and other low-burden, high-immigration countries. The higher transmission and the older age of transmission chains likely reflects a situation in which Spain suffered from higher disease incidence for most of the 20th century, reflecting its lower socioeconomic status than neighboring countries. The current control strategies in place in the Valencia region meet the WHO’s target to reduce TB, including active case findings of close contacts since the 1990s. Improved TB control has led to a continuous drop in case numbers and to an incidence from 22 to 6.4 in the last 20 years. By contrast, Oxfordshire displays a bimodal distribution of clustering across pairwise distances, and also lacked transmission events other than those involving 12 SNP gClusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These results agree with the robust reduction in both disease incidence and transmission that occurred until the beginning of the 1990s in the UK; after that, increased HIV infections, immigration and the emergence of TB drug resistance fueled the expansion of TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glaziou et al., 2018</xref>). In accordance with this data, we dated ongoing transmission in Oxfordshire back to 1993. Our results imply uninterrupted transmission of TB in Valencia region and Malawi and not in Oxfordshire and offer an explanation for the differences in SNP distributions across settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical time trees indicating transmission links (TLs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Left) The complete phylogeny, including all bacterial isolates and displaying multiple transmission events over time (located at nodes for simplification).

For the period between the most recent sample (MRS) and 50 y BMRS, links within (gClusters) and outside gClusters (No gClusters) are indicated.

However, we showed that cases included are an accurate representation of the epidemiological characteristics of the populations under study. On the other hand (II), in our analysis of historical transmission, we use tree nodes as ‘TLs'’ to summarize the number and time of historical transmission. Since both are impossible to quantify, we assume that these TLs represent an estimation of the moment when the strain started to circulate and, at least, one person-to-person transmission event. We also assume that the strains were circulating in the region and not elsewhere and later imported. Finally, we have not attempted to quantify the number of person-to-person transmission; which can only be done using approaches like TransPhylo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Didelot et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). However, this approach is suitable only for recent transmission, i.e. cases within transmission clusters. Thus, TransPhylo is not applicable in our study.</p><p>Finally (III), differences in the absolute number of cases in each dataset are irrelevant for comparison, since they all represent population-based studies with the same time-window sampling, thus the majority culture positive cases were included in the analysis. In this sense, the distribution of cases in clusters likely reflects the whole transmission dynamics of the settings.</p><p>Our results underscore a primary role for continuous transmission in fueling TB incidence in the Valencia region. Likewise, our results strongly suggest that in this particular setting, community transmission is occurring more frequently rather than in household contacts. All these features are similar to some high-burden settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bjorn-Mortensen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guerra-Assunção et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">López et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The opposite scenario occurs in other low-burden countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jajou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walker et al., 2014</xref>) where transmission is limited and immigration from high-burden countries, also involving reactivation of the disease, represents the primary driver of incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meumann et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, reported meta-analysis from historical epidemiological studies suggests that, contrary to current assumptions, MTB infection may not be lifelong, and most people are able to clear it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behr et al., 2019</xref>). This further suggests that the prevalence of LTBI is much lower than assumed, and most of the TB cases we see today are coming either from recent contagion or imported depending on the TB setting.</p><p>We demonstrate that low burden does not translate to low transmission, highlighting how low-burden TB locations can entail very distinct scenarios that require specifically tailored management in order to eliminate TB, and that general guidelines should not be applied to all the areas based solely on incidence rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lönnroth et al., 2015</xref>). In areas where incidence is mainly contributed by transmission, actions beyond passive case finding strategies are likely to be more successful. Different forms of active case finding to cut community transmission have been implemented in low income countries that can be transferred to high and middle income ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ho et al., 2016</xref>). Those strategies can be designed not only based on the presence of social and host risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dowdy et al., 2012</xref>) now there is the opportunity to move toward genomics-informed infection control programmes, e.g., by identifying transmission hotspots or highlighting unanticipated risk factors. Active case finding also has the potential to tackle subclinical TB transmission, which we estimated using high resolution transmission mapping in our setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2019</xref>), and its impact on global and local TB control is still unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kendall et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our key message is that understanding heterogeneities in TB transmission dynamics is essential to define tailor-made interventions to halt transmission with a population-level impact, which is key to reducing the incidence of TB worldwide.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>IC received consultancy fees from Foundation for innovative new diagnostics.

Genomic transmission clusters were constructed if the genetic distance between at least two patients’ isolates fell below a defined threshold. A customized script was used, and different SNP thresholds considered. To confirm cluster monophyly, a maximum likelihood tree was constructed with the MSA file (50,184 SNPs) using RAxML v8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>), the GTR GAMMA model, 1,000 bootstrap replicates, and including <italic>M. canetti</italic> as an outgroup.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-3"><title>Dating recent common ancestors (MRCA) of local transmission clusters</title><p>Timed phylogenies for datasets from Malawi (2008–2010), Oxfordshire, and the Valencia Region were inferred with Beast v2.5.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouckaert et al., 2014</xref>). First, an MSA file for each dataset was constructed without drug resistance-related SNPs.

Radiocarbon dates were used as prior for ancient samples’ tip date, and the Spanish outbreak was included as a calibration node; both cases used a log-normal prior distribution. Three independent runs of Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) length chains of 10 million were performed. The runs were combined via logcombiner v2.4.8. Tracer v1.6 was used to determine adequate mixing, convergence of chains and sufficient sampling for every parameter (effective sample sizes, ESS &gt;200), after a 10% burn-in.

Those cases were used to evaluate associations between risk factors and genomic transmission (clustered cases vs. unique cases) using Fisher’s exact test in R. The performance of WGS for detecting transmission was compared against classic contact tracing – to this end, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive values (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parikh et al., 2008</xref>). Following the definitions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diel et al., 2019</xref>, sensitivity was calculated as the probability of clustering epidemiologically linked cases (true positive value) by WGS. Specificity was calculated as the probability of classifying as unique those epidemiologically unlinked cases (true negative value) by WGS. PPV was calculated as the percentage of patients within a WGS cluster who had an epidemiologically confirmed link. NPV was calculated as the percentage of unique WGS cases without an epidemiologically confirmed link.</p><p>A ROC curve was calculated from a subset of the pairwise distance file, including pairwise distances from 0 to 2000 SNPs. We named as a ‘cluster’ those pairs defined as epidemiologically linked cases by contact tracing and ‘unique’ those pairs without a link.

Model assumptions, including linearity; influential values and multicollinearity were tested and verified in R. Goodness of fit of the logistic regression was tested with Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The best model was defined with the stepwise method, implemented in MASS library; it includes age, gender, place of birth, imprisonment, disease type and homelesness. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) indicates that the reduced model is better (AIC = 717.08) than the complete one (AIC = 726.42).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>Supplemental results</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10-1"><title>Comparison between epidemiological and genomic clustering</title><p>Epidemiological contact tracing was performed for 78% of study cases by DGSP with 97 cases identified as involved in transmission chains (66 epidemiological clusters).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Conor J Meehan (Reviewer #1); Timothy M Walker (Reviewer #2).</p><p>As is customary in <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers have discussed their critiques with one another. What follows below is the Reviewing Editor's edited compilation of the essential and ancillary points provided by reviewers in their critiques and in their interaction post-review. Please submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter, we also need to see the corresponding revision clearly marked in the text of the manuscript. Some of the reviewers' comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text. Please keep in mind, however, that readers may have the same perspective as the reviewers. Therefore, it is essential that you attempt to amend or expand the text to clarify the narrative accordingly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Comments from Reviewer 1 emphasize the need for several refinements to the BEAST analyses, most important among which is the issue of ascertainment biases. If sampling completeness is systematically different over time or in association with particular patient epidemiologic characteristics, then this may raise concerns about interpretation of the findings from this analysis. Specific reference is also made here about distinguishing timing of transmission events vs. time to the most recent common ancestor (coalescent).</p><p>2) Reviewer 2 raises the comment that the analysis presented in Table S3 would be stronger if a multivariate analysis had been performed, i.e. controlling for each of the risk factors to determine if they were independently associated with transmission events/clustering.</p><p>3) Reviewer 2 also raises points regarding the interpretation of SNP thresholds in settings with differing transmission characteristics, which likewise merit consideration when the authors revise their Discussion.</p><p>4) Formatting of the revised manuscript should follow <italic>eLife</italic>'s style guidelines including use of an unstructured abstract. Text in the figures, including in legends and axis labels, is in many places illegibly small and cannot be read on a written page or screen without substantial magnification; this should be fixed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Low burden vs low transmission</p><p>The framing of the 'low burden doesn't mean low local transmission' needs a better set up and implications explanation. On line 104 this is somewhat set up but it needs to be more clearly stated as an aim of the study. Additionally, what public health officials should do in low burden settings to better use these findings could be explained in the discussion. This would make it easier to read and help people create actionable decisions from these findings.</p><p>Line 352 about the future of the Spain TB profile: What backs this up? This is a crux, I think, of what you are trying to get at overall in the paper but it does not come across.</p><p>Potential sample bias</p><p>You had a few L5 and L6 in your dataset, yet these are more likely to not grow sufficiently within 3 weeks on 7H11, usually requiring 4 weeks. Do you think this could create bias in your sequenced dataset?</p><p>Referencing past work</p><p>There are a lot of great points made by the authors that perhaps come across as novel but have been shown before and should be referred to. Some examples (but not limited to): Roetzer et al. Plos Medicine 2013 looked extensively at contact tracing vs SNPs; Meehan et al. Ebiomedicine 2018 looked at time vs SNP cut-off; Meumann et al. Lancet Regional Health 2021 looked at time between cases linked genomically and epidemiologically. Some comparisons and general discussion of the findings in the context of these and other papers would be of benefit here.</p><p>This dataset was previously published in Xu et al. Plos Medicine 2019 but little reference is made to that paper or its findings. Indeed authors start the discussion stating they present the first population study in Valencia, but that's not exactly true since it was previously published by Xu, although not analysed in this context.

Were SNP alignments or complete WGS data used for the time trees? If SNP, were the invariant counts included to correct the branch lengths? If not, the dates on the branches are most certainly incorrect and need to be redone. If the full genome was used, this needs to be more apparent in the text. Perhaps the BEAST XML file could be supplied via a figshare link or similar.</p><p>As stated above, I feel the historical transmission analyses is weak and not well explained. I found it difficult to follow but it seems that only local-born samples were used for this? Although the authors state they are not trying to estimate all transmission in this period, even their approach will result in large inaccuracies in different settings with different sampling fractions and burdens. For example, even a small difference in sampling fraction can have an effect on these transmission event estimations without something like TransPhylo to correct for the sampling fraction (see Séraphin et al. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2018 for an example). The Xu et al. paper even showed that in Valencia there is a lot of missed index cases from epidemiological data that is found by TransPhylo. These would potentially also all be missed here without the additional Bayesian analyses of TransPhylo over the standard BEAST analyses.</p><p>My feeling is that the authors are actually trying to estimate coalescent events, not transmission events.

If the idea behind a threshold is essentially pragmatic, denoting a cut-off where sensitivity and specificity are optimised (as elegantly shown in Figure 2), then how is that impacted by the existence of isolates that are 20, 30, 50 or 100 SNPs apart? Is the argument that the existence of such intermediate distances implies possible epidemiological linkage across them that would inform contact tracing in a helpful way? That would seem unlikely, but it seems to be the implication, namely that it renders the 12 SNP threshold (which is/was epidemiologically defined for contact tracing) less applicable. I would have thought that different patterns are seen in Valencia and Malawi than in Oxfordshire because most of the cases there are endemic rather than imported. Long term transmission dynamics (by which we might understand the survival and expansion of particular clones/strains in a population) are indeed best understood phylogenetically rather than based on thresholds. But it's not clear why the data support 12 SNPs being less informative for contact tracing in Valencia or Malawi. If anything, a lower threshold (e.g. 5 SNPs or less) would make more sense where transmission is more intense, as it would be more specific and avoid investigating links between cases who might in truth be separated by several transmission events (i.e. intermediary cases). In subsequent paragraphs, the authors say just this. I would suggest rethinking how these findings are best interpreted in the text here, or at least successfully rebuffing the points above.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76605.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Comments from Reviewer 1 emphasize the need for several refinements to the BEAST analyses, most important among which is the issue of ascertainment biases.

On the contrary, in low-burden countries the assumption is that transmission plays at minor role, supported by the fact that in countries close to the pre-elimination phase (&lt;5/100,000 cases) tuberculosis cases are mainly contributed by re-activations of latent TB infection (LTBI) from recently arrived migrants (Menzies et al., 2018). However, whether the minor role of transmission in pre-elimination phase countries can be extrapolated to other low-burden countries is currently unknown. Understanding the correlation between burden and transmission and country specific dynamics is key if tailor-made control strategies are needed.”</p><p>Line 476: “High transmission among Spanish-born individuals is a major contributor to disease burden in Valencia.

In areas where incidence is mainly contributed by transmission, actions beyond passive case finding strategies are likely to be more successful. Different forms of active case finding to cut community transmission have been implemented in low income countries that can be transferred to high and middle income ones (Ho et al., 2016). Those strategies can be designed not only based on the presence of social and host risk factors (Dowdy et al., 2012) now there is the opportunity to move towards genomics-informed infection control programmes for example by identifying transmission hotspots or highlighting unanticipated risk factors. Active case finding also has the potential to tackle subclinical TB transmission, which we estimated using high resolution transmission mapping in our setting (Xu et al., 2019) and its impact on global and local TB control is still unknown (Kendall et al., 2021).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1.P3.

Contrary to other neighboring countries, Spain had historically higher TB rates which are now slowly matching the EU countries with lowest burden. Rates during the 90s’ were higher than 20/100,000 compared to around 10/100,000 in countries like the United Kingdom or Germany.

Thus, the Xu et al. paper does not describe relationships between all the strains in the dataset including those unique and therefore the present paper is the first describing the transmission profile of the region using genomic epidemiology.</p><p>On the other hand, in this new work we present a population-based study of the Valencia Region. One of the main objectives of the study was to evaluate SNP cut-offs in the light of epidemiological links via an ROC curve. We show that a 11.5 SNP cut-off maximizes the number of links without compromising specificity. Thus, we use a 12 SNP threshold. In Xu et al. 2019 the objectives were different and focused on understanding person-toperson transmission not the burden of transmission in the region. For this, we customized Transphylo, a tool that allows reconstructing transmission trees from phylogenetic trees. We used a 15-SNP threshold for two main reasons. 1. TransPhylo has a particular requirement of cluster size -at least 4 cases-, and genetic distances between cases, to be able to perform estimates, because of that we decided to construct clusters considering a larger distance threshold of 15 SNPs than is usually used. 2. Transphylo is largely agnostic to SNP thresholds, so we decided to include very recent transmission events as well as older transmission events. In any case 42.7% of the cases analyzed in this study were in a distance of 12 SNP or below compared to 43.5% 15 SNP.</p><p>However, we agree with the reviewer that the Xu et al. 2019 article could have been introduced better and discuss our results in the light of the previous results derived from part of the present dataset.

There is an alternative method to introduce ascertainment bias including the invariants sites in the XML file (https://groups.google.com/g/beast-users/c/QfBHMOqImFE). To explore which method performs better we have compared our correction approach with the commonly used method of including invariant position in the xml file. We evaluated the correlation between the median height values of each node estimated with both approaches, for each dataset (Figure 1). The correlation is close to 1 and significant, indicating that our approach is appropriate as an ascertainment bias correction method.</p><p>As an independent quality control of our dating approach we included in the original analysis a set of ancient DNA from mummies from Bos et al.

To notice, we did not try to quantify how many transmission events have happened over the last 150 years. Our rationale is that many person-to-person transmission events likely occurred along branches between nodes or nodes and terminals, they are impossible to quantify, but we can summarize all these events as one transmission link, as we are confident that at least one transmission event occurred along the branch. The exact time of the transmission is not possible to estimate either, instead our rationale is that when two circulating strains had a common transmission link in the past, this ancestor represents a lower-bound for when the strains started to circulate. Thus, we compare how many links have occurred during a period of time among different settings, as an approach of long term transmission dynamics analysis. In our approach, we only considered genomic data from local-born patients to avoid the influence of imported genotypes in our analysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1.P9.

These would potentially also all be missed here without the additional Bayesian analyses of TransPhylo over the standard BEAST analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer as the analysis from TransPhylo (one of the authors of the original paper is part of this ms) and Beast are different. With TransPhylo we can identify mostly recent transmission links and missing cases in densely sampled clusters, thus it is focused mainly in recent transmission, as was used in Xu et al. 2019. If TransPhylo were to map transmission events onto long branches, it would be doing that using only the information the user enters about the generation interval. If you assume a long generation interval, then the system estimates fewer transmission events, and vice versa.</p><p>If we try to run TransPhylo on a tree with several clusters separated by long branches, TransPhylo spends all its time adding and removing transmission events on the long branches where it has no information, and doesn't converge well in the sense of estimation within the clusters. TransPhylo can't simultaneously estimate the timing of transmission, the effective population size in the host (parameter Neg) and the sampling fraction. However, within the densely-sampled clusters it can help. In this sense, adding more recent transmission links was not our intention, since we were interested in long-term transmission dynamics.</p><p>With BEAST we use the ancestral nodes as a surrogate of historical transmission links to reconstruct the historical epidemic in each setting. One major limitation is that if any representative derived from those ancestral transmission events is not present in our sampling period (2014-2016), they will be missed in our historical reconstruction. Thus, any transmission lineage that has died will not be reflected. However, this is precisely one of our points about the impact of interventions when we compare Oxfordshire to Valencia or to Malawi.</p><p>On the other hand, our approach used population based datasets, in all cases more than 70% of positive culture cases were sequenced; meaning that we recover almost all the transmission that can be measured by WGS. Malawi was the setting with the least percentage of cases sequenced (72% of culture positive) and Oxfordshire the highest (92%). In this sense, if including more cases had any impact in our results, it would affect more to Malawi and Valencia than to Oxfordshire, probably increasing the differences in the historical transmission dynamics observed, making our results even more significant.</p><p>We have now included this explanation in the manuscript under “Tracking historical transmission links” heading (Material and Methods, line 253).

We totally agree with the reviewer although we may have failed to pass through the message. There are two important roles for thresholds in our opinion and experience working with public health. On one hand, communicating genomic clustering helps in on-going public health investigations particularly within 5 SNP but we have found cases up to 12 SNP that have clarified the origin of an outbreak. In fact, report 5, 12, 15 SNP thresholds to public health together with a degree of confidence, it is the call from public health officials to pursue or not the potential links.
