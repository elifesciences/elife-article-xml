where they engage in a wide array of intra- and inter-specific interactions. The extent to which these interactions drive or impede microbiome diversity is not well understood. Historically, two contrasting hypotheses have been suggested to explain how species interactions could influence diversity. ‘Ecological Controls’ (EC) predicts a negative relationship, where the evolution or migration of novel types is constrained as niches become filled. In contrast, ‘Diversity Begets Diversity’ (DBD) predicts a positive relationship, with existing diversity promoting the accumulation of further diversity via niche construction and other interactions. Using high-throughput amplicon sequencing data from the Earth Microbiome Project, we provide evidence that DBD is strongest in low-diversity biomes, but weaker in more diverse biomes, consistent with biotic interactions initially favouring the accumulation of diversity (as predicted by DBD). However, as niches become increasingly filled, diversity hits a plateau (as predicted by EC).</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>biodiversity</kwd><kwd>black queen hypothesis</kwd><kwd>microbial ecology</kwd><kwd>evolutionary ecology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shapiro</surname><given-names>B Jesse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shapiro</surname><given-names>B Jesse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Microbiomediversity favors further diversity in a positive feedback that is strongest in lower-diversity biomes but which plateaus as niches are increasingly filled in higher-diversity biomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The majority of the genetic diversity on Earth is encoded by microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hug et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lapierre and Gogarten, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tara Oceans coordinators et al., 2015</xref>) and the functioning of all Earth’s ecosystems is reliant on diverse microbial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Falkowski et al., 2008</xref>). High-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing studies continue to yield unprecedented insight into the taxonomic richness of microbiomes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Louca et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sogin et al., 2006</xref>), and abiotic drivers of community composition (e.g. pH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lauber et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Power et al., 2018</xref>) are increasingly characterized. Although it is known that biotic (microbe-microbe) interactions can also be important in determining community composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Needham and Fuhrman, 2016</xref>), comparatively little is known about how such interactions, either positive (e.g. cross-feeding; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seth and Taga, 2014</xref>) or negative (e.g. toxin-mediated interference competition; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Czárán et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hibbing et al., 2010</xref>), shape microbiome diversity as a whole.</p><p>The dearth of studies exploring how microbial interactions could influence diversity stands in marked contrast to a long research tradition on biotic controls of plant and animal diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elton, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gause, 2003</xref>). In an early study of 49 animal (vertebrate and invertebrate) community samples, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elton, 1946</xref> plotted the number of species versus the number of genera and observed a ~ 1:1 ratio in each individual sample, but a ~ 4:1 ratio when all samples were pooled. He took this observation as evidence for competitive exclusion preventing related species, more likely to overlap in niche space, to co-exist. This concept, more recently referred to as niche filling or Ecological Controls (EC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schluter and Pennell, 2017</xref>), predicts speciation (or, more generally, diversification) rates to decrease with increasing standing species diversity because less niche space is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rabosky and Hurlbert, 2015</xref>). In contrast, the Diversity Begets Diversity (DBD) model predicts that when species interactions create novel niches, standing biodiversity favours further diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calcagno et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Whittaker, 1972</xref>). For example, niche construction (i.e. the physical, chemical or biological alteration of the environment) could influence the evolution of the species constructing the niche, as well as that of co-occurring species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laland et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">San Roman and Wagner, 2018</xref>). An alternative to either EC or DBD is The Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography, in which all species are functionally equivalent and communities assemble via random sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hubbell, 2001</xref>). Neutral Theory serves as a null hypothesis of community assembly in macrobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azaele et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gotelli and McGill, 2006</xref>), and more recently in microbiome research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harris et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li and Ma, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Empirical evidence for the action of EC vs. DBD in natural plant and animal communities has been mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calcagno et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emerson and Kolm, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Palmer and Maurer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Price et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rabosky et al., 2018</xref>). Laboratory evolution experiments tracking the diversification of a focal bacterial lineage in communities of varying complexity have also yielded contradictory results, with support for EC, DBD, or intermediate scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brockhurst et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meyer and Kassen, 2007</xref>). For example, diversification of a focal <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> clone was favoured by increasing community diversity in the range of 0–20 other strains or species within the same genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calcagno et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jousset et al., 2016</xref>) but diversification was inhibited in highly diverse communities (e.g. hundreds or thousands of species in compost; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gómez and Buckling, 2013</xref>). These experiments are consistent with interspecific competition initially driving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey et al., 2013</xref>), but eventually inhibiting diversification as niches are filled.</p><p>Most laboratory experiments are restricted to relatively short evolutionary time scales and include only a small number of taxa; it is therefore unclear if they can be generalized to natural communities consisting of many more taxa evolving and assembling over much longer periods, spanning more environmental change, greater evolutionary diversification, and frequent migration events. Although the absence of a substantial prokaryotic fossil record hinders deconvoluting speciation and extinction rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Louca and Pennell, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marshall, 2017</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Louca et al., 2018</xref> recently estimated that bacterial diversity has mostly increased over the past billion years, with speciation rates slightly exceeding extinction rates. However, because many free-living microbes have high migration rates (‘everything is everywhere, but the environment selects’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Wit and Bouvier, 2006</xref>]), we expect that the majority of diversity present within a typical microbiome sample is selected from a pool of migrants rather than having evolved in situ. As such, here we broadly define ‘diversity begets diversity’ (DBD) to include the combined effects of community assembly from a migrant pool (‘ecological species sorting’) and in situ evolutionary diversification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Contrasting the Diversity Begets Diversity (DBD) and Ecological Controls (EC) models.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>). In this hypothetical scenario, microbiome sample 1 contains one non-focal genus, and two amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) within the focal genus (point at x = 1, y = 2 in the plot). Sample 2 contains three non-focal genera, and four ASVs within the focal genus (point at x = 3, y = 4). Tracing a line through these points yields a positive diversity slope, supporting the DBD model (red). (<bold>B</bold>) Alternatively, a negative slope would support the Ecological Controls (EC) model (blue line). In the middle panel, we consider a community assembly model to explain the hypothetical data of the top panel, in which standing diversity (black points) in a community selects (for or against) new types (referred to here as ASVs) which arrive via migration (purple points and arrows). In the bottom panel, we consider an evolutionary diversification model of a focal lineage (genus) into ASVs as a function of initial genus-level community diversity present at the time of diversification.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58999-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>To test whether patterns of diversity in natural communities conform to EC or DBD dynamics, we used 2000 microbiome samples from the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP), the largest available repository of biodiversity based on standardized sampling and sequencing protocols, with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) as the finest-grained taxonomic unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elton, 1946</xref>, we use the equivalent of Species:Genus ratios, calculating a range of taxonomic diversity ratios (up to the Class:Phylum level) as proxies for diversity within a focal taxon, from shallow to deep evolutionary time. We then plot each ratio as a function of the number of non-focal taxa (Genera, Families, Orders, Classes, and Phyla, respectively) with which the focal taxon could interact. We refer to the slope of these plots as the ‘diversity slope’, with negative slopes supporting EC and positive slopes supporting DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As a null, we compare these slopes to the expectation under Neutral Theory. To avoid a trivially positive diversity slope due to variation in sequencing effort, all samples were rarefied to 5000 observations (counts of 16S rRNA gene sequences), as diversity estimates are highly sensitive to sampling effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gotelli and Colwell, 2001</xref>). As 16S evolves at a rate of roughly 1–2 substitutions per million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuo and Ochman, 2009b</xref>), evolutionary diversification within individual EMP samples cannot be uncovered using this marker; rather our data represent mainly a record of community assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantifying the DBD-EC continuum in prokaryote communities compared to neutral null models</title><p>We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to estimate the diversity slope at each taxonomic level in the EMP data, which revealed a tendency towards positive slopes with significant variation explained by the random effects of lineage, environment, and their interaction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Section 1). All models reported here provide significantly better fits compared to models without the fixed effect of community diversity, and coefficients of determination (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic>) are higher with the inclusion of random effects, showing their importance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Examples of how the diversity slope varies across lineages and environments are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s16">16</xref>. To assess the significance of these slope estimates in light of potential sampling bias and data structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gotelli and Colwell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jarvinen, 1982</xref>), we considered null models, all of which randomize the associations between ASVs within a sample, thus randomizing any true biotic interactions. Models 1 and 2 are based on draws from the zero-sum multinomial (ZSM) distribution, which arises from the standard Neutral Theory of Biodiversity (Materials and methods). Model 1, in which each microbiome sample is drawn from the same ZSM distribution, produces a significantly negative diversity slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s17">Figure 2—figure supplement 17</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Model 2, in which each environment draws from a separate distribution, is effectively a composite of Model 1 in which different environments, each with a negative slope, are 'stacked' to yield an overall positive slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s17">Figure 2—figure supplement 17</xref>). However, the Model 2 slope is not significant in a GLMM accounting for variation across environments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> Section 1.2). In the real EMP data, most individual environments tend towards a positive slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s18">Figure 2—figure supplement 18</xref>). The tendency towards positive diversity slopes in the EMP is therefore not straightforwardly explained by neutral processes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Focal-lineage diversity as a function of community diversity in the top two most prevalent taxa at each taxonomic level.</title><p>As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the x-axes show community diversity in units of the number of non-focal taxa (e.g. the number of non-Proteobacteria phyla for the left-most column), and the y-axes show the taxonomic ratio within the focal taxon (e.g. the number of classes within Proteobacteria).

In contrast, the addition of EC had little effect on the slope, suggesting low power to detect EC under some null models. Taken together, these modelling results suggest that positive diversity slopes observed in the EMP are more readily explained by DBD than by Neutral Theory, whereas negative slopes could be explained by EC, Neutral Theory, or some combination of the two.</p><p>Because taxonomic labels can be unavailable or inconsistent with phylogenetic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parks et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vos, 2011</xref>) we repeated the analyses using nucleotide sequence identity in the 16S rRNA gene instead of taxonomy, and again recovered generally positive diversity slopes (Materials and methods). As a final sensitivity analysis, we repeated the GLMMs using unrarefied community Shannon diversity instead of richness (Materials and methods) and obtained similar results, with generally positive diversity slopes that could in some cases be reversed depending on the lineage or environment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Section 2). The Shannon diversity metric is robust to sampling effort, suggesting that the results are not biased by undersampling in diverse biomes.

This expectation is borne out in our dataset, particularly in the nucleotide sequence-based analyses which support quadratic or cubic relationships over linear diversity slopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s20">Figure 2—figure supplement 20</xref>). For example, in the animal distal gut, a relatively low-diversity biome, we observed a strong linear DBD relationship at most phylogenetic depths; in contrast, the much more diverse soil biome clearly reaches a plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s21">Figure 2—figure supplements 21</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s26">26</xref>).</p><p>To comprehensively test the hypothesis that more diverse microbiomes experience weaker DBD due to saturated niche space, we used a GLMM including the interaction between diversity and environment as a fixed effect. We considered this model only for taxonomic ratios with significant diversity slope variation by environment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>): Family:Order, Order:Class, and Class:Phylum. Diversity slopes were significantly higher in less diverse (often host-associated) biomes, suggesting that niche filling leads to a plateau of DBD in more diverse biomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Section 3). The interaction observed in the real EMP data between community diversity and biome type in shaping focal lineage diversity was not observed under a neutral null (Model 2, in which each environment has its own characteristic level of diversity) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> Section 1.2). The DBD plateau observed in more diverse biomes is thus not readily explained by a neutral model, nor is rarefaction expected to bias the diversity slope estimates, particularly at the Class:Phylum level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s19">Figure 2—figure supplement 19</xref>). This suggests that the plateau of DBD at higher levels of community diversity is not an artefact of data structure or sampling effort. Finally, we considered whether variation along the EC-DBD continuum could be explained by differential cell density across environments, which could affect both the frequency of cell-cell interactions (a biological effect) or the sampling depth (a technical artefact). Although precise estimates of cell densities in all EMP biomes are not available, we extracted plausible ranges for eight biomes from the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kennedy and de Luna, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lindow and Brandl, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sender et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Whitman et al., 1998</xref>) and annotated these in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.

Migrants to the ‘wrong’ environment experience even less DBD, and are even subject to EC in two out of three environment types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).

The strength of the DBD relationship dissipates with increasing microbiome diversity, which we hypothesize is caused by niche saturation. In more diverse biomes such as soil, abiotic factors therefore may become relatively more important in driving focal-lineage diversity. The effect of DBD is strongest among habitat specialists (residents), suggesting that long-term niche adaptation tends to select against the establishment of migrant diversity.</p><p>While most of the DBD literature considers a model of evolutionary diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schluter and Pennell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Whittaker, 1972</xref>), our results pertain mainly to ecological community assembly dynamics. At the limited resolution of 16S rRNA gene sequences, we do not expect measurable diversification within an individual microbiome sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuo and Ochman, 2009b</xref>); however, community diversity could still select for (as in DBD) or against (as in EC) increasing diversity in a focal lineage, even if this lineage diversified before the sampled community assembled. Future work with higher resolution genomic or metagenomic data will enable testing if and how DBD arises in microbial communities via evolutionary diversification, and also how prokaryote diversification is affected by other community members including phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brockhurst et al., 2005</xref>), protists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meyer and Kassen, 2007</xref>), and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kastman et al., 2016</xref>). Predator-prey, cross-feeding, and other biotic interactions with these non-prokaryotic community members could explain some of the unaccounted variation we observed in diversity slopes across environments.</p><p>Our dataset also provides an opportunity to explore how DBD relates to genome size evolution. Bacteria with larger repertoires of accessory genes, and thus larger genomes, are able to occupy a wider range of niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barberán et al., 2014</xref>). Taxa with larger genomes might therefore be hypothesized to better survive and thrive when they disperse into a new location, exhibiting stronger DBD. Although a comprehensive test of this hypothesis will require higher resolution genomic or metagenomic data, as a preliminary exploration we assigned genome sizes to 576 focal genera for which at least one whole genome sequence was available (using the largest recorded genome size for each genus) and added an interaction term between genome size and diversity as a fixed effect in the GLMM (Materials and methods). Consistent with our expectation, we observed a significant positive effect of genome size on the diversity slope (GLMM, Wald test, z = 2.5, p=0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Section 6). This effect was not observed in null models, in which the interaction between community diversity and focal genus genome size was never significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> Section 1.3 and 2.2) and so this effect of genome size cannot be trivially explained by data structure. The positive relationship between genome size and DBD is likely even stronger than estimated, because assigning genome sizes to entire genera is imprecise (i.e. there is variation in genome size within a genus, or even within species), therefore weakening the correlation.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Positive effect of genome size on DBD.</title><p>Results are shown from a GLMM predicting focal lineage diversity as a function of the interaction between community diversity and genome size at the ASV:Genus ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Section 6).

This tendency appears to be at odds with the Black Queen hypothesis, which predicts that social conflict between interacting species leads to the inactivation and loss of genes involved in shareable metabolites (public goods), eventually resulting in reduced genome size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morris et al., 2012</xref>). Such a process would produce a negative correlation between the degree of species interactions (i.e. community diversity) and genome size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morris et al., 2012</xref>). The interaction between genome size, biotic interactions and diversification thus deserves further study.</p><p>Alongside theory and experimental data, the EMP survey data provide a window into the biotic drivers of microbial diversity in nature. In particular, our correlational results support previous experiments and theory showing that DBD is strong when community diversity is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calcagno et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jousset et al., 2016</xref>), driving the accumulation of diversity in a positive feedback loop until niches are filled and EC starts to predominate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brockhurst et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gómez and Buckling, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meyer and Kassen, 2007</xref>). However, due to the correlational nature of the EMP data, it is not possible to test whether DBD is primarily due to the creation of novel niches via biotic interactions and niche construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laland et al., 1999</xref>), or due to increased competition leading to specialization on underexploited resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hibbing et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jousset et al., 2016</xref>). We hope future higher resolution genomic studies, and complementary experiments, will be able to elucidate the types of biotic interactions that promote microbiome diversity. Regardless of the underlying mechanisms, our results demonstrate a general scaling between different levels of community diversity, which has important implications for modelling and predicting community function and stability in response to perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coyte et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pennekamp et al., 2018</xref>).

Data standardization (transformation to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one) was applied to all predictors to get comparable estimates. In models with only one predictor, applying standardization resolved convergence warnings and considerably sped up the optimization. We first tested the significance of random effects, by using likelihood-ratio tests (LRTs, implemented in the anova function in the R stats package) on nested models where each random effect was dropped one at a time. We then assessed the significance of fixed effects using the drop1 function from the stats package with the likelihood-ratio test option (this function drops individual terms from the full model and compares models based on the AIC). We calculated the Akaike information criterion (AIC) of each significant model and a null model including all random effects but no fixed effects other than the intercept.

As the dependent variable (focal lineage diversity, defined as taxonomic ratios, ASV:Genus, Genus:Family, Family:Order, Order:Class, and Class:Phylum) was a count response, we used a Poisson error distribution with a log link function. Community diversity (number of non-focal lineages: non-focal Genera, Families, Orders, Classes, and Phyla), standardized to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, was specified as the predictor (fixed effect). We included the following random effects on the slope and intercept: lineage (Lin), environment (Env), environment nested within lineage (a lineage may be present in different environments) and lab (the principal investigator who conducted the EMP study) nested within environment (different labs sampled and sequenced a given environment) (as suggested in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html">http://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html</ext-link>).

To do so, we fitted a GLMM with the number of ASVs per focal taxon as the response variable, and the Shannon diversity based on ASVs across all non-focal taxa (z-standardized) as the predictor (fixed effect) The random effects were kept as in the taxonomy-based GLMMs, but we added an observation-level random effect to account for overdispersion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> section 2).

These null models were randomly generated matrices of the same size as the real EMP dataset, but based on a distribution that arises from the Neutral Theory of Biodiversity. Neutral Theory postulates that the biodiversity of a metacommunity is governed by independent random population dynamics across species. The aggregate behaviour is quantified by the fundamental biodiversity number <italic>θ</italic>, such that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn> <mml:mi/><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>J</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>υ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>J<sub>M</sub></italic> is the size of the metacommunity and <italic>ν</italic> is the speciation rate.

Model 1 assumes that the whole dataset follows the same species abundance distribution (SAD), characterized by a mZSM with <italic>θ</italic> = 50. Model 2 assumes that each environment has its own SAD and thus all the samples of a single environment are assigned the same <italic>θ</italic> but are distinct across environments (<italic>θ</italic> was chosen uniformly between 1 and 100). The number of samples per environment were the same as the EMP dataset. To obtain similar mean counts as the real dataset, we set <italic>J</italic> = 1000 for both models 1 and 2, in order to vary <italic>θ</italic> from 1 to 100. These values are reasonable based on previous studies that estimated these parameters from microbiome data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li and Ma, 2016</xref>). We included a down-sampling step to replicate the zero-inflated nature of the real dataset (on average there were only 96 ASVs per sample while there was a total of 22,014 ASVs in the entire EMP dataset). To replicate the sampling effect due to rarefaction, we first created a vector of all individuals from a single sample. We then selected 5000 individuals at random whose identities determined which ASVs were found in that sample. These neutrally-derived random matrices, null models 1 and 2, were plotted using the same plots (ASV:Genus vs number of genera) as the real EMP dataset and were then analysed using GLMMs with community diversity as a predictor of focal lineage diversity (fixed effect), with lineage identity and EMP sample ID as random effects. For Model 1, the slope was significantly negative (GLMM, Wald test, z=-9.807, <italic>P</italic>&lt;2e-16). For Model 2, the null GLMM (including the intercept only) was significant, meaning that the community diversity has no significant effect on focal lineages diversity (Likelihood-ratio test between the model with the predictor and the intercept-only model, <italic>P</italic>=0.9399).</p><p>To generate a null model for a metacommunity assembled by niche processes, null model 3 was made by sampling from a single Poisson distribution (λ = 0.01) for each element of the data matrix. We used the Poisson distribution as a sensitivity analysis compared to the ZSM, and found the two behave quite similarly (i.e. Model 1 and 3 produce qualitatively similar results). The probability of size zero was sufficiently large that the down-sampling step was not needed for this model. Next, DBD and EC effects were added to null model 3 according to the following procedure. An element was chosen at random in a sample and tested if it is empty or full (i.e. check the presence/absence of a particular ASV). If the element is full then the DBD algorithm fills an empty element chosen at random in the same sample, while the EC algorithm empties a filled element in the same sample. This is to mimic the effect of DBD creating a niche for a new ASV, or EC removing a niche based on the existing diversity. The strength of DBD or EC effects were determined by the percent of elements tested.

DBD variation across environments was tested for Family:Order, Order:Class and Class:Phylum taxonomic ratios, as diversity slope variation by environment was statistically significant (likelihood-ratio test, p&lt;0.05) for these ratios in the taxonomy-based models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Abiotic effects</title><p>To test for the relative effect of biotic and abiotic environmental variables on focal lineage diversity across different taxonomic ratios, we used a separate GLMM, with Poisson error distribution and a log link function, for every ratio. We fitted the GLMM on a subset (~10%) of the whole dataset, 192 samples (from water: saline (19) and non-saline (44), surface: saline (42) and non-saline (19), sediment: saline (22) and non-saline (31), soil (8) and plant rhizosphere (7)), for which measurements of four key abiotic variables (temperature, pH, latitude and elevation) were available. As predictors of focal lineage diversity (fixed effects), we included non-focal community diversity and abiotic variables, as well as their interactions. All predictors were standardized to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one to obtain comparable estimates. The GLMM had the same random effects as in the previous analysis, but only on the intercept for simplicity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> section 4).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Soil dataset analysis</title><p>We used the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2018</xref> soil microbiome survey (237 samples from 18 countries) to further test the relative impacts of biotic versus abiotic drivers of diversity. Raw data and abiotic measurements were downloaded from Figshare (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/s/82a2d3f5d38ace925492">https://figshare.com/s/82a2d3f5d38ace925492</ext-link>; DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.5611321). 16S bioinformatic processing was performed using QIIME2 and Deblur with the same protocol as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>. Raw data 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4 region), were processed by trimming the primers (341F/805R primer set) with qiime cutadapt trim-paired, then merged using qiime vsearch join-pairs. Sequences were quality filtered and denoised using Deblur with a trimming length of 400 bp. The resulting 400 bp Deblur BIOM table was filtered to keep only ASVs with at least 25 reads total over all samples and rarefied to a depth of 5000. Taxonomy was assigned with a Naive Bayes classifier trained on the V4-V3 region of 99% OTU Greengenes 13.8 sequences with qiime feature-classifier. We obtained a final dataset of 186 samples and 24,252 ASVs which was used as input for all statistical analysis as in the EMP dataset analysis. This data set included 14 environmental factors: aridity index (Aridity_Index), minimum and maximum temperature (MINT and MAXT), precipitation seasonality (PSEA), mean diurnal temperature range (MDR), ultra-violet (UV) radiation (UV_Light), net primary productivity (NPP2003_2015), soil texture (Clay_silt), pH; total C (Soil_C), N (Soil_N) and P (Soil_P) concentrations, C:N ratio (Soil_C_N_ratio) and Latitude.</p><p>We used a separate GLMM with Poisson error distribution and a log link function to test for the effect of biotic (non-focal community diversity) and abiotic environmental variables on focal lineage diversity (e.g. the ASV:Genus ratio for a focal genus), across different taxonomic ratios.

The quadratic terms were not significant, except for the ASV:genus ratio (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>; likelihood-ratio test, p&lt;2.2e-16). The interaction terms were not significant except the interaction between diversity and PCs at Family:Order ratio (likelihood-ratio test, p=2.182e-05; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Defining residents, generalists, and migrants</title><p>We defined a genus-level community composition matrix as a matrix of 17 environments (rows) by 1128 genera (columns), with the matrix entries indicating the percentage of samples from a given environment in which each genus is present. We clustered the environmental samples based on their genus-level community composition using fuzzy <italic>k</italic>-means clustering. The clustering (cmeans function, package e1071 in R) was done on the ‘hellinger’ transformed data (decostand function, vegan R package). To identify resident genera to each cluster, we used indicator species analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dufrene and Legendre, 1997</xref>) as implemented in the indval function (labdsv R package). We defined residents as genera with indval indices between 0.4 and 0.9, with permutation test p&lt;0.05. Genera not associated with any cluster were considered generalists. We used principal component analysis (PCA) on the community composition matrix to visualize the clustering and the indicator genera (rda function, vegan R package) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We then ran a separate GLMM for each environmental cluster, with resident genus-level diversity (number of non-focal genera) as a predictor of focal genus diversity (ASV:Genus ratio) for resident, migrant (residents of one cluster found in a different cluster) and generalist genera. The fixed effect was specified as the interaction between diversity and a factor defining the genus-cluster association (with three levels: resident, migrant and generalist). Random effects on intercept and slope were kept as in the GLMMs described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Genome size analysis</title><p>We chose a subset of genera represented by one or more sequenced genomes in the NCBI microbial genomes database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse#!/prokaryotes/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse#!/prokaryotes/</ext-link>). For these genera, a representative genome size was assigned by selecting the genome with the lowest number of scaffolds (if no closed genomes were available) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). If multiple genomes were available with the same level of completion, the largest genome size was used, as smaller genomes could be artefacts of incomplete assembly which would bias the mean and median downward. Moreover, given the deletional bias in bacterial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuo and Ochman, 2009a</xref>), the largest genome is likely more reflective of the ancestral genome size of the genus. Only genera with two or more ASVs in at least one sample were included in the analysis. Intracellular symbionts were excluded. We fitted a GLMM on the subset of data with known genome size (576 genera, ranging from ~1 to 15 Mbp) with the interaction between community diversity and genome size as a predictor of focal lineage diversity at the ASV:Genus level. All the other random effects on intercept and slope were kept as in the previous GLMMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> section 6).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Luke Thompson for assistance obtaining EMP data and Zofia Ecaterina Taranu, Vincent Fugère and Guillaume Larocque for advice on GLMMs. We are also grateful to Steven Kembel, Tom Battin, the reviewers Eric Kemen and Benjamin E Wolfe, and the editor Detlef Weigel for critical comments that improved the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Eric Kemen (Reviewer #1); Benjamin E Wolfe (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Madi and colleagues revisit an old debate in the ecology literature dating back to the 1940s: Does diversity promote or constrain diversity at different levels, and how is diversity maintained? On one hand, having more species to interact with can create new niches and promote diversity. On the other hand, more species might mean more competition that would limit additional gains in diversity. While these hypotheses make opposite predictions, they are not mutually exclusive and likely act in tandem during community assembly. As the authors note, these questions have been asked in communities of macroorganisms, but this is probably the first high-level analysis of a large microbiome dataset that explores how species interactions influence microbial diversity.</p><p>The authors found support for the &quot;Diversity Begets Diversity&quot; (DBD) hypothesis in habitats with lower overall diversity, while in habitats with higher overall diversity, the &quot;Ecological Controls&quot; (EC) hypothesis appeared to more closely describe patterns of microbial diversity.</p><p>There are many caveats when inferring microbial interactions and other dimensions of microbial diversity from 16S rRNA amplicon data, but this work provides a great jumping point for many future studies to experimentally test some of the conclusions of this analysis.</p><p>The paper has a great mix of modern tools, historical ideas, and interdisciplinary science. It is clearly written and the analyses are generally carefully executed and presented.</p><p>However, there are also several significant concerns, which we hope the authors will be able to address.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A third significant hypothesis is missing that makes predictions about how diversity can affect net rates of diversification, The Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography (NT). The pattern the authors observed – decreased diversity slopes within clades embedded within more diverse communities – can be explained by a neutral model devoid of ecological interactions. Let us consider a simple neutral model that has a rate of diversification intrinsic to each unique taxonomic unit (new taxa emerging per generation per unique taxonomic unit) and a rate of stochastic extinction that is proportional to the population size of each taxonomic unit. The probability that any taxa diversifies would be uniform throughout the community, however, as the diversity increases, this increases the number of unique units that can yield new taxa and thus the rate of influx of new taxa. At some tipping point, however, the community will become so diverse that the population size of any given taxa will be low and susceptible to stochastic loss. This will cause the net diversification rate to drop in more diverse communities. This is just a simple example and it does not consider migration, which is important for shaping microbial diversity; however, it demonstrates that other forces outside of the ecologically-based models of DBD and EC may be acting to produce the patterns under investigation. It is important to rule out NT's parsimonious predictions before moving on to testing sophisticated ecological theories.</p><p>2) Following from the NT discussion, there is likely an important role for extinction in shaping these patterns. The discussion of hypotheses focused on the production of diversity and not the net balance of production and loss. This omission is a major weakness of the paper; some discussion of the role of extinction in these patterns would strengthen the interpretations.</p><p>3) The analysis of the relationship between genome size and DBD in the context of the Black Queen Hypothesis is not convincing. As the authors acknowledge, there are serious limitations with assuming that the genome size from one strain/species within a genus can fully represent the genome size of that genus. The authors do not provide an estimate of how much error might result from this approach (for example, by looking at several genera where many genome sizes exist and seeing how that impacts their analyses). They also do not fully explain their rationale for some aspects of this analysis; for example, why was the largest genome size available used? Why would having more precise genome data make the positive relationship stronger?</p><p>We suggest that this part of the analysis is removed in the revision. You may refer to it in the Discussion as speculation.</p><p>If you decide to discuss genome size and how this could correlate with more metabolic functions, you should elaborate further on this. Generally genome size correlates to repeats rather than additional metabolite clusters. You could use the available genomes to annotate genome clusters (using e.g. antiSMASH).</p><p>4) One of the major findings is the evidence for DBD being strongest in less diverse biomes and weaker in more diverse biomes. However, some of these biomes also suggest a correlation with total microbial load. For example, the animal distal gut is a less diverse biome but an extremely densely populated biome, whereas the soil biome is exceptionally diverse but has a lower total microbial density than the distal animal gut. Do the authors have access to any data about the population density in these different biomes? Does population density also correlate with the DBD-EC continuum? If the authors do not think that total microbial load factors into the DBD-EC continuum, they should provide an explicit rationale why not. Note that we do not expect that microbial population size data are available for the entire data set, but perhaps there is a subset for which this is available and that could be analysed.</p><p>5) For model validation for GLMMs, it would be useful if the authors could report goodness of fit for all their models (differences between the observed values and the model's predicted) using the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Further, using cross validation (dividing data to train and test) might be useful to estimate the error rate of the models and could be used to confirm the accuracy of the models.</p><p>Additional major comments:</p><p>6) The measures for diversity vary over the paper and it is not always clear when which measurement is used, which makes it difficult to compare the analyses. Where the measures differ, this should be justified.</p><p>For example, this is clear in Figures 1, 4 and 5, but not in Figure 2. Similarly, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, which show the number of focal taxa as a function of the number of non-focal taxa, but in Figure 3 the diversity slope was estimated from a GLMM using taxonomic ratio for the community diversity, without mentioning what diversity measure was used for focal lineage. More generally, are taxonomic ratios a good measures of lineage diversity? Please explain why you used these measures of diversity instead of others. You mention that you also tried others such as Shannon index that are also robust but did not follow up on this.</p><p>7) In the very beginning of the Results, the authors note that a null model was used to assess the slopes from their GLMMs (subsection “Quantifying the DBD-EC continuum in prokaryote communities”), but details are provided only later in the Materials and methods. We think the paper would be very much improved if the authors spent a paragraph explaining the null model early in the Results section and if a data figure (or figures) from the null model were moved to the main body of the text from the supplementary information. This would help the reader understand how support for significance of the slopes was determined as they move through the rest of the paper. More importantly, the paper would have greater readability and impact for a broader audience if the authors explained the development and rationale of their null model in very simple terms.</p><p>8) The term ASV is used throughout, but the downloaded databases contain mainly OTUs. This of course could affect the outcome of an analyses depending if OTUs and ASVs are mixed or either OTUs or ASVs are used. Please explain in more detail what was used and how it was calculated.</p><p>9) A major limitation that is not acknowledged is a sole focus on prokaryotic taxa. Many of the ecosystems sampled in the EMP dataset have diverse and abundant fungi, protists, and other types of microbes. It is likely that these other microbial taxa interact with the target bacteria studied in this work in diverse ways (as numerous previous studies have shown). The authors should acknowledge this major limitation and explore briefly how it may impact their findings in the Discussion of the text. For example, fungi may play disproportionate roles in some environments that explain some of the variation observed here (e.g. the rhizosphere).</p><p>10) Subsection “Abiotic drivers of diversity”, last two paragraphs: These two paragraphs contain two analyses that essentially contradict each other. These varying results are interesting – could you please expand a little more on why these two analyses might be showing different results? In particular, the last sentence suggests that diversity levels in soil and other communities with a DBD plateau are predominantly controlled by abiotic factors. However, this is the first mention of those specific biomes in this paragraph. Could you add a little more about this observation?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58999.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A third significant hypothesis is missing that makes predictions about how diversity can affect net rates of diversification, The Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography (NT).

It is important to rule out NT's parsimonious predictions before moving on to testing sophisticated ecological theories.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this oversight on our part; the Neutral Theory (NT) is a natural concept to include, and we now consider it explicitly as a potential explanation for the diversity slopes observed in the EMP data. We mention the NT in the Introduction, and the Results now include simulated data sampled from the distribution that arises from the classical NT: the zero-sum multinomial (ZSM). These simulated data are generated in a very similar way to our previous null models, except that the Poisson distribution has been replaced with the ZSM to align with NT. As before, and as suggested by the reviewers, ours is a model of community assembly rather than de novo diversification, which is more appropriate for the 16S amplicon data from EMP (in which de novo speciation within a sample is highly unexpected).</p><p>Under neutral Model 1, in which all data are sampled from the same ZSM distribution, there is a significantly negative diversity slope, and the trend is visibly linear (updated Figure 2—figure supplement 7). Under neutral Model 2, in which each environment draws from a separate distribution (which we consider to be realistic given that environments have systematically different levels of community diversity), there is a visibly positive trend (due to ‘stacked’ negative slopes from different environments; Figure 2—figure supplement 7) but this is found to be non-significant in a GLMM that accounts for the effect of different environments. We note that our previous Model 2 (which was made with a Poisson distribution) contained an error: although we stated in the text that there was one distribution per environment, in fact the data were generated from a model with one distribution per sample. This error has now been corrected, and we consider the ‘environment-specific diversity’ model more parsimonious than the ‘sample-specific diversity’ model, especially given that sample-specific effects on the diversity slope are relatively small (Table 1). The neutral null models 1 and 2 assume no species interactions by definition and so are not included as ‘baselines’ for the DBD or EC “spike-in” simulations. We keep the old Model 1 (sampled from one Poisson distribution) as the baseline for the DBD and EC “spike-in” simulations, and it is now called Model 3.</p><p>Overall, the updated model results suggest that a positive diversity slope is unlikely to arise under NT, but that negative slopes can arise. Combined with the finding that adding DBD, but not EC, is detectable by our GLMMs, this suggests we are well-powered to detect DBD but likely underpowered to detect EC in the EMP data. Therefore, the positive slopes in the EMP data are likely real, but there may be undetectable EC effects as well.</p><p>Regarding the plateau of DBD at high levels of diversity: these results indicate that the ‘upward’ part of the slope is likely due to DBD, but the plateau could be due to a combination of EC and sampling from a NT model. We also note that the observed ‘plateau’ of DBD in more diverse biomes (shown in Figure 3) level is not observed under the neutral Model 2. Therefore, this DBD plateau cannot be easily explained by NT.</p><p>To summarize, we are able to rule out NT’s parsimonious predictions in the sense that they are unlikely to give rise to the positive DBD slopes observed. However, it is hard to tell whether negative slopes in the EMP data arise from NT, EC, or a mixture of the two. This is in line with previous studies that have found distinguishing competition and neutrality based on metacommunity data to be non-trivial. Further work and more sophisticated models will be needed to tease these apart.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Following from the NT discussion, there is likely an important role for extinction in shaping these patterns. The discussion of hypotheses focused on the production of diversity and not the net balance of production and loss. This omission is a major weakness of the paper; some discussion of the role of extinction in these patterns would strengthen the interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>In the absence of a substantial fossil record, it is very difficult to accurately deconvolute speciation and extinction rates from phylogenies and instead we must rely on the net diversification rate (speciation minus extinction) (Louca and Pennell, 2020; Marshall, 2017). Nevertheless, Louca et al. recently estimated that bacterial diversity has mostly increased over the past billion years, with speciation rates slightly exceeding extinction rates (Louca et al., 2018). (We note that this is generally consistent with the widespread action of DBD, and less consistent with widespread EC). Thus, although bacterial lineages do go extinct, the precise rates of extinction and speciation are not straightforward to infer from phylogenies, and we do not attempt this here. More importantly, we do not think that speciation and extinction dynamics are at play at the scale of 16S rRNA gene sequencing in the EMP dataset. Although molecular clocks vary across bacterial lineages, the 16S gene typically evolves at a substitution rate of &lt;0.1% per million years, equivalent to 1-2 substitutions (Kuo and Ochman, 2009b). Therefore, even at the resolution of ASVs, we do not expect new ASVs to evolve within EMP samples (and this is even more true for higher taxa like genera or phyla). We thus consider most of our observations to be consistent with an ‘ecological community assembly’ rather than ‘evolutionary diversification’ model of DBD. These points have now been added to the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The analysis of the relationship between genome size and DBD in the context of the Black Queen Hypothesis is not convincing. As the authors acknowledge, there are serious limitations with assuming that the genome size from one strain/species within a genus can fully represent the genome size of that genus.

Generally genome size correlates to repeats rather than additional metabolite clusters. You could use the available genomes to annotate genome clusters (using e.g. antiSMASH).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this analysis was speculative and it has now been clearly flagged as​ such and moved to the Discussion. Although this is a preliminary analysis, the effects of biotic interactions on genome size evolution (including the Black Queen Hypothesis) is a subject of growing interest, and we believe our analysis will spur discussion and further study. The Black Queen Hypothesis is now only briefly mentioned in the Discussion. We plan to follow up on these genome size analyses using higher-resolution genomic or metagenomic data, and hopefully publish these as a Research Advance as suggested above by the editor (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). In the meantime, we attempt to clarify and justify the exploratory genome size analyses as much as possible.</p><p>First, we justify the choice of using the largest genome size in a genus as in the Materials and methods section as follows: “If multiple genomes were available with the same level of completion, the largest genome size was used, as smaller genomes could be artefacts of incomplete assembly which would bias the mean and median downward. Moreover, given the deletional bias in bacterial genomes (Kuo and Ochman, 2009a), the largest genome is likely more reflective of the ancestral genome size of the genus.”</p><p>Second, we further explain why having more precise genome size data would make the positive relationship stronger, in the Discussion as follows: “The positive relationship between genome size and DBD is likely even stronger than estimated, because assigning genome sizes to entire genera is imprecise (i.e. there is variation in genome size within a genus, or even within species), therefore weakening the correlation.”</p><p>In essence, we argue that we see a DBD-genome size relationship <italic>in spite of</italic> a noisy estimate of genome size. If the relationship is real, having less noisy estimates would improve the correlation.</p><p>Finally, given that estimating genome size at the genus level based on 16S taxonomic information is already noisy, we refrain from running additional analyses (e.g. antiSMASH) based on this dataset, and prefer to follow up on more appropriate genomic datasets. Nevertheless, we believe it is a reasonable assumption that the number of gene families (and thus metabolic potential, in a general sense) scale with genome size in bacteria. In bacteria and archaea, there is a linear (log-log) correlation between genome size and the number of protein-coding genes, and the linear relationship reaches a plateau in eukaryotes</p><p>(https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Genome_size_vs_protein_count.svg). This is likely because larger eukaryotic genomes contain more repeats, transposons, and viral sequences, but this is not the case for bacteria, as shown for example in a study of soil bacteria in which genome size is correlated with the number of coding genes, including secondary metabolic pathways (Barberán et al., 2014). We also note that the range of bacterial genome size variation (1-15 Mbp) that we find affect diversity slope (in our Figure 5) is too great to be explained simply by repeat sequences, and must be largely driven by coding sequences. Therefore, the literature clearly supports a scaling of bacterial genome size with protein coding genes, and likely with metabolic potential. Nevertheless, the relevance of this to DBD remains speculative and deserves further study, as clearly stated in our revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) One of the major findings is the evidence for DBD being strongest in less diverse biomes and weaker in more diverse biomes. However, some of these biomes also suggest a correlation with total microbial load. For example, the animal distal gut is a less diverse biome but an extremely densely populated biome, whereas the soil biome is exceptionally diverse but has a lower total microbial density than the distal animal gut. Do the authors have access to any data about the population density in these different biomes? Does population density also correlate with the DBD-EC continuum? If the authors do not think that total microbial load factors into the DBD-EC continuum, they should provide an explicit rationale why not. Note that we do not expect that microbial population size data are available for the entire data set, but perhaps there is a subset for which this is available and that could be analysed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this excellent point. As the reviewers suspected,​ we do not have comprehensive estimates of microbial population sizes (cell counts) for the entire dataset, but a subset allows us to make some informed speculation. Indeed, the animal distal gut has a density ~10<sup>11</sup> cells/mm3<sup>3</sup> and has relatively low diversity while soil is more diverse but less dense (~107 -109 cells/mm ). However, cell density does not appear to correlate with the DBD-EC continuum, as is now illustrated in the updated Figure 3. For example, saline water has an intermediate level of diversity compared to the distal gut or soil, but has lower cell density than either of these biomes (~10<sup>6</sup> cells/mm<sup>3</sup> ). Non-saline water has a similar density, but tends to have higher diversity than saline water. Of course, these are rough estimates and a more systematic study could allow a more refined analysis, but we tentatively conclude that differential cell density across biomes is unlikely to explain variation along the DBD-EC continuum. We suspect this is because even relatively low-density microbiomes yield sufficient numbers of 16S amplicons for analysis. These findings are now reported in the Results describing Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For model validation for GLMMs, it would be useful if the authors could report goodness of fit for all their models (differences between the observed values and the model's predicted) using the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Further, using cross validation (dividing data to train and test) might be useful to estimate the error rate of the models and could be used to confirm the accuracy of the models.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have calculated AIC for full GLMM models, and compared these​ to models without any fixed effects save the intercept. The delta-AIC values for these comparisons, as well as likelihood-ratio test <italic>p</italic>-values are now reported in the new Supplementary file 1. As an additional measure of goodness of fit, we also report both marginal (including only fixed effects) and conditional (including both fixed and random effects) coefficients of variation (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic>) in Supplementary file 1. In general, the conditional <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> values are higher, suggesting the importance of random effects. This is now mentioned briefly in the first Results paragraph, and explained in detail in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional major comments:</p><p>6) The measures for diversity vary over the paper and it is not always clear when which measurement is used, which makes it difficult to compare the analyses. Where the measures differ, this should be justified.</p><p>For example, this is clear in Figures 1, 4 and 5, but not in Figure 2. Similarly, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, which show the number of focal taxa as a function of the number of non-focal taxa, but in Figure 3 the diversity slope was estimated from a GLMM using taxonomic ratio for the community diversity, without mentioning what diversity measure was used for focal lineage. More generally, are taxonomic ratios a good measures of lineage diversity? Please explain why you used these measures of diversity instead of others. You mention that you also tried others such as Shannon index that are also robust but did not follow up on this.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion, and we have now clarified the metrics of focal lineage diversity and community diversity used throughout the manuscript. Briefly, focal lineage diversity is always measured as a taxonomic ratio in all the main text figures, and the axis labels have now been adjusted to clarify this. The only alternative metric of focal lineage diversity is when we use percent nucleotide identity instead of taxonomic ratios, as in Figure 2—figure supplements 10 and 11. In the main text figures, community diversity is always measured as the number of non-focal taxa. The only exception is a sensitivity analysis, in which we show that using Shannon diversity as an alternative metric of community diversity (Table 3) gives qualitatively similar results as using the number of non-focal taxa as in other analyses (summarized in Table 1). We have made clarifications throughout the manuscript, notably in the Figure 2 legend to specify that these are taxonomic ratios as in Figure 1.</p><p>We chose to focus the primary analyses on taxonomic ratios because they are simple, interpretable (i.e. they allow linking the results to well-studied organisms, e.g<italic>. Pseudomonas</italic>), and have a long history in the ecological literature dating back to Elton. We view the taxonomy-independent analyses (using percent nucleotide identity in the 16S rRNA gene) as supportive of the primary results based on taxonomic ratios, showing that these primary results are not overly biased by taxonomy. Similarly, we use Shannon diversity as an alternative measure of community diversity (which is otherwise measured simply as richness, or the number of non-focal taxa) to show that major findings are not sensitive to the choice of metric. We consider these controls using alternative diversity metrics to be sufficient for our broad-scale analyses, and leave it for future investigations to investigate details of why different metrics might differ slightly, tracking different aspects of the EC-DBD continuum. For the time being, we hope it is now clear which measures were used for which analyses in our manuscript, and for what reason.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the very beginning of the Results, the authors note that a null model was used to assess the slopes from their GLMMs (subsection “Quantifying the DBD-EC continuum in prokaryote communities”), but details are provided only later in the Materials and methods. We think the paper would be very much improved if the authors spent a paragraph explaining the null model early in the Results section and if a data figure (or figures) from the null model were moved to the main body of the text from the supplementary information. This would help the reader understand how support for significance of the slopes was determined as they move through the rest of the paper. More importantly, the paper would have greater readability and impact for a broader audience if the authors explained the development and rationale of their null model in very simple terms.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree, and a description of the null models (now explicitly linked to Neutral Theory, as described in the response to Essential Revision #1 above) now appears prominently in the first two Results paragraphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The term ASV is used throughout, but the downloaded databases contain mainly OTUs. This of course could affect the outcome of an analyses depending if OTUs and ASVs are mixed or either OTUs or ASVs are used. Please explain in more detail what was used and how it was calculated.</p></disp-quote><p>We aimed to make all our analyses as standardized and comparable as possible,​ we used ASVs throughout – for both EMP and global soil datasets. To make the soil dataset comparable to the EMP, we downloaded the raw sequencing data and called ASVs using deblur, using the same pipeline as for the EMP. This is now clarified in the Results paragraph introducing the soil dataset analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) A major limitation that is not acknowledged is a sole focus on prokaryotic taxa. Many of the ecosystems sampled in the EMP dataset have diverse and abundant fungi, protists, and other types of microbes. It is likely that these other microbial taxa interact with the target bacteria studied in this work in diverse ways (as numerous previous studies have shown). The authors should acknowledge this major limitation and explore briefly how it may impact their findings in the Discussion of the text. For example, fungi may play disproportionate roles in some environments that explain some of the variation observed here (e.g. the rhizosphere).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion, and fully agree. We now mention in the Discussion how interactions involving non-prokaryotes such as phages and eukaryotes could explain some of the variation along the DBD-EC continuum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Subsection “Abiotic drivers of diversity”, last two paragraphs: These two paragraphs contain two analyses that essentially contradict each other. These varying results are interesting – could you please expand a little more on why these two analyses might be showing different results? In particular, the last sentence suggests that diversity levels in soil and other communities with a DBD plateau are predominantly controlled by abiotic factors. However, this is the first mention of those specific biomes in this paragraph. Could you add a little more about this observation?</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the end of this paragraph to further reconcile the apparent contradiction between EMP and soil datasets. The result that DBD is weak and abiotic drivers of diversity are strong in soil can be reconciled with the finding of generally stronger DBD in the overall EMP dataset. We showed that soil has a relatively low diversity slope, even without considering abiotic factors (Figure 3). It is therefore not surprising to estimate a low diversity slope when abiotic factors are added to the model. This is now explained on in the subsection “Abiotic drivers of diversity”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
