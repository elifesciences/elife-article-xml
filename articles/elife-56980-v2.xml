prominent RNA modification in mammals. Here, we study mouse skin embryogenesis to tackle m6A’s functions and physiological importance. We first landscape the m6A modifications on skin epithelial progenitor mRNAs. Contrasting with in vivo ribosomal profiling, we unearth a correlation between m6A modification in coding sequences and enhanced translation, particularly of key morphogenetic signaling pathways. Tapping physiological relevance, we show that m6A loss profoundly alters these cues and perturbs cellular fate choices and tissue architecture in all skin lineages. By single-cell transcriptomics and bioinformatics, both signaling and canonical translation pathways show significant downregulation after m6A loss. Interestingly, however, many highly m6A-modified mRNAs are markedly upregulated upon m6A loss, and they encode RNA-methylation, RNA-processing and RNA-metabolism factors. Together, our findings suggest that m6A functions to enhance translation of key morphogenetic regulators, while also destabilizing sentinel mRNAs that are primed to activate rescue pathways when m6A levels drop.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>N6-methyladenosine</kwd><kwd>skin epithelial morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>lineage specification</kwd><kwd>miCLIP</kwd><kwd>RNA metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AR27883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuchs</surname><given-names>Elaine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-CA186702</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaffrey</surname><given-names>Samie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21-CA224391</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaffrey</surname><given-names>Samie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-2263-16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xi</surname><given-names>Linghe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>HHMI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuchs</surname><given-names>Elaine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>METTL3-mediated m6A modification maintains proper cell lineage specification during skin epithelium morphogenesis by coupling transcription and translation of key regulatory pathways.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sophisticated gene expression regulatory machineries are necessary to achieve proper fate choices during mammalian embryogenesis. While transcriptional regulation has been studied in great depth, much less is known about how post-transcriptional regulation comes into play in tissue formation. Being an important element of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, chemical modifications on RNAs have been demonstrated to affect a wide range of RNA bio-activities. Among the over 100 types of RNA modifications identified thus far, m6A is the most abundant modification on mRNAs. Previous studies have identified m6A methyltransferases (writers), m6A demethylases (erasers) and also factors that recognize m6A-modified RNAs (readers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alarcón et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bokar et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Patil et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>miCLIP and ribosomal profiling analyses of the mouse skin epithelial progenitors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting the major factors involved in regulating the cellular dynamics of m6A modification.

The empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) plots compare the relative mRNA translation efficiency of the top 20% and bottom 20% of m6A-modified mRNAs. The data reveal that transcripts with higher levels of m6A modification (assessed by the sum of normalized-to-input uTPM value of m6A along the full-length transcript) tend to have higher levels of translation efficiency. The correlation between translation efficiency and the sum of normalized-to-input uTPM value of m6A at different regions of the mRNAs (5’ UTR, coding sequence, 3’ UTR) shows that the coding sequence m6A gives the best correlation to translation efficiency.

In recent years, models have been made to conditionally disrupt specific m6A writers, erasers or readers in mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Geula et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ivanova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Xu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yoon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). While uniformly underscoring the physiological importance of m6A, these studies have also unveiled a profound complexity in m6A’s biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Du et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kennedy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zaccara and Jaffrey, 2020</xref>). Thus in some cell types and contexts, m6A modification promotes differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Geula et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2019</xref>), while in others, it blocks differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vu et al., 2017</xref>). Sometimes, as in the case of <italic>Myc,</italic> such opposing effects can be observed in different cell types sharing a common m6A target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zou et al., 2019</xref>). In other cases, m6A targets can differ based upon cellular contexts and expression. Finally, m6A can exert context-dependent effects on distinct steps of RNA metabolism, compounding the unpredictability of whether a modification will impart to a given target increased or decreased expression.</p><p>The skin epithelium is an excellent model to begin to unravel the mechanisms underlying m6A’s influences on various morphogenetic processes. Embryonic skin epithelium begins as a single layer of multipotent epithelial progenitors, which will develop into three strikingly distinct tissues: epidermis, hair follicles (HFs) and sebaceous glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Launching tissue diversification is WNT signaling, which begins heterogeneously within the progenitor population.</p><p>WNTs play a critical role in specifying the HF fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gat et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">van Genderen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huelsken et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Within the basal epidermal plane, WNT<sup>hi</sup> embryonic progenitors cluster into hair placodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahtiainen et al., 2016</xref>), which emerge in three waves beginning at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) and develop into fully mature HFs by birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duverger and Morasso, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The first divisions in WNT<sup>hi</sup> placode cells are asymmetric, generating WNT<sup>lo</sup> daughters that will give rise to hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and outer root sheath, and WNT<sup>hi</sup> daughters that will generate the inner root sheath and hair shaft of the follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ouspenskaia et al., 2016</xref>). Near birth, oil-rich sebaceous glands spawn from the upper portion of each HF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Sebaceous gland development is favored over HFs in mice whose skin expresses ΔNLEF1, a dominant-negative disrupter of WNT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Merrill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Niemann et al., 2003</xref>), indicating that WNT levels play an important role in balancing these fate choices.</p><p>Lower levels of WNT signaling also favor epidermal over HF fates, as in the developing plane of embryonic progenitors, those with lower levels of WNT signaling become fated to become epidermal progenitors, which fuel the production of upward columns of terminally differentiated cells that form the skin’s barrier that excludes pathogens and retains body fluids. This differentiation program is regulated by NOTCH signaling and MYC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blanpain et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frye et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gandarillas and Watt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moriyama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rangarajan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Watt et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Watt et al., 2008b</xref>).</p><p>While the levels of external signals and their downstream transcriptional effectors function critically in these epithelial fate choices within the skin, post-transcriptional regulation, such as translational control, has received more emphasis on balancing proper homeostasis once the tissue fate has been selected. Similar to the hematopoietic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buszczak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Signer et al., 2014</xref>), skin progenitors maintain reduced levels of protein synthesis relative to their differentiating progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blanco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liakath-Ali et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sendoel et al., 2017</xref>). In differentiating skin cells, 5-methylcytosine (m5C) is enhanced, which protects tRNAs from cleavage and facilitates protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blanco et al., 2011</xref>). Under conditions of stress in the epidermis, EIF2α is phosphorylated, dampening protein translation, while a less efficient, more promiscuous initiator, EIF2A, translates key proteins that allow progenitor survival in a harsher environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sendoel et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, however, when translational control is compromised in the skin, epidermal, HF and sebaceous gland stem cell compartments respond differently, with epidermal cells implementing a feedback mechanism to increase global translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liakath-Ali et al., 2018</xref>). While context again surfaces as being key in triggering these varied responses, their purpose appears to be rooted in restoring homeostasis to the tissue.</p><p>How signaling, transcriptional regulation and cellular fate choices are linked to translational control and tissue homeostasis has remained elusive. Here, we show that m6A modifications of mRNAs may be involved in this connection. We began by mapping m6A at single-nucleotide resolution in skin epithelia. Exploiting our prior in vivo epidermal ribosomal profiling data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sendoel et al., 2017</xref>), we then interrogated how m6A correlates with overall translational efficiency. Probing the physiological relevance of our findings, we employed genetics to conditionally ablate the deposition of m6A on RNAs. After analyzing the striking and differential consequences of m6A loss to the fates of the skin epithelial progenitors in vivo, we turned to single-cell RNA sequencing and functional studies to gain insights into the major cellular activities that are targeted by this regulatory machinery, and the significance of m6A to these three diverse programs of epithelial morphogenesis in the skin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Skin transcripts most highly modified by m6A are involved in HF morphogenesis</title><p>To assess the location and extent of m6A modification on the mRNAs expressed in mouse epidermal cells under physiological conditions, we performed m6A individual-nucleotide-resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (miCLIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grozhik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Linder et al., 2015</xref>) on poly(A)+ RNAs directly isolated from basal skin progenitors in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Sequencing libraries were then constructed from the m6A-immunoprecipitated mRNAs as well as the corresponding input RNA samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Based upon the crosslinking-induced mutations detected in the miCLIP libraries, 11,420 transcripts displayed a total of 157,641 sites that were modified by m6A and typified by a ‘DRACH’ motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Linder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The data were highly reproducible across three independent replicates, and as previously noted, m6A density was highest around mRNA stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To quantify the extent of m6A modification at each site, we calculated the unique tag counts per million (uTPM) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Patil et al., 2016</xref> around each site in the miCLIP data. We then normalized to the uTPM around the same site in the corresponding input data. This normalized-to-input uTPM value was also highly consistent across biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Exploiting our prior in vivo ribosome profiling data of mouse skin epidermal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sendoel et al., 2017</xref>), we next examined in an unbiased fashion whether the degree of m6A modification of an mRNA correlated with its translational efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, schematic). For every m6A-modified mRNA, we calculated the sum of normalized-to-input uTPM at each m6A site identified on full-length, 5’ UTR, coding sequence, and 3’ UTR. For each, we then compared the translational efficiencies of the top 20% most highly and bottom 20% least m6A-modified mRNAs from each way of calculation. Intriguingly, mRNAs with high levels of m6A modification tended to be more highly translated than those with low modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This correlation was most striking when we focused on m6A modifications in the coding sequence.</p><p>We then ranked the m6A-modified mRNAs according to the sum of normalized-to-input uTPM at each m6A site within the coding sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) upon that value featured ‘basal cell carcinoma’, dominated by WNT and SHH signaling factors, and ‘NOTCH signaling’ among the top three categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Interestingly, these top three categories tended to be more efficiently translated than other pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Overall, these findings pointed to a potential importance of m6A modifications specifically within the coding sequence in promoting translation of an mRNA.</p><p>We then performed GSEA to interrogate the KEGG pathways enriched with the top 20% most highly modified and highly translated mRNAs. We focused on pathways with p values &lt;0.05 and &gt;5 enriched mRNAs/category. Although we do not discount the potential importance of any individual mRNA, it was easier to predict this potential for mRNAs with high coding sequence m6A levels, high translation and residing within larger enrichment categories.</p><p>The top categories sharing these criteria were signaling pathways including ECM-receptor interactions, basal cell carcinoma (dominated by mRNAs encoding WNT and SHH signaling factors) and NOTCH signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These pathways play essential roles in HF morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Notably, WNT signaling, which prompts basal progenitors to organize into hair placodes, precedes SHH signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Woo et al., 2012</xref>), and WNT signaling is required to maintain SHH pathway-driven basal cell carcinomas in mice and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sánchez-Danés et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Given the large number of mRNAs that were modified by m6A, we did not expect nor did we see a single category with an extraordinarily high enrichment score. However, the fact that the WNT and SHH pathways surfaced in multiple top enrichment categories was promising and suggested that m6A might function in promoting the HF fate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Conditional ablation of <italic>Mettl3</italic> in epidermal progenitors results in a marked defect in HF morphogenesis</title><p>The METTL3-METTL14 writer complex is responsible for adding the vast majority of m6A onto RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

At P0, LEF1 levels remained low in the WNT<sup>hi</sup> cells.

PCAD is often associated with cells that undergo migration and invasion, while ECAD is typically associated with more static intercellular contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kümper and Ridley, 2010</xref>). Thus, the reduction in PCAD:ECAD ratio, along with the diminished actin regulators, were further consistent with enhanced departure of <italic>Mettl3</italic> null cells from the basal layer, where cells have traction.</p><p>The spindle orientations of <italic>Mettl3</italic> null cell divisions were largely unaltered and remained within the plane of the basal layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). However, at P0, a 45 min pulse with EdU revealed signs of elevated proliferation in the cKO basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This was surprising as pups did not grow in size appreciably post-birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). As we show below, this could also not be accounted for by an appreciable rise in apoptosis. Rather, we attribute this change to reflect replacements due to the increased departure of basal cells into the suprabasal layers. This was accompanied by a marked increase in cellularity, particularly within the spinous layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Suprabasal cells were also smaller than normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The increase of cell number and decrease of cell size in the suprabasal layers was also confirmed by FACS quantifications, in which we found the numbers of K10<sup>+</sup> cells were greater, with somewhat lower values on the forward scatter projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>Although the four stages of terminal differentiation in <italic>Mettl3</italic> cKO epidermis were still recognizable by morphology and by molecular markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>), perturbations reverberated into the later stages of differentiation. In normal skin, when spinous cells transition to the granular layer, they initially remain transcriptionally active, but then a destructive phase ensues as they lose nuclei and other organelles and flatten to become dead ‘squames’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Quiroz et al., 2020</xref>). This is normally accompanied by DNA destruction, detected by TUNEL staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Mettl3</italic> cKO epidermis displayed an appreciable number of nuclei in their granular layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) and showed little or no signs of TUNEL positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, although desmosomes and hemidesmosomes were still present, small gaps were often noted ultrastructurally at intercellular borders in the <italic>Mettl3</italic> cKO epidermis (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, middle frame). We also observed occasional signs of spinous cell cytolysis, which was also reflected in the increased incidence of early suprabasal cells positive for TUNEL but negative for activated Caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F</xref>).

The categories of mRNAs enriched upon METTL3 loss and highly m6A-modified in wild-type conditions raised the possibility that the upregulated mRNAs might represent a global response to m6A loss.</p><p>Interestingly, CAP-independent translation was among the upregulated GO terms, consistent with the reduced mRNA levels that we had detected for canonical initiation. RNA methylation was also among the GO terms. Additionally, of note, mRNAs encoding all three of the major m6A reader proteins—<italic>Ythdf1, Ythdf2</italic> and <italic>Ythdf3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2014a</xref>)<italic>—</italic>were not only heavily m6A-modified in their coding sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), but also significantly upregulated upon m6A loss (Z-scores ranging from 3.8 to 16) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These findings were suggestive of a possible feedback mechanism to sense m6A paucity and compensate. The upregulation of Pelota (<italic>Pelo</italic>) was also intriguing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

Our current study uncovered several new insights into m6A’s actions and made headway in tying together and advancing our knowledge of certain recurrent themes that have emerged from prior in vivo and in vitro studies. As importantly, our findings place m6A as a key integrator of stem cell fate choices and translational control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>In gaining new insights, we were aided by having previously performed in vivo ribosomal profiling on embryonic murine skin epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sendoel et al., 2017</xref>). By performing high-resolution miCLIP on this tissue, we were uniquely poised to tease out, on a global in vivo scale, a prominent correlation between the degree of m6A modifications that an mRNA has within its coding sequence and its translation efficiency. This correlation was particularly pronounced in mRNAs encoding signaling pathways known to affect skin progenitor fates. Moreover, by performing scRNA-seq on control and <italic>Mettl3</italic> cKO skin progenitors, we were further able to appreciate that many of the most significantly downregulated mRNAs upon m6A loss were associated with these same pathways.</p><p>The most striking phenotypic defects surfacing upon m6A loss were in HF morphogenesis, where both specification and down growth were markedly curtailed. These processes require WNT signaling, and mRNAs encoding a number of WNT regulators were significantly downregulated. Moreover, WNT-effectors nuclear LEF1 and β-catenin, were both diminished at the sites where WNT signaling is known to be essential. Further signs that WNT signaling was deleteriously affected included the promotion of sebaceous gland fate characteristics at the expense of HF fate ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Merrill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Niemann et al., 2003</xref>), the perturbations in SHH signaling and also the difficulty that <italic>Mettl3</italic> null HFs seemed to face in engulfing the DP.</p><p>Recent studies on other cell types and cancers have also reported connections between WNT signaling and m6A levels ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cui et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). In some of these cases, m6A loss resulted in an elevation of WNT signaling, while in others, it was diminished, and a variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain these seemingly context-dependent effects. Our findings show that not only are WNT pathway mRNAs among the most heavily m6A-modified and efficiently translated, but they are also among the most significantly downregulated early after m6A loss. When coupled with the physiological consequences to skin development, our findings place the impact of m6A alterations at the helm of this pathway.</p><p>For the skin, the link between WNT signaling and m6A was particularly intriguing because it offered a hitherto elusive connection between mRNA regulation and cellular fate choices. Additionally, given that overall levels of WNT signaling can profoundly impact fate specification, our studies reveal how even subtle changes in this pathway can have a profound impact on fate outcomes. That said, despite the importance of WNT signaling in skin progenitor fate specification and the consistency of the METTL3 loss of function phenotype with a decrease in this pathway, m6A modifications in the skin epithelium went well beyond this pathway. Indeed, our comprehensive analyses of the <italic>Mettl3</italic> cKO phenotype in the skin provided graphic appreciation that m6A RNA modifications function broadly and diversely in regulating cellular responses.</p><p>In addition to WNT signaling, the pathways affected when highly m6A-modified and efficiently translated mRNAs experienced depletion of m6A encompassed actin regulators, cell polarity, ECM-receptor interaction and NOTCH signaling. A number of cellular changes and phenotypic correlations were consistent with these differences. Thus for example, the perturbations we found in apical cytoskeletal polarity seem likely to contribute to the decreased ability of HF cells to engulf the DP. Additionally, the decrease in HES1 in early spinous cells was reflective of diminished NOTCH signaling and consistent with mRNA downregulation of NOTCH ligand JAG2 and NOTCH co-activator Mastermind like 2. And although we did not observe overt morphological differences in hemidesmosomes, the heightened departure of progenitors from the basal layer and their inability to form colonies in vitro were in agreement with possible defects in <italic>Mettl3</italic> null basal progenitor:ECM adhesion.</p><p>The high number of mRNAs upregulated significantly upon METTL3 loss were equally informative but in a strikingly different way. Although many of these transcripts were among the most highly m6A-modified in the wild-type state, their GO terms were not among the top m6A-modified mRNAs that were efficiently translated. On the contrary, the marked increase in their mRNA levels upon m6A ablation was suggestive that this mark normally functions to destabilize this cohort.</p><p>In contemplating the physiological relevance of the upregulated mRNAs in <italic>Mettl3</italic> cKO embryos, we were drawn to several curious possibilities. First, it was both intriguing and paradoxical to find that that <italic>Myc</italic> and <italic>Bmyc</italic> were upregulated upon m6A loss. In cancer cells, MYC has been implicated as a key positive regulator of CAP-dependent mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cargnello and Topisirovic, 2019</xref>), a process that was predicted to be downregulated upon <italic>Mettl3</italic> ablation in embryonc skin. That said, MYC overexpression has also been shown to promote differentiation in the epidermis and sebaceous glands at the expense of HF morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arnold and Watt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cottle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Watt et al., 2008b</xref>), phenocopying some of the key features we observed upon m6A loss.</p><p>Notably, upregulation of RNA processing factors has been observed in the skin progenitors of both MYC-overexpressing skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arnold and Watt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frye et al., 2003</xref>), and <italic>Mettl3</italic> cKO skin. As global rates in RNA metabolism can profoundly affect stem cells' activities as well as how they respond to stressful environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blanco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sampath et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sendoel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Signer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Starck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zismanov et al., 2016</xref>), it seems likely that the block in the degradation of this selected cohort of RNAs might impact the translation of the signaling pathways that orchestrate lineage specification.</p><p>A second major curiosity was that by miCLIP, <italic>Ythdf1, Ythdf2</italic> and <italic>Ythdf3</italic> fell within the top 20% of mRNAs whose coding sequence in basal skin progenitors was highly modified, and in <italic>Mettl3</italic> null basal progenitors, these mRNAs were among the most significantly increased in levels. YTHDF1-3 function as m6A readers. While YTHDF1 and 3 have been proposed to increase the stability and translation of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), recent studies suggest that all three may function in localizing m6A-modified mRNAs to the decay machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zaccara and Jaffrey, 2020</xref>). Irrespective of their precise reader roles, their collective m6A modification in control progenitors and upregulation upon m6A loss is suggestive of a key rescue juncture for the cell.</p><p>Indeed many of the other upregulated pathways were also suggestive of potential feedback mechanisms, activated upon m6A loss. Among them were CAP-independent translation genes, RNA methylation genes, RNA processing pathways and ribosome-associated mRNA quality control genes. When coupled with the downregulation in mRNAs that are normally m6A-modified and highly translated, and with the reduction in canonical translation transcripts, these upregulated mRNA perturbations pointed not only to further signs of an altered protein translation state, but also to a potential built-in mechanism to boost alternative translational routes and RNA metabolism lost upon <italic>Mettl3</italic> ablation. Thus by having a cohort of key regulatory mRNAs that are heavily modified by m6A, progenitors are able to sense when the modification is lost and respond by rapidly enhancing their mRNA pool and calling into action rapid responses and rescue pathways to control the damage involved.</p><p>A model based on our findings and summarizing this speculation is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>. Future studies will be needed to probe the significance of m6A modifications of individual mRNAs and to unearth the mechanisms underlying why some m6A-modified mRNAs were downregulated upon m6A loss while others were upregulated. It will also take further investigation to sift through the myriad of mRNAs and pathways that were affected both negatively and positively by m6A loss, and which exposed an underlying complexity in m6A's roles in translational regulation. The problem becomes even more daunting when considering that we have not yet examined the consequences of METTL3 loss to miRNAs in the skin. In this regard, in a breast cancer cell line, METTL3 was found to mark pri-miRNAs for recognition and processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alarcón et al., 2015</xref>), and in skin, METTL3 depletion shares certain similarities with global loss of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yi and Fuchs, 2011</xref>).</p><p>While many areas remain to be explored, our results show that the two arms of the pathways for down- and up-regulated mRNAs are intricately interwoven. In this regard, our many findings reported here shed new light on the previously identified roles of m6A in translational regulation. Finally, and intriguingly, the circuitry funneled to progenitor fate choices, each of which uses a distinct repertoire of signaling pathways and has distinct needs for protein synthesis. Our studies on m6A through the lens of skin morphogenesis now place m6A on the center stage of this arena.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>The <italic>Mettl3<sup>fl</sup></italic> mouse strain was a gift from the Brüning Lab at Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research and Policlinic for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Preventive Medicine.

Your article has been reviewed by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Rui Yi (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Xi et al., studied m6A RNA modification and its role in embryonic skin development. They first profiled m6A modification in epithelial progenitors and investigated the correlation between m6A modification and translation efficiency as well as mRNA stability. By conditionally deleting <italic>Mettl3</italic>, a critical writer for m6A, in epithelial cells during skin development, they examined the physiological impact of <italic>Mettl3</italic>/m6A modification and observed compromised hair follicle morphogenesis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The correlation between m6A and translation efficiency (TE) seems weak, and the way they show this in Figure 1E is confusing. In the Materials and methods section, I couldn't find the definition of &quot;Relative TE&quot; and the cut-off for &quot;high&quot;, &quot;med&quot; and &quot;low&quot; m6A modification. As it's shown in Figure 1E, ~50% of &quot;high&quot; m6A mRNA have relative TE greater than 0 and ~50% less than 0. This doesn't support &quot;high&quot; m6A enhances TE. Even in the CDS panel, &quot;med&quot; and &quot;low&quot; m6A transcripts show only very mild reduction of overall TE. They should fully define the parameters used in this analysis; use non-modified transcripts as control; calculate the statistical significance of each comparison e.g. &quot;high&quot; vs &quot;med&quot;, &quot;med&quot; vs &quot;low&quot; and all against non-modified transcripts. To truly support the claim that m6A enhances TE, they should perform ribosome profiling in WT and mettl3 ko epithelial cells and calculate the differential TE. And for a few examples, they should quantify protein levels by Western blotting and/or staining to support the increased TE indeed leads to a higher concentration of protein or the reduced protein levels in cKO.</p><p>2) They relied heavily on gene ontology analysis to identify pathways that are preferentially affected by m6A. However, this analysis is confusing. They stated they &quot;ranked the mRNAs carrying the modification according to the sum of normalized-to-input uTPM at each m6A site within the coding sequence, and divided by CDS length&quot; (subsection “Skin transcripts most highly modified by m6A are involved in hair follicle 129 morphogenesis”). However, I'm not sure if they used the ranking system at all when they searched for enriched KEGG pathways. It seems that they simply identified pathways with most transcripts with m6A but not necessarily highly modified. They need to show (1) which pathways the most highly m6A modified mRNAs are enriched in? (2) whether the top enriched pathways contain many highly m6A modified mRNAs? In addition, they should apply their TE analysis to these enriched pathways. Can they find reduced TE in these highly modified mRNAs that belong to the top KEGG pathways such as BCC and hedgehog signaling?</p><p>3) The phenotypical analysis should be strengthened by more careful analysis of cell proliferation such as colony formation in addition to EdU and Ki67 staining and cell adhesion analysis. The demonstrated phenotypes also seem similar to Dicer1 KO, when all miRNAs are depleted, including neonatal lethality due to the lack of weight gain, degenerated hair follicles and diminished filiform papillae formation.</p><p>4) They mentioned that WNT and SHH pathways surfaced in multiple pathways in their miCLIP data and suggested that m6A might function in hair follicle fate through these pathways. However, the authors did not show how these pathways behaved in WT vs cKO mice. Such analysis will strengthen their claims. Aberrant LEF and SHH signaling was associated with failure to form tight dermal condensates. With this data, they concluded that WNT signaling has been altered by m6A modification. However, there were not mechanistic studies to prove that WNT has been altered. The authors can do qPCR analysis of transcripts that are under WNT regulation to further show altered WNT signaling (e.g. axin) or IHC imaging of β-catenin etc. to future strengthen their conclusion.</p><p>5) They performed single-cell RNA-seq to measure the changed transcriptome and cellular state. However, their cell clustering analysis should be performed by using control and cKO samples together, rather than clustering separately and relying on marker genes to identify each population in control and cKO (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D, F). Are all corresponding cell populations in control and cKO clustered together? If not, they should explore the underlying reasons. The pseudotime analysis in Figure 4B should be strengthened by statistical analysis rather than eyeballing the population/lineage differences between Ctrl and cKO. They also should keep in mind they only have 1 pair of biological samples, which may reduce the robustness of the analysis. For differential gene analysis, they should independently confirm each data (Figure 4C, Figure 5D etc.) by qPCR or bulk RNA-seq from more sample pairs.</p><p>6) Based on ribosome profiling analysis, they suggest that m6A enhances translation. Based on RNA-seq, they suggest that m6A reduces mRNA stability. Globally, these are two opposite effects on mRNA's potential to make protein. It's important to distinguish (1) whether these two opposite effects of m6A are on different mRNAs? (2) if the same mRNAs are under the control of both effects, what is the net effect on protein synthesis? Are they cancelled out or one effect is more dominant than the other? How does this explain/correlate with the phenotypes?</p><p>7) The observation of prematurely detached basal cells is interesting. Are they the direct consequence of reduced cell-cell adhesion and/or cell-bm adhesion?</p><p>8) The reviewers were not sure about the point of OPP experiments. OPP label may be too low resolution to show any changes in <italic>Mettl3</italic> cKO.</p><p>9) Figure 3E-F: it is clear that in the grafted skin <italic>Mettl3</italic> cKO HFs underwent HF degeneration in accompany with sebocyte differentiation. However, it is not clear if this fate switch only occurred in <italic>Mettl3</italic> cKO HFs upon wounding (grafting in this case). Oil red O staining with P6 ungrafted skin sections will partially address this question. If this fate switch only happens upon wounding, authors should discuss the effects of m6A loss in the differential circumstance as well as speculate the effect of wounding in m6A-mediated regulation.</p><p>10) Subsection “Conditional ablation of <italic>Mettl3</italic> in epidermal progenitors results in a marked defect in HF morphogenesis”: &quot;the engrafted cKO epidermis was hyperthickened, a feature which had also been evident in ungrafted cKO epidermis.&quot; To this reviewer, the hyperthicken epidermis could NOT be appreciated in ungrafted cKO epidermis based on the H&amp;E staining shown in Figure 2G. The quantification in the thickness of ungrafted and grafted epidermis will be essential. In line with point #2, this hyperthicken epidermis in grafted cKO skin might be caused by wounding if hyperthickness is not detected in ungrafted <italic>Mettl3</italic> cKO epidermis.</p><p>11) Figure 5E: Authors stated that MYC expression was elevated within <italic>Mettl3</italic> cKO epidermal progenitors (subsection “A cohort of highly m6A-decorated mRNAs whose levels rise upon removal of their modification”). It is not clear to this reviewer how the quantification of MYC expression was done. Which cell markers did authors use to define &quot;epidermal progenitors&quot; (e.g. integrin α6 or K14…)? Did authors also include P-cad+ WNY-hi, WNT-lo HF cells, and epidermal suprabasal cells? Please clarify this by adding information in the figure legend as well as Materials and methods.</p><p>12) Figure 3—figure supplement 1: It is interesting to see high levels of PCAD expression in the basal layer of grafted <italic>Mettl3</italic> cKO epidermis. Did authors also find this striking pattern in ungrafted <italic>Mettl3</italic> cKO epidermis (e.g. P6 ungrafted skin)? What could be the explanation of this significant upregulation of P-Cadherin in the <italic>Mettl3</italic> cKO epidermal basal cells, e.g. alteration in cell junction? Confusion in fate specification? It will be helpful if authors can check on ungrafted skin and speculate the possibilities.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56980.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The correlation between m6A and translation efficiency (TE) seems weak, and the way they show this in Figure 1E is confusing.

Specifically, we have now added a schematic in new Figure 1F to show how the ribosomal and miCLIP analyses were performed on a population of neonatal skin progenitors. In response to the excellent reviewer comment, we also reanalyzed the data, this time taking the miCLIP-measured top 20% and bottom 20% of m6A-modified mRNAs across (1) full-length mRNA, (2) 5’UTR mRNA, (3) coding sequence mRNA and (4) 3’UTR mRNA, and then analyzing them for their relative translational efficiency as measured by ribosomal profiling. All the words are now spelled out to make it easy for the reader to see.</p><p>We have also performed the appropriate statistical tests to evaluate shifts in translation efficiency for our newly defined m6A abundance bins. Visualization of the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of the translation efficiency of these top 20% and bottom 20% quintiles was used to illustrate the correlation of m6A modification level with translational efficiency. To evaluate the statistical significance of these m6A dependent shifts in translation efficiency we have performed Mann-Whitney tests between our successive quintiles. This new analysis confirms and extends our earlier observation that transcripts with high m6A modification levels are more efficiently translated. All these new analyses are currently demonstrated in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and described in detail in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To truly support the claim that m6A enhances TE, they should perform ribosome profiling in WT and mettl3 ko epithelial cells and calculate the differential TE.</p></disp-quote><p>We discussed this point in our initial response to the reviewers, and our response was accepted and approved by the editors/reviewers back in April. We actually had already tried, but technical hurdles beyond our control prevented us from performing ribosomal profiling on <italic>Mettl3</italic> KO epithelial cells either in vitro or in vivo. in vitro, the cells do not survive loss of <italic>Mettl3</italic>. Even when we culture the cells and then KO <italic>Mettl3</italic> in culture, the cells do not tolerate LOF. in vivo, the HF defects result in the placodes and germs fractionating with the dispase-treated dermis and not the epidermis at E17.5 and as development proceeds, the reduced HFs makes the fractionation unequal between KO and control. We now mention these issues in the text and provide the problems (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C) so that other readers will know.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And for a few examples, they should quantify protein levels by Western blotting and/or staining to support the increased TE indeed leads to a higher concentration of protein or the reduced protein levels in cKO.</p></disp-quote><p>The inability to obtain sufficient numbers of matched cKO and Control cells (see above) precluded us from not only ribosomal profiling but also immunoblotting. However, as suggested, we have been successful at immunostaining and now add LEF1, β-catenin and <italic>Gli1-lacZ</italic> for our WNT and SHH analyses, and we provide closeups to show that the HF-DP borders are affected in ways that are expected when WNT signaling is inhibited (Matos et al., 2020). The data are now shown in new Figure 3A-D. By focusing on the top 20% of modified genes that are efficiently translated, the new comparisons also unearthed NOTCH signaling genes as ones highly modified and efficiently translated. We add data on NOTCH but later in the manuscript (new Figure 6D), when we focus on the epidermis. Equally importantly, by examining how the 20% most heavily modified mRNAs fare in scRNA seq, we uncover hitherto unappreciated strong ties between the data in Figure 1 and the single-cell <italic>Mettl3</italic> LOF data (new Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) They relied heavily on gene ontology analysis to identify pathways that are preferentially affected by m6A.

We actually used the ranking system when we searched for enriched KEGG pathways, but we agree the way it was written and presented was confusing. We have now clarified this both in the figures and in the text. We expanded our description of the normalization used to emphasize that we have used this ranking of m6A modification over input for this analysis. We have added an analysis to demonstrate that KEGG pathways enriched for the highly modified transcripts tend to be more efficiently translated (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1G). We have also added a new analysis for functional enrichment for genes which are highly m6A modified (top 20%) and have a high translational efficiency (top 20%), as was suggested to in point (1) above. These KEGG pathways in Figure 1G now show the top 8 pathways that contain &gt;5 genes within a category and that surface when we analyze the top 20% of highly modified mRNAs that are also among the top 20% of highly translated mRNAs. As you can see, they are enriched for signaling pathways important for skin lineages, similar to before, but will now be much more convincing and interesting to readers. The statistical parameters suggest the extent of the enrichment. We also add new Figure 1H for readers who don’t necessarily know how these pathways pertain to skin development.</p><p>We also greatly thank the reviewers for asking how these pathways for highly methylated, highly translated mRNAs fare upon METTL3 loss. We’ve now separated the scRNA data into significantly down as well as significantly upregulated mRNAs. As shown in new Figure 6A,B, the top 20% of genes that are downregulated in our scRNA seq data include signaling pathway genes (including WNT, SHH and NOTCH), actin regulators and cellular adhesion genes and among these are mRNAs that are heavily modified by m6A. Of particular intrigue, we discovered that many canonical translational initiators are among the 20% most significantly downregulated mRNAs upon <italic>Mettl3</italic> LOF, offering a possible explanation as to why efficiently translated, heavily modified mRNAs tend to be downregulated (Figure 6B).</p><p>In our initial version, we did not include any information on the downregulated, heavily modified genes. These new analyses now beautifully tie together the data in Figure 1 with the scRNA seq data and the phenotypic data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The phenotypical analysis should be strengthened by more careful analysis of cell proliferation such as colony formation in addition to EdU and Ki67 staining and cell adhesion analysis. The demonstrated phenotypes also seem similar to Dicer1 KO, when all miRNAs are depleted, including neonatal lethality due to the lack of weight gain, degenerated hair follicles and diminished filiform papillae formation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises some excellent points. The cKO cells don’t survive in vitro cell culture, as alluded to above, but we now add the colony formation data (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). We now show the epidermal flux experiment as part of Figure 6 and with additional data in new Figure 6—figure supplement 2. As NOTCH signaling pathway surfaced among the top 20% of mRNAs modified and top 20% of mRNAs efficiently translated and among the top 20% most significantly downregulated upon METTL3 loss, we also confirm that HES1, the main NOTCH target, is downregulated in the differentiating epidermal cells (new Figure 6D). This is further interesting, as it is consistent with precocious outward flux as well as the increase in cellularity. We corroborate increased cellularity at the ultrastructural level (new Figure 6G). Finally, we show that apoptosis is not increased in the basal layer and thus, cannot account for why proliferation basally is up in the METTL3 LOF pups (new Figure 6—figure supplement 2F). Rather, the data are together, consistent with the increased flux. We did investigate cell adhesion. We see a decrease in P-cad:E-cad ratio, which correlates with a reduction in cell migration and increased departure from the basal layer (new Figure 6—figure supplement 2A). However, even though we saw downregulated <italic>Col17a1, Itgb4</italic> at the mRNA level, we saw hemidesmosomes (Figure 6G). We leave open in the text now the possibility that a decrease in attachment could contribute to enhanced flux.</p><p>It is intriguing that to some extent, the phenotype resembles that of mice, whose skin lacks miRNAs. In 2015, Alcaron et al., (2015) used a breast cancer cell line to show that METTL3 methylates pri-miRNAs, marking them for recognition and processing by DGCR8, and that METTL3 depletion results in the global reduction of mature miRNAs and concomitant accumulation of unprocessed pri-miRNAs. While beyond the scope of our current study, our in vivo <italic>Mettl3</italic> LOF coupled with prior Dgrcr8 and Dicer LOF in skin (Yi et al. 2008; 2011) point to an interesting parallel. That said, the skin phenotypes are different in the most fundamental way, and that is that when miRNAs are lost, HFs invaginate, something we don’t see in our mice. Since we don’t analyze miRNAs in our paper, it makes discussion a bit problematic. We have now added some text and references to this effect, in our last few paragraphs of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) They mentioned that WNT and SHH pathways surfaced in multiple pathways in their miCLIP data and suggested that m6A might function in hair follicle fate through these pathways. However, the authors did not show how these pathways behaved in WT vs cKO mice. Such analysis will strengthen their claims. Aberrant LEF and SHH signaling was associated with failure to form tight dermal condensates. With this data, they concluded that WNT signaling has been altered by m6A modification. However, there were not mechanistic studies to prove that WNT has been altered. The authors can do qPCR analysis of transcripts that are under WNT regulation to further show altered WNT signaling (e.g. axin) or IHC imaging of β-catenin etc. to future strengthen their conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>This was an excellent point. To this end, we first add data for β-catenin IHC (new Figure 3C), higher magnification of the interface between DP and HF progenitors to show defects in both WNT and SHH signaling in New Figure 3C,D, qPCR results for Lef1 in new Figure 6C as requested and most importantly, a previously not included analysis of the <italic>downregulated</italic> genes from our single cell RNA seq analysis of control and <italic>Mettl3</italic> cKO skin progenitors (new Figure 6A,B). This new analysis shows that among the most significantly downregulated genes are those involved in WNT and SHH signaling. Moreover, a number of these were both highly modified and highly translated in wild-type. Finally, we show that among the mRNAs downregulated are many canonical translation genes, providing further possibilities as to why genes highly modified and efficiently translated are likely down upon <italic>Mettl3</italic> LOF. These data beautifully strengthen our conclusions and tie together the manuscript. We really thank the reviewers for raising this point!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) They performed single-cell RNA-seq to measure the changed transcriptome and cellular state. However, their cell clustering analysis should be performed by using control and cKO samples together, rather than clustering separately and relying on marker genes to identify each population in control and cKO (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D, F). Are all corresponding cell populations in control and cKO clustered together? If not, they should explore the underlying reasons. The pseudotime analysis in Figure 4B should be strengthened by statistical analysis rather than eyeballing the population/lineage differences between Ctrl and cKO. They also should keep in mind they only have 1 pair of biological samples, which may reduce the robustness of the analysis. For differential gene analysis, they should independently confirm each data (Figure 4C, Figure 5D etc.) by qPCR or bulk RNA-seq from more sample pairs.</p></disp-quote><p>For the clustering of cell populations, we did analyze all cells in control and cKO together, so we agree on this point completely with the reviewers. We have now stated this more clearly in the text, as we agree the way we presented the story was confusing. We also now include more details in the Materials and methods section and also show the t-SNE plots with cells from the two conditions projected together in new Figure 5A. We have also performed statistical analysis for the pseudotime. Results are in new Figure 5C. qPCR and IMF verification for the top downregulated genes are substantiated in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 6. Conversely, t-SNE plots, qPCR and IMF verification for upregulated genes of mRNAs highly modified in WT are now added in new Figure 6C, D and new Figure 7—figure supplement 1B-D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Based on ribosome profiling analysis, they suggest that m6A enhances translation. Based on RNA-seq, they suggest that m6A reduces mRNA stability. Globally, these are two opposite effects on mRNA's potential to make protein. It's important to distinguish (1) whether these two opposite effects of m6A are on different mRNAs? (2) if the same mRNAs are under the control of both effects, what is the net effect on protein synthesis? Are they canceled out or one effect is more dominant than the other? How does this explain/correlate with the phenotypes?</p></disp-quote><p>Again, these points were incredibly helpful in our revising the manuscript so that others could clearly grasp the significance of our findings. As alluded to above, the comments made us realize that up until the scRNA seq data, we had focused on phenotypes corresponding to highly modified, efficiently translated mRNAs and which belonged to pathways that were suggested to be downregulated. However, in our initial version, we had not delved into the significantly downregulated mRNAs that surfaced upon scRNA seq of <italic>Mettl3</italic> null vs Control transcripts. We’ve now analyzed the most significantly downregulated genes and find that excitingly, these mRNAs encode proteins that are involved in WNT and SHH signaling and actin/ECM/cell adhesion proteins! These data are now presented in a new Figure 6A, B and they add compelling evidence to show that heavily modified, efficiently translated mRNAs involve pathways that are downregulated upon loss of m6A. Additionally, we find that markedly downregulated genes include a number of mRNAs involved in canonical translation (Figure 6B, lower right), further providing a possible explanation for why efficiently translated, highly modified mRNAs might be selectively downregulated upon LOF.</p><p>Conversely, the upregulated mRNAs include those which are heavily modified in the wild-type and encode proteins involved in RNA methylation, CAP-independent translation and different aspects of RNA metabolism. So yes, their KEGG profiles and mRNAs are distinct! The data suggest that the upregulated mRNAs are likely involved in (1) rescue mechanisms to boost stalled ribosome machinery and activate alternative pathways for translation; and (2) built-in negative feedback mechanisms for key mRNAs, e.g. the m6A readers (Ythdf1-3) to sense when m6A is low and boost efficiency of reading. Overall, the data beautifully demonstrate that m6A functions in multifaceted ways, which cannot be categorized as simply regulating mRNA translation nor mRNA degradation. The data further show that the functions of down and up regulated mRNAs upon <italic>Mettl3</italic> loss are markedly different—in one case affecting signaling and cell fate decisions and in the other case affecting pathways that become triggered when levels of m6A drop. We now highlight these data in the figures (new Figure 7C, D) and in the text, and add a new Figure 7E model to emphasize these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The observation of prematurely detached basal cells is interesting. Are they the direct consequence of reduced cell-cell adhesion and/or cell-bm adhesion?</p></disp-quote><p>Again, this is an excellent comment. We point out that ECM-receptor interactions are among the top 20% of mRNAs modified heavily and top 20% most efficiently translated. Upon loss of METTL3, Focal adhesion and intercellular adhesion are also categories among the most significantly downregulated in cKO and most heavily m6A modified in Control. This could explain the premature detachment. We provide new data that shows that cell polarity and cell organization are altered (new Figure 4) and that P-cad:E-cad is down in the cKO (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A), expected for a decrease in migration/actin dynamics normally seen in basal cells. Our new data point to NOTCH pathway genes as being highly m6A modified and efficiently translated and that NOTCH signaling is downregulated in the cKO epidermal progenitors as they exit the basal layer (new Figure 6D). Additionally, ECM-receptor interaction and actin regulators are also among the most significantly downregulated upon LOF. These data presented in new Figure 6B are supportive of the reviewers’ hypothesis. However, electron microscopy showed that although the epidermis is highly disordered and show increased cellularity and signs of basal features suprabasally, overall hemidesmosomes and intercellular junctions are largely intact, even at P0 (new Figure 6G). This is corroborated by TEWL, showing intact barrier function in newborn mice. Our data together point to the notion that precocious departure of basal progenitors is occurring and is reflected in basal features lingering suprabasally, but these defects are subtle. We attribute this to a remarkable ability of the epidermal progenitors to activate compensatory mechanisms that work for a while until eventually, the deleterious effects of m6A loss cannot be overcome. We thank the reviewers for encouraging us to explore this avenue in depth, and although our answers are not simple, they do provide valuable insights for future explorations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The reviewers were not sure about the point of OPP experiments. OPP label may be too low resolution to show any changes in Mettl3 cKO.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and felt that in the absence of ribosomal profiling, the data is best omitted, which we’ve done. However, our new data in Figure 6 show that canonical translational regulators are significantly downregulated upon METTL3 LOF as are signaling pathways whose mRNAs include among the most highly modified and most efficiently translated (new Figure 6B). Conversely, CAP-independent translational regulators are upregulated as are other Rna processing factors that suggest alternative pathways for translation (new Figure 7C-E). Finally, we also see signs of rescue mechanisms. First is Myc, known to function in enhanced translation (new Figure 7—figure supplement 1B-D). Second is YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3, all of which we show are highly methylated by m6A in WT progenitors and highly upregulated upon m6A loss. As these are key m6A readers—affecting translation (1 and 3) and RNA degradation (2) they too are suggestive of a means to boost m6A recognition in the face of m6A deficiency. These arguments are stronger and more interesting than the OPP data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 3E-F: it is clear that in the grafted skin Mettl3 cKO HFs underwent HF degeneration in accompany with sebocyte differentiation. However, it is not clear if this fate switch only occurred in Mettl3 cKO HFs upon wounding (grafting in this case). Oil red O staining with P6 ungrafted skin sections will partially address this question. If this fate switch only happens upon wounding, authors should discuss the effects of m6A loss in the differential circumstance as well as speculate the effect of wounding in m6A-mediated regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Excellent point! We have performed the Oil red O staining on P6 ungrafted skin (new Figure 3E) and added discussion about the potential influences caused by wounding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Subsection “Conditional ablation of Mettl3 in epidermal progenitors results in a marked defect in HF morphogenesis”: &quot;the engrafted cKO epidermis was hyperthickened, a feature which had also been evident in ungrafted cKO epidermis.&quot; To this reviewer, the hyperthicken epidermis could NOT be appreciated in ungrafted cKO epidermis based on the H&amp;E staining shown in Figure 2G. The quantification in the thickness of ungrafted and grafted epidermis will be essential. In line with point #2, this hyperthicken epidermis in grafted cKO skin might be caused by wounding if hyperthickness is not detected in ungrafted Mettl3 cKO epidermis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and feel that the point is best omitted from the text, even though we did quantify and confirmed the thickness. Our EM data showing increased cellularity is clear and supported by quantifications at the IMF level (new Figure 6G; Figure 6—figure supplement 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 5E: Authors stated that MYC expression was elevated within Mettl3 cKO epidermal progenitors (subsection “A cohort of highly m6A-decorated mRNAs whose levels rise upon removal of their modification”). It is not clear to this reviewer how the quantification of MYC expression was done. Which cell markers did authors use to define &quot;epidermal progenitors&quot; (e.g. integrin α6 or K14…)? Did authors also include P-cad+ WNY-hi, WNT-lo HF cells, and epidermal suprabasal cells? Please clarify this by adding information in the figure legend as well as Materials and methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We now clarify this. We identified populations from our scRNA seq data according to known marker gene expressions (Figure 5B; now color coded as in the t-SNE plots in Figure 5A). For our substantiating qPCR, we used basal skin progenitors FACS-purified from whole E16.5 skins as shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1E. We now state this in the text and methods. For MYC, we quantified the t-SNE data also by IMF and there we focus on basal progenitors at both E17.5 and P0. We moved the MYC data to the supplement as it is confusing to most readers not in the skin field. The Watt group showed that MYC functions in terminal differentiation of the epidermis while others have shown that <italic>Myc</italic> can act as a WNT target gene in e.g. colon. In the APC LOF skin mouse, <italic>Myc</italic> is actually downregulated even though WNT signaling is upregulated. Thus, although our data are consistent with the antagonistic effects of WNT signaling and MYC in the skin, it is not an essential point to our work here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 3—figure supplement 1: It is interesting to see high levels of PCAD expression in the basal layer of grafted Mettl3 cKO epidermis. Did authors also find this striking pattern in ungrafted Mettl3 cKO epidermis (e.g. P6 ungrafted skin)? What could be the explanation of this significant upregulation of P-Cadherin in the Mettl3 cKO epidermal basal cells, e.g. alteration in cell junction? Confusion in fate specification? It will be helpful if authors can check on ungrafted skin and speculate the possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we have selected a more representative image for the PCAD staining in the grafted skin (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Second, we have examined the expression levels of PCAD and ECAD at E16.5 closely. Results are included in Figure 6—figure supplement 2A. Our data show clearly that P-cadherin:E-cadherin ratios shift in the <italic>Mettl3</italic> cKO. We also provide data that there are some gaps, visible by EM in the adherens junctions of the cKO vs WT, but these are subtle (Figure 6G). We think that these differences, coupled with the marked downregulation of actin regulators, polarity genes and adhesion genes in the cKO (Figure 6B, Figure 4B) are all suggestive that there are subtle defects here. We show the data and discuss this possibility.</p></body></sub-article></article>
