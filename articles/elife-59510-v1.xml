In the zygotes of humans, but also in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, parental chromosomes are initially in separate pronuclei each surrounded by a nuclear envelope (NE) and meet for the first time during the first mitotic division. For this mitosis to occur properly, the NE of the pronuclei must be disassembled in a timely manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>). This step is essential to permit the mingling of the maternal and paternal chromosomes and their capture by the microtubules of the developing spindle.</p><p>The newly fertilized one-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo provides a dynamic developmental context for the investigation of the mechanism regulating nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and for review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oegema, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen-Fix and Askjaer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pintard and Bowerman, 2019</xref>). After fertilization, the egg and sperm pronuclei meet near the posterior pole of the embryo. After rotation and centration of the nucleo-centrosomal complex, the NE breaks down in the vicinity of the centrosomes and between the juxtaposed pronuclei. This allows the capture of the chromosomes by the microtubules and the mixing of the parental chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The breakdown of the envelope located between the two pronuclei starts with the formation of a membrane gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Audhya et al., 2007</xref>), most likely triggered by egg and sperm chromosomes that come into contact with the NE. Accordingly, gap formation depends on proper chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rahman et al., 2015</xref>). Complete disassembly of the NE occurs later at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2000</xref>). NEBD is thus spatially regulated in the early embryo but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear.</p><p>If the NE between the two pronuclei persists through anaphase, as is the case in mutant embryos with delays or defects in NEBD, the two sets of parental chromosomes remain physically separated during the first mitosis. Consequently, the maternal and paternal chromosomes segregate into two separate DNA masses at each pole of the spindle. This in turn leads to the formation of two separate nuclei in each cell of the two cell embryo, called the ‘paired nuclei’ phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rahman et al., 2015</xref>). Several studies have documented conditions that affect NEBD and give rise to the paired nuclei phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Audhya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gorjánácz and Mattaj, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bahmanyar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rahman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martino et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, this phenotype is typically associated with inactivation of the mitotic Polo-like kinase (PLK-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, Plk1 in humans and Polo in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rahman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martino et al., 2017</xref>), which regulates many aspects of mitotic entry and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Archambault and Glover, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zitouni et al., 2014</xref>). However, the critical targets of PLK-1 involved in this process are largely unknown. Identifying these targets is of primary importance to decipher how PLK-1 promotes the merger of the maternal and paternal genomes into a single nucleus after fertilization.</p><p>Consistent with a role in NEBD, PLK-1, is specifically recruited to the NE in prophase just before NEBD via its C-terminal Polo-Box domain (PBD), both in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Linder et al., 2017</xref>) and in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martino et al., 2017</xref>). The PBD domain binds to specific phosphorylated sequence motifs (polo-docking sites) that are created by other priming kinases (non-self-priming) or are self-primed by PLK-1 itself, thus providing an efficient mechanism to regulate PLK-1 subcellular localization and substrate selectivity in space and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 2010</xref>). At the NE, PLK-1 could potentially regulate all the steps of NEBD, in particular, depolymerization of the nuclear lamina.</p><p>The lamina is a rigid proteinaceous meshwork underlying the inner nuclear membrane, bridging the nuclear envelope and chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaronson and Blobel, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldman et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aebi et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burke and Stewart, 2013</xref>). All lamins are type V intermediate filaments composed of an unstructured N-terminal head, a central α-helical coiled-coil rod domain, and a C-terminal tail domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stuurman et al., 1998</xref>). Lamin filaments are composed of lamin dimers, which assemble into dimeric head-to-tail polymers. Two head-to-tail polymers then assemble laterally into a protofilament with a uniform shape rod of around 3.5 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Turgay et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahn et al., 2019</xref>). Lamin filaments depolymerization is triggered by mitotic phosphorylation of the head and tail domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerace and Blobel, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heald and McKeon, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mühlhäusser and Kutay, 2007</xref>) but the regulation of lamin phosphorylation is complex and not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Machowska et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Conserved Cdk (Cyclin-dependent kinase) consensus motifs (S/T-P) are present in most lamins and their phosphorylation is important for lamina disassembly in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ward and Kirschner, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heald and McKeon, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peter et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peter et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dessev et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mehsen et al., 2018</xref>). However, in most studies conducted in vivo, the impact of lamin-phosphosite mutations on lamina disassembly during mitosis has been investigated only in the presence of endogenous phosphorylatable lamin. In this context, the resulting phenotype is highly dependent on the level of overexpression of the mutated lamin over the wild-type version, which makes the precise analysis of the contribution of the phosphosites to lamina disassembly particularly challenging. Based on a similar overexpression approach, Protein Kinase C (PKC) has been proposed to act in concert with Cdk1 to promote phosphorylation-dependent lamin B1 disassembly through lipid signaling in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mall et al., 2012</xref>). These observations suggest that multiple kinases cooperate to promote efficient mitotic lamin disassembly.</p><p>Although Plk1 has not been directly implicated in lamin phosphorylation during mitosis, the lamina persists during mitosis upon <italic>plk-1</italic> inactivation, resulting in a paired nuclei phenotype, consistent with a possible role of PLK-1 in lamina depolymerization in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Moreover, partial inactivation of <italic>lmn-1</italic>, encoding the unique lamin isoform (B-type) expressed in <italic>C elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2000</xref>), suppresses the paired nuclei phenotype of <italic>plk-1</italic> temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rahman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martino et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that PLK-1 directly phosphorylates LMN-1 at multiple sites in the head and tail domains to trigger lamina depolymerization. Accordingly, the expression of non-phosphorylatable versions of LMN-1 prevents lamina depolymerization during mitosis, which is sufficient to induce the formation of 2cell embryos with a paired nuclei phenotype. Furthermore, we reconstitute the depolymerization of pre-assembled LMN-1 filaments by PLK-1 in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that PLK-1 is a direct lamin kinase <italic>in C. elegans</italic> and possibly also in other organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PLK-1 phosphorylates the <italic>C. elegans</italic> lamin LMN-1 at multiple sites in vitro</title><p>To determine if LMN-1 is a direct PLK-1 substrate in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we tested whether PLK-1 directly phosphorylates LMN-1 in vitro. As lamina disassembly is regulated by phosphorylation of the head and the tail domains, we specifically concentrated on these two regions of LMN-1.

We tested this hypothesis using a Far-Western ligand-binding assay. We pre-phosphorylated the head or the tail domain of LMN-1 using PLK-1 and then tested their ability to interact with the PLK-1 PBD. As shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> (panels a, b), the LMN-1 head, but not the tail domain, pre-phosphorylated by PLK-1 readily interacted with the PLK-1-PBD (panel a), but not with a version of the PBD carrying mutated phospho-pincers (panel b), demonstrating that this interaction is phospho-dependent. To test if the two polo-docking sites defined by sequence analysis accounted for PBD binding, we analyzed different LMN-1 [H] fragments (3A, 4A, 7A) containing alanine substitutions in the predicted polo-docking sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, panels a, b and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We conclude that PLK-1 phosphorylates LMN-1 on two polo-docking sites in the head domain for self-priming and binding in vitro.</p><p>Protein sequence analysis suggested that Plk1/Polo might also interact with lamins from other species, as vertebrate and <italic>Drosophila</italic> lamins contain putative polo-docking sites in the head domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, instead of matching the consensus for PLK-1 self-priming phosphorylation and binding (S-pS-X), these sites match the consensus for non-self-priming and binding (S-pT/pS-P). Notably, 12 out of 21 lamins from vertebrates and <italic>Drosophila</italic> harbor the canonical STP site in the head domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which perfectly matches the consensus for non-self-priming and binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> lamin Dm0 contains two of these sites while human lamin A/C contains one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> panel a). As these polo-docking sites are modified by Cyclin B-Cdk1 during mitosis, both in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Machowska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mehsen et al., 2018</xref>) and in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dephoure et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), we reasoned that their phosphorylation might promote Plk1 binding via a non-self-priming mechanism.

The canonical non-self-priming STP and SSP polo-docking sites accounted for all the PBD binding activity as substitution of the threonine and serine to alanine abrogated binding under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, panel b lane 4).

Like all NEs, each pronucleus NE is a double membrane perforated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the ER while the inner nuclear membrane is supported by nuclear lamina, which provides structural integrity to the pronuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen-Fix and Askjaer, 2017</xref>). Understanding how these double membranes are remodeled to allow the merging of the parental chromosomes is of critical importance. Although it is a key step in development, this process is poorly understood.</p><p>How does PLK-1 promote NEBD and pronuclear membrane fusion? Rahman et al have recently used ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) to show that the membranes of the two pronuclei fuse during metaphase and become two membranes perforated by fenestrations, allowing the parental chromosomes to come into contact. The pronuclei membranes fuse by two types of membrane structures: outer-outer junctions and three-way sheet junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>). In <italic>plk-1</italic>ts embryos, these three-way junctions are not observed and the membranes do not fuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>). Based on these observations, it has been proposed that PLK-1 promotes the fusion of the pronuclei membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>) and that membrane fusion events, rather than NEBD, drive the two pronuclei together before the first mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma and Starr, 2020</xref>). While we cannot exclude a direct role of PLK-1 in pronuclei membrane fusion, our results rather suggest that PLK-1 is required to depolymerize the lamina and possibly to remove other nuclear envelope proteins (nucleoporins, inner nuclear membrane proteins) from the nuclear envelopes of the pronuclei, to promote the merging of the parental chromosomes. Expression of LMN-1 mutated on eight PLK-1-phosphorylation sites is sufficient to stabilize the lamina during mitosis, which is in turn sufficient to physically separate the parental chromosomes during their segregation in anaphase, giving rise to embryos with a paired nuclei phenotype. Furthermore, the membrane scission event, required for chromosome merging in metaphase, was never seen in <italic>lmn-1</italic> 8A mutant embryos, even though parental chromosomes perfectly aligned on the metaphase plate in a majority of embryos (7 out of 12). These findings suggest that PLK-1-mediated lamina depolymerization, a key step of NEBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Güttinger et al., 2009</xref>), is a prerequisite for membrane gap formation, pronuclei membrane fusion, and for the merging of the parental chromosomes into a single nucleus at the two-cell stage. Notably, embryonic lethality was associated with the <italic>lmn-1 8A</italic> mutant, illustrating the functional importance of lamina depolymerization. The cause of embryonic lethality is unclear but might result from defects in chromosome movements in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Link et al., 2018</xref>) and segregation in mitosis. A similar defect in the merging of parental chromosomes at the beginning of human life might have drastic consequences and cause various defects including loss of heterozygosity.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that although PLK-1 phosphorylates LMN-1 on fifteen sites, here we have only studied the functional consequences of mutating eight of these sites. We clearly showed that mutation of eight sites is sufficient to stabilize the lamina during mitosis but does not fully recapitulate the stabilization of the lamina observed after <italic>plk-1</italic> depletion. We attributed this difference to the seven remaining sites but we can certainly not exclude the possibility that PLK-1 also phosphorylates other Lamin-binding proteins which indirectly contributes to lamina disassembly. To further investigate this issue, it will be critical to analyze lamina disassembly in embryos expressing GFP::LMN-1 15A. Likewise, it will be important to decipher whether all these sites equally contribute to lamina disassembly and whether they are equally phosphorylated by PLK-1. Addressing this issue might help to decipher how lamina disassembly is spatially regulated in the early embryo. Our study also revealed that N-terminal tagging of LMN-1 with GFP appears to alter the assembly properties of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> lamina. Clearly the phenotype observed after expression of GFP::LMN-1 8A is not as severe as the one resulting from the expression of untagged LMN-1 8A. Whether GFP has the same impact on lamins from other species is unclear but it will be important to carefully examine this possibility in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Possible contribution of PLK-1 to lamina depolymerization in other species</title><p>Depolymerization of the lamina during mitosis is a major step in NEBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerace and Blobel, 1980</xref>). Seminal works have shown the importance of the master mitotic Cyclin B-Cdk1 kinase in this process in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peter et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ward and Kirschner, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heald and McKeon, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Machowska et al., 2015</xref>). Although the importance of Cyclin B-Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of lamins for their depolymerization during mitosis cannot be overemphasized, several questions remain to be addressed. For instance, lamin A/C and B networks are disassembled with different kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Georgatos et al., 1997</xref>) but the precise contribution of Cyclin B-Cdk1 in the depolymerization of both networks is not entirely clear. While substitution of CDK sites by alanines has been shown to strongly stabilize lamin A filaments in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heald and McKeon, 1990</xref>), similar point mutations in lamin B1 have only a modest effect on the timing of lamin B1 depolymerization during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mall et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Another important aspect to consider is the timing of lamina depolymerization in different species. If lamina depolymerization occurs in prophase and pro-metaphase in human cells that undergo ‘open mitosis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Souza and Osmani, 2009</xref>), it occurs at the latter stages in several organisms including <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> or <italic>C. elegans.</italic> In these organisms, part of lamina dispersion takes place at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paddy et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2000</xref>) and coincides with a drop in Cyclin B-Cdk1 kinase activity due to proteasomal Cyclin B degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Voet et al., 2009</xref>). This suggests that other kinase(s) might be responsible for lamina depolymerization in these organisms at this cell cycle stage. Cyclin B-Cdk1 might initiate the process and another kinase might act after Cyclin B-Cdk1 inactivation, or alternatively, the process might be entirely CDK-independent. Our results strongly suggest that lamina depolymerization in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is independent of Cyclin-Cdk and is driven by the Polo-like kinase PLK-1. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> CDK1 is directly implicated but Polo might also play a role. In support of this hypothesis, we found that PLK-1 binds <italic>Drosophila</italic> head domain of lamin Dm0 via non-self-priming and binding mechanisms. Furthermore, previous work established that Polo is required for NEBD in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kachaner et al., 2017</xref>) and that lamin Dm0 phosphorylation outside the CDK site contributes to lamin dispersal in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mehsen et al., 2018</xref>). Based on all these observations, and given the timing of lamina disassembly in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we suggest that Cyclin-Cdk, together with Polo, might ensure the efficient depolymerization of lamin in mitosis. Likewise, Plk1 could assist lamin A/C dispersal early in mitosis in human cells because similarly to <italic>Drosophila</italic> lamin Dm0, Lamin A/C is readily phosphorylated on a polo-docking site in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dephoure et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Further work will be required to test the role of Plk1 in lamina depolymerization in other organisms.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified a PLK-1-dependent lamina-depolymerization process in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> early embryo that is essential for parental chromosome mixing after the first mitosis. Given that human embryos presumably also segregate parental chromosomes on a single mitotic spindle, timely lamina depolymerization might be required in human embryos to ensure parental chromosomes mixing. A defect in this process might be deleterious for human embryonic development, leading for example to the production of genomic heterogeneity among the blastomeres. It will be important to consider defects in the merging of the parental chromosomes in the fertilized zygote as a source of multinucleated blastomeres.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans)</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>C. elegans</italic> N2 Bristol</td><td valign="top">CGC</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cgc.cbs.umn.edu/strain.php?id=10570">http://www.cgc.cbs.umn.edu/strain.php?id=10570</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans)</italic></td><td valign="top">[<italic>gfp</italic>::<italic>lmn-1</italic>] <italic>MosSCI</italic>: <italic>lmn-1</italic>(<italic>tm1502</italic>) <italic>I</italic>; <italic>jfSi68</italic>[<italic>Plmn-1</italic>::<italic>gfp cb-unc-119</italic>(+)] <italic>II</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Link et al., 2018</xref>, #49005</td><td valign="top">UV120</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans)</italic></td><td valign="top">[<italic>gfp</italic>::<italic>lmn-1<sup>S8A</sup></italic>] <italic>MosSCI</italic>: <italic>lmn-1</italic>(<italic>tm1502</italic>) <italic>I</italic>; <italic>jfSi89</italic>[<italic>Plmn-1S</italic>(<italic>21</italic>,<italic>22</italic>,<italic>24</italic>,<italic>32</italic>,<italic>397</italic>,<italic>398</italic>,<italic>403</italic>,<italic>405</italic>)<italic>A</italic>::<italic>gfp cb-unc-119</italic>(+)] <italic>II</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Link et al., 2018</xref>, #49005</td><td valign="top">UV122</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans)</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>lmn-1(jf140[S21,22,24,32,397,398, 403,405A]) I/hT2 [bli-4(e937) let-?(q782) qIs48</italic>] (I;III)</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top">UV2059</td><td valign="top">V.

After Freeze-crack and fixation with cold dehydrated methanol, slides were washed 3 × 5 min, blocked for 1 hr in PBS 3% BSA and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS 3% BSA. Working dilutions for the primary antibodies were 1/1000 for rabbit LMN-1 antibodies. Slides were later incubated for 30 min at room temperature with secondary antibodies (anti-Rabbit) coupled to the Alexa 568 fluorophore. Next, embryos were mounted in Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector). Fixed embryos were imaged using a spinning disk confocal microscope with 63 × N/A 1.4 objectives. Captured images were processed using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop.</p><p>For the analysis of the paired nuclei phenotype in live specimens by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, embryos were obtained by cutting open gravid hermaphrodites using two 21-gauge needles. Embryos were handled individually and mounted on a coverslip in 3 μl of M9 buffer. The coverslip was placed on a 3% agarose pad. DIC images were acquired by an Axiocam Hamamatsu ICc one camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Bridgewater, NJ) mounted on a Zeiss AxioImager A1 microscope equipped with a Plan Neofluar 100×/1.3 NA objective (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany), and the acquisition system was controlled by Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany). Images were acquired at 10 s intervals.</p><p>Live imaging was performed at 23°C using a spinning disc confocal head (CSU-X1; Yokogawa Corporation of America) mounted on an Axio Observer.Z1 inverted microscope (Zeiss) equipped with 491- and 561 nm lasers (OXXIUS 488 nm 150 mW, OXXIUS Laser 561 nm 150 mW) and sCMOS PRIME 95 camera (Photometrics). Acquisition parameters were controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). In all cases a 63×, Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 Oil (Zeiss) lens was used, and approximately four z-sections were collected at 1 µm and 10 s intervals. Captured images were processed using ImageJ and Photoshop.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Photoconversion experiment</title><p>Photoconversion of wildtype or <italic>lmn-1 8A</italic> embryos expressing the photoconvertible form of histone (Dendra2::H2B) in the germline was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolková and Lanctôt, 2016</xref>). By using a ‘point activation’ (using a ROI to select the region of interest), through illuminating the chromatin of the maternal pronucleus with the 405 nm diode laser set at power of 4 mW (4% of maximum power) and a pixel dwell time of 40µs for five repeats. A green-to-red photoconversion of the labeled chromatin was observed and followed the fate of the chromosomes during mitosis until the two-cell stage. Image stacks were processed and merged using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Negative staining electron microscopy</title><p>Purified untagged Ce-lamin (0.5 mg/ml) was assembled into head-to-tail polymers as described above, LMN-1 filaments disassembly reaction was initiated by the addition of purified C.e. 6×(His)-PLK-1 kinase, follow by incubation at 30°C for 40 min in the presence of Mg/ATP. Then 3 μl of the LMN-1 assembled into head-to-tail polymers or LMN-1 filaments disassembly reaction were deposited on glow-discharged TEM grids and allowed to sediment for two mins. Excess liquid was blotted out and grids were stained in 1% uranyl acetate for 30 s, blotted and dried before observation in a Tecnai 12 (Thermofischer scientific, Eidenhoven, The Netherlands) transmission microscope at 120kV. Pictures were acquired on a Gatan Oneview camera (Roper Scientific, USA) at 0.3 to 1 nm pixel size.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>GFP::LMN-1 intensity over time was measured using the Image J software in control and RNAi conditions after background subtraction. Anaphase onset was defined as time 0. Data points on the graphs are the mean of the normalized GFP intensity measurements in control and RNAi conditions for the same define region of interest (ROI). To allow direct comparison between control and RNAi conditions, the average signal intensity of GFP::LMN-1 at the NE 120 s before anaphase was arbitrarily defined as 1. The results are presented as means ± SEM. In all graphs, data were compared by Mann-Whitney test.

It was previously known that pronuclear fusion depends on PLK-1 activity and that LMN-1 is a PLK-1 target in vivo. The authors now demonstrate that PLK-1 can phosphorylate recombinant fragments of <italic>C. elegans</italic> LMN-1 in vitro, and identify putative PLK-1 target sites by mass spectrometry. Using a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of LMN-1, the authors demonstrate that LMN-1 phosphorylation drives the timely disassembly of the nuclear lamina in the zygote as a prerequisite for the mixing of the parental genomes. The manuscript presents a set of well-controlled experiments that are of commendable quality and in support of the proposed model.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>All the reviewers asked that you clarify the specificity of the Plk1 kinase assays. They also agreed that the manuscript would benefit from rewriting to make it clearer focusing on Plk1's role in lamina disassembly and make the parts on &quot;merger of parental genomes&quot; more compact and concise since such binucleate phenotypes have already been characterised extensively. Moreover, mentioning the role of microtubules, but then not going into the details, e.g. by visualizing microtubules themselves, is more confusing than helpful – these data may have a better use as a basis for a new study.</p><p>It would be helpful to provide a clearer description of processes in the early embryo in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. There are sections of the Introduction that are confusing unless you are a <italic>C. elegans</italic> specialist. In particular, gap formation in the opposed nuclear membranes depends on the alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate and for this to happen limited NEBD must occur in regions of the NEs closest to the spindle poles, which raises the question of how NEBD is spatially regulated. In the absence of PLK-1 the membrane gap does not appear, resulting in the formation of paired maternal and paternal nuclei in the two cell embryo but the chromosomes are still segregated, indicating that limited NEBD must still occur close to the spindle poles. Clearly, mechanisms of NEBD are spatially segregated. Even in wild type embryos, the distal margins of the two NEs survive until the metaphase-anaphase transition. Is there a mechanical aspect to this? Similarly, for the apparent flattening of the two opposed NEs: is there any evidence of physical interactions between the two outer nuclear membranes, perhaps analogous to that which occurs between Golgi cisternae? Another possibility would be interaction between outer nuclear membrane KASK-domain proteins. Microtubulule-dependent associations between opposed UNC-83 molecules for instance. Do we know if SUN or KASH domain proteins are concentrated in this contact region? It goes without saying that there have to be interactions between the two ONMs if the fusion model described in the Rahman et al., 2020, paper proves to be correct.</p><p>A few more comments on LMN-1 might also be useful. Is it more closely related to vertebrate B-type lamins, is it farnesylated, does it remain membrane-associated during mitosis, etc?</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>(1) in vitro kinase assays may suffer from a lack of specificity. In light of this fact, it must be noted that phosphorylation by PLK-1 in the presented in vitro assays is only suppressed if all available Ser and Thr residues are mutated to Ala. And, as mentioned by the authors, some of the identified phosphosites do not follow the consensus sequence of PLK-1 phosphorylation, especially not the broadened consensus defined by Santamaria et al., 2010 (L(Φ)(E/N/D(Q))X(S/T)L(Φ)) or the previously accepted consensus (D/E)X(S/T)Φ (Nakajima et al., 2003). The consensus sequence of PLK-1 should be shown as part of Figure 1. The comparison shown in Supplementary file 2 may overestimate the fit to the consensus by using the most minimal motifs. In the table, it should also be indicated which sites were identified as PLK-1 target sites in vivo (Link et al., 2018). How specific is Plk1 as compared to cdk1 or Aurora, for example, in phosphorylating these sites? How strongly are these sites phosphorylated by Plk1 as compared to phosphorylation of cdk1-sites by cdk1?</p><p>(2) In the text it is stated that depletion of PLK-1 in the GFP::LMN-1 8A mutant strain exacerbates the lamina disassembly defect (Figure 3). This should not be the case if the authors had identified all relevant PLK-1 phosphorylation sites. The authors ascribe this additional effect on the lamina to the remaining seven phosphosites that were phosphorylated in their in vitro assay, but not mutated in this experiment. Since these seven additional phosphosites have not been shown to be phosphorylated by PLK-1 in previous studies in vivo studies, one might wonder whether the exacerbation of the lamina disassembly effect can be ascribed to something other than these 15 putative phosphosites. In order to exclude this possibility, it would have been helpful to analyze a 15A mutant. In any case, the effect of PLK-1 depletion in the mutant worm is most striking after anaphase onset. The authors should discuss this observation.</p><p>3) Figure 1 shows that Plk1 can efficiently phosphorylate lamin on several sites. However, the figure lacks data that would allow a relative comparison of how efficient and specific this phosphorylation really is.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article “PLK-1 promotes the merger of the parental genome into a single nucleus by triggering lamina disassembly&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We fully understand the concern that the in vitro kinase assays may suffer from a lack of specificity, but available data in the literature indicate that Plk1 generally phosphorylates its substrates on the same sites in vitro and in vivo. In fact, Plk1 consensus sites were originally defined using in vitro kinase assays with purified Plk1 and GST-Cdc25C peptides (Nakajima et al., 2003), exactly as we did here with GST-LMN-1 fragments. Later Plk1 consensus sites were refined by combining phosphoproteomic studies in human cells with mass-spectrometry-based in vitro kinase assays using naturally occurring peptides (Santamaria et al., 2010, Kettenbach et al., 2011). Overall, these studies have extensively used in vitro kinase assays to validate Plk1 sites and to define the consensus sequence.</p><p>Furthermore, it should be noted that PLK-1 does not phosphorylate GST which itself contains multiple serine and threonine residues. Likewise, the GST-LMN-1[H] 9A fragment, which contains four serine and two threonine residues at the beginning of the LMN-1 sequence is not phosphorylated by PLK-1, indicating the specificity of the assay. We also used <italic>C. elegans</italic> PLK-1 kinase in our assay to further ensure specificity. We also clearly demonstrate that some of these phosphosites are self-priming sites. Finally, we clearly show that S32, which is phosphorylated in vitro by PLK-1 is also modified in vivo in a PLK-1-dependent manner. For all these reasons we are confident that our assay is relatively specific.</p><p>Regarding the Plk1 consensus site, we note that it has been defined using human proteins and we currently do not know whether it is exactly the same consensus with <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteins. In addition, as emphasized by Santamaria et al., even the broadened consensus L(F)(E/N/D(Q))X(S/T)L(F) does not account for all observed Plk1 substrates. Kettenbach et al., 2011 have identified variations of this motif (Kettenbach et al. Science Signaling 2011, Figure S11B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They also agreed that the manuscript would benefit from rewriting to make it clearer focusing on Plk1's role in lamina disassembly and make the parts on &quot;merger of parental genomes&quot; more compact and concise since such binucleate phenotypes have already been characterised extensively.</p></disp-quote><p>The main focus of our study was to decipher how PLK-1 promotes the merger of the parental chromosomes by identifying its key target(s) at the nuclear envelope.</p><p>As PLK-1 is expected to phosphorylate numerous substrates during mitosis, the paired nuclei phenotype could have resulted from the non-phosphorylation of multiple PLK-1 targets. Here we not only identify the lamina (LMN-1) as a PLK-1 target but we demonstrate that the expression of LMN-1 with point mutations on PLK-1 sites is sufficient to recapitulate the paired nuclei phenotype resulting from <italic>plk-1</italic> inactivation. We thus demonstrate that depolymerization of the lamina is a key and essential step towards the merging of the parental genomes.</p><p>While it is true that the paired nuclei phenotype has been already described, only one study demonstrated that parental chromosomes remain physically separated in embryo presenting this phenotype (Rahman et al., 2015). Thus to prove our point it was critical to demonstrate unequivocally that the expression LMN-1 with point mutations on PLK-1 sites prevents the merging of the parental genomes and thus that LMN-1 is a key target.</p><p>We discuss extensively the implication of the identification of LMN-1 as a new Plk1 target in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and possibly in other systems in the Discussion section. For all these reasons, we would rather prefer to keep the organization of the manuscript as it is. Nevertheless, we have slightly modified the Abstract to better balance the two main findings of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, mentioning the role of microtubules, but then not going into the details, e.g. by visualizing microtubules themselves, is more confusing than helpful – these data may have a better use as a basis for a new study.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this comment. Consequently, we have decided to remove the last section on microtubules. This part does not change the main message of our study. We will publish it separately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful to provide a clearer description of processes in the early embryo in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. There are sections of the Introduction that are confusing unless you are a <italic>C. elegans</italic> specialist. In particular, gap formation in the opposed nuclear membranes depends on the alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate and for this to happen limited NEBD must occur in regions of the NEs closest to the spindle poles, which raises the question of how NEBD is spatially regulated. In the absence of PLK-1 the membrane gap does not appear, resulting in the formation of paired maternal and paternal nuclei in the two cell embryo but the chromosomes are still segregated, indicating that limited NEBD must still occur close to the spindle poles. Clearly, mechanisms of NEBD are spatially segregated. Even in wild type embryos, the distal margins of the two NEs survive until the metaphase-anaphase transition. Is there a mechanical aspect to this? Similarly, for the apparent flattening of the two opposed NEs: is there any evidence of physical interactions between the two outer nuclear membranes, perhaps analogous to that which occurs between Golgi cisternae? Another possibility would be interaction between outer nuclear membrane KASK-domain proteins. Microtubulule-dependent associations between opposed UNC-83 molecules for instance. Do we know if SUN or KASH domain proteins are concentrated in this contact region? It goes without saying that there have to be interactions between the two ONMs if the fusion model described in the Rahman et al., 2020, paper proves to be correct.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not having been sufficiently clear on the description of NEBD in the one cell embryo. We have modified the Introduction accordingly. Clearly mechanisms of NEBD are spatially regulated in the early embryo and the localization of PLK-1 is probably one of the mechanisms dictating this timing.</p><p>The mechanisms allowing the flattening of the two opposed NEs are unknown and whether the two membranes physically interact before fusion and how they do it is not understood. SUN and KASH domain proteins are located at the NE but are not particularly enriched in this contact region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A few more comments on LMN-1 might also be useful. Is it more closely related to vertebrate B-type lamins, is it farnesylated, does it remain membrane-associated during mitosis, etc?</p></disp-quote><p>It appears that we have not been sufficiently clear on this point either. We have included additional comments to specify that LMN-1 is the unique B-type lamin ortholog in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) in vitro kinase assays may suffer from a lack of specificity. In light of this fact, it must be noted that phosphorylation by PLK-1 in the presented in vitro assays is only suppressed if all available Ser and Thr residues are mutated to Ala.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, the GST-LMN-1[H] 9A fragment, which still contains four serine and two threonine residues at the beginning of LMN-1 sequence is not phosphorylated by PLK1. GST, used as a control in these experiments, is also not phosphorylated by Plk1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And, as mentioned by the authors, some of the identified phosphosites do not follow the consensus sequence of PLK-1 phosphorylation, especially not the broadened consensus defined by Santamaria et al., 2010 (L(Φ)(E/N/D(Q))X(S/T)L(Φ)) or the previously accepted consensus (D/E)X(S/T)Φ (Nakajima et al., 2003).</p></disp-quote><p>That is true: some of the identified phosphosites do not follow the consensus defined by Santamaria et al. but it is important to mention that Santamaria et al. emphasized in their study that even the broadened consensus L(F)(E/N/D(Q))X(S/T)L(F) does not account for all observed Plk1 substrates. Kettenbach et al., 2011 identified additional consensus sites including pS/pT-F or pS/pT with a hydrophobic residue in position +1 (Kettenbach et al., 2011, Figure S11B). There are several variations of these consensus sequences, as noted in these studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The consensus sequence of PLK-1 should be shown as part of Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the consensus sequence of PLK-1 in the main text but not in Figure 1. Just adding the consensus sequence in the Figure will not help the reader unless we insert the full Supplementary file 2 that we have extensively revised (see next comment).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The comparison shown in Supplementary file 2 may overestimate the fit to the consensus by using the most minimal motifs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Supplementary file 2 to compare the surrounding sequence of each phosphosites to the broaden consensus sites defined by Santamaria et al. or Kettenbach et al. It should be noted that several contiguous phosphorylated residues such as S21 and S22 are embedded in a consensus site.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the table, it should also be indicated which sites were identified as PLK-1 target sites in vivo (Link et al., 2018).</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that Link et al. did not show that these sites are PLK-1 targets in vivo but CHK2 and PLK-2 targets in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline. We show here that LMN-1 S32 is a PLK-1 target in the early embryo. As suggested, we now indicate in the Supplementary file 2 the sites that have been found to be phosphorylated in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How specific is Plk1 as compared to cdk1 or Aurora, for example, in phosphorylating these sites? How strongly are these sites phosphorylated by Plk1 as compared to phosphorylation of cdk1-sites by cdk1?</p></disp-quote><p>Extensive phosphoproteomic studies have shown that these three kinases clearly phosphorylate different motifs. As mentioned in the text, LMN-1 does not contain a single S/T-P site typically phosphorylated by Cyclin-dependent kinases nor R/KpS/pT or R/K-XpS/pT motifs phosphorylated by Aurora kinases. Whether Plk1 and Cdk1 phosphorylates their sites with equal efficiency is, to the best of our knowledge, not known but the fact that some phosphosites in the head domain of LMN-1 are also self-priming sites clearly increases the efficiency of phosphorylation by concentrating the Plk1 kinase in the vicinity of its substrate. Accordingly, our data suggest that the LMN-1 head domain, which contains two self-priming sites, is more efficiently phosphorylated than the LMN-1 tail domain which lacks such sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the text it is stated that depletion of PLK-1 in the GFP::LMN-1 8A mutant strain exacerbates the lamina disassembly defect (Figure 3). This should not be the case if the authors had identified all relevant PLK-1 phosphorylation sites. The authors ascribe this additional effect on the lamina to the remaining seven phosphosites that were phosphorylated in their in vitro assay, but not mutated in this experiment. Since these seven additional phosphosites have not been shown to be phosphorylated by PLK-1 in previous studies in vivo studies, one might wonder whether the exacerbation of the lamina disassembly effect can be ascribed to something other than these 15 putative phosphosites. In order to exclude this possibility, it would have been helpful to analyze a 15A mutant. In any case, the effect of PLK-1 depletion in the mutant worm is most striking after anaphase onset. The authors should discuss this observation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a very important point. We are in the process of generating <italic>C. elegans</italic> lines to address this important issue. We now emphasize this point in the Discussion as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1 shows that Plk1 can efficiently phosphorylate lamin on several sites. However, the figure lacks data that would allow a relative comparison of how efficient and specific this phosphorylation really is.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above Figure 1 shows that the LMN-1 head is more efficiently phosphorylated than the LMN-1 tail domain.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers support the publication of your paper in principle but they, and the editor, are disappointed that you made little effort to address the specificity of the in vitro kinase assays that was a major concern for all the reviewers. Please address this point with new data in your revision. You should also provide a control – treated compared to untreated – for Figure 5C.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concerns of the reviewers that our in vitro kinase assay may suffer from a lack of specificity but we believe that we have included the appropriate controls in these in vitro experiments. To summarize, we show that PLK-1 phosphorylates GST-LMN-1 fragments but not GST (control) on multiple PLK-1 consensus sites and that mutation of these sites eliminates phosphorylation by PLK-1 in vitro. In addition, we show that LMN-1 contains functional polo-docking sites, which is the signature of PLK-1 substrates.</p><p>To try to address the concerns of the reviewers, we have tested whether other mitotic kinases, including Aurora A or Cyclin B-Cdk1, can phosphorylate the LMN-1 head domain. As a control, we have used a fragment of Bora (Bora<sup>1-224</sup>), which is known to be phosphorylated by Cyclin B-Cdk1 and Aurora A kinases. As shown in the revised Figure 1 supplement 1B, PLK-1, but not Cyclin B-Cdk1 or Aurora A, induced a mobility shift of GST-LMN-1 head on Phos-tag gels. As a positive control, we show that both Cyclin B-Cdk1 and Aurora A induced a mobility shift of Bora<sup>1-224</sup> in these conditions. These data indicate that PLK-1, but not Aurora A or Cyclin B-Cdk1, phosphorylates the LMN-1 head. We hope that these new experiments address the concerns of the reviewers. We cite these results as follows:</p><p>“In a similar assay, the other mitotic kinases Aurora A and Cyclin B-Cdk1 failed to induce a mobility shift of GST-LMN-1 [H] (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B) indicating that PLK-1, but not these other mitotic kinases, phosphorylates LMN-1 in vitro, possibly at multiple residues.”</p><p>“….lamins in nematodes, do not harbor any Cdk S/T-P motifs in the head or in the tail domains (Figure 2A). Proline residues, highlighted in red in the protein sequence alignment presented in Figure 2A, are strikingly absent in the head and tail domains of lamins from nematodes, consistent with the observation that Cyclin B-Cdk1 failed to phosphorylate GST-LMN-1[H] (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B).”</p><p>It was also requested that we perform EM analysis of Lamin filaments after treatment with PLK-1. We now provide in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 additional EM images of LMN-1 filaments untreated (+ Mg/ATP, left panels) versus treated with PLK-1 (+ Mg/ATP PLK-1, right panels). We present images taken at different magnifications. Whereas a dense network of LMN-1 filaments was visible in the untreated condition, the network was no longer detectable in the treated sample, even though some small LMN-1 filaments were visible, which agrees with the biochemical data presented Figure 5D, indicating that part of LMN-1 remains insoluble after treatment with the PLK-1 kinase.</p><p>We cite these observations as follows:</p><p>“To corroborate these observations, we used electron microscopy to examine LMN-1 filaments 40 min after incubation with PLK-1. In the absence of PLK-1, a dense meshwork of LMN-1 filaments was detectable but this network was no longer visible in the presence of PLK-1 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Taken together, these results indicate that LMN-1 phosphorylation by PLK-1 promotes lamina disassembly in vitro.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
