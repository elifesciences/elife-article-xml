critical growth factor involved in the maturation of the CNS, including neuronal morphology and synapse refinement. Herein, we demonstrate astrocytes express high levels of BDNF’s receptor, TrkB (in the top 20 of protein-coding transcripts), with nearly exclusive expression of the truncated isoform, TrkB.T1, which peaks in expression during astrocyte morphological maturation. Using a novel culture paradigm, we show that astrocyte morphological complexity is increased in the presence of BDNF and is dependent upon BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling. Deletion of TrkB.T1, globally and astrocyte-specifically, in mice revealed morphologically immature astrocytes with significantly reduced volume, as well as dysregulated expression of perisynaptic genes associated with mature astrocyte function. Indicating a role for functional astrocyte maturation via BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling, TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes do not support normal excitatory synaptogenesis or function. These data suggest a significant role for BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling in astrocyte morphological maturation, a critical process for CNS development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>astrocyte</kwd><kwd>BDNF</kwd><kwd>TrkB</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>synaptogenesis</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31NS100259</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holt</surname><given-names>Leanne M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS075062</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olsen</surname><given-names>Michelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/TrkB.T1 signaling contributes to astrocyte morphological maturation, with implications for neuronal synaptogenesis and function and astrocyte functional maturation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Astrocyte maturation is a crucial developmental process for normal CNS function. In the rodent cortex, astrocyte maturation takes place largely during the first 2–4 postnatal weeks. Importantly, this includes morphological maturation wherein immature astrocytes elaborate their processes and infiltrate the neuropil with fine, terminal, leaflet processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bushong et al., 2004</xref>). These leaflet terminals represent important functional structures, allowing cell–cell communication with neighboring astrocytes and enwrapping of synapses—where astrocytes participate in neurotransmitter uptake and synapse development and stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farhy-Tselnicker and Allen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oberheim et al., 2012</xref>). Underscoring the morphological complexity of these cells, estimates indicate a single mature rodent astrocyte encompasses between 20,000–80,000 µM<sup>3</sup> of domain space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bushong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halassa et al., 2007</xref>), associates with 300–600 neuronal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halassa et al., 2007</xref>), and contacts more than 100,000 individual synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freeman, 2010</xref>). The maturation period of astrocyte morphogenesis coincides with neuronal synaptic refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freeman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morel et al., 2014</xref>) and differential expression of key genes associated with mature astrocyte functions, such as <italic>Slc1a2</italic> (Glt1), <italic>Kcnj10</italic> (Kir4.1), and <italic>Aq4</italic> (Aqp4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clarke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Molofsky and Deneen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Molofsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nwaobi et al., 2014</xref>). While the time course of astrocyte morphogenesis is well defined, few studies have attempted to identify molecular signals guiding astrocyte morphogenesis and maturation. To date, three mechanisms have been identified: Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)/Heartless signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stork et al., 2014</xref>), glutamate/mGluR5 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morel et al., 2014</xref>), and contact-mediated neurexin/neuroligin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stogsdill et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a critical growth factor in the development, maturation, and maintenance of the CNS. Its role in neuronal cell growth, differentiation, morphology, and synaptogenesis via TrkB receptor signaling is well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Autry and Monteggia, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fenner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park and Poo, 2013</xref>). In the CNS, TrkB has two main isoforms. The full-length receptor, TrkB.FL, possesses a tyrosine kinase domain that autophosphorylates with BDNF binding, and a truncated receptor, TrkB.T1. While TrkB.T1 lacks the canonical tyrosine kinase domain, BDNF binding to this receptor is thought to signal through a RhoGTPase inhibitor and the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deinhardt and Chao, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fenner, 2012</xref>). Dysregulation of BDNF/TrkB signaling has been implicated in multiple neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolaños and Nestler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Merighi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park and Poo, 2013</xref>). However, a role for BDNF in the developmental maturation of astrocytes has not been investigated.</p><p>Here for the first time we demonstrate that <italic>Ntrk2</italic>, the gene that encodes BDNF’s receptor is highly enriched in astrocytes during the critical period of astrocyte morphological maturation. RNA sequencing and qPCR reveal that in vivo astrocytes predominately express the truncated TrkB (TrkB.T1) receptor. TrkB.T1 receptor expression mediates increased astrocyte morphological complexity in response to BDNF in vitro, and TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes in vivo remain morphologically immature with significantly reduced cell volumes and morphological complexity. TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes exhibit dysregulation of genes associates with perisynaptic mature astrocyte function. Importantly, astrocyte-specific conditional knockout of TrkB.T1 also results in decreased morphological complexity. Finally, co-culture studies indicate TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes do not support normal synaptic development or function. Together, these data suggest a significant role for BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling in astrocyte morphogenesis and indicate this signaling may contribute to astrocyte regulation of neuronal synapse development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Astrocytes express high levels of truncated TrkB.T1 mRNA</title><p>RNA sequencing was performed on cortical astrocytes that were acutely isolated from late juvenile (PND 28) mice via magnetic separation (n = 5 replicates) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holt and Olsen, 2016</xref>).

QPCR analysis of total and isoform-specific <italic>Ntrk2</italic> mRNA expression indicated total TrkB (primer detects both isoforms, gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) was most highly expressed in astrocytes, relative to neurons or microglia.

We next assessed TrkB isoform-specific expression across astrocyte development. QPCR analysis indicated low expression of the full length receptor regardless of time point. In contrast, expression of the truncated receptor was highest during the juvenile period (PND 28, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) relative to young (PND 8) and adult (PND 60) astrocytes when total availability of BDNF peaks in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Intriguingly, this time period correlates with the height of astrocyte morphological maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Novel serum-free primary astrocyte cultures</title><p>To test a direct effect of BDNF/TrkB on astrocyte morphogenesis we turned to a novel in vitro astrocyte culture system.

Notably, culturing astrocytes in serum free media resulted in 3.43-fold more complex astrocyte as assessed by Shape Index of GFAP immunostained cells (t (198)=13.39, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). A cumulative frequency analysis was performed to account for the large range in the datasets, and demonstrates a significant right shift in serum-free astrocytes (D = 0.75; p&lt;0.001). We additionally utilized a combination of Glast and Ezrin immunocytochemistry to demarcate both the membrane (Glast) and the fine, peripheral processes (Ezrin) in subsequent experiments. Glast—a membrane localized glutamate transporter—is highly expressed in astrocyte populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kondo et al., 1995</xref>) and Ezrin—a member of the ERM protein family—links the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton, and has been previously demonstrated to be localized to peripheral astrocyte processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Derouiche and Frotscher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lavialle et al., 2011</xref>). The visualization and quantification of astrocyte membrane, which accounts for upwards of 85% of in vivo astrocytic volume, results in more physiologically relevant information. Unsurprisingly, comparison of Shape index quantification from membrane (Glast) staining revealed a 1.5 fold increased cellular complexity relative to intermediate filaments (GFAP) staining, (t(164) = 4.183, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>BDNF induces an increase in astrocyte morphological complexity</title><p>Given the high levels of astrocytic TrkB expression during a period of astrocyte morphological maturation we next evaluated a role for BDNF on astrocyte morphology.

Wildtype cortical neurons were again cultured from p0/1 mouse pups and allowed 3–5 days to recover, with subsequent plating of WT or .T1 KO astrocytes on top.

In fact, the number of synapses did not differ from neurons cultured alone (F(2,38) = 2.8939; p=0.6069). Effects on synaptic function were also assessed. We utilized whole-cell patch-clamp to record miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC) in co-cultured neurons between 11–14 DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). In comparison to neurons co-cultured with WT astrocytes, neurons co-cultured with .T1 KO astrocytes demonstrated a reduced frequency (KS = 0.0456; p&lt;0.001; n = 21 cells WT, n = 24 cells KO from N = 3 cultures; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) but increased amplitude (KS = 0.116; p&lt;0.0001; n = 21 cells WT, n = 24 cells KO from N = 3 cultures; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). These studies suggest, at least in a simple model system, TrkB.T1 astrocytes do not support normal excitatory synaptic development and function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Astrocytes lacking TrkB.T1 receptor are unable to support neuronal synaptogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of neurons cultured in the presence of none, wildtype, or TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes.

Within cortical astrocytes, TrkB.T1 receptor expression is in the top 20 of all protein-coding transcripts, with the highest expression during astrocyte morphological refinement. We developed and utilized a novel astrocyte culture paradigm to demonstrate that BDNF induces an increase in astrocyte morphological complexity, which is dependent upon the TrkB.T1 receptor. Importantly, in vivo astrocyte morphology is less complex with loss of the TrkB.T1 receptor in both global and astrocyte-specific murine models. In particular, the lack of TrkB.T1 prevented normal morphogenesis during the time of astrocyte morphological refinement, between PND 14 and PND 28 and in fact persisted into adulthood (PND 50), indicating BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling contributes to astrocyte morphological maturation. Additionally, loss of the TrkB.T1 receptor in astrocytes resulted in aberrant expression of genes associated with mature astrocyte functions that are known to be developmentally regulated. Furthermore, BDNF signaling onto astrocytes appears to have consequences on neuronal synapse development, with decreased numbers and aberrant function of excitatory synapses in neurons co-cultured with TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes. These findings have broad implications, given the wealth of neurological disorders within which BDNF and, increasingly more often, astrocytes are implicated.</p><p>BDNF’s role in CNS growth and maturation has been intensely studied, with a particular emphasis on the full length receptor and neuronal function. Here, we demonstrate that astrocytes express the highest levels of <italic>Ntrk2</italic> over other CNS cellular populations. Others have demonstrated that astrocytes express TrkB.T1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ohira et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rose et al., 2003</xref>). Prior to our work, however, TrkB receptor isoform expression in astrocytes across development and maturation was unknown. We therefore utilized a magnetic separation technique to isolate cortical astrocytes from young, juvenile, and adult animals. RNASequencing and qPCR analysis revealed that astrocytes predominately express the truncated TrkB.T1 isoform and intriguingly that TrkB.T1 demonstrated developmentally regulated expression. In particular, the highest expression of TrkB.T1 was found in juvenile (PND 28) animals. Indeed, RNASequencing in juvenile astrocytes revealed that TrkB expression is within the top 20 most highly expressed genes. In addition, we demonstrate that astrocytes express the highest levels of BDNF’s receptor, TrkB, relative to neuronal and microglial populations. Publicly available RNA sequencing databases corroborate our data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), and, in fact, additionally demonstrate that human astrocytes express the highest levels of <italic>Ntrk2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kelley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Truncated TrkB.T1 lacks the canonical tyrosine kinase signaling domain, and therefore has historically been presumed to act in a dominant negative capacity to prevent overactivation of BDNF signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fenner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klein et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Middlemas et al., 1994</xref>). We here have shown that BDNF induces an increase in astrocyte morphological complexity, and this effect is lost in TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes. Therefore, our data suggest an intrinsic and direct mechanism of action. Supporting this, in vivo dysfunction of astrocytic TrkB.T1 has been implicated in mediating neuropathic pain and motor dysfunction following spinal cord injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matyas et al., 2017</xref>). BDNF application to cultured astrocytes resulted in a PLCy-IP3R mediated rise in calcium with kinetics different from cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rose et al., 2003</xref>). Additionally, the TrkB.T1 receptor has been found to co-immunoprecipitate with a RhoGTPase inhibitor, RhoGDIa in primary astrocyte cultures, and inhibition of RhoA increased the area occupied by cultured astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ohira et al., 2005</xref>). Given RhoGTPases’s known roles in regulating astrocytic cytoskeletal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zeug et al., 2018</xref>), this presents a potential mechanism by which BDNF increases astrocyte morphological complexity in astrocytes. A potential interaction and/or regulation of RhoGTPases by TrkB.T1 may also offer insight into the BDNF dose-specific response we observed in cultured astrocytes. Time and dose dependent effects have been observed for many BDNF/TrkB.FL downstream signaling mediators, including phosphorylation of CREB, ERK, and Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cunha et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mamounas et al., 2000</xref>), leading to alterations in neuronal cell survival, axonal sprouting, and enhancement or deficits to learning and memory behaviors (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kowiański et al., 2018</xref>). To date, this has not been examined specifically for TrkB.T1. If TrkB.T1 mediates astrocyte morphological complexity via inhibition of RhoGTPases, then too little (10 ng/ml) or too much (100 ng/ml) inhibition could result in no discernible change in astrocyte morphology. Future work aimed at determining the primary downstream signaling pathways of TrkB.T1 are needed to elucidate the dose dependent changes in astrocyte morphology we observed. It is unclear how BDNF is processed by astrocytes following binding to TrkB.T1. However, our data suggest TrkB.T1 plays an active, direct role in astrocyte biology.</p><p>Little is known regarding the mechanisms governing astrocyte morphogenesis and maturation. Thus far, three mechanisms have been identified. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, FGF signaling through the Heartless receptor determines astrocyte domain size and infiltration into the neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stork et al., 2014</xref>). Pharmacological and genetic manipulations of mGluR5 in astrocytes reduced the developmental increase in astrocytic volume between PND 14 and 21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morel et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, loss of neuroligins in astrocytes and/or their neuronal neurexin partner reduced astrocyte morphogenesis in the visual cortex by PND 21. Based on our findings, we propose BDNF signaling through truncated TrkB.T1 receptor as another mediator of astrocyte morphological maturation. Similar to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stogsdill et al., 2017</xref>), we found that wildtype astrocytes exhibited a 1.75-fold increase in volume during astrocyte morphological maturation. However, TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes did not exhibit normal morphogenesis. No difference in astrocyte volume between PND 14 and PND 28 in TrkB.T1 KO animals was found, and we only observed an increase in .T1 KO astrocyte complexity at PND 50. However, there is still a roughly 40% decrease in increased complexity compared to WT astrocytes between PND 14 and 50, indicative of a failure to properly undergo morphogenesis and maturation. In fact, at PND 28 there is a 30% decrease in astrocyte volume compared to mature wildtype littermates, which persists in PND 50 animals.</p><p>We did not observe a difference in astrocyte number by stereological microscopy across the motor cortex, nor did we observe a difference in cortical motor thickness. Sox9<sup>+</sup> astrocytes represented a mere 12% of total DAPI<sup>+</sup> cells in this region. Our observed difference in volume at PND 28 was ~30%, given the small number of astrocytes relative to total number of cells this change may not result in measurable differences in overall cortical volume. While not influencing overall cortical volume, the difference in astrocyte complexity may impact astrocyte infiltration into the neuropil, enwrapment of synapses and neuronal function. Future work using EM, specifically in the astrocyte specific knock out are needed to address this question. It should be noted that the global TrkB.T1 knock out animals demonstrate anxiety like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carim-Todd et al., 2009</xref>). Studies in astrocyte specific TrkB.T1 KO are needed to determine if loss of TrkB.T1 in astrocytes contribute to this aberrant behavior.</p><p>Of note, in cultured astrocytes, control-TrkB.T1 KO astrocyte complexity did not differ in comparison to control-WT astrocytes, and we observed a reduced complexity in the. T1 KO astrocytes only following exposure to BDNF. While in vitro work allows for the specific manipulation of the cell culture media, it also removes cells from the influence of other CNS cell populations. The loss of signaling molecules from other cells, in this context the lack of BDNF present in the media, may explain our data. This assertion is also supported by our TrkB-Fc scavenge experiments whereby removal of BDNF from the culture media prevented the increase in astrocyte morphological complexity. Additionally, in co-culture experiments, TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes co-cultured with WT neurons exhibited a decreased complexity compared to WT astrocytes co-cultured with WT neurons. Of note, it is well characterized that neurons exert many effects on astrocytes. In fact, all of the three thus identified mechanisms governing astrocyte morphological maturation involve neuron-astrocyte communication.</p><p>An important limitation is the utilization of a global TrkB.T1 knockout mouse model to assess in vivo astrocyte morphology. We therefore devised three experiments to test astrocyte-specific TrkB.T1 contribution to astrocyte morphological complexity. First, we demonstrated that TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes exhibit decreased complexity compared to WT astrocytes in the presence of WT neurons. Second, we used an astrocyte-specific AAV to drive cre recombinase activity specifically in astrocytes in TrkB.T1 floxed mice. Importantly, we also expressed a control AAV driving only the tdTomato fluorescent reporter in these animals. We found that only the Egfp<sup>+</sup>-Cre astrocytes from TrkB.T1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals exhibited a change in astrocyte complexity, specifically a 20% decrease, in comparison to WT Egfp<sup>+</sup>-Cre astrocytes. Within the same animals, there was no difference in complexity of the control, tdTom<sup>+</sup> astrocytes. Finally, we generated an astrocyte specific conditional knockout mouse model. Utilization of the Aldh1l1-creERT2 mouse line allows for temporal and spatial control of TrkB.T1 expression in astrocytes. We injected animals with TAM between PND 8–11 in order to examine astrocyte morphogenesis. We indeed saw a significant decrease in astrocyte complexity in the cKOs compared to cWT littermates at PND 28. Together, our data indicate that BDNF/TrkB.T1 plays an important role in normal astrocyte morphogenesis and may act as a mediator of astrocyte morphological maturation.</p><p>Peripheral astrocyte processes (PAPs) are dramatically increased in complexity during the morphological refinement phase, and facilitate many known astrocyte biological functions. We therefore examined expression of known PAP-targeted genes associated with mature astrocyte function. TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes demonstrated decreased mRNA expression of Kir4.1, Glt1, and Aq4 in juvenile (PND 28) mice. Noteworthy, these genes are known to be developmentally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Furuta et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nwaobi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Regan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wen et al., 1999</xref>). Another astrocytic PAP gene, <italic>Gja1</italic> (Cx43), did not change in expression. Interestingly, although Cx43 is associated with mature astrocyte function, previous work demonstrates mRNA expression stabilizes after PND 15 in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aberg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iacobas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prime et al., 2000</xref>). Importantly, in our astrocyte-specific TrkB.T1 conditional KO mice we found the same gene expression changes. This suggests that BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling may regulate a specific set of genes in astrocytes, however, future work is needed to elucidate the exact mechanism.</p><p>Astrocytes actively contribute to synaptogenesis through release of astrocyte derived factors such as hevin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kucukdereli et al., 2011</xref>), thrombospondins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christopherson et al., 2005</xref>), SPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kucukdereli et al., 2011</xref>), and glypicans 4/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2012</xref>). Astrocyte enwrapment of synapses is additionally known to be regulated by neuronal activity, and can stabilize synapses following LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernardinelli et al., 2014</xref>). As TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes demonstrate decreased morphological complexity, we additionally investigated how BDNF signaling onto astrocytes may impact neuronal synapse number and function. To this end, we developed a novel astrocyte-neuron co-culture paradigm. Utilization of MAC sorting technique allows for separation and subsequent combination of different cellular subtypes, genotypes, and ages within cultures. We posit that this technique will be useful to many for investigations of cell-to-cell communication. We found neurons cultured in the presence of .T1 KO astrocytes exhibited decreased numbers of excitatory post-synaptic elements and an overall reduction in numbers of co-localized pre and post-synaptic puncta. We additionally found aberrant synaptic function of neurons co-cultured with .T1 KO astrocytes, with a decrease in frequency but increase in the amplitude of mEPSCs. This is particularly interesting as previous work demonstrated no change in basal synaptic transmission or LTP in the hippocampus, but found decreased neuronal arborization in the amygdala and anxiety-like behavior in 8 week old global TrkB.T1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carim-Todd et al., 2009</xref>). We utilized cortical neurons and astrocytes for all experiments, and future investigations are needed to determine regional specificity of BDNF/TrkB.T1 effects on astrocytes. The decreased frequency of mEPSCs observed is consistent with the decreased synapse number found in neurons co-cultured with .T1 KO astrocytes. We additionally observed an increase in mEPSC amplitude, which could result from increased AMPAR currents or increased pre-synaptic vesicular loading. Additionally, increased mEPSC amplitude is associated with synaptic scaling in response to reduced activity, and we demonstrate a concomitant reduction in the number of synapses and frequency of mEPSC. Similar patterns of synaptic dysfunction were found in hippocampal slice mEPSCs of neurodevelopmental disorder Rett Syndrome, with right shifted cumulative probabilities in both frequency and amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calfa et al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, aberrant BDNF expression and dysfunctional astrocytes are well characterized in Rett. Future work is needed to determine the mechanism of increased amplitude.</p><p>We demonstrated that scavenging BDNF from the media within an hour of exposure prevented the increase in cellular complexity 24 hr later, suggesting that BDNF must be actively present to elicit an increase in astrocyte morphological complexity. This experiment is particularly interesting given that following synaptogenesis, BDNF secretion from neurons is largely targeted to synaptic zones and is secreted in an activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park and Poo, 2013</xref>). While outside of the scope of this paper, the influence of BDNF on astrocyte morphological complexity may indeed extend into activity-dependent maintenance of astrocyte morphology and enwrapment of synapses. One study suggests that this may indeed occur, as siRNA knockdown of TrkB.T1 in adult rats leads to decreased ability of cortical astrocytes to modulate their morphology in response to neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ohira et al., 2007</xref>). These results also highlight that BDNF may be necessary for the maintenance of astrocyte morphology in adulthood.</p><p>Here we demonstrate BDNF’s receptor, TrkB.T1, is highly enriched in cortical astrocytes, particularly during the period of astrocyte morphological maturation, and that BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling in astrocytes plays a critical role in astrocyte morphogenesis and may play a role in proper astrocyte maturation. Furthermore, proper neuronal synaptogenesis was lost with deletion of the TrkB.T1 receptor in astrocytes. Our studies suggest that BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling is a novel unexplored pathway in the role of astrocytes in synapse development. Given the role of aberrant synapse development in neurological dysfunction, our results herein suggest astrocyte BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders in which BDNF signaling is implicated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background(<italic>M. musculus</italic>, male)</td><td>Wildtype; WT</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods, Animals section</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background(<italic>M. musculus</italic>, male)</td><td>TrkB.T1 KO;.

Oligodendrocytes were eluted from the LS column after three washes, with 5 mL buffer and the supplied plunger. Microglia were isolated next, with a 10 min incubation with 15 µL Cd11b+ microbeads. Cells were applied to a prepped LS column, and washed 3x. As before, all flow through was collected and utilized to isolate the next cellular population. Microglia were eluted from the LS column after three washes, with 5 mL buffer and the supplied plunger. Astrocytes were subsequently isolated as described above. Finally, neuronal populations were isolated using Neuronal isolation kit. The flow through was again collected and used to isolate neurons utilizing Miltenyi Biotec’s Neuron Isolation Kit. The cell suspension was incubated with 20 µL biotinylated antibodies for 10 min at 4°C, followed by a 15 min incubation with 20 µL anti-biotin microbeads. Cells were applied to a prepped LD column.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a guest Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marc Freeman (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Please aim to submit the revised version within two months. If you feel this is an unrealistic amount of work for 2 months, please send back within a week an action plan that outlines what you consider reasonable revisions and the editors and reviewers will discuss it.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors report a role for BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling in astrocyte morphogenesis and morphological complexity. The authors show data that loss of TrkB.T1 impacts astrocyte maturation and dysregulates expression of genes involved in astrocyte function. Additionally, the authors show astrocytes lacking TrkB.T1 do not support normal synaptogenesis. Key data supporting their model includes astrocyte-specific expression of TrkB.T1 in vitro and in vivo, a developmental upregulation of TrkB.T1, KO data in vitro and in vivo supporting a role for TrkB.T1 in promoting astrocyte morphological complexity (as well as Fc-depletion of BDNF), changes in the expression of key astrocyte functional genes, and a reduced capacity of these astrocytes to promote post-synaptic development. The three reviewers and the reviewing editor all found the data convincing and experiments well conducted. However, they also agreed that to fully support the claims of this study, additional electrophysiological and in vivo data are required. Moreover, the reviewers pointed out several necessary clarifications and textual edits to ensure that the data presented and the conclusions drawn from the are in line.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Major concerns to be addressed during revision:</p><p>1) Electrophysiological analyses are needed to confirm the claim that loss of TrkB in astrocytes alters the ability of astrocytes to induce synapse formation and enhance synaptic function in vitro.</p><p>2) The decrease in astrocyte volume/complexity in TrkB.T KO mice in vivo requires more investigation. Is this difference maintained in later ages? Does it lead to reduced neuropil infiltration by astrocytes and/or generation of more astrocytes due to reduced territory sizes? For example, is there still a deficit in astrocyte volume at older ages, such as P60, when astrocyte volume has stabilized (see Morel et al., 2014)? If the volume of all astrocytes in the cortex is decreased, this would predict that there is now an increase in the volume of the extracellular space. If so, this would be expected to have a significant impact on neuronal activity, for example by altering potassium uptake and neurotransmitter recycling. Are the mice reported to show any behaviors that would correlate with this, for example seizures? Alternatively, are there more astrocytes in the KO cortex that fill in the space? This could be quantified by counting the number of <italic>Sox9</italic> positive nuclei in the KO and WT (see Sun et al., Journal Neuroscience, 2017).</p><p>3) A key limitation of the study is the utilization of a global TrkB.T1 knockout mouse. In order to draw conclusions on the role of this protein in astrocytes in vivo, the authors should manipulate TrkBT1 expression only in astrocytes and test the effects on astrocyte morphogenesis. Targeting of astrocytes for gene manipulation by viral or electroporation approaches provide the means for doing this without the need for generating conditional KOs. So, we believe this experiment can be conducted within a reasonable time frame during revisions.</p><p>4) The data provided is not strong enough to firmly link impaired synaptogenic signaling by sparcl1 and sparc signaling to the phenotypes associated with loss of TrkB in astrocytes. We ask the authors to remove these experiments or conduct new experiments that will causally link sparcl1/sparc-signaling as a potential mechanism. However, the authors should also consider that astrocytes secrete a number of synapse modulating proteins and those may also be at play here. They should be able to rule them in or out before landing on sparcl1 and sparc. But we also agreed that this may be beyond the scope of one study. Therefore, it is recommended that you focus on the top three points in the revisions and leave this aspect for future research.</p><p>Textual Clarifications/Changes Required:</p><p>1) It is difficult to understand exactly how astrocyte complexity was quantified. Please provide more clarity on this point. It is hard to tell from the images how dramatic the change is with BDNF manipulation. This is difficult to do, but is a key part of the study.</p><p>2) Claims to 'first time' and 'novelty' should be avoided. For example, the last paragraph of the Introduction states this is the first time the TrkB receptor has been detected in astrocytes, however there are many reports of this in the literature e.g. Rose et al., 2003, Ohira et al., 2005, Ohira et al., 2007, Matyas et al., 2017. Further, in two of these papers a role for truncated TrkB in regulating astrocyte morphology in vitro and in brain slices (fine process motility) was investigated (Ohira et al., 2005 and 2007). While we appreciate the current study uses a more physiological astrocyte model (serum free culture, postnatal astrocyte isolation), and is looking at overall astrocyte growth during postnatal maturation, the 'first time' and 'novelty' claims cannot be supported due to these earlier studies.</p><p>3) The utilization of a global TrkB.T1 knockout mouse does not allow support for the claim &quot;the majority effects within the global TrkB.T1 KO mouse may be attributable to astrocytes.&quot; In cortical circuit development, neuron generation happens before astrocyte generation, which is a quite different from the cell-specific astrocyte culture system employed in this study. Using cell-specific astrocyte cultures, the authors assessed the impact of TrkB.T1 on astrocytes, however it does not necessarily represent the systemic effects of TrkB.T1 on astrocytes. Please carefully go through the manuscript to ensure that no overarching comments that cannot be fully supported by the experiments conducted are present.</p><p>4) Related to the point raised above, the authors show impairments of morphological maturation of astrocytes in the TrkB.T1 KO mouse compared to that in WT mouse in vivo; however, the impact of morphological complexity demonstrated in TrkB.T1 KO astrocyte cultures only occurred under external BDNF application. This is an important point that is not addressed and may suggest various processes are in play. Please discuss/clarify.</p><p>5) In the WT astrocyte cultures (Figure 2), the enhancement of TrkB.T1 mRNA expression was detected at DIV14; however, the astrocyte morphological complexity in TrkB WT and TrkB.T1 KO astrocyte cultures had no difference under the control treatment at the same DIV14 (Figure 3). The authors should comment on this point. Moreover, in separate experiments the authors assessed synaptic development 5 days after seeding WT or TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes on the top of neurons (Figure 5). Given the various timeframes examined and the varying results, it is difficult to conclude that the impact of excitatory synaptic development measured at DIV8-9 in Figure 5 resulted from astrocytes lacking TrkB.T1 in their co-culture experiment. Explain the differences between the timelines utilized between different experiments.</p><p>6) It is mentioned in the Discussion that both excitatory and inhibitory synapses were affected, with TrkB manipulation in astrocytes, but only data for excitatory synapses is shown. Please correct this error.</p><p>7) The authors collected samples from neurons, astrocytes or microglia at various time points, but the indication of the expression of RNA or protein at these time points were unclear in the figures and figure legends. Please label the time points on the figure or make a developmental timeline and pinpoint the time window for each experiment in each figure.</p><p>8) There should be some discussion as to why BDNF only has an effect on astrocyte morphology at 30ng/ml, and not 100ng/ml. Is BDNF acting through the truncated TrkB receptor known to have a bell-shaped dose response?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44667.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Major concerns to be addressed during revision:</p><p>1) Electrophysiological analyses are needed to confirm the claim that loss of TrkB in astrocytes alters the ability of astrocytes to induce synapse formation and enhance synaptic function in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.

We have broken the reviewer comments into separate sections in order to clearly address each point.</p><p>A) Change in astrocyte morphological complexity at later ages.</p><p>We agree that this is an important question. We have now included astrocyte morphological complexity analysis at PND 50 (Morel, 2014) in Figure 4. These data demonstrate a significant 20% reduction in astrocyte morphological complexity at P50.</p><p>B) Change in extracellular space / astrocyte number as compensation.</p><p>The reviewers bring up a very interesting point. As suggested, we performed stereological microscopy to determine the number of astrocytes and neurons in the TrkB.T1 KO mice. We have included new experimental analysis of astrocyte cell numbers as suggested by the reviewer and included the following in the Discussion:</p><p>“We did not observe a difference in astrocyte number by stereological microscopy across the motor cortex, nor did we observe a difference cortical motor thickness. […] Studies in astrocyte specific TrkB.T1 KO are needed to determine if loss of TrkB.T1 in astrocytes contribute to this aberrant behavior.”</p><p>Additionally, we have found no publications investigating seizure susceptibility in the TrkB.T1 KO mice, and little investigation of neuronal activity in this model. However, published reports (Carim-Todd, 2009) demonstrate that the mice do exhibit behaviors associated with increased anxiety. We feel that the susceptibility of the mice to seizures is outside of the scope of this manuscript, however behavioral assessment in the conditional-TrkB.T1 KO mouse we have generated are an area we plan to investigate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A key limitation of the study is the utilization of a global TrkB.T1 knockout mouse. In order to draw conclusions on the role of this protein in astrocytes in vivo, the authors should manipulate TrkBT1 expression only in astrocytes and test the effects on astrocyte morphogenesis. Targeting of astrocytes for gene manipulation by viral or electroporation approaches provide the means for doing this without the need for generating conditional KOs. So, we believe this experiment can be conducted within a reasonable time frame during revisions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We agree with the reviewers that the utilization of the global TrkB.T1 KO model is a key limitation to the study, and that astrocyte-specific loss of TrkB.T1 in an otherwise normal environment is an important experiment. We therefore performed three experiments in parallel, presented in a new Figure 5, to address this concern. These data unambiguously indicate that the loss of TrkB.T1 in astrocytes alone is sufficient to result in reduced astrocyte morphological complexity. We have outlined the experiments and findings below:</p><p>A) We assessed the complexity of astrocyte morphology from WT and TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes co-cultured with WT neurons. Using both Glast to demarcate the membrane (and therefore total astrocyte complexity) and Gfap to demarcate the processes, we found that TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes demonstrated decreased morphological complexity in comparison to WT astrocytes.</p><p>B) We utilized viral-mediated Cre-recombinase to knockdown TrkB.T1 specifically in astrocytes. Using a previously generated TrkB.T1 floxed mouse line and our ICV injection paradigm, WT and. T1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were co-injected with an astrocyte-specific AAV driving Cre recombinase with an EGFP florescent reporter and a control astrocyte-specific AAV driving only a tdTomato fluorescent reporter. Astrocyte morphology was assessed in both egfp<sup>+</sup>(Cre) and tdtom<sup>+</sup>(control) astrocytes in both WT and.T1fl/fl mice. Egfp+(Cre+) astrocytes from. T1fl/fl animals exhibited decreased volume compared to Egfp+(cre+) WT astrocytes. Importantly, we found no difference between tdtom+(control).T1fl/fl and WT astrocytes.</p><p>C) We generated an astrocyte-specific TrkB.T1 knockout model. Using the same TrkB.T1 floxed line as above, we crossed these mice to astrocyte targeted Aldh1l1-CreERT2 mice. Following tamoxifen injections between P8-11, we found loss of the TrkB.T1 receptor specifically in astrocytes. Animals were injected with the AAV2/5 Gfap-egfp virus, TAM injected, and astrocyte morphology assessed. We again found decreased astrocyte complexity in the cKO animals compared to cWT littermates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The data provided is not strong enough to firmly link impaired synaptogenic signaling by sparcl1 and sparc signaling to the phenotypes associated with loss of TrkB in astrocytes. We ask the authors to remove these experiments or conduct new experiments that will causally link sparcl1/sparc-signaling as a potential mechanism. However, the authors should also consider that astrocytes secrete a number of synapse modulating proteins and those may also be at play here. They should be able to rule them in or out before landing on sparcl1 and sparc. But we also agreed that this may be beyond the scope of one study. Therefore, it is recommended that you focus on the top three points in the revisions and leave this aspect for future research.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. As the reviewers suggested, we have removed the sparcl/sparc data from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Textual Clarifications/Changes Required:</p><p>1) It is difficult to understand exactly how astrocyte complexity was quantified. Please provide more clarity on this point. It is hard to tell from the images how dramatic the change is with BDNF manipulation. This is difficult to do, but is a key part of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this highlighting this ambiguity in the manuscript. We have added the following sentence to the Results section clarify how the Shape Index quantifies cellular complexity.</p><p>“We utilized the Shape Index (SI) to examine in vitro astrocyte complexity; this equation, given as perimeter<sup>2</sup>/area – 4π, relates area and perimeter of a cell to a circle such that a perfect circle receives an SI of 0, and increasingly complex cells have correspondingly larger SI values.”</p><p>Analysis of shape index data indicate a &gt; 2-fold increase in morphological complexity. Cumulative frequency also shows the rightward shift in morphological complexity in astrocytes treated with BDNF. The images of astrocytes presented are representative. The 30 ng BDNF image demonstrates a striking difference in astrocyte morphology compared with the 4 other images in the figure. We now provide additional images in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 with example tracing of individual astrocytes used for data analysis in Image J.</p><p> <italic>2) Claims to 'first time' and 'novelty' should be avoided. For example, the last paragraph of the Introduction states this is the first time the TrkB receptor has been detected in astrocytes, however there are many reports of this in the literature e.g. Rose et al., 2003, Ohira et al., 2005, Ohira et al., 2007, Matyas et al., 2017. Further, in two of these papers a role for truncated TrkB in regulating astrocyte morphology</italic> in vitro <italic>and in brain slices (fine process motility) was investigated (Ohira et al., 2005 and 2007). While we appreciate the current study uses a more physiological astrocyte model (serum free culture, postnatal astrocyte isolation), and is looking at overall astrocyte growth during postnatal maturation, the 'first time' and 'novelty' claims cannot be supported due to these earlier studies.</italic> </p><p>Thank you. We have carefully reviewed the manuscript and have striven to remove language that suggests incorrect novelty. However, we do feel that our data does represent novel findings in regards to TrkB receptor expression in astrocyte development. In particular, we are indeed the first examine TrkB receptor expression specifically in astrocytes across cortical development. To ensure we do not overgeneralize, we have included the following in the Discussion:</p><p>“BDNF’s role in CNS growth and maturation has been intensely studied, with a particular emphasis on the full length receptor and neuronal function. […] Publicly available RNA sequencing databases corroborate our data (Zhang et al., 2014), and, in fact, additionally demonstrate that human astrocytes express the highest levels of Ntrk2 (Kelley et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The utilization of a global TrkB.T1 knockout mouse does not allow support for the claim &quot;the majority effects within the global TrkB.T1 KO mouse may be attributable to astrocytes.&quot; In cortical circuit development, neuron generation happens before astrocyte generation, which is a quite different from the cell-specific astrocyte culture system employed in this study. Using cell-specific astrocyte cultures, the authors assessed the impact of TrkB.T1 on astrocytes, however it does not necessarily represent the systemic effects of TrkB.T1 on astrocytes. Please carefully go through the manuscript to ensure that no overarching comments that cannot be fully supported by the experiments conducted are present.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have removed this section. We have reviewed the manuscript and have striven to remove overgeneralization of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Related to the point raised above, the authors show impairments of morphological maturation of astrocytes in the TrkB.T1 KO mouse compared to that in WT mouse in vivo; however, the impact of morphological complexity demonstrated in TrkB.T1 KO astrocyte cultures only occurred under external BDNF application. This is an important point that is not addressed and may suggest various processes are in play. Please discuss/clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We agree that this is an important and complicated point. We have addressed this within the Discussion of the manuscript. We feel that our data can be explained, in part, due to the differences in in vitro and in vivo astrocytes. It is well characterized that astrocyte cultures are not fully representative of in vivo astrocytes. While many of these differences can be attributed to the presence of serum in traditional astrocyte cultures (Foo et al., 2011), culturing astrocytes in isolation also removes them from the influence of other cellular populations. The loss of various signaling molecules from other CNS populations, and in this context, the lack of BDNF present in the media, may explain why the in vitro WT and TrkB.T1 KO astrocyte morphology does not differ except under external application.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the WT astrocyte cultures (Figure 2), the enhancement of TrkB.T1 mRNA expression was detected at DIV14; however, the astrocyte morphological complexity in TrkB WT and TrkB.T1 KO astrocyte cultures had no difference under the control treatment at the same DIV14 (Figure 3). The authors should comment on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers bring up an interesting point. As mentioned in response to #4, culturing astrocytes removes them from communication with other cellular populations, and thus under control conditions the media will not contain BDNF. Under this assumption, with no stimulation from BDNF, it would be predicted that control conditions between WT and TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes would not exhibit differences in morphological complexity. Only in the presence of the TrkB.T1 receptor’s ligand, BDNF, would WT astrocytes be signaled to increase in morphological complexity. Our assertion that TrkB.T1 increases astrocyte morphological complexity only with BDNF stimulation is also supported by our TrkB-Fc scavenge data, whereby removing the exogenously applied BDNF from the media results in astrocytes with morphological complexity similar to control astrocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, in separate experiments the authors assessed synaptic development 5 days after seeding WT or TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes on the top of neurons (Figure 5). Given the various timeframes examined and the varying results, it is difficult to conclude that the impact of excitatory synaptic development measured at DIV8-9 in Figure 5 resulted from astrocytes lacking TrkB.T1 in their co-culture experiment. Explain the differences between the timelines utilized between different experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>While our data does demonstrate an upregulation of TrkB.T1 in the astrocytes at 14DIV, we feel that it is not indicative of a lack of TrkB.T1 receptor expression in 7DIV astrocytes. We highlighted this observation in the manuscript only as it is on a similar to the upregulation we found between PND 7 and PND 28 astrocytes, and thus suggests an intrinsic regulation of <italic>Ntrk2</italic> expression in astrocytes. In fact, preliminary data from our lab indicates that <italic>Ntrk2</italic> RNA expression is in the top 50 most highly expressed genes found in acutely isolated wildtype astrocytes from postnatal day 6-60. Thus, BDNF may exert effects on astrocytes across their development and maturation. We feel that the impact on excitatory synaptic development measured at DIV8-9 can only be explained by the one manipulated variable, the loss of the truncated receptor in astrocytes. However, to address this concern, we performed synaptic quantification in wildtype neurons co-cultured with astrocytes for a longer, more extended timeframe with collection at 12-14DIV. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we found the same change in excitatory synapse number. And, in fact, we found no significant difference in synaptic numbers between the two experimental designs (black: 12-14 DIV and red 8-9 DIV). We have therefore collapsed these datasets into one figure and expanded the time of collection in the manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44667-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is mentioned in the Discussion that both excitatory and inhibitory synapses were affected, with TrkB manipulation in astrocytes, but only data for excitatory synapses is shown. Please correct this error.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. This has been corrected in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors collected samples from neurons, astrocytes or microglia at various time points, but the indication of the expression of RNA or protein at these time points were unclear in the figures and figure legends. Please label the time points on the figure or make a developmental timeline and pinpoint the time window for each experiment in each figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting the ambiguity of the figure. We have updated both the figures and figure legends to make the time line of assessment more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) There should be some discussion as to why BDNF only has an effect on astrocyte morphology at 30ng/ml, and not 100ng/ml. Is BDNF acting through the truncated TrkB receptor known to have a bell-shaped dose response?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers bring up a very interesting point. To the authors’ knowledge, thus far experimental determination of a dose-response of TrkB.T1 has not been performed. The authors chose the experimental BDNF concentrations as they have been used previously to examine BDNF’s effects on cultured cellular populations. We have added the following into the Discussion section of the manuscript:</p><p>“A potential interaction and/or regulation of RhoGTPases by TrkB.T1 may also offer insight into the BDNF dose-specific response we observed in cultured astrocytes. […] However, our data suggests TrkB.T1 plays an active, direct role in astrocyte biology.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
