development. Our existing understanding of functional specialisation in the infant brain is based on evidence from unitary imaging modalities and has thus focused on isolated estimates of spatial or temporal selectivity of neural or haemodynamic activation, giving an incomplete picture. We speculate that functional specialisation will be underpinned by better coordinated haemodynamic and metabolic changes in a broadly orchestrated physiological response. To enable researchers to track this process through development, we develop new tools that allow the simultaneous measurement of coordinated neural activity (EEG), metabolic rate, and oxygenated blood supply (broadband near-infrared spectroscopy) in the awake infant. In 4- to 7-month-old infants, we use these new tools to show that social processing is accompanied by spatially and temporally specific increases in coupled activation in the temporal-parietal junction, a core hub region of the adult social brain. During non-social processing, coupled activation decreased in the same region, indicating specificity to social processing. Coupling was strongest with high-frequency brain activity (beta and gamma), consistent with the greater energetic requirements and more localised action of high-frequency brain activity. The development of simultaneous multimodal neural measures will enable future researchers to open new vistas in understanding functional specialisation of the brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group

This specialised functioning emerges across development through a combination of genetically influenced brain architecture and experience-expectant learning processes (generalised neural development that occurs as a result of common experiences) and experience-dependent (variation in the environment contributing to individual differences in neural response) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Johnson, 2001</xref>). During early development, infants undergo significant neural, physiological, and socio-cognitive changes that are accompanied by large-scale changes in social communication and interaction. Currently, we have relatively few tools that allow us to comprehensively capture the emergence of functional specialisation in the infant social brain. Developing new approaches is critical for advancing our understanding of early brain physiology and cognitive function.</p><p>Identifying appropriate metrics to index functional specialisation in the infant brain should be informed by theoretical perspectives on how functional specialisation develops. Interactive specialisation is a theory of brain development that posits that functional specialisation emerges through competition between brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Johnson, 2011</xref>). Thus, functional specialisation can be indexed as a smaller spatial extent of neural responses to a particular stimulus category and concomitant selectivity in responsive regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jones et al., 2015</xref>). Typically, the extent and selectivity of brain activation is measured through indirect indices of oxygenated blood flow (e.g. functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bale et al., 2016</xref>] or functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attwell and Iadecola, 2002</xref>]) or of coordinated neural activity (e.g. electroencephalography [EEG] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buzsáki, 2006</xref>]). However, one mechanism that may contribute to competition between brain regions is the limited energetic resources available to the infant brain. The brain is an energetically costly organ, consuming 20–25% of the body’s energy in adulthood while representing only 2% of the body’s mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Raichle and Mintun, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sokoloff, 1999</xref>). There are also substantial developmental changes in the brain’s energy consumption; in the first year of life, up to 60% of available energy is used by the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Steiner, 2019</xref>). When brain regions become functionally active (e.g. during stimulus processing) neurons fire more rapidly, requiring greater supplies of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (energy stores). Producing ATP requires oxygen, and this is supplied through a localised increase in oxygenated haemoglobin in the blood. Increases in oxygenated haemoglobin do not happen concurrently in all brain areas, and there are spatial dependencies between activated and deactivated regions in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Leech et al., 2014</xref>). Energy supplies are important to synaptic plasticity, memory, and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Vaynman et al., 2006</xref>), and the mechanism through which energy supplies are coupled to activation (neurovascular coupling, see ) also develops through experience-dependent specialisation in the infant brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kozberg and Hillman, 2016</xref>). Thus, energy supply constraints may be one factor that contributes to the emergence of brain specialisation. If this is the case, detecting functional specialisation in infancy requires not only examining measures of neural activity and oxygenated haemoglobin, but also identifying whether particular regions show stronger coupling between neuronal demand and energetic supply.</p><p>As a first step, testing such frameworks requires the availability of methods that can measure the spatial extent and stimulus selectivity of neuroenergetics coupling in infancy. Previous studies have typically used single modalities sensitive to distinct aspects of brain function. For example, studies with fMRI indicate that core regions of the social brain (particular the fusiform face area) show increases in oxygenated haemoglobin delivery in response to faces by 4–9 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kosakowski et al., 2022</xref>). Further, fNIRS studies show that oxygenated haemoglobin delivery in response to naturalistic social videos in a broad region of temporal cortex emerges over the first hours of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Farroni et al., 2013</xref>). Work with EEG indicates developmental increases in differentiated theta power responses to social versus non-social stimuli between 6 and 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jones et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, work with single modalities indicates development in functional specialisation across the first year of life.</p><p>Broadband near-infrared spectroscopy (bNIRS) is a new technique that uses a broad range of optical wavelengths which allows the measurement of the oxidation state of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (CCO), thereby providing a direct measure of cellular energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bale et al., 2016</xref>). CCO is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and serves as the terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain (ETC). It therefore accounts for 95% of cellular oxygen metabolism. In this way, bNIRS allows non-invasive measurement of cellular energy metabolism alongside haemodynamics/oxygenation in awake infants.</p><p>Work with single modalities has demonstrated that social selectivity in core regions of the adult ‘social brain’ can be robustly detected by 4–7 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grossmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lloyd-Fox et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lloyd-Fox et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lloyd‐Fox et al., 2018</xref>). We recently showed the feasibility of using bNIRS in 4- to 7-month-old typically developing infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siddiqui et al., 2021</xref>) and demonstrated the presence of unique task-relevant, regionally specific functional networks where high levels of haemodynamic and metabolic coupling were observed. Here, we integrate this methodology with EEG to examine whether specific brain regions show coordinated energetic coupling and neural activity. We develop a novel analysis pipeline to identify localised coupling responses that are modulated by naturalistic social content. We aimed specifically to investigate the relationship between low- and high-frequency neural activity with haemodynamics and metabolism. For EEG, we expected an increase in neural activity in response to the social condition and a decrease in neural activity in response to the non-social condition. Based on previous work, this was expected to be strongest in the theta frequency band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jones et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, for the combined bNIRS-EEG analyses, we hypothesised differentiated haemodynamic/metabolic coupling with neural activity for the social and non-social stimulus conditions. We performed two types of statistical tests: (a) individual comparisons of the social and non-social conditions and (b) comparison of the social condition versus the non-social condition. The individual condition tests were performed to show the scale and spatial location/sensitivity of the coupling between haemodynamics/metabolism and neural activity for each condition. Meanwhile, the social versus non-social comparison was performed to show where there was a significant difference in the coupling between the two conditions. With comparison (a) we aimed to identify regions involved in the processing of social and non-social stimuli by identifying the regions where the coupling was significant. With comparison (b) we aimed to identify regions where coupling was significantly different between conditions. We predicted that for the individual comparison of the social condition, we would observe positive associations between bNIRS and EEG measures, that is a simultaneous increase in haemodynamics/metabolism and neural oscillatory activity in the beta and gamma frequency bands (based on previous combined EEG-fMRI studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Scheeringa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scheeringa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goldman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yuan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Niessing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Koch et al., 2009</xref>) which would be localised to core social brain regions. We hypothesised that for the non-social condition, over the same brain regions, positive associations would be observed between bNIRS and EEG measures, but they would be a simultaneous decrease in haemodynamics/metabolism and oscillatory activity. We also expected simultaneous increases in haemodynamics/metabolism and oscillatory activity to be localised to the parietal brain region. These predictions are based on our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siddiqui et al., 2021</xref>) where we demonstrated that stronger coupling between haemodynamics and metabolism was observed in the temporo-parietal regions for the social condition and in parietal region for the non-social condition which is known to play an important role in object processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wilcox et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dekker et al., 2011</xref>). For the social versus the non-social contrast, we predicted that haemodynamic activity and metabolism would be coupled with neuronal oscillatory activity more strongly for the social stimuli in comparison to the non-social stimuli, with significant differences being observed in the temporo-parietal regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Naturalistic social stimuli elicit expected increases in broadband EEG activity</title><p>Five-month-old infants (n=42) viewed naturalistic social and non-social stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) while we concurrently measured EEG and broadband NIRS.

For both conditions, bNIRS-EEG coupling was consistently observed between bNIRS channel 14 and various EEG channels, which were positioned over the parietal and superior temporal sulcus-temporal parietal junction regions, respectively. For the social condition, a coupled increase in haemodynamic/metabolic activity and neural oscillatory activity was observed in the beta, gamma, and high-gamma frequency bands, which was primarily concentrated in the temporo-parietal region (e.g. bNIRS channel 14 and EEG electrodes Pz, PO4). A consistent pattern of coupling with neuronal activity was observed across chromophores particularly for the beta band. For the non-social condition, no coupling was observed between haemodynamics and neural activity (i.e. HbO<sub>2</sub> and HHb) for the low-frequency theta and alpha frequency bands. Meanwhile, a coupled increase in metabolic activity and neural activity was observed between bNIRS channel 14 and occipital and parietal EEG locations (O2, PO8, P10, P4 for the theta band and P10 for the alpha band).

Several long-range associations were also observed such as those in the beta frequency bands between bNIRS channels 12 and 13 and EEG locations TP8 and T8 respectively for the social condition for HbO<sub>2</sub> and between bNIRS channel 14 and EEG locations C2 and Cz for the non-social condition for HHb and oxCCO.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the statistical comparison of the social versus the non-social condition.

As a proof of principle, we examined the relationship between these measures to identify regional selectivity to social versus non-social stimuli. To first demonstrate the scale and spatial sensitivity of the coupling between haemodynamic/metabolic activity and neuronal oscillatory activity, comparisons were performed individually for the social and non-social conditions. For this, we predicted a simultaneous increase in haemodynamics/metabolism and neural activity in the beta and gamma frequency band. We predicted that for the social condition this would be localised to the core social brain regions (temporo-parietal region) while for the non-social condition, we expected the coupling to be localised to parietal regions, known to be involved in object processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wilcox et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dekker et al., 2011</xref>). We additionally expected a simultaneous decrease in haemodynamic/metabolic activity and neural activity over the temporo-parietal region for the non-social condition, in accordance with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siddiqui et al., 2021</xref>). Next, to demonstrate differential coupling for social and non-social stimuli, we performed a comparison of the social condition versus the non-social condition. For this, we hypothesised that in the beta and gamma frequency bands, there would be stronger coupling between haemodynamics/metabolism and neural activity for the social condition over the temporo-parietal region.</p><p>Confirming previous work, naturalistic social and non-social stimuli produce broad haemodynamic changes, with smaller spatial extent of locations with coupled haemodynamic and metabolic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siddiqui et al., 2021</xref>). We also replicated previously observed greater EEG responses to social versus non-social stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jones et al., 2015</xref>). However, examining coupling between these two phenomena uncovered a precise pattern in which specific locations in the parietal and temporo-parietal regions showed differential coupling between bNIRS-EEG for social and non-social stimuli, particularly for the beta and gamma band frequency bands, as we predicted. We contend that this approach identifies a more localised regional area with selective coordination of neural, haemodynamic, and metabolic activity. The increased localisation observed in our coupling analysis may indicate our approach provides a more rigorous measure of functional specialisation. Widespread use of this technique will accelerate our understanding of both the typically and atypically developing brain. Unexpectedly, while most associations between haemodynamic/metabolic activity and oscillatory activity were localised, we observed several long-range connections between haemodynamic/metabolic and neural signals. It has been hypothesised that long-range functional connectivity patterns are vital for the organisation of human brain structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). The strongest coupling was observed between temporo-parietal bNIRS channel 14 with parietal EEG locations Pz and PO4 for the social condition (for beta and gamma frequency bands). Meanwhile, for the non-social condition, coupling was observed between temporo-parietal bNIRS channel 14 with occipital and parietal EEG locations Oz, O2, PO8, and P10 (for theta and beta frequency bands). While an overall consistent pattern of associations across chromophores and conditions was observed, some variability was also seen, particularly across frequency bands. This was expected and in line with previous EEG-fMRI studies that have demonstrated task-dependent variation in coupling between neural and haemodynamic activity across frequency bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Scheeringa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scheeringa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goldman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yuan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Niessing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Koch et al., 2009</xref>). For example, for resting-state simultaneous fMRI and EEG, stronger coupling between the BOLD response and neural activity has been observed for the alpha band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Scheeringa et al., 2012</xref>). Meanwhile, for cognitive tasks, stronger coupling has been observed in the gamma frequency band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kucewicz et al., 2014</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Scheeringa et al., 2011</xref>, investigated trial-by-trial coupling of EEG and BOLD activity and found that low- and high-frequency bands independently contribute to explaining BOLD variance. We therefore expected the frequency band showing the strongest coupling between bNIRS and EEG for each of the stimuli to vary. Further, while we did expect and observe significant overlap in associations between chromophores within each frequency band, some variability was seen. For example, for the social condition, no associations were observed in the low-frequency bands for any of the chromophores. Moreover, in the beta frequency bands, all chromophores displayed significant associations between bNIRS channel 14 and Pz for the social condition and both HHb and oxCCO displayed significant associations between bNIRS channel 14 and O2, PO8, and C2. Similarly, in the gamma frequency bands, both HbO<sub>2</sub> and oxCCO displayed significant associations between bNIRS channel 14 and PO4. The variability that was observed between chromophores was limited mostly to the non-social condition. For example, only oxCCO displayed significant associations between bNIRS and EEG for the low-frequency theta and alpha frequency bands. It is well known that various components involved in neurovascular coupling undergo development postnatally, see the review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harris et al., 2011</xref>, for a full discussion. Briefly, there is an extensive structural change within cerebral microvasculature including growth, extension, and proliferation of new blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rowan and Maxwell, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Norman and O’Kusky, 1986</xref>). Further, studies have also demonstrated gradual development of vascular reactivity (i.e. change in vascular tone, vasoconstriction, and vasodilation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Scheeringa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scheeringa et al., 2009</xref>) which is necessary for the propagation of the NVC response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Lastly, pericytes and astrocytes which are key components of NVC are also known to undergo development in size, number, connectivity, and branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kozberg and Hillman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fujimoto, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Seregi et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Stichel et al., 1991</xref>). From the metabolic perspective, infant positron emission tomography (PET) studies demonstrate regional-specific, progressive increase in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chugani et al., 1987</xref>) while others evidence a developmental maturational change in oxidative metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kozberg and Hillman, 2016</xref>). In adults, previous research has also suggested that oxygen consumption is more spatially localised in comparison to changes in cerebral blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Malonek and Grinvald, 1996</xref>) and that oxCCO has distinct spatial distributions in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Phan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wong-Riley et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hevner et al., 1995</xref>), indicating that energy metabolism may be more spatially specific. The spatial distribution of oxCCO in different brain regions currently remains unmapped in the developing infant brain, however. Therefore, taken together, given that during early development there are extensive changes in cerebral vasculature as well as the metabolic environment and potential variability in the spatial distribution of oxCCO, it is expected that there will be some variability observed in the associations between the haemodynamics and metabolism with neural activity. In our study, we observed more consistent oxCCO-EEG associations across frequency bands and stimuli with more localised (fewer long-range) associations. Further studies with a larger sample size and longitudinal follow-up can provide a clearer view on how NVC develops in infancy which will help explain some of the observed variability. Moreover, future studies with high-density bNIRS arrays will provide clarification on the spatial distribution of oxCCO in the infant brain.</p><p>EEG profiles observed in the present study are consistent with previous studies in identifying increased gamma band activity over temporal and parieto-occipital brain regions during face processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Uono et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghuman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bayer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Müller-Bardorff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nguyen and Cunnington, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Engell and McCarthy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bossi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ishai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pelphrey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zion-Golumbic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2013</xref>). High-frequency neural firing is associated with localised processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">von Stein and Sarnthein, 2000</xref>) whilst lower-frequency activity is associated with larger-scale network changes and transfer of information across systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Canolty and Knight, 2010</xref>). The increase in lower-frequency activity during social attention also observed here and in other work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jones et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">van der Velde et al., 2021</xref>) may support larger-scale connectivity and communication of information through cross-frequency coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghuman et al., 2014</xref>). Our work further indicates that measures of metabolic load may provide important additional information in understanding localisation of brain function. Localised high-frequency activity exerts strong metabolic demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Smith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kann, 2011</xref>) and subsequent increases in oxygenated haemoglobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Niessing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goense and Logothetis, 2008</xref>). These increases in metabolic rate are supported by increased activity in the mitochondrial ETC, resulting in the changes in CCO we detected with broadband NIRS. Nitric oxide (which competes with oxygen to bind to CCO) and carbon dioxide (produced as a by-product in the ETC) are key signalling molecule in controlling neurovascular coupling and thus subsequent oxygen delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hosford and Gourine, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hosford et al., 2022</xref>). Finally, reactive oxygen species produced by the ETC are a key signal in inducing synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oswald et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, our work is consistent with a model in which social attention induces localised high-frequency brain activity in the temporal parietal junction, which increases local metabolic rates, triggering synaptic plasticity and subsequent oxygen delivery to a broader region.</p><p>Our work particularly highlights the temporal-parietal junction is showing strong coupling and social selectivity. Previous studies measuring haemodynamic activity have identified early sensitivity of this region to social stimuli from at least 4 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lloyd-Fox et al., 2017</xref>), alongside a broader network of other regions. Here, we pinpoint this specific location as having coupled neuronal, metabolic, and haemodynamic activity that is modulated in opposite directions by complex social and non-social content. In the adult brain, the temporal-parietal junction has received considerable attention and there are several competing models of its function. It has been linked to mentalising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schurz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schurz et al., 2017</xref>) and reorienting attention to behaviourally relevant stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>); it can be viewed as a nexus area where the convergence of attention, language, memory, and social processing supports a social context for behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carter and Huettel, 2013</xref>) or as a region that is active when awareness of a prediction permits attentional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wilterson et al., 2021</xref>). Intriguingly, recent formulations within the predictive coding framework link the right temporal-parietal junction to a domain-general role in prediction, perhaps representing the precision of priors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Masina et al., 2022</xref>). Predictability has been linked to energy efficiency, with some computational models showing that energy limitations are the only requirement for driving the emergence of predictive coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2021</xref>). Increases in beta/gamma have also been linked to unexpected reward processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">HajiHosseini et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together, our results may indicate the early presence of priors for social interaction that are being actively updated (in contrast to the dynamic toys, which may already be more predictable).</p><p>The methods we developed could be broadly applied to study both neurotypical and atypical brain function. Assessing coupling over developmental time may reveal the mechanisms underpinning neural specialisation and constrain theoretical frameworks seeking to explain specialisation in the adult brain. The mechanisms of neurovascular coupling remain unclear in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hosford and Gourine, 2019</xref>), and are developing in infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kozberg and Hillman, 2016</xref>), and novel multimodal and non-invasive approaches to their identification could yield significant progress. Computational models could test the role of constraints in energy supply on developing localisation of function. Further, the region identified here also shows atypical haemodynamic responsiveness in infants with later symptoms of autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lloyd‐Fox et al., 2018</xref>); since mitochondrial dysfunction has become an increasing focus in autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Siddiqui et al., 2016</xref>) the possibility that atypical coupling may impact specialisation in autism is an important hypothesis to test. Further, our methods have applicability in determining the impacts of early brain injury. Recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bale et al., 2019</xref>) measured both cerebral oxygenation and energy metabolism in neonates with brain injury (hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy) and demonstrated that the relationship between metabolism and oxygenation was able to predict injury severity. This therefore provided a clinical, non-invasive biomarker of neonatal brain injury. Indicating applicability across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vezyroglou et al., 2022</xref>) simultaneous measurements of cerebral oxygenation, metabolism, and neural activity in epilepsy revealed unique metabolic profiles for healthy brain regions in comparison to those with the regions of the epileptic focus. The work in epilepsy demonstrates the strength of combining measurements from multiple modalities to investigate brain states, particularly in clinical populations.</p><p>Our work has several limitations. We used naturalistic stimuli to maximise ecological validity; however, this reduces our ability to probe the function of the temporal-parietal junction across specific stimulus dimensions and this is an important target for future work. Limitations of current technology meant we recorded from the right hemisphere only and thus cannot determine the specificity of our findings to left temporal-parietal junction; engineering advances are required to produce whole-head bNIRS devices. Moreover, we only studied one age group of infants between 4 and 7 months; therefore, we could not investigate developmental change.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Energy metabolism and neural activity are known to be tightly coupled in order to meet the high energetic demands of the brain, both during a task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jeong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lundgaard et al., 2015</xref>) and at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rocher et al., 2003</xref>).

The non-social videos consisted of dynamic video clips of moving mechanical toys. The visual and auditory components of both social and non-social videos were matched.

The following experimental condition was then presented once the infant’s attention was on the fixation cross. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> depicts the order of stimulus presentation. All infants sat in their parent’s lap at an approximate distance of 65 cm from a 35-in screen which was used to display the experimental stimuli. The study began with a minimum 10 s rest period to draw the infant’s attention towards the screen during which the infant was presented with various shapes in the four corners of the screen. Following this, the baseline and experimental stimuli were presented alternatingly until the infant became bored or fussy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data acquisition and array placement</title><p>bNIRS and EEG data was acquired simultaneously and the bNIRS optodes and EEG electrodes were positioned on the head using custom-built, 3D printed arrays which were embedded within a soft neoprene cap (Neuroelectrics, Spain). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref> shows the locations of bNIRS optodes and EEG electrodes on the head. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> shows the combined bNIRS-EEG headgear positioned on an infant.

The bNIRS system consisted of two light sources that consisting of halogen light bulbs (Phillips) that emitted light in the near-infrared range (504–1068 nm). The light was directed to the infant’s head through customised bifurcated optical fibres (Loptek, Germany), allowing each light source to split into two pairs of light sources. This formed a total of four light sources at the participant-end and each pair of light sources were controlled by a time multiplexing mechanism whereby one pair of light sources was on every 1.4 s. The system also consisted of 14 detector fibres at the participant-end which were connected to two spectrometers, 7 for each spectrometer (in-house developed lens spectrographs and PIXIS512f CCD cameras; Princeton Instruments). The configuration of 4 light sources and 14 detectors formed a total of 19 measurement channels. These were positioned over the occipital cortex and the right hemisphere as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>. The source detector separation was 2.5 cm.</p><p>Data were analysed in Matlab (Mathworks, USA) using in-house scripts. First, for each participant, across all wavelengths, wavelet-based motion correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Molavi and Dumont, 2012</xref>) was applied to the attenuation change signal to correct for motion artifacts. The tuning parameter α = 0.8 was used. Following this, the UCLn algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bale et al., 2016</xref>) was used with a wavelength-dependent, age-appropriate fixed differential path-length factor value of 5.13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duncan et al., 1995</xref>). While the light sources emitted light between 504 and 1068 nm, the changes in concentration of HbO<sub>2</sub>, HHb, and oxCCO were calculated using 120 wavelengths between 780 and 900 nm. A fourth-order bandpass Butterworth filter from 0.01 to 0.4 Hz was used to filter the data. For each infant, channels were assessed for signal quality and any channels with poor signal quality were rejected. Following this, the HbO<sub>2</sub>, HHb, and oxCCO time-series were entered into a GLM to correlate bNIRS and EEG data.</p><p>For each infant, intensity counts (or photon counts) from each of the 14 detectors were used to assess the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at each channel and the channels with intensity counts lower than 2000 or higher than 40,000 were excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Phan et al., 2016</xref>). If an infant had more than 60% of channels excluded, they were excluded from the study. At the group level, five channels over the occipital cortex were excluded due to poor SNR in majority of infants (channel 3 excluded in 64% of infants, channel 6 excluded in 83% of infants, channel 7 excluded in 64% of infants, channel 8 excluded in 79% of infants) and one channel over the right hemisphere was excluded in 100% of infants due to a damaged optical fibre.

The system consisted of 32 electrodes, the locations of which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>. The sampling rate of the system was 500 Hz. The experimental protocol in Psychtoolbox sent event markers to both bNIRS and EEG systems using serial port communication which was then used to synchronise the bNIRS and EEG.</p><p>All data were analysed using the EEGlab Toolbox (Schwartz Centre for Computation Neuroscience, UC San Diego, USA) and in-house scripts in Matlab (Mathworks, USA). The raw EEG signal was band-pass filtered between 0.1 and 100 Hz and a notch filter (48–52 Hz) was applied to remove artefacts due to line noise. Following this, blocks of the data were created such that they consisted of the baseline period prior to the stimulus presentation and the entire following stimulus period. These blocks were then segmented into 1 s segments such that for both the baseline and the stimulus, each 8–12 s presentation of the baseline condition or the stimulus condition yielded 8–12 × 1 s segments. These 1 s segments consisted of 200 ms of the previous 1 s segment and 800 ms of the current segment and the 200 ms was used for baseline correction of each 1 s segment. This will be referred to as ‘within-segment baseline correction’ from here. Segments where the infants were not visually attending to the stimulus were removed. An average of 30 × 1 s segments were included per infant. Artefacts were detected using automatic artifact detection in EEGlab and through manual identification. EEG segments were rejected if the signal amplitude exceeded 200 μV, or if electro-ocular, movement, or muscular artefacts occurred. Channels with noisy data were interpolated by an algorithm incorporated within EEGlab. Data were then re-referenced to the average reference.</p><p>Within each block (consisting of the baseline period and the stimulus period), each artefact-free 1 s segment was subjected to a power analysis to calculate the average root mean square (RMS) power for both low- and high-frequency bands – theta (3–6 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz), gamma (20–60 Hz), and high gamma (60–80 Hz), within each 1 s segment. This then yielded the average RMS power across the block (baseline period + following stimulus period). Baseline correction was performed by subtracting the average of the 2 s of the baseline period from the entire block. This will be referred to as the ‘block baseline correction’ from here on. RMS power was chosen as the metric to correlate bNIRS and EEG data as previous studies have demonstrated that task-related BOLD changes are best explained by RMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kilner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rosa et al., 2010</xref>). The blocks were then averaged across trials to obtain an averaged RMS response per participant. A portion of the averaged RMS power was then entered into a GLM analysis described below – this consisted of 8 s of the stimulus period. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> provides a visual depiction of how the RMS power was derived from the pre-processed EEG data. For each participant, the RMS power was also averaged across the stimulus period for statistical analysis of the EEG data. For each frequency band, statistical t-tests were performed on this averaged RMS power comparing the social condition versus the baseline (RMS power was averaged during the baseline period), the non-social condition versus the baseline, and social versus non-social. The FDR procedure using the Benjamin-Hochberg method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) was performed to correct for multiple comparisons, across the 32 EEG channels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> outlines the data analysis pipelines for both bNIRS and EEG data, as well as the procedure for the combined bNIRS-EEG analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Combined NIRS-EEG analysis</title><p>A GLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friston et al., 1994</xref>) approach was employed to investigate the relationship between the bNIRS haemodynamic and metabolic data with the EEG neural data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows the physiological relationship between EEG neural activity and the bNIRS haemodynamic and metabolic signals. The canonical GLM typically uses a model of the expected haemodynamic response, that is the HRF, to predict the haemodynamic signal. However, given the differences in the haemodynamic response in adults and infants, the standard adult HRF model cannot be assumed for infant data. For example, infants display a delay in their haemodynamic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schroeter et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shimada and Hiraki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Minagawa-Kawai et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the analogous of the HRF is not established for the metabolic response (i.e. the metabolic response function [MRF]). Therefore, the first step of this analysis involved reconstructing the HRF for HbO<sub>2</sub> and HHb and the MRF for oxCCO before combing bNIRS and EEG data.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Simplified summary of the signalling pathways that mediate neurovascular coupling.</title><p>High-frequency neural activity causes the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and noradrenaline which bind to either <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in interneurons or metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) or adrenaline receptors in astrocytes. In both cases, this causes an influx of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) which in turn leads to an increase in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production through the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). As a by-product, in interneurons, nitric oxide (NO) is produced in the interneurons which dilates arterioles to increase blood flow leading to increased oxygen delivery in surrounding brain regions. Alternatively, in astrocytes derivates of arachidonic acid (AA) include prostaglandins (PG) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET) which cause vasodilation.

Based on our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siddiqui et al., 2021</xref>), we selected only the channels that displayed statistically significant responses to the contrast task versus baseline. The single subjects block-averaged responses were averaged across the social and non-social conditions and then across the significant channels. The resulting block-averaged responses were then averaged across the group to obtain a ‘grand average’ HbO<sub>2</sub>, HHb, and oxCCO response.</p><p>The grand average was then used in an iterative approach to estimate the HRF and MRF that best fit the HbO<sub>2</sub>, HHb, and oxCCO responses. This involved fitting the grand-averaged signals with different HRF/MRF models starting from the canonical HRF made of two gamma functions and varying the following parameters: (a) delay of response, (b) delay of the undershoot, and (c) ratio of response to undershoot to identify the combination of parameters that best reconstructed the infant HRF/MRF for the social/non-social stimuli. The parameters were varied in increments of 1 s such that the delay of the response was varied from 5 to 15 s from the stimulus onset, the delay of the undershoot was varied from 5 to 20 s, and the ratio of the response to the undershoot was varied from 2 to 6 s. All possible combinations of parameters were tested. The grand average responses were fitted with each HRF/MRF in GLM approach, and β-values were obtained for each combination of the HRF/MRF parameters. The β-values were entered into a statistical test and the parameter combinations that yielded the highest, statistically significant β-values (i.e. the model best fitting the data) were selected to reconstruct the infant HRF/MRF. This is approach is similar to those used previously to reconstruct the infant HRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Minagawa-Kawai et al., 2011</xref>) and identified the best fit to be with a 2 s delay of response for HbO<sub>2</sub> and HHb and a 3 s delay of response for oxCCO in comparison to the adult HRF (i.e. 6 s). Moreover, the delay of the undershoot was 9 s earlier for all chromophores and the ratio of the response to the undershoot was 2 for HbO<sub>2</sub> and HHb and 3 for oxCCO, in comparison to 6 for the adult HRF. These correspond to the basis function representing the haemodynamic/metabolic response to an event of zero duration/impulse function. The new reconstructed HRF and MRF were then used for the GLM approach to correlate bNIRS and EEG data.

For this, we used the results from an analysis we described previously that combined bNIRS haemodynamic and metabolic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siddiqui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pinti et al., 2021</xref>). The results from this identified task-relevant cortical regions displayed high levels of haemodynamic and metabolic coupling. The bNIRS channels that displayed significant haemodynamic and metabolic coupling for social and non-social conditions were used here. All EEG channels were used as EEG is not as spatially specific as bNIRS. For each infant, for each chromophore, for each channel, and each EEG frequency band, the new infant HRF/MRF that was reconstructed in the previous step was convolved with the events to obtain the ‘predicted’ bNIRS signal. The ‘predicted’ bNIRS signal was then convolved with the EEG RMS power block (consisting only of the data from the stimulus period) at each frequency band to obtain the neural regressor for the bNIRS data, considering both social and non-social conditions together. The design matrix thus included the neural regressor reflecting the increased EEG activity to the social and non-social stimuli and used to fit the bNIRS data. This was performed for HbO<sub>2</sub>, HHb, and oxCCO individually for all the channels. β-Values were estimated for each channel and t-tests against 0 were conducted to test whether there was a statistically significant association between bNIRS signals and EEG frequency bands. The FDR procedure using the Benjamin-Hochberg method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) was performed to correct for multiple comparisons across EEG and bNIRS channels. The FDR-corrected significant t-values were plotted. This method has been used in numerous studies previously in correlating fMRI BOLD-EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scheeringa et al., 2009</xref>). Only bNIRS channels that displayed significant (prior to FDR correction) haemodynamic and metabolic coupling were used for this analysis (as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and d</xref>). For the social condition, channels 12, 13, and 14 for HbO<sub>2</sub>, channels 11, 12, 14, and 18 for HHb, and channels 11, 12, 13, 14, and 18 for oxCCO displayed significant haemodynamic and metabolic coupling. Moreover, for the non-social condition, channels 12 and 14 for HbO<sub>2</sub>, channels 12, 14, and 16 for HHb, and channels 12, 14, and 16 for oxCCO displayed significant coupling. For consistency, the channels selected for the bNIRS-EEG analysis were the same across chromophores and conditions. The final channels included in the analysis therefore were channels 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 18. For the integrated bNIRS-EEG analysis, six channel-wise t-tests were carried (one per included bNIRS channel, e.g. 6) for each EEG frequency band. Therefore, the FDR correction was applied across the six bNIRS channels for each of the hypotheses tested.</p><p>For the bNIRS analysis, data from 25 infants was included while for the EEG analysis, data from 35 infants were included. For the joint bNIRS-EEG analysis, only infants that had both valid bNIRS and EEG data for both social and non-social conditions were included and therefore 14 infants were included in this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Image reconstruction</title><p>Image reconstruction was performed on the bNIRS data, at the individual subject level and then averaged across infants to produce a grand average that is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.

For this analysis, three additional long-distance channels were created over the right hemisphere (in addition to the 19 bNIRS channels) that had a source/detector separation of 4.3 cm to generate multiple and overlapping channels.</p><p>More precisely, the block-averaged attenuation changes at 13 discrete wavelengths (from 780 to 900 nm at 10 nm intervals) for each infant were selected from the bNIRS data.

Diffuse boundary sources and detectors were simulated as a Gaussian profile with a 2 mm standard deviation, and Neumann boundary conditions were applied.

coupling of complementary cerebral measures (neural, hemodynamic and metabolic) during development by providing an interesting roadmap for multimodal neuroimaging in infants. The methodological contribution is compelling with an original setup for simultaneous EEG and NIRS recording and analyses. Results on the role of activation changes in the temporal-parietal junction on the development of social processing are convincing. This work will be of interest to a broad audience of scientists interested in multimodal neuroimaging and cognitive development.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84122.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Dubois</surname><given-names>Jessica</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05f82e368</institution-id><institution>Inserm Unité NeuroDiderot, Université Paris Cité</institution></institution-wrap><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Kabdebon</surname><given-names>Claire</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05a0dhs15</institution-id><institution>Ecole Normale Supérieure</institution></institution-wrap><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.11.08.514512">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.08.514512v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Chris Baker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Claire Kabdebon (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although the reviewers acknowledged the important methodological contribution of your study, the following key aspects of the article were questioned and will need to be addressed in the revised manuscript, in addition to the other reviewers' comments (detailed below).</p><p>1) A discrepancy was perceived between the main claim of the article at the cognitive/developmental level (on brain specialization for social processing in infants) and the evidence provided by this work. It seems necessary to temper this presentation because the analyses and results are not as aligned with the aims and hypotheses as the reader might expect after reading the abstract and introduction. To gain clarity and impact of the manuscript, we advise you to partially reframe the article to better highlight the methodological contribution rather than emphasizing the fundamental side which is insufficiently supported by the results.</p><p>2) At the methodological level, avoiding shortcuts and general statements would be welcome. Better specification of your predictions in complex analyses such as the final general linear model would facilitate the interpretation of the results. The spatial comparison of source-localized NIRS measures and scalp-based EEG measures was also questioned.</p><p>3) Finally, during our discussions following the individual review process, Reviewer #2 suggested adding a critical discussion of the difference in hemodynamic response shape when signals are grand averaged vs. the HRF shape.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I feel the manuscript would be stronger if it focussed on evaluating the combination of methods. At the moment, it takes on too much and so ultimately disappoints. Theoretically, the introduction builds a case that this method might provide a special test of interactive specialization, but this is not revisited in the results or the discussion. And methodologically, there are large claims throughout (e.g., the title &quot;beyond the neuron&quot;, line 73 &quot;work with single modalities…does not yield insights&quot;, line 217 &quot;a critical nexus in understanding localisation&quot;, line 254 &quot;novel multimodal and non-invasive&quot;, line 268 &quot;demonstrates the strength… particularly in clinical populations&quot;). These are non-substantiated and distract from the genuine discoveries in the paper. Highly relevant literature is also omitted. For example, there is a whole community using EEG and fMRI, either sequentially or simultaneously, that has produced what I expect are hundreds of papers. What lessons have been learned from this? A summary should be given in the introduction and the work-related back in the discussion.</p><p>The authors perform source localisation to map the scalp measures to brain sources for the NIRS. It would be interesting to give some estimate of the spatial resolution of this method. But no such localisation is attempted for EEG. It was probably omitted because there are too few EEG channels for it to be meaningful. But, it is then just not possible to spatially compare scalp-based EEG measures, which may be far from the neural source to a neural measure, of localised NIRS. I feel that plotting the scalp electrodes on the brain, along with the NIRS data, is misleading.</p><p>It is difficult to read a paper where the methods are so important, with the methods at the end.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Please check two issues with Graphic links in the text: lines 374 and 561 &quot;Error! Reference source not found.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Here are some additional remarks:</p><p>– In order to address the specialization process, and if the sample size and distribution allow, it might be interesting to explore age-related effects over the reported brain regions.</p><p>– About the organization of the methods section, for clarification, I would suggest following the structure of the Results section.</p><p>– Regarding the EEG analysis, some aspects of the analysis were unclear to me. First, about data segmentation: it is mentioned that data is epoched in 1s segments, consisting of 200ms of the previous segment and 800ms of the current segment: it is thus my understanding that segments are overlapping. However, it doesn't fit with the schematic representation of the procedure in figure 6b. This procedure should be clarified.</p><p>Second, it is also mentioned that the first 200ms of the segment was used as a baseline. What is the purpose of this baseline correction, since a second baseline correction will be performed in the frequency domain? Is it only for artifact detection purposes?</p><p>Third, regarding the definition of the frequency bands, the β and γ bands are overlapping (Β from 13 to 30Hz and Γ from 20 to 60Hz), which means that the two measures are not independent. How do the authors ensure that the reported effects in the two frequency bands are not driven by this shared activity?</p><p>– About the hemodynamic to metabolic coupling assessment, it is mentioned that the coupling of hemodynamic and metabolic activity was restricted to specific channels, based on previous studies. Which are these specific channels?</p><p>– Regarding the HRF and MRF reconstruction, the schematic representation of the procedure in figure 7 was confusing to me. The authors performed block averages of the HbO, HbR, and COO signals. However, it is unclear to me whether the blocks consist of [baseline stimulation] or [stimulation baseline]: what does the 0-time point correspond to in these figures? It seems like on the group average response on the top it represents the onset of the baseline, and on the reconstructed infant response functions it represents the onset of the stimulation. This is only a detail of the representation, but it was confusing for me.</p><p>Besides, do the depicted response functions represent the actual functions obtained? It would be informative to provide the reader with this information.</p><p>– Regarding the combined NIRS-EEG analysis, it was unclear to me whether the EEG measures were used to model the bNIRS data on a second-by-second basis (i.e. the time-resolved rms power signal is convolved with the response function), or on a block by block basis (i.e. average of the rms power signal for each block), or whether an average across each of the two conditions was used (i.e. average rms power across all blocks of each condition). Besides, L463-465 it is mentioned that the RMS power is entered in the GLM with 2s baseline + 8s stim, but L545, it is then mentioned that only the data for the stimulus period is included. Please clarify this point.</p><p>– Regarding multiple comparisons, the proposed analysis examining relations between EEG activity in 4 frequency bands to each of the three chromophores implies a high number of comparisons. The authors indicate that they used FDR corrections: across which dimensions were these corrections performed? Is it EEG x bNIRS sensors x chromophores x frequency bands? It would be worth mentioning for each of the analyses performed.</p><p>– Please mention the average amount of data used to perform each of the analyses across infants (i.e. how many blocks of stimulation are included).</p><p>– I found that some of the information included in the figures was sometimes too small or very hard to read. I would suggest re-designing some of these figures to be self-explanatory.</p><p>– Figure 2-f: it is unclear what this graph corresponds to, and how it was obtained. Does it correspond to a specific condition social or non-social? What is the added value of this graph in the framework of this study?</p><p>– There are some reference errors (L561 and 374).</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Using multi-modal neuroimaging to characterise social brain specialisation in infants&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Floris de Lange (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In general, the authors produced a stronger manuscript that addresses most of the concerns that were raised. In particular, the authors improved the overall clarity of their work both conceptually and methodologically, and they provide better data visualization. Besides, the scope and contribution of the paper is now communicated more clearly.</p><p>Yet, a few aspects of the manuscript remain a bit obscure to me and I believe they should be further improved or at least addressed.</p><p>First, after reading the paper, the pattern of results obtained from the combined EEG – bNIRS analysis does not seem as clear as I would have expected from the authors predictions. In figures 3-1 and 3-2, although some bNIRS channels (11 and 14) are overall more consistently reported than others as significant, as emphasized in the results and discussion, there is still quite some variability in the pattern of bNIRS to EEG channels coupling across chromophores (and frequency bands and conditions). How do the authors explain this variability? Shouldn't the different chromophore measurements reflect a similar phenomenon, and thus display similar coupling patterns with EEG channels? Is this the expected level of variability for this kind of dataset, or for this age range, population size etc….? It would be really informative if the authors could elaborate more on the reasons why we observe this variability in the discussion, and if possible provide recommendations on how to reduce it in further studies.</p><p>Second, about the authors' predictions in the introduction, they mention that they expect to observe &quot;coordinated increases in hemodynamics/metabolism and neural oscillatory activity&quot; in the social condition, and &quot;coordinated decreases in hemodynamics/metabolism and neural oscillatory activity&quot; in the non-social condition. This wording suggests that this is a hypothesis that the authors will be able to test. However, the authors do not test this hypothesis further in the manuscript and it seems to me that the directionality of coordinated activity cannot be directly assessed using this GLM approach. I would therefore suggest to slightly reframe the phrasing of this paragraph to avoid that confusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84122.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A discrepancy was perceived between the main claim of the article at the cognitive/developmental level (on brain specialization for social processing in infants) and the evidence provided by this work.

These hence correspond to the hemodynamic/metabolic response to an event of 0 duration and differ from the group averaged responses that represent the responses averaged across the whole duration of the various task blocks. The HRF and MRF were estimated using the iterative procedure as these are not known for infants and the MRF nor for infants and adults, therefore providing a new method to optimize the analysis of NIRS-based data when the canonical HRF might not be appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I feel the manuscript would be stronger if it focussed on evaluating the combination of methods.

We revised the introduction to increase the focus on the methodological advances represented by our work, though we think the broader theoretical context that motivates the use of these methods in general is still important to consider (because that provides the motivation for developing them). We have clarified that we are suggesting that integrating metabolic measurements and their coupling to other measures may provide a more sensitive way of measuring functional specialisation (the selective engagement of a particular brain region in a particular process) because energetic constraints may play a role in interactive specialisation, one theory of how functional specialisation arises. We are not arguing that our measures can measure interactive specialisation itself, and so we have tried to highlight this distinction throughout. We have further clarified that this is the context in which we present material on theoretical frameworks and returned to them in the discussion from this perspective. We have also clarified several places where we used unclear phrasing (e.g., on line 1148 we meant that the study we were discussing on epilepsy had implications for use in clinical populations, rather than our study directly; we have clarified this now). We have added material on simultaneous EEG and fMRI to the introduction and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors perform source localisation to map the scalp measures to brain sources for the NIRS.

To clarify, we did not perform source localisation on the NIRS data for our analyses examining associations with EEG. We did perform image reconstruction (as seen in Figure 4) with the bNIRS data, but this was to address a separate goal. The HbO<sub>2</sub>, HHb and oxCCO time-series (i.e. for each channel) were used as part of the combined bNIRS – EEG analysis, not the reconstructed time-series (i.e. for each node of the mesh). We have added text on lines 1623 – 1624 to make it clear that image reconstruction was a separate analysis that was performed with the main goal of visualizing how the changes in HbO<sub>2</sub>, HHb, oxCCO were spatially related to each other. Moreover, we have changed Figure 6c to indicate at which step of the analysis image reconstruction was performed. This should also clarify that the data from the reconstruction was not used in any other subsequent analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is difficult to read a paper where the methods are so important, with the methods at the end.</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed the <italic>eLife</italic> template for this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Please check two issues with Graphic links in the text: lines 374 and 561 &quot;Error!

These bands are widely adopted by EEG infant studies. In order to clear any doubts, we have now included a “high γ” frequency band (60 – 80 Hz) in the combined bNIRS – EEG analysis. The results shown in Figures 3b and 3c show consistency/similarity in the pattern of results in the “γ” and “high γ” frequency bands and no similarity between the “β” and “γ” frequency bands.

To clarify, for each condition, for each chromophore, a different set of channels showed significant haemodynamic and metabolic coupling. To avoid further complexity, we decided to include all the channels that showed significant coupling for either of the conditions, for any of the chromophores. Therefore, considering all the significant channels across conditions and chromophores, the final channels included were 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 18.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Regarding the HRF and MRF reconstruction, the schematic representation of the procedure in figure 7 was confusing to me.

The block in the group-averaged responses corresponds to the period [stimulation + baseline] as infants often show delayed responses (e.g. see Lloyd-Fox et al., 2017 using a similar task). The HRF and MRF on the right of the figure instead represent the basis function, i.e. the model of the response to an event of 0 duration. In addition, the figure shows the actual functions obtained. In order to clarify these aspects, we have included the yellow shaded areas to indicate the stimulation periods as well as mentioned that the shown HRF and MRF are estimated functions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Regarding the combined NIRS-EEG analysis, it was unclear to me whether the EEG measures were used to model the bNIRS data on a second-by-second basis (i.e. the time-resolved rms power signal is convolved with the response function), or on a block by block basis (i.e. average of the rms power signal for each block), or whether an average across each of the two conditions was used (i.e. average rms power across all blocks of each condition).

To clarify, the average RMS power (which is referred to as the “block averaged EEG response” in the text) across all blocks of each condition was used for the convolution with reconstructed infant HRF/MRF. This is because unlike fNIRS/bNIRS data, several trials of EEG data are required to accurately detect activity. It was therefore more accurate to average all the blocks of each condition for each participant. This has already been mentioned on line 1350 – “The blocks were then averaged across trials to obtain an averaged RMS response per participant” Regarding the reviewer’s second comment, there was indeed a discrepancy, and we had erroneously stated that the RMS power block that was entered into the GLM consisted of 2s baseline + 8s stimulus. In fact, only the stimulus period was used for the GLM analysis. This error has been corrected now on line 1352.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Regarding multiple comparisons, the proposed analysis examining relations between EEG activity in 4 frequency bands to each of the three chromophores implies a high number of comparisons.

We note that the reviewer also made a comment for us to clarify the FDR correction procedure and upon checking this (in order to include the exact details in the manuscript), we noted that the results figures that we had included after the previous revisions were not the FDR-corrected ones. The correct ones have now been included in Figure 3 supplement 1 and supplement 2 and are now much clearer. We see a more consistent, stimulus-dependent, localised pattern of associations between bNIRS channels and EEG electrodes. There is still a small amount of variation across chromophores, and we have added the following into the discussion on lines 340 – 395 which we hope will clarify why there is variability across chromophores and frequency bands:</p><p>“The strongest coupling was observed between temporo-parietal bNIRS channel 14 with parietal EEG locations Pz and PO4 for the social condition (for β and γ frequency bands). Meanwhile, for the non-social condition, coupling was observed between temporo-parietal bNIRS channel 14 with occipital and parietal EEG locations Oz, O2, PO8 and P10 (for theta and β frequency bands). While an overall consistent pattern of associations across chromophores and conditions was observed, some variability was also seen, particularly across frequency bands. This was expected and in line with previous EEG-fMRI studies that have demonstrated task-dependent variation in coupling between neural and haemodynamic activity across frequency bands [1]–[7]. For example, for resting state simultaneous fMRI and EEG, stronger coupling between the BOLD response and neural activity has been observed for the α band [8]. Meanwhile, for cognitive tasks, stronger coupling has been observed in the γ frequency band [9]. Scheeringa et al. (2011) investigated trial-by-trial coupling of EEG and BOLD activity and found that low- and high-frequency bands independently contribute to explaining BOLD variance. We therefore expected the frequency band showing the strongest coupling between bNIRS and EEG for each of the stimuli to vary. Further, while we did expect and observe significant overlap in associations between chromophores within each frequency band, some variability was seen. For example, for the social condition, no associations were observed in the low-frequency bands for any of the chromophores. Moreover, in the β frequency bands, all chromophores displayed significant associations between bNIRS channel 14 and Pz for the social condition and both HHb and oxCCO displayed significant associations between bNIRS channel 14 and O2, PO8 and C2. Similarly, in the γ frequency bands, both HbO<sub>2</sub> and oxCCO displayed significant associations between bNIRS channel 14 and PO4. The variability that was observed between chromophores was limited mostly to the non-social condition. For example, only oxCCO displayed significant associations between bNIRS and EEG for the low-frequency theta and α frequency bands. It is well known that various components involved in neurovascular coupling undergo development postnatally, see the review by [18] for a full discussion. Briefly, there is extensive structural change within cerebral microvasculature including growth, extension and proliferation of new blood vessels [19], [20]. Further, studies have also demonstrated gradual development of vascular reactivity (i.e., change in vascular tone, vasoconstriction and vasodilation) [20], [21] which is necessary for the propagation of the NVC response [23]. Lastly, pericytes and astrocytes which are key components of NVC are also known to undergo development in size, number, connectivity and branching [24]–[27]. From the metabolic perspective, infant positron emission tomography (PET) studies demonstrate regional-specific, progressive increase in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO<sub>2</sub>) [14] while others evidence a developmental maturational change in oxidative metabolism [15]. In adults, previous research has also suggested that oxygen consumption is more spatially localised in comparison to changes in cerebral blood flow [10] and that oxCCO has distinct spatial distributions in the brain [11], [12], [13], indicating that energy metabolism may be more spatially specific. The spatial distribution of oxCCO in different brain regions currently remains unmapped in the developing infant brain, however. Therefore, taken together, given that there are extensive changes in cerebral vasculature as well as the metabolic environment and potential variability in the spatial distribution of oxCCO, it is expected that there will be some variability observed in the associations between the haemodynamics and metabolism with neural activity. In our study, we observed more consistent oxCCO – EEG associations across frequency bands and stimuli with more localised (fewer long-range) associations. Further studies with a larger sample size and longitudinal follow up can provide a clearer view on how NVC develops in infancy which will help explain some of the observed variability. Moreover, future studies with high density bNIRS arrays will provide clarification on the spatial distribution of oxCCO in the infant brain.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, about the authors' predictions in the introduction, they mention that they expect to observe &quot;coordinated increases in hemodynamics/metabolism and neural oscillatory activity&quot; in the social condition, and &quot;coordinated decreases in hemodynamics/metabolism and neural oscillatory activity&quot; in the non-social condition. This wording suggests that this is a hypothesis that the authors will be able to test. However, the authors do not test this hypothesis further in the manuscript and it seems to me that the directionality of coordinated activity cannot be directly assessed using this GLM approach. I would therefore suggest to slightly reframe the phrasing of this paragraph to avoid that confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>The wording in the introduction and the discussion has been changed to the following and instead of the word coordinated, we have used the word simultaneous.</p><p>“We predicted that for the individual comparison of the social condition, we would observe positive associations between bNIRS and EEG measures, i.e. a simultaneous increase in haemodynamics/metabolism and neural oscillatory activity in the β and γ frequency bands (based on previous combined EEG – fMRI studies [1]–[7]) which would be localised to core social brain regions. We hypothesised that for the non-social condition, over the same brain regions, positive associations would be observed between bNIRS and EEG measures, but they would be a simultaneous decrease in haemodynamics/metabolism and oscillatory activity. We also expected simultaneous increases in haemodynamics/metabolism and oscillatory activity to be localised to the parietal brain region.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
