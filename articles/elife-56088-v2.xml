necessary for carbon assimilation and must be regulated to minimize free radical damage. There is a longstanding controversy over the role of a critical enzyme in this process (ferredoxin:NADP(H) oxidoreductase, or FNR), and in particular its location within chloroplasts. Here we use immunogold labelling to prove that FNR previously assigned as soluble is in fact membrane associated. We combined this technique with a genetic approach in the model plant Arabidopsis to show that the distribution of this enzyme between different membrane regions depends on its interaction with specific tether proteins. We further demonstrate a correlation between the interaction of FNR with different proteins and the activity of alternative photosynthetic electron transport pathways. This supports a role for FNR location in regulating photosynthetic electron flow during the transition from dark to light.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>electron transport</kwd><kwd>ferredoxin</kwd><kwd>thylakoid</kwd><kwd>photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>chloroplast</kwd><kwd>NADPH</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB944 project 2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name><name><surname>Hanke</surname><given-names>Guy Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/R004838/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanke</surname><given-names>Guy Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012952</institution-id><institution>University Grenoble Alps</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-49-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Finazzi</surname><given-names>Giovanni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>833184</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Finazzi</surname><given-names>Giovanni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LabEx Saclay Plant Sciences-SPS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-0040-SPS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krieger-Liszkay</surname><given-names>Anja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>French Infrastructure for Integrated Structural Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-INSB-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krieger-Liszkay</surname><given-names>Anja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bayer CropScience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F-2016-BS-0555</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012952</institution-id><institution>University Grenoble Alps</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CBH-EUR-GS (ANR-17-EURE-0003)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Finazzi</surname><given-names>Giovanni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The regulatory switch from protection to assimilation, which plants use to exploit natural, fluctuating light, involves movement of the enzyme ferredoxin:NADP(H) oxidoreductase between chloroplast membrane complexes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Photosynthetic carbon assimilation in chloroplasts requires NADPH. This is generated by the enzyme ferredoxin:NADP(H) oxidoreductase (FNR) using electrons from ferredoxin (Fd), which is reduced on excitation of photosystem I (PSI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shin et al., 1963</xref>). The pathway is referred to as ‘linear electron flow’ (LEF) because the electrons originate from water splitting at photosystem II (PSII) and are transferred in a linear progression to PSI via plastoquinone/plastoquinol (PQ/PQH<sub>2</sub>) and the cytochrome b<sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> complex (Cyt b<sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic>), pumping protons across the thylakoid membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hill and Bendall, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mitchell, 1975</xref>). Plastocyanin (PC) takes these electrons and re-reduces the oxidised PSI. This proton motive force drives synthesis of ATP, which is also required for carbon fixation among a host of other reactions. FNR shows an extremely high control co-efficient for photosynthetic rate (meaning that changing FNR concentrations strongly influences flux through the pathway) in tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>): 0.7 in limiting light and 0.94 in saturating light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hajirezaei et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Chloroplasts are bounded by an envelope membrane and contain a soluble matrix (the stroma) and an internal membrane (the thylakoid) composed of two distinct domains: stacks of appressed discs known as grana, connected by sheets of membrane called lamellae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Paolillo, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mustárdy et al., 2008</xref>). Apart from the electron shuttling proteins PC and Fd, all components of LEF are unambiguously localised to the thylakoid membrane except FNR, whose location remains controversial.</p><p>Although it has been found associated with PSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 1992</xref>), it is suggested that membrane association is unnecessary for FNR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Benz et al., 2010</xref>). This is because mutation of two, higher plant specific, FNR tethering proteins (Tic62 and TROL) caused all FNR to be soluble but had little impact on LEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lintala et al., 2014</xref>). Current dogma therefore states that NADP<sup>+</sup> photoreduction is conducted by soluble FNR, free in the stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Benz et al., 2010</xref>), and indeed a large proportion of FNR is recovered as a soluble protein after cell fractionation of algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mosebach et al., 2017</xref>) and higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Okutani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Böhme, 1978</xref>). Contrary to this theory, FNR enzyme activity increases when the protein is associated with the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Carrillo and Vallejos, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Forti and Bracale, 1984</xref>).</p><p>PSI can be re-reduced by returning electrons from Fd to PQ, thus pumping protons without generating NADPH. This cyclic electron flow (CEF) protects the photosynthetic machinery when there is an imbalance between the production of excited electrons and their consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yamori et al., 2016</xref>), and regulates the ratio between ATP and NADPH produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Suorsa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Walker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Munekage et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Joliot and Johnson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kramer and Evans, 2011</xref>). Two CEF pathways have been defined: one is catalysed by a homologue of respiratory complex I called NDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Burrows et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shikanai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kofer et al., 1998</xref>); the other is defined by its sensitivity to antimycin A, and depends on the Pgr5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Munekage et al., 2002</xref>) and PgrL1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">DalCorso et al., 2008</xref>). There are some differences in CEF pathways between angiosperms, which retain the NDH complex, and algae such as <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> which replace it with an NDH2 type, monomeric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Peltier et al., 2016</xref>). Curiously, FNR is implicated in the antimycin A sensitive pathway, being found in complex with PgrL1 in the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Iwai et al., 2010</xref>) and identified as a PgrL1 interaction partner in higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">DalCorso et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, <italic>pgr5</italic> knockout in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> increases FNR solubilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mosebach et al., 2017</xref>). There is also some evidence supporting a function for FNR in higher plant CEF from inhibitor studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ravenel et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shahak et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bendall and Manasse, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mills et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cleland and Bendall, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ye and Wang, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hosler and Yocum, 1985</xref>), but a definitive mutant study is hampered by the severe phenotype when NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bendall and Manasse, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lintala et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Higher plant chloroplasts switch rapidly between LEF and CEF in response to environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Joliot and Joliot, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Asada et al., 1993</xref>) and dynamic transfer of FNR between membrane complexes has been proposed as part of this mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Joliot and Johnson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Breyton et al., 2006</xref>). FNR iso-proteins with variable capacity for membrane association could help to test this hypothesis and have been identified so far in wheat, Arabidopsis, and maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Okutani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gummadova et al., 2007</xref>). Arabidopsis has two FNR iso-proteins (AtFNR1 and AtFNR2), and knock-out of the At<italic>FNR1</italic> gene results in complete solublisation of AtFNR2, indicating cooperativity in membrane association of the two FNR iso-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lintala et al., 2007</xref>). Maize has 3 FNR iso-proteins, which are differentially localised between cell types engaging predominantly in CEF or LEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Twachtmann et al., 2012</xref>). Remarkably, when we expressed maize FNRs heterologously in Arabidopsis, they showed specific association with either TROL (ZmFNR1), Tic62 (ZmFNR2), or were soluble (ZmFNR3). For clarity, the properties of the different Arabidopsis and maize FNRs are summarised in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>The grana and lamellae domains of the thylakoid vary in protein composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andersson and Anderson, 1980</xref>), with PSII and its antennae in the appressed grana, and PSI, NDH, and the ATPase restricted to stroma facing regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Daum et al., 2010</xref>). Cyt b<sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> is evenly distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allred and Staehelin, 1986</xref>). As LEF requires PSI and PSII, it is thought to predominantly occur at border regions, where appressed and stroma facing membranes coincide, bringing the necessary components into proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>). By contrast, the CEF components PSI, PgrL1/Pgr5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hertle et al., 2013</xref>), NDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lennon et al., 2003</xref>), and Cyt b<sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> are all present on the lamellae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chow et al., 2005</xref>). In order to understand whether FNR can act as part of a regulatory switch between LEF and CEF, it is therefore critical to understand (1) where it is located within the chloroplast, (2) how this relates to its interaction with different tether proteins, and (3) how these factors impact on the different electron transport pathways. Fluorescence microscopy with FNR is hampered by difficulties in labelling the protein – the N-terminal is critical for interaction with the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Twachtmann et al., 2012</xref>), while the carboxy-group of the C-terminal Tyr is part of the catalytic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tejero et al., 2005</xref>). In this study we therefore undertook a rigorous immunogold-label (IGL) study on FNR location in Arabidopsis chloroplasts. The data indicate that the enzyme is almost exclusively membrane bound, even in genotypes where it was previously thought to be totally soluble. Moreover, to dissect the connection between interaction, location, and function, we have introduced genes for the different ZmFNR proteins into the <italic>fnr1</italic> mutants, creating Arabidopsis plants with approximately wild-type levels of FNR but enriched in specific interactions: either Tic62-bound, TROL-bound, or soluble. The data show that FNR:protein tether interactions change FNR sub-chloroplast distribution and impact on the dominant CEF pathway that occurs during the transition from dark to light.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In order to establish a rigorous protocol for FNR localisation by IGL, we first confirmed our antibodies are highly specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Then we performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) IGL on multiple chloroplasts from one individual. We defined sub-compartments in the chloroplast and calculated the FNR staining density within them as particles per µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The minimum number of chloroplasts necessary for a statistically sound interpretation was identified using a power analysis of this data in a mixed model test (chosen as a statistical test because the FNR density in different sub-compartments of each chloroplast is related). This was defined as three chloroplasts per individual, but we have analysed 15 to generate additional statistical power (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2a</xref>). The distance between a label and its target is influenced by the size of antibodies – meaning a label can potentially be up to 30 nm away from a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hermann et al., 1996</xref>). To ensure a conservative estimate of membrane localisation, we therefore defined an area approximately 10 nm either side of the membrane as ‘membrane bound’, and divided chloroplasts into three sub-compartments: stroma, grana core, and combined stromal exposed membranes (lamellae + margins). FNR staining density is five times higher at the lamellae/margin region than in the stroma or the grana core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), which the mixed model describes as highly significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2a</xref>). Although FNR-staining in both grana core and stroma is higher than in the cytosol, we consider this density likely originates from FNR at the lamellae/margin region, labelled by antibody oriented such that it extends beyond the defined 10 nm area either side of the TEM visualised membrane. This interpretation is based on the following reasons: (1) FNR cannot enter the grana core, due to spatial restriction, and so grana assignments must originate from antibodies tethered to FNR at the grana margins. (2) There is no statistical difference between staining density in the grana and stroma, meaning that even the low level detected in the stroma is also likely due to the orientation of label attached to membrane associated FNR. (3) Cyt <italic>f</italic> is also detected at significantly higher density in the stroma than the cytosol by IGL-TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>). Cyt <italic>f</italic> is part of the Cyt b<sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic>, an integral membrane protein that is never found in the stroma. Nevertheless, we retained the original 10 nm area to define membrane association, as this appears to detect the great majority of membrane bound proteins. We consider that a small amount of false negative assignments to grana core and stroma are preferable to the risk of false positives associated with extending the membrane assignment zone from 10 to 30 nm. As expected, there is no significant difference in Cyt <italic>f</italic> staining between different thylakoid domains. Based on this analysis, we conclude that chloroplasts contain very little soluble, stromal FNR.</p><p>It has been reported that during some fixation procedures for immunolabelling whole mammalian cells, soluble cytosolic proteins may be disproportionately washed out of samples in comparison to membrane bound proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huebinger et al., 2018</xref>). To confirm that this is not the reason for the absence of soluble-localised FNR in our sections, we therefore repeated the experiment to compare several individuals of Wt and <italic>fnr1,</italic> a genotype in which the remaining FNR (AtFNR2) is 100% soluble following mechanical disruption to extract proteins from leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lintala et al., 2007</xref>). Again, our analysis shows significantly higher label density of the margins/lamellae than the stroma in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). There is no significant difference between labelling density of stroma and grana core, indicating that there is negligible FNR in the stroma. This result, combined with previous observations that organellar proteins are much less prone to loss during fixation than cytosolic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schnell et al., 2012</xref>), strongly suggests that the FNR distribution we have measured reflects the situation in the native chloroplast. The studies that previously determined completely soluble distribution of FNR in the <italic>fnr1</italic> mutant were based on mechanical separation followed by centrifugation. By contrast, our IGL data indicate that in situ almost all FNR is thylakoid associated. The FNR previously assigned as soluble must therefore be associated with the membrane through weak associations that are disrupted during mechanical extraction.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FNR is not detected in the chloroplast stroma of higher plants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative micrograph showing immunogold labelling of FNR in sections of chloroplasts from Wt Arabidopsis detected by IGL-TEM.

We exploited genes for three maize FNR proteins (ZmFNR1, ZmFNR2, and ZmFNR3) with variable affinity to the TROL and Tic62 membrane tethers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Twachtmann et al., 2012</xref>). These were expressed in the Arabidopsis <italic>fnr1</italic> mutant, under control of the Arabidopsis <italic>FNR1</italic> promoter – resulting in approximately wild-type FNR protein contents. Western blots to show FNR proteins in these lines are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. SDS-gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) separate proteins according to mass, while native gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) separate proteins according to native charge and retain some strong protein:protein interactions. As previously reported, mechanical separation of supernatant and pellet fractions from <italic>fnr1</italic> leaves caused recovery of all FNR in the soluble fraction. We have now termed this ‘weakly bound’ FNR, based on the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In the <italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR1 genotype, ZmFNR is recovered in both the weakly bound and the pellet (now termed ‘tightly bound’) fractions. The tightly bound ZmFNR1 is mostly in high molecular weight complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) associated with TROL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, when we confirmed the specificity of our TROL antibody, we noted that total TROL abundance partly correlates with the intensity of the BNP band that reacts with both FNR and TROL antisera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), being increased in the <italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR1 line and decreased in the <italic>fnr1</italic>, <italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR2, and <italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR3 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Heterologously expressed ZmFNR2 is also found in both weakly associated and strongly bound fractions, and its expression results in the rescue of native AtFNR2 recruitment to the tightly bound membrane fraction in the <italic>fnr1</italic> genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> lower band). This lends support to the hypothesis that co-operative interactions with other FNR iso-proteins are necessary to recruit AtFNR2 to Tic62 and TROL tethers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lintala et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lintala et al., 2007</xref>). FNR is enriched at Tic62 in this line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

These were designated loose (L) and tight (T) membrane bound FNR fractions, based on the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Positions of molecular mass markers are indicated between the gels and the blots in kDa.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56088-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The plants expressing genes for the maize FNR1, FNR2, and FNR3 iso-proteins in an Arabidopsis <italic>fnr1</italic> mutant background (<italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR1, <italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR2, and <italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR3) were then analysed by IGL-TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In this case we further divided the staining density of lamellae/margin into separate margin (any stromal facing membrane adjacent to an appressed membrane) and lamellae (all thylakoid membrane not adjacent to appressed membrane) areas. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for an example of domain area labelling. We consider this a primarily functional, rather than structural, distinction, as many regions we have classed as margin will not be curved, but should have PSI and PSII in relatively close proximity. We examined the possibility that differences in chloroplast ultrastructure between genotypes might influence our findings, by comparing the relative size of our defined areas between the genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that the <italic>fnr1</italic> mutant shows a small increase in relative stromal area and corresponding decrease in relative margin area. The relative areas of chloroplast sub-compartments did not differ from the Wt in any of the other genotypes. Analysis of FNR staining density in chloroplasts of all genotypes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (statistics in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Absolute staining density might be influenced by variation in FNR-isoform antigenicity, so we have compared only between sub-chloroplast domains of each genotype. The greatest variation in distribution between genotypes is seen in the density of FNR staining associated with the lamellae (blue boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). While FNR density in the lamellae region is similar to that at the margin for Wt chloroplasts, the <italic>fnr1</italic> mutant shows a significant decrease in label density at the lamellae relative to the margins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Introduction of ZmFNR1 (TROL binding) to the <italic>fnr1</italic> background restored equal FNR density between the margins and lamellae regions. By contrast, introduction of ZmFNR2 (Tic62 binding) to the <italic>fnr1</italic> background results in much higher label density at the stromal lamellae relative to the margins. This tendency is also seen on introduction of ZmFNR3 (weak binding), but with lower statistical significance. We interpret the dramatic change in FNR localisation on ZmFNR2 expression in the <italic>fnr1</italic> background as being related to the restoration of native AtFNR2 recruitment into strong interactions at the thylakoid membrane in this genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Tether interactions determine FNR sub-chloroplast location.</title><p>Density of immunogold labelled FNR in different sub-chloroplast compartments of the indicated genotypes.

In the measurements shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, only two components are clearly observed: a fast one of less than 1 s, and a slow one that lasts ~20 s. Further characterisation of these components is described in Appendix 1. The two observed components of NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction can be fitted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2c</xref>) and vary significantly in relative size between genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2d</xref>), depending on the abundance and location of FNR. The <italic>fnr1</italic> mutant and the genotype expressing weakly bound maize FNR in the mutant background (<italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR3) show a relatively small contribution of the slow component when compared to Wt, <italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR1, and <italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR3. NADPH oxidation in the dark was well fit to a single component using a Hill coefficient and no difference between genotypes was detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2e</xref>).</p><p>We then determined that these differences in NADP(H) kinetics are not due to pleiotropic effects altering the abundance of other proteins that could impact photosynthetic electron transport or NADP(H) poise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found no differences in protein abundance that correlate with those in NADP(H) reduction and oxidation kinetics. Although this does not discount the possibility that variable FNR:FNR tether interactions could influence regulation of these proteins (see later discussion), it does allow us to discount pleiotropic changes in their total capacity.</p><p>It is reported that FNR interactions with Tic62 and TROL are weakened by exposure to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Benz et al., 2009</xref>). This means that during the illumination period of our NADP(H) measurement, these interactions will be weakened. Because interaction with Tic62 and TROL is not detected in the <italic>fnr1</italic> and <italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR3 genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which also have a diminished slow phase of NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we propose that the release of FNR from tightly bound tether locations could contribute to an increase in the activity of the enzyme. The kinetics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> suggest that either (1) strongly bound FNR (prevalent after dark adaptation) has less efficient NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction activity, and that dissociation of FNR from Tic62 and TROL therefore represents a mechanism for upregulation, or (2) there is a difference between the genotypes in the speed with which they upregulate downstream NADPH consumption processes.</p><p>We then assessed the impact of FNR location on photosynthetic electron transport. Because of the longstanding debate about the role of FNR in CEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bendall and Manasse, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bojko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buchert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hertle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hosler and Yocum, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Iwai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mosebach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shahak et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ye and Wang, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>), and the suggestion that relocation of FNR might be a mechanism to switch between LEF and CEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Breyton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Joliot and Johnson, 2011</xref>), we paid particular attention to CEF related parameters. It is reported that rates of CEF are highest in the first 20 s of illumination following dark adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Joliot and Joliot, 2005</xref>), and this corresponds to the time scale over which the slow kinetic phase of NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction kinetics develops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We therefore compared the electrochromic band shift (ECS), here used to quantify electron flow rates, following either 20 s or 5 min acclimation to actinic light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

This is a specific PSII inhibitor, which showed the same trend, but with much greater variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). When the data are normalised to a single turnover flash, it is possible to calculate rates of CEF/total EF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, see Materials and methods for a detailed explanation on the calculation procedure). As expected, for WT, there is significantly more CEF following a short (20 s) light exposure in dark adapted leaves than after light acclimation. This trend is not seen in the <italic>fnr1</italic> mutant, suggesting it lacks the capacity to upregulate CEF in dark adapted leaves. Heterologous expression of either tether bound FNR, ZmFNR1, or ZmFNR2 rescues this capacity, but the more weakly interacting ZmFNR3 does not. All genotypes show similar CEF/total EF values after light acclimation, indicating that the impact of FNR location is related to the tether interactions that occur following dark adaptation. Western blotting confirms that there is little difference in abundance of major PET components between the genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In several replicated experiments the only consistent differences seen are decreased PsbA in the <italic>fnr1</italic> line and increased PC in the <italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR3 line. Critically, there is no difference in abundance of PgrL1 or subunit 1 of the NDH complex, indicating that CEF components are equivalent and the variation seen in our measurements of CEF is related to FNR location rather than secondary effects.</p><p>We also compared activity of PSI (P700 oxidation) and PSII (chlorophyll fluorescence) in the same genotypes under identical conditions to the ECS experiment, in order to understand how these parameters relate to the ECS. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> shows selected parameters, measured after a 20 s high light treatment of either dark adapted or light acclimated plants. PSI activity (ФI) during high light treatment is higher after light acclimation and similar between all genotypes except for a small decrease in <italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR3 in dark adapted plants. As expected under high light treatment, acceptor limitation at PSI (Y(NA)) is high, and this is ameliorated somewhat by light adaptation. Unexpectedly, after dark adaptation the <italic>fnr1</italic> mutant, which theoretically has lower Fd oxidation capacity, shows lower acceptor limitation than the other genotypes. Correspondingly, measurements of (Y(ND)) show significantly higher limitation in donors to PSI for the <italic>fnr1</italic> mutant than all other genotypes.</p><p>These data are consistent with the deficiency in CEF seen in dark adapted <italic>fnr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), with fewer electrons being cycled back to the donor side of PSI. The opposite trend is seen following light acclimation, with <italic>fnr1</italic> showing higher acceptor limitation and lower donor limitation. This is consistent with decreased Fd oxidation capacity at PSI resulting in decreasing acceptor availability. The <italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR3 plants, which also appear deficient in CEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), do not show a corresponding donor side limitation at PSI following dark adaptation. This discrepancy could be related to the elevated levels of PC protein in the <italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR3 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), as PC is the electron donor to PSI. As expected, light incubation leads to much greater LEF flux, with an increase in PSII acceptor availability as seen in ФII and qL for all genotypes. Taken together, our data support a model where FNR location regulates electron transport through both LET and CET pathways.</p><p>To test this further, we repeated our IGL-TEM experiment to examine sub-chloroplast FNR localisation following light adaptation. These data are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in a comparison with those generated in the original dark adapted experiment from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Unlike the dark adapted leaves, where staining density is equivalent between margins and lamellae, light adaptation gives higher FNR density at the margins than in the lamella.

Model A, Active role in CEF for the FNR:tether complex. Tight binding of FNR to Tic62/TROL during the dark sequesters some of the enzyme on the stromal lamellae, favouring increased CEF at the onset of light (possibly involving pgr5/pgrL1 and/or interaction with the Cyt b<sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic>). As proton pumping drives ∆pH formation, FNR:tether interactions weaken, and a proportion of this enzyme relocates to PSI at the margins, increasing the rate of NADPH formation. Model B, Default CEF due to FNR deactivation on tether interaction. Binding of some FNR to the Tic62/TROL tethers inactivates the enzyme, driving CEF by default, either through the Cyt b<sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> or the NDH complex. Weakening of these associations during the light releases a proportion of this enzyme, activating it. Some of this FNR relocates to the margin region, increasing the rate of NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction.

Here we present strong evidence that this is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary files 2a, 2b</xref>) with only membrane bound FNR detected, even in genotypes where FNR was previously considered totally soluble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lintala et al., 2007</xref>). The most likely explanation for this is that the aggressive cell disruption procedures, or osmotic shock followed by solubilisation for BNP, disrupt weak associations of FNR with other membrane complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>), or possibly even the membrane itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grzyb et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grzyb et al., 2008</xref>). We have therefore redefined soluble FNR as weakly associated FNR. These results are in good agreement with an IGL study showing FNR is only found associated with the algal thylakoid in Chlamydomonas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Suss et al., 1995</xref>), though they contradict an earlier study on higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Negi et al., 2008</xref>), where the authors report co-localisation of FNR and GAPDH. In the chloroplast example shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Negi et al., 2008</xref> some of the labelled FNR appears to be in the stroma, but no details of primary or secondary antibody specificity, sample number or leaf treatment prior to sample preparation are given, which would be necessary for a valid comparison with our work. It has previously been reported that FNR is a component of the inner envelope translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stengel et al., 2008</xref>), but we detected little evidence for this in analysis of over 300 mature chloroplasts from 18 individuals (over 4500 gold particles counted). However, we cannot discount the possibility that such interactions are more prevalent earlier in chloroplast development, when protein import is more active.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Benz et al., 2010</xref> propose that FNR tethering by Tic62 is not involved in NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction. While these authors suggest that Tic62-binding prevents proteolytic degradation of FNR in the dark, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> reveal another function, critical for transient CEF on dark to light transition. This is consistent with earlier results in antisense tobacco plants, where transient CEF was negatively impacted by decreased FNR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Joliot and Johnson, 2011</xref>), although this effect has not previously been reported in Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis has two genes for FNR, and P700 re-reduction data from plants knocked-out or knocked-down for either gene have been interpreted as showing an increase in CEF after high light or temperature stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lintala et al., 2009</xref>). FNR:Tic62 and FNR:TROL interactions are disrupted at higher light intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Benz et al., 2009</xref>), meaning that specific interaction to these tethers is unlikely to withstand illumination during stress treatments. Indeed, our ECS measurements after light acclimation show no difference in CEF between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and P700 parameters indicate less donor limitation for <italic>fnr1</italic> than other genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The reported differences in P700 re-reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lintala et al., 2009</xref>) therefore likely have another cause in the <italic>fnr1</italic> mutants and <italic>fnr2</italic> knock-downs or reflect a different CEF pathway from the dark to light transition CEF measured in our work.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The function of FNR bound to Tic62 and TROL</title><p>The study of CEF in full FNR knock-outs is hampered by the essential role FNR plays in generating NADPH in LEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bendall and Manasse, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lintala et al., 2012</xref>), and previous investigation of a role for FNR-location in CEF has been complicated by the decrease in total FNR content when the Tic62 or TROL proteins are knocked out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Benz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jurić et al., 2009</xref>). Here we have generated plants with approximately wild type levels of FNR, but variable location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), allowing us to establish that tight binding to Tic62 or TROL is necessary for the transient CEF associated with the dark light transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In fact, the literature investigating a role for FNR activity in CEF is extensive, with multiple inhibitor based studies supporting this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ravenel et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shahak et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bendall and Manasse, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mills et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cleland and Bendall, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ye and Wang, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hosler and Yocum, 1985</xref>). The actual function for FNR in higher plant CEF, however, remains speculative: it has been proposed as a direct Fd:quinone reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bojko et al., 2003</xref>), or as a binding site for Fd to allow reduction of quinones via PgrL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hertle et al., 2013</xref>) or the Cyt b<sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> in both algae and higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buchert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Buchert et al., 2020</xref>). Although it is reported that interaction with Tic62 or TROL has no impact on FNR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alte et al., 2010</xref>), another possibility is that by binding to Tic62 or TROL, FNR becomes less efficient at oxidising Fd. By default, reduced Fd would then donate electrons to other pathways, including CEF. This would be consistent with the recent finding that the NDH complex uses Fd as the direct electron donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yamamoto and Shikanai, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schuller et al., 2019</xref>). It has recently been reported that both the NDH and antimycin A CEF pathways are regulated by the ATP:ADP ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>). In both cases ATP was found to act as a competitive inhibitor of reduced Fd association. It follows that an increase in the rate of Fd oxidation by FNR would result in greater ATP inhibition of CEF. Indeed, the <italic>fnr1</italic> and <italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR3 genotypes both show a greater fast-component of NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), implying faster Fd oxidation at the onset of light, and both genotypes also lack upregulated CEF following dark adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>The fact that transient CEF does not occur when total FNR content is decreased in the <italic>fnr1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and is decreased in <italic>FNR</italic> antisense tobacco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Joliot and Johnson, 2011</xref>) seems to support an active role for FNR, as any default Fd oxidation pathway would be expected to increase in these circumstances. Because several CEF pathways are regulated by redox signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Breyton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Takahashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Strand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Strand et al., 2016</xref>), it also remains possible that the impact of decreased FNR activity on CEF is indirect, through a failure to effectively poise the NADP(H) pool.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>FNR as a dynamic switch between LEF and CEF</title><p>Because the <italic>fnr1</italic> and <italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR3 genotypes, which lack Tic62 and TROL interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), retain FNR bound to the thylakoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the enzyme must occupy alternative, weaker binding sites on the membrane following release from Tic62 and TROL. This is further supported by the IGL-staining on illuminated leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), in which Tic62/TROL interactions with FNR should be disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Benz et al., 2009</xref>), but FNR remains membrane bound. We have no direct evidence for the identity of these weak sites of FNR-interaction, but it seems likely they include proteins that have previously been reported as FNR interaction partners, such as PSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 1992</xref>) or the Cytb<sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Clark et al., 1984</xref>). Indeed, specific interaction between FNR and PSI has recently been demonstrated in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Marco et al., 2019</xref>), and the authors suggest a binding site comprising PsaE and the light harvesting complexes. Proximity to PSI would result in more efficient flux of electrons from PSI to NADP<sup>+</sup>, consistent with the dominant fast component of NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction in the <italic>fnr1</italic> mutant and <italic>fnr1</italic>-ZmFNR3 genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), where all FNR is weakly associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lintala et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The <italic>fnr1</italic> mutant is also the only genotype with higher FNR density at the margin than on the lamellae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), consistent with the theory that LEF occurs predominantly on these regions of the thylakoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chow et al., 2005</xref>). As the contribution of the slow component in NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) matches the timescale of transient CEF on light to dark transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Joliot and Joliot, 2005</xref>), and FNR interaction with Tic62 and TROL tethers is weakened in the light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Benz et al., 2009</xref>) we tentatively propose the following model to explain our data: in the dark, a large amount of FNR is sequestered at Tic62 and TROL on the lamellae in a location sub-optimal for Fd oxidation, limiting NADPH production before carbon fixation is upregulated. In this location FNR promotes CEF by an as yet uncharacterised mechanism, possibly related to Pgr5 and/or PgrL1. Over light induction, these interactions are disrupted, and the enzyme relocates to associate with PSI, resulting in increased efficiency of NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction. This speculative model is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. Our measurements of NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction kinetics could be fitted by two components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2c</xref>), while this model would imply three possible changes in kinetics corresponding to dissociation, diffusion, and re-association. If the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref> is correct, at least one component must be too fast to be detected. This could either be diffusion, due to close proximity of the Tic62/TROL membrane tethers to PSI, or association with PSI following a slow diffusion phase.</p><p>Although we propose that the slow phase of NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) results from changes in FNR activity, we cannot exclude the possibility that it is caused by regulation of the rate of NADP<sup>+</sup> consumption. In this way, variable slow phase contributions could reflect differential regulation (originating in the redox state of the Fd and NADP(H) pools) of fast, NADPH consuming enzymatic processes downstream. The dominant NADPH consuming reaction in the chloroplast is catalysed by glyceraldehyde 3 P dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in the Calvin Benson Basham (CBB) cycle of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, which is regulated by thioredoxin (Trx)-mediated thiol reduction and oxidised glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wolosiuk and Buchanan, 1978</xref>). Indeed, we previously measured differences in both steady state Trx regulation and glutathione redox poise associated with FNR abundance and membrane localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kozuleva et al., 2016</xref>). Because thiol reduction of GAPDH acts to increase allosteric upregulation by 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baalmann et al., 1995</xref>), and levels of CBB intermediates in isolated chloroplasts are very low, leading to a lag phase in starting the cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baldry et al., 1966</xref>) it is unlikely that GAPDH activity will change significantly in dark adapted chloroplasts during the 30 s time-frame of our experiment. Nevertheless, it may be that even small changes in activity of such an abundant enzyme could contribute to the kinetics shown here. We also previously found that FNR abundance and location correlated with the thiol-mediated activation state of NADPH malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kozuleva et al., 2016</xref>), another powerful sink, which is upregulated much faster than GAPDH in isolated chloroplasts, as the allosteric regulator involved is NADPH itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Scheibe, 2004</xref>). We therefore repeated the NADPH kinetic measurements with an <italic>nadp-mdh</italic> knock-out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>), but found no change in the amplitude of the slow phase of NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction relative to wild type. We cannot rule out an impact on other NADPH-dependent processes in the chloroplast being influenced by FNR location, especially those regulated by thiol regulation cascades originating in the redox state of Fd or NADP(H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yoshida and Hisabori, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Naranjo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nikkanen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hashida et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Based on the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, another intriguing possibility is an impact of CEF on NADP(H) turnover. For example, the slow phase of NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction might reflect activity of the proposed NADPH consuming CEF pathway utilising the reverse catalytic reaction of FNR when the enzyme is bound to the Cytb<sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). Alternatively, upregulation of the NDH complex by NADPH poise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nikkanen et al., 2018</xref>) or redox regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Strand et al., 2015</xref>) could be influenced by FNR location, resulting in differential competition for reduced Fd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schuller et al., 2019</xref>) and variable substrate availability for FNR.</p><p>It is also possible that during the light FNR remains associated with the membrane tether proteins, but is activated through a change from strong to weak binding. We have interrogated this hypothesis by repeating the IGL experiment on Wt plants after light acclimation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We find that, in contrast to dark adapted plants, there is higher FNR density at the margins than on the lamellae (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), supporting a model of some FNR diffusion to sites of high LEF. It therefore seems likely that, in higher plants, FNR does indeed change interaction partners and consequently sub-chloroplast location, as part of a mechanism to decrease CEF and increase LEF during light adaptation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top">FNR1; <break/>FNR2</td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">AT5G66190; AT1G20020</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Zea mays</italic>)</td><td valign="top">FNR1; <break/>FNR2; <break/>FNR3; <break/>TROL</td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">BAA88236; BAA88237; ACF85815; <break/>ACF79627.1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BL21(DE3)</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="top">EC0114</td><td valign="top">Competent cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>A. thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Columbia; <break/>Columbia <italic>fnr1</italic>; <break/>Columbia ZmFNR1; <break/>Columbia ZmFNR3</td><td valign="top">Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) <break/>See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Twachtmann et al., 2012</xref> for over-expression line generation</td><td valign="top"><italic>wt;</italic> <break/><italic>AT1G20020</italic> T-DNA insertion mutant; <break/>Line expressing BAA88236 under control of the AT1G20020 promoter; <break/>Line expressing ACF85815 under control of the AT1G20020 promoter</td><td valign="top">See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanke et al., 2008</xref> for mutant isolation;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-maize FNR2 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">This paper <break/>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Okutani et al., 2005</xref>)</td><td valign="top">BAA88237</td><td valign="top">IG-TEM (1:200), WB (1:50,000).

After 20 s or 5 min of illumination, LEF and CEF were measured by following the relaxation kinetics of the carotenoid electrochromic bandshift at 520 nm (corrected for the signal at 546 nm) using a JTS-10 spectrophotometer (Biologic, France). The ECS spectral change is a shift in the pigment absorption bands that is linearly correlated with the light-induced generation of a membrane potential across the thylakoid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bailleul et al., 2010</xref>). Under steady state continuous illumination, the ECS signal stems from transmembrane potential generation by PSII, the cytochrome <italic>b<sub>6</sub>f</italic> complex, and PSI and from transmembrane potential dissipation by the ATP synthase CF<sub>0</sub>-F<sub>1</sub>. When light is switched off, reaction centre's activity stops immediately, while ATPase and the cytochrome <italic>b<sub>6</sub>f</italic> complex activities remain (transiently) unchanged. Therefore, the initial rate of ECS decay is proportional to the rate of PSI and PSII photochemistry (i.e. to the rate of 'total’ electron flow). This can be calculated dividing this rate (expressed as -ΔI/I per unit of time) by the amplitude of the ECS signal (again expressed as −ΔI/I) induced by the transfer of one charge across the membrane (e.g. one PSI turnover). The rate of CEF can be evaluated using the same approach under conditions where PSII activity is inhibited. Typically, this is done by preventing PSII activity with DCMU. In our experiments, we found that leaf infiltration with DCMU did not result in homogeneous inhibition of PSII, as tested by measuring fluorescence transients in the leaves using an imaging setup (Speedzen, JbeamBio, France), causing high variability and high estimations of CEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, another approach was employed to evaluate CEF, i.e. exposure to saturating far red light (λ &gt;720 nm), to fully excite PSI with a minimum excitation of PSII. Results were expressed as electrons<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and estimated from the amplitude of the electrochromic shift signal upon excitation with a saturating single turnover flash (five ns laser pulse). Total electron flow was measured following a pulse of actinic light (λ = 640 ± 20 nm FWHM) at 1100 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> while CEF was measured with a pulse of far red light at the maximum setting (estimated as 1400 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> by the manufacturer).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Chlorophyll fluorescence and P<sub>700 </sub>absorption</title><p>Chlorophyll fluorescence and P<sub>700</sub> absorption were simultaneously analysed using the DUAL-PAM-100 system (Heinz Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany), and parameters calculated as described in the DUAL-PAM handbook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Klughammer and Schreiber, 2008</xref>). Plants were first dark incubated for 30 min before determination of F<sub>0</sub> as dark fluorescence yield. Change in P700 signal was monitored as the difference in transmittance at 875 nm and 830 nm. The maximum change in P<sub>700</sub> signal indicated as P<sub>m</sub> was measured by application of far red light for 30 s followed by application of a saturating pulse. We confirmed that P<sub>m</sub> was not significantly underestimated in mutants with decreased acceptor limitation at PSI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2f</xref>). In addition the maximum fluorescence yield F<sub>m</sub> of dark adapted leaves was determined before illumination. For the dark adapted measurement, plants were directly subjected to high light (1100 µE m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> PAR) with saturation pulses applied after 5 s and 20 s. Light acclimated plants were instead illuminated in the DUAL-PAM leaf clip at 150 µE m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> PAR for 5 min before application of the 1100 µE m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> high light and saturating pulses after 5 s and 20 s. Typical fluorescence and P700 oxidation traces are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>. Only data from the pulses applied after 20 s of high light were used to generate the data presented. The maximal fluorescence yield F<sub>m</sub>’ or maximum change in P<sub>700</sub> signal P<sub>m</sub>’ were determined on each saturating pulse, while the current fluorescence yield F was measured before each pulse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>Arabidopsis Genome Initiative locus identifiers for the genes mentioned in this article are as follows: maize <italic>FNR1</italic>, BAA88236; maize <italic>FNR2</italic>, BAA88237; maize <italic>FNR3</italic>, ACF85815; Arabidopsis <italic>FNR1</italic>, AT5G66190; Arabidopsis <italic>FNR2</italic>, AT1G20020; maize Tic62, ACG28394.1; Arabidopsis <italic>Tic62</italic>, AT3G18890; maize <italic>TROL</italic>, ACF79627.1; Arabidopsis <italic>TROL</italic>, AT4G01050.1.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by funding from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through (Project 2 in the Collaborative Research Center (SFB) 944) and BBSRC (BB/R004838/1) to G.T.H.

interpretation of the 2 phases fit to NADP(H) reduction and oxidation kinetics in intact plastids</title><boxed-text><p>Several phases of light-dependent fluorescence in chloroplasts (most much faster than those described here) at equivalent wavelengths have previously been described and extensive characterisation indicates that they are due to light-dependent reduction of NADP<sup>+</sup>, with little or no contribution from protein content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Latouche et al., 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, as the relative amplitude of these two NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) is dependent on tight binding of FNR to the thylakoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we sought to further characterise our system.</p><p>We initially assumed that only intact chloroplasts were likely to contribute to the signal. This is because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Latouche et al., 2000</xref> estimated that as little as 2.5–3% of all NADP(H) is free in the stroma (amounting to approximately 1–3 µM), meaning soluble NADP(H) from ruptured chloroplasts would be subject to a huge dilution factor at the concentrations in our assay (chlorophyll concentrations of 3–6 µg /ml). However, controls with deliberately ruptured chloroplasts give some light-dependent kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>), albeit at lower amplitude and with higher noise than intact chloroplasts. One explanation for this could be that a significant proportion of chloroplast NADP(H) remains bound strongly to the FNR enzyme. It is estimated that as much as 44% of chloroplast NADPH is bound to FNR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Latouche et al., 2000</xref>). If NADP+ remains bound to FNR in a solution of ruptured chloroplasts, then a cascade of PSI &gt; Fd &gt; FNR could support its reduction. When data from ruptured chloroplast traces are fitted, they do not reveal distinct phases, but rather a rapid reduction and oxidation. This demonstrates that ruptured chloroplasts are not the source of the slow phase of NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction.</p><p>Although NADH levels are reported to be undetectably low in isolated chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heineke et al., 1991</xref>) light-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> reduction in leaf chloroplasts was recently reported using fluorescent markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lim et al., 2020</xref>) and might contribute specifically to one of the phases detected in our measurements. FNR affinity for NAD<sup>+</sup> is extremely low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Piubelli et al., 2000</xref>) but indirect flux through other enzymes is possible, the most likely route being an internal malate valve comprising both NADP(H)- and NAD(H)-dependent malate dehydrogenase (MDH) enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Selinski and Scheibe, 2019</xref>). To test this possibility, the experiment was repeated with a <italic>nadp-mdh</italic> mutant, which shows identical kinetics to the wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>), indicating that light-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> reduction probably makes an undetectable contribution to the signal we measure.</p><p>These results and the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Latouche et al., 2000</xref> indicate that the kinetics detected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref> result from light-dependent changes in the turnover of NADP(H) in intact chloroplasts. As the measurements were performed on dark adapted chloroplasts, the slow phase likely reflects the relatively slow (10–20 s) light-dependent regulation of either a fast NADP(H) reduction or oxidation process. Because the amplitude of the slow phase correlates with FNR:FNR-tether protein interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and its time frame corresponds to the generation of ΔpH (shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alte et al., 2010</xref> to drive dissociation of FNR from tether proteins), we hypothesise that this could correspond to upregulation of NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction, on release of FNR from the tether proteins. However, it is also possible that the slow phase originates in light-dependent changes to downstream NADPH consumption processes, and it may be that secondary effects of FNR-FNR tether protein interactions also have an impact here. For example, this might particularly be the case for processes subject to thiol-regulation by cascades originating in the redox state of NADP(H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yoshida and Hisabori, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Naranjo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nikkanen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hashida et al., 2018</xref>). Another possibility might be slow saturation of an NADPH-dependent electron sink, the most likely candidate being glutathione reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Foyer and Halliwell, 1976</xref>). However, we have found that, compared to the Wt, glutathione is in a more oxidised state in <italic>fnr1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kozuleva et al., 2016</xref>), which would not be consistent with the smaller contribution of the slow phase to NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction kinetics in this genotype.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Examination of the two phases detected in fluorescent measurement of light-dependent NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction.</title><p>Traces show NADPH fluorescence of dark adapted Arabidopsis chloroplasts measured over a short light exposure from 10 to 40 s.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is 'in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>'.

(If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work describes significant, new results that help answer long-standing question about the roles of FNR in regulating the partitioning of electrons from photosystem I (PSI) into linear electron flow (LEF) and cyclic electron flow (CEF). Both reviewers felt that the work makes a strong contribution to a long-standing and perplexing area of photosynthesis research. One strength of the work is that it critically tests some of the past assumptions about how, or even if, this re-localization occurs, and comes to the provocative conclusion that much of the previous work needs to be re-evaluated, with important consequences for a number of models proposed in the literature. Specifically, the previously proposed soluble forms of FNR are shown to remain membrane-associated, but that the localization within different thylakoid domains is variable. They then perform a number of genetics and spectroscopic measurements that are interpreted to support a role for the changes in localization of FNR to regulating electron flow. However, both reviewers also concluded that there were substantial issues, in experimental interpretation and statistical analysis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers also concluded that there were substantial issues that must be addressed. Some of these issues may require some additional experimental work, but it is also possible that they can be dealt with by more rigorous analysis and interpretation of the results the group already has on hand. For example, it may be possible to deal with the reviewer #1's criticism of the interpretation of photosystem I absorbance signals, by reanalyzing the raw data.</p><p>However, other issues, e.g. the statistical analysis in Figure 4 brought up by both reviewers, appear to require additional experimental results, and this may delay resubmission.</p><p>Both reviewers recommended specific approached to most easily address these issues.</p><p>The discussion should be modified along the lines of the reviewers' comments to better reflect the strengths and weaknesses of the data sets and the current state of the field.</p><p>While it is understandable that one would as high impact a title as possible, it should not make declarations that are not supported by the paper itself.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript revisits a long-standing, and quite mysterious, set of observations in which FNR1 and FNR2 appear can be differentially localized near the thylakoid membrane or in the stroma, possibly regulating the partitioning of electrons from photosystem I (PSI) into linear electron flow (LEF) and cyclic electron flow (CEF). What I like about the work is that it critically reviews some of the past assumptions about how, or even if, this re-localization occurs, and comes to the provocative conclusion that much of the previous work needs to be re-evaluated, with important consequences for a number of models proposed in the literature. Specifically, the previously proposed soluble forms of FNR are shown to remain membrane-associated, but that the localization within different thylakoid domains is variable.

More likely explanations include the following:</p><p>1) It is also possible that the system is heterogeneous, so that different subpopulations of chloroplasts or pools within chloroplasts behave differently. For instance, the presence of a fraction of broken or damaged chloroplasts could give rise to a slow NADP+ reduction phase;</p><p>2) Reduction of other electron carriers, including NADH which would also contribute to blue fluorescence, or bound NAD(P)H which has been reported to have a higher fluorescence yield than their free forms;</p><p>3) The slow rise represents is controlled by downstream re-oxidation of previously reduced NADPH. The immediate rise in fluorescence is, indeed, consistent with a model in which a local pool of NADPH goes rapidly reduced when the light is switched on. In this case, The slow rise may reflect NADPH further net reduction of NADPH, but not because of low accessibility of FNR/NADP+ but rather changes in the reoxidation of reduced NADPH. In this case, in initial extent of NADPH reduction is set by competition between reduction and re-oxidation, and the slow rise is caused by either increased in reduction or decreases in re-oxidation. For example, there may be a pool of oxidant for NADPH that is slowly reduced during the slow phase. Or, a local pool of O2 could be depleted during the slow rise time.</p><p>The complex, multiphasic decay kinetics in the dark seem to be consistent with this type of model. For example, there are clearly fast phases of decay in fnr1 and fnr1 ZmFNR2 that are not fit to the &quot;simple second order kinetics&quot; model used in the manuscript. (Indeed, there is no strong rationale for using simple second-order kinetics, which assumes that the system is homogeneous but with limiting concentrations of two substrates.) This simple second order model cannot account for the rapid decay phases (see above). For instance, it is possible that a very rapid re-oxidation process would introduce a quite rapid decay phase that, even if small in amplitude, would constitute a large fraction of the flux. Indeed, the kinetics are quite complex and thus simple second order behavior is likely to be an oversimplification. This may also explain the improved fits when modulating the ad hoc Hill cooperativity term.</p><p>“We then determined that these differences in NADP(H) kinetics are not due to secondary impact on other PET chain components, by examining abundance of proteins that could impact photosynthetic electron transport or NADP(H) poise (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).

In that case, the third component could be essentially invisible, if the proposed diffusional excursion ends with much faster process.

However, some important problems remain, especially regarding the interpretation of the NADPH florescence kinetics. As brought up by reviewer #1 in the first review, and further expanded on be reviewer #2 in the second review, the biphasic characteristics of the fluorescence rise can have multiple interpretations, and this issue has not been addressed in the revised text, which still sticks to an over-simplistic interpretation and the text needs to introduce other possible interpretations especially because the data presented thus far cannot exclude them. The reviewer and editor feel that an acknowledgement and full discussion of these possibilities is not only essential for the science, it will strengthen the paper substantially.</p><p>The paper may be acceptable for publication if this, and the smaller issues brought up by Reviewer #2, can be addressed. In particular, the revision must address the inaccurate interpretation of the Kauny/Setif reference and discuss possible alternative interpretations of the fast and slow phases of the NADPH kinetics.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p>Although the regulation of cyclic electron flow (CEF) in plant chloroplasts has been clearly demonstrated, its mechanism has yet to be established. The present work investigates the hypothesis that regulation of CEF is exerted via the re-positioning of ferredoxin-NADP reductase (FNR) to different places on the thlyakoid. The work begins with an immunogold electron microscopic analysis of the distribution of FNR in chloroplast of several Arabidopsis mutants that have previously shown to have different associations with the thylakoids, though interestingly, all forms appear to be associated with the thylakoid and none free in the stroma. Correlations between the distribution of FNR and the characteristics of CEF was then anlayzed using multiple approaches, and although some assays were not necessarily unambiguous, overall the data presents a reasonably compelling argument that FNR re-positioning underlies the observed switching in the intensity of CEF, at least during the dark-light transition.</p><p>By and large the questions have been mostly addressed, however some problems remain regarding the NADPH florescence kinetics, specifically their biphasic characteristics of their rise. The authors still have not excluded other downstream processes as being responsible for the slow phase. These can be slowly changing fast rates of redox sinks. In other words, these can be relatively fast NADPH consumption process (very fast relative to the times scales of the experiment), but their rates can be slowly changing. The argument post about the lack of biphasicity cyanobacteria (Kauny/Setif reference) is not accurate: although clearly different kinetics, with different shapes are involved in cyanobacteria, the slower phases are clearly visible and actually correlate to things like state transitions and the activation of the Calvin cycle. Accordingly, processes downstream of PSET (but interacting due to back-propagation effects) seem to be responsible for these multi second kinetic features. Since thee are intact chloroplasts, it is clearly possible such effects are present in the current experiments. Thus the argument based on measuring the abundance of electron transport chain components is not sufficient to strongly argue against the dominance of downstream processes in governing the slower phase. This needs to be clearly articulated in the main results text as well as in discussion. That said, the hypothesis that relocation accounts for these phases is not excluded either and altogether the interpretations seem to hold together. Nevertheless, the cited weakness needs to temper the strength of the arguments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56088.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers also concluded that there were substantial issues that must be addressed.

Because of the variation between experiments performed on different days and in different labs, we selected a representative dataset (with the clearest signal) for fitting. We have now repeated the experiment a further 3-6 times for each genotype with plants grown in identical conditions to obtain robust averages, and performed statistical analysis, showing that differences between genotypes are not random.

We have performed the experiment with deliberately ruptured chloroplasts (Appendix 1—figure 1) which show a considerably lower light dependent signal, greater noise and the absence of the slow kinetic phase. As we now write in the text (Appendix 1), we think that the reason for the residual light dependent activity is that a considerable proportion of chloroplast NADP(H) is thought to be bound to the FNR enzyme (Latouche et al., 2000), and therefore can be reduced effectively even in a ruptured chloroplast system. This experiment does establish that the slow phase of kinetics is dependent on intact chloroplasts.</p><p>On the other hand we certainly agree with the reviewer that different pools of NADP(H) within chloroplasts may behave differently.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reduction of other electron carriers, including NADH which would also contribute to blue fluorescence, or bound NAD(P)H which has been reported to have a higher fluorescence yield than their free forms;</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, protein bound NADPH has a higher fluorescence than NADPH free in solution (L.N.M Duysens, G.H.M Kronenberg (1957) BBA, 26: 437-438; T.G Scott, R.D Spencer, N.L Leonard, G Weber (1970) JACS, 92:687-695), and so we initially thought that the slow phase we measure might be due to slow association of NADPH with enzymes. FNR binds a considerable proportion of free NADP+ (Latouche et al., 2000) and it could therefore be that the decreased FNR abundance in the fnr1 mutant might be related to the decreased amplitude of the slow phase. However, heterologous expression of ZmFNR3 in the fnr1 mutant yields Wt levels of FNR, but still fails to rescue the amplitude of this slow phase, suggesting that FNR location, rather than abundance is responsible. This is in line with the findings of Latouche et al. (2000), who conclude that neither protein binding, nor flavins within enzymes (an important consideration when using plants with variable FNR content) contribute to light dependent NADPH fluorescence in isolated chloroplasts after extensive characterisation of the technique, as we now discuss in Appendix 1.</p><p>On conducting these experiments we assumed negligible contribution of NADH to the fluorescence, based on the undetectably low NADH levels reported in illuminated, isolated chloroplasts by (Heineke et al., 1991, Plant Physiology 95, 1131). However, since our intial submission, there has been a report that, based on expression of NADPH and NADH responsive fluorescent proteins in cytosol and stroma, NADH levels do indeed rise in the stroma at the onset of light (Lim et al., Nat Comm 11, 3238). FNR affinity for NAD(H) is extremely low (Piubelli et al., 2000) and no enzyme capable of light dependent reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> has yet been identified. NADPH dependent reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> is possible, as suggested by Lim et al. (2020) and we have tested this in the following way. The dominant pathway for NADPH/NADH interconversion is an internal chloroplast OAA/malate shuttle, comprising NADP(H) malate dehydrogenase and NAD(H) malate dehydrogenase (both present in the chloroplast, see Selinsky and Scheibe 2018). Thiol upregulation of NADP-MDH over a similar time scale as the development of the slow phase makes this a good candidate. We therefore repeated our NADP(H) kinetics experiment with a T-DNA knock out of this enzyme (nadp-mdh), of which an example trace is shown in Appendix 1—figure 1. If light dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> reduction is contributing to the fluorescence seen in our measurement, then this mutant should show significant perturbation in the kinetics, but instead it shows a nearly identical kinetic pattern to the Wt. This is now discussed in Appendix 1. In our opinion, this means a contribution of NADH to the light dependent kinetics in our chloroplast preparations is unlikely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The slow rise represents is controlled by downstream re-oxidation of previously reduced NADPH. The immediate rise in fluorescence is, indeed, consistent with a model in which a local pool of NADPH goes rapidly reduced when the light is switched on. In this case, The slow rise may reflect NADPH further net reduction of NADPH, but not because of low accessibility of FNR/NADP+ but rather changes in the reoxidation of reduced NADPH. In this case, in initial extent of NADPH reduction is set by competition between reduction and re-oxidation, and the slow rise is caused by either increased in reduction or decreases in re-oxidation. For example, there may be a pool of oxidant for NADPH that is slowly reduced during the slow phase. Or, a local pool of O2 could be depleted during the slow rise time.</p></disp-quote><p>If we interpret this comment correctly, the reviewer suggests that the slow phase in Figure 4 could be due to an increase in the rate of NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction, or a decrease in the rate NADPH oxidation over the “slow phase”. In the first case – this is consistent with what we are suggesting in the paper. We now provide 2 models (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) showing possible ways that NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction activity and CEF might change according to FNR location over the dark to light transition. We base these models on the fact that the slow phase amplitude correlates with genotypes that have strong FNR: membrane interaction, and that in Wt these interactions are reported to be disrupted in the light (Benz et al., 2009) and at pH values expected in the stroma during the light (Alte et al., 2010).</p><p>In the second case, it is possible that, as the reviewer suggests, there could be a decrease in the rate of NADPH consumption. We now mention this in Appendix 1. The reviewer suggests as an example the oxidation of a localised pool of O<sub>2</sub>. Although it is hard to understand how this would correlate with tight binding of FNR to Tic62/TROL tethers, we have considered that it could be due to slow saturation of glutathione reduction (by NADPH dependent glutathione reductase), which would be indirectly connected to O<sub>2</sub> reduction. However, in previous work we found that under illumination the glutathione pool of the fnr1 mutant is actually more oxidised than that of the Wt (Kozuleva et al., 2016), which would be at odds with the smaller contribution of the slow phase seen in this mutant in Figure 4. As the data we present in Figure 4 are averages of repetitive measurements on isolated chloroplasts, it is unlikely that it represents exhaustion of a metabolite resulting in a decrease in NADPH oxidation.</p><p>Finally, the slow phase seen in our (and other) chloroplast preparations is absent from NADPH fluorescence measurements on cyanobacteria (Kauny and Setif, 2014). In cyanobacteria, FNR is permanently bound to the thylakoid by a phycobilisome linker peptide (Korn et al. 2009, JBC 284, 31789), so movement between complexes / locations is not likely. This indicates that the slow phase of NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction is either related to a specific property of higher plant FNR (such as interaction with the Tic62/TROL membrane tethers and various other complexes) or chloroplast specific metabolism. This is now also discussed in Appendix 1. We accept that our explanation that the slow phase may be due to FNR dissociating from one complex and re-associating with another (as previously suggested by Johnson and Joliot, among others) could prove to be wrong, but based on current evidence it seems the most likely explanation in our opinion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The complex, multiphasic decay kinetics in the dark seem to be consistent with this type of model. For example, there are clearly fast phases of decay in fnr1 and fnr1 ZmFNR2 that are not fit to the &quot;simple second order kinetics&quot; model used in the manuscript. (Indeed, there is no strong rationale for using simple second-order kinetics, which assumes that the system is homogeneous but with limiting concentrations of two substrates.) This simple second order model cannot account for the rapid decay phases (see above). For instance, it is possible that a very rapid re-oxidation process would introduce a quite rapid decay phase that, even if small in amplitude, would constitute a large fraction of the flux. Indeed, the kinetics are quite complex and thus simple second order behavior is likely to be an oversimplification. This may also explain the improved fits when modulating the ad hoc Hill cooperativity term.</p></disp-quote><p>The differences in NADPH oxidation could not be clearly discerned in all the individual chloroplast preparations, and so we have removed this analysis and any discussion of it from the text. Regarding the Hill coefficient, we acknowledge that the fitting is purely phenomenological and we make no attempt to fit a physical model to the data – it is simply used to obtain some useful characterization of the kinetics. The parameters probably have little physical meaning in and of themselves but in a relative sense they are informative. We chose a Hill type function because neither mono- nor bi-exponential functions provided a reasonable fit. Adding further exponentials would probably improve the fit of the data, but also run the danger of over-fitting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“We then determined that these differences in NADP(H) kinetics are not due to secondary impact on other PET chain components, by examining abundance of proteins that could impact photosynthetic electron transport or NADP(H) poise (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).

This was previously mentioned only in the figure legends, but we have now also mentioned it in the Materials and methods to make this clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is important to show the kinetics of the P700 signals because with strong PSI acceptor limitations a strong pulse of actinic light can result in rapid accumulation of electrons on PSI acceptors, preventing one from determining the real amplitude of Pm or Pm'. In many cases, application of far red light minimized this issue, but in the case of fnr1, in which the capacity for oxidation of Fd is constitutively low, it is quite likely that this will not help. Underestimating Pm should artifactually decrease Y(NA).</p></disp-quote><p>We did indeed check that our data were not due to underestimation of Pm, but did not include this data in the original manuscript. These are now supplied as a table in Supplementary file 2f, and show a small (but not significant) decrease in the original Pm measurement for the fnr1 mutant, indicating that this is not a significant problem in our measurement. This is now mentioned in the text. In addition, it should be pointed out that following light adaptation, the Y(NA) value of the fnr1 mutant becomes significantly higher (about 200%) than that of other genotypes (Figure 5), implying that the lower value seen after dark adaptation is not an underestimation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The best way to determine if these issues impact the results is to show the raw traces and look for the transient behavior of the P700+ signal.</p></disp-quote><p>See earlier comment above about Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;The non-photochemical quenching parameters for PSI were calculated with Y(ND) = 1-P700 red. and Y(NA) = (Pm-Pm') / Pm.

One of the best demonstration of the rapid rates of switching between LEF and CEF is Luker et al., who showed it was rapid indeed, on the order of tens of seconds. How can changing the localization of FNR and its interactions with the thylakoid membrane respond this quickly?</p></disp-quote><p>We think that FNR relocation is definitely not the only mechanism of regulating CEF/LEF pathways, and probably not the dominant one – especially in high light. It is therefore hard to speculate about which CEF pathway is being measured in the work by Luker et al. based on our findings. However, we can elaborate on the suggestion we make in the discussion: FNR interactions with TROL and Tic62 tethers are subject to pH regulation (Alte et al., 2010), weakening as pH rises in the stroma. The change in Δ pH at the onset of light happens on the timescale of seconds or tens of seconds, providing a possible prompt for FNR release. In terms of association with (presumably) PSI and antennae (as shown by Marco et al., 2019), nothing is known about regulation, but given the failure to detect it in blue native gels it must be weaker than with TROL or Tic62. In the absence of other evidence to date, our assumption is that this interaction takes place by default on release from Tic62/TROL on a timescale of tens of seconds. We hope to examine this in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is a strong contribution that analyzes the correlation between the distribution of FNR alone sections of the chloroplast and the characteristics of cyclic electron flow. The topic addresses important controversial question about how cyclic electron transport is transiently upregulated and them down regulated during the dark light transition ---- a brief period when excess light energy cannot yet be adequately utilized because the time it takes to activate the carbon fixation reactions of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. Significance also relates to The fact that similar regulatory features are probably necessary for the protection stabilization of the photosynthetic mechanism in fluctuating environmental conditions. Therefore, I rate the overall significance this manuscript as high.</p><p>Technically, this appears to be a well-executed set of wisely chosen experiments. There are some grammatical issues, but overall the manuscript is clearly written with interesting discussions. Apart from some clarifications on the interpretation of the kinetics, I find no serious glitches in this article and offer only a few minor additional suggestions:</p><p>It would be a good idea to briefly define what control coefficient means since this aspect of metabolic theory is not so widely studied, despite its importance.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a definition in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results paragraph seven (this paragraph and next):</p><p>This discussion would benefit from some re-working to clarify.

We are reluctant to include a model as a main figure, as we believe this is still quite speculative, but we now present two possible alternative graphical models as an additional Figure in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 is fit with two components, yet the discussion would seem to imply a third sequential component that needs to be accounted for in the fit. If the strongly bound form is not simply &quot;less efficient&quot;, but essentially inactive, then slow component refers to the time of diffusion and (or release assuming very fast diffusion). In that case, the third component could be essentially invisible, if the proposed diffusional excursion ends with much faster process. Intermediate situations would be a more complex situation and I think it would probably appear as a more sigmoidal characteristic of the slow phase as those mobilized convert to faster activity. Don't know if this makes sense, but definitely the authors need to better express their ideas in the context of a model.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point, and we thank the reviewer for the insightful comment. We have amended the text about dissociation, and removed the speculation about weak associations from the Results section, and now integrate it into the Discussion, amended to try and better express that i) dissociation, diffusion and association could be expected to contribute 3 distinct components, ii) that one of these components is either silent (possibly because of inactivation on binding), or too fast to be detected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think this is not a change in efficiency but the existence of two parallel reactions with different efficiencies (see above).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is highly likely, and we have amended the text to simply state that the slowly increasing phase of NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction kinetics (rather than any change in enzymatic efficiency) is on the same time scale. In addition, this possibility is presented in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should consider the recent finding that the NADH-1 complex appears not to use NADPH, but Fd which would be in line with their interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now incorporated this information.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers judged that the current revisions corrected most of the issues, mainly by eliminating some areas of over-interpretation and narrowing the focus of the discuss. However, some important problems remain, especially regarding the interpretation of the NADPH florescence kinetics. As brought up by reviewer #1 in the first review, and further expanded on be reviewer #2 in the second review, the biphasic characteristics of the fluorescence rise can have multiple interpretations, and this issue has not been addressed in the revised text, which still sticks to an over-simplistic interpretation and the text needs to introduce other possible interpretations especially because the data presented thus far cannot exclude them. The reviewer and editor feel that an acknowledgement and full discussion of these possibilities is not only essential for the science, it will strengthen the paper substantially.</p><p>The paper may be acceptable for publication if this, and the smaller issues brought up by reviewer #2, can be addressed.

The authors still have not excluded other downstream processes as being responsible for the slow phase. These can be slowly changing fast rates of redox sinks. In other words, these can be relatively fast NADPH consumption process (very fast relative to the times scales of the experiment), but their rates can be slowly changing. The argument post about the lack of biphasicity cyanobacteria (Kauny/Setif reference) is not accurate: although clearly different kinetics, with different shapes are involved in cyanobacteria, the slower phases are clearly visible and actually correlate to things like state transitions and the activation of the Calvin cycle. Accordingly, processes downstream of PSET (but interacting due to back-propagation effects) seem to be responsible for these multi second kinetic features.</p></disp-quote><p>The discussion of cyanobacterial NADP(H) kinetics has been removed from the Appendix text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since there are intact chloroplasts, it is clearly possible such effects are present in the current experiments. Thus the argument based on measuring the abundance of electron transport chain components is not sufficient to strongly argue against the dominance of downstream processes in governing the slower phase. This needs to be clearly articulated in the main results text as well as in discussion. That said, the hypothesis that relocation accounts for these phases is not excluded either and altogether the interpretations seem to hold together. Nevertheless, the cited weakness needs to temper the strength of the arguments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and on reflection this should have been spelled out more clearly in the text. We have now introduced this possibility in the Results section, and expanded on it in more detail in the discussion and Appendix 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
