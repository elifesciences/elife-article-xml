Dysregulation of these processes underlies diverse ion channelopathies including cardiac arrhythmias and cystic fibrosis. Ubiquitination powerfully regulates multiple steps in the channel lifecycle, yet basic mechanistic understanding is confounded by promiscuity among E3 ligase/substrate interactions and ubiquitin code complexity. Here we targeted the catalytic domain of E3 ligase, CHIP, to YFP-tagged KCNQ1 ± KCNE1 subunits with a GFP-nanobody to selectively manipulate this channel complex in heterologous cells and adult rat cardiomyocytes. Engineered CHIP enhanced KCNQ1 ubiquitination, eliminated KCNQ1 surface-density, and abolished reconstituted K<sup>+</sup> currents without affecting protein expression. A chemo-genetic variation enabling chemical control of ubiquitination revealed KCNQ1 surface-density declined with a ~ 3.5 hr <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> by impaired forward trafficking. The results illustrate utility of engineered E3 ligases to elucidate mechanisms underlying ubiquitin regulation of membrane proteins, and to achieve effective post-translational functional knockdown of ion channels.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29744.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are surrounded by a membrane that separates the outside of the cell from its inside. Proteins called ion channels are embedded within this membrane and allow charged ions to move in and out of the cell. The movement of ions generates electrical currents that are essential for many processes that keep us alive, including our heartbeat and the activity within our brain.</p><p>Like many other proteins, newly made ion channels undergo several steps before they mature and become active. Cells destroy any proteins that do not mature properly, as well as those that become damaged or are simply no longer needed. A small protein called ubiquitin helps to mark such unwanted proteins for destruction. Enzymes known as E3 ligases attach ubiquitin to target proteins in a process known as ubiquitination. This process regulates both the quality and amount of proteins within cells.</p><p>To understand the role of a particular protein, it is often necessary to remove it from the cell and then examine the consequences. In the past, researchers have harnessed the ubiquitin system to remove many kinds of proteins, but this approach had not previously been used to target an ion channel.</p><p>Now, Kanner et al. set out to selectively eliminate ion channels via targeted ubiquitination. The experiments showed that previous approaches that could destroy proteins within the cell were not effective against ion channels. Kanner et al. then engineered a particular E3 ligase so that it could selectively attach ubiquitin to the desired ion channels. This approach successfully prevented the channels from reaching the cell membrane, thereby silencing the electrical currents that they normally generate. Additionally, a new tool was developed to stop ion channels in their tracks, essentially with a flip of a chemical switch. Kanner et al. then used this approach to manipulate ion channels in a highly controlled manner, within their normal environment of heart muscle cells.</p><p>These new approaches form a toolset that scientists can now exploit to study diverse ion channels. In the future, the toolkit could potentially be used to develop treatments for disorders such as epilepsy, chronic pain, and irregular heartbeats, where too many channels are active or present at the cell membrane.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Ion channel regulation</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>E3 ubiquitin ligase</kwd><kwd>voltage-gated potassium channel</kwd><kwd>voltage-gated calcium channel</kwd><kwd>nanobody</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1-HL121253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colecraft</surname><given-names>Henry M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1RO1-HL122421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colecraft</surname><given-names>Henry M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007367</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanner</surname><given-names>Scott A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Engineered E3 ubiquitin ligases are utilized to elucidate mechanisms underlying ubiquitin regulation of membrane proteins, and to achieve robust post-translational functional knockdown of ion channels.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Integral surface membrane proteins including ion channels, transporters, and receptors are vital to the survival and function of all cells. Consequently, processes that control the surface abundance and composition of membrane proteins are critical determinants of cellular biology and physiology. Impaired surface trafficking of membrane proteins underlies diverse diseases ranging from cystic fibrosis to cardiac arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gelman and Kopito, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>), motivating a need to better understand fundamental mechanisms controlling membrane protein surface density. The surface repertoire of membrane proteins is regulated by multi-layered maturation and trafficking processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacGurn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foot et al., 2017</xref>). As such, the mechanisms governing diverse aspects of membrane protein fate is an intensely studied research area.</p><p>Ubiquitination determines membrane protein functional expression by regulating multiple steps in the membrane protein lifecycle. Ubiquitin is a 76-residue protein that can be covalently attached to lysine residues on polypeptide substrates through the sequential action of three enzymes: a ubiquitin activation enzyme (E1); a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2); and a ubiquitin ligase (E3), that catalyzes transfer of ubiquitin to substrates. The human genome encodes 2 E1s, 37 E2s, and &gt;600 E3 ubiquitin ligases. Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, K63) that, together with its N-terminus (Met1), can serve as secondary attachment points to make diverse polyubiquitin chains with different structures and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Komander, 2009</xref>). Ubiquitination has classically been ascribed to targeting cytosolic proteins for degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998</xref>). However, it is now evident that ubiquitination of both cytosolic and membrane proteins can lead to more nuanced outcomes including regulating protein trafficking/sorting, stability, and/or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Komander, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foot et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, precisely how ubiquitination regulates such diverse aspects of protein fate— and membrane protein fate in particular— is often poorly understood. Factors that complicate analyses include: (1) multiple E3 ligases may ubiquitinate a single substrate; (2) a particular E3 can typically catalyze ubiquitination of multiple substrates; (3) distinct E3 ligases can have preference for particular ubiquitination profiles (e.g. monoubiquitination versus polyubiquitination) and polyubiquitin chain linkages (e.g. K48 versus K63); (4) lack of temporal control over the ubiquitination process.</p><p>The elusive nature of ubiquitin signaling is exemplified by its regulation of diverse voltage-gated ion channels. KCNQ1 (Kv7.1; Q1), is a voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel which together with auxiliary KCNE1 subunits give rise to the slowly activating delayed rectifier current <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> that is important for human ventricular action potential repolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barhanin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanguinetti et al., 1996</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in Q1 lead to long QT syndrome type 1 (LQT1), a precarious condition that predisposes affected individuals to exertion-triggered cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tester et al., 2005</xref>). In heterologous expression studies, NEDD4-2, a HECT domain E3 ligase, binds a PY motif on Q1 C-terminus; enhances Q1 ubiquitination; down-regulates Q1 expression; and inhibits <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jespersen et al., 2007</xref>). Understanding precisely how NEDD4-2 accomplishes these distinctive effects is confounded by the promiscuity of this E3 ligase in targeting many other proteins that contain PY motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Abriel and Staub, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacGurn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goel et al., 2015</xref>), as well as a lack of tight temporal control over its action. This could potentially be resolved if it were possible to target distinct E3 ligase activity to Q1/KCNE1 proteins in a selective and temporally controllable manner.</p><p>Several studies have applied an approach that utilizes engineered E3 ubiquitin ligases to selectively target cytosolic proteins to direct their degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hatakeyama et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Portnoff et al., 2014</xref>). The general principle involves replacing the intrinsic substrate-targeting module of an E3 ligase with a motif that directs it to a desired target protein. Here, we sought to determine, for the first time, whether this method could be applied to elucidate mechanisms underlying ubiquitin regulation of ion channel complexes. We engineered E3 ubiquitin ligases to selectively target YFP-tagged Q1 or KCNE1 subunits and assessed the impact on channel surface density, stability, and <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub>. We found that targeted ubiquitination of Q1/KCNE1 with distinct engineered ligases dramatically diminished channel surface expression without necessarily affecting total protein expression. We developed a chemo-genetic variation of the approach that enabled controllable targeting of an engineered E3 to the channel using chemical heterodimerization. The temporal control afforded by the chemo-genetic method in combination with fluorescence pulse-chase assays revealed that ubiquitination diminished Q1 surface density by selectively limiting channel delivery to the cell surface, and not by enhancing the rate of endocytosis. To demonstrate the generality of the approach, we used the engineered E3 ligase to selectively eliminate surface expression and currents through voltage-gated L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2) channels. Similar to Q1, targeted ubiquitination of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 markedly decreased channel surface density without impacting total expression, emphasizing a fundamental distinction in the impact of targeted ubiquitination between ion channels and previously studied cytosolic proteins. Beyond enabling original mechanistic insights, the approach provides a potent tool to post-translationally manipulate surface expression of ion channel macromolecular complexes in a manner that complements, and provides particular advantages over, well-established and widely used genomic/mRNA interference methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design of engineered ubiquitin ligases to manipulate Q1 functional expression</title><p>The lifecycle of surface ion channels and other membrane proteins involves minimally their genesis and folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); post-translational maturation in the Golgi; their delivery to and removal from their site of action on the plasma membrane; and ultimately their demise by degradation in lysosomes or via the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Ubiquitination looms as a powerful mechanism to control membrane protein fate since it potentially influences multiple steps in their lifecycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We took advantage of the modular design of E3 ligases, which typically have distinct substrate-binding and catalytic domains. For example, CHIP (C-terminus of the Hsp70-interacting protein), is a U-box E3 ligase comprised of a catalytic domain that binds E2 and a tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) targeting domain that binds Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Connell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murata et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). This modular arrangement enables its function for chaperone-mediated ubiquitination of substrate proteins as a quality control mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We substituted the TPR domain of CHIP with the vhh4 nanobody, which binds GFP/YFP (but not CFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kubala et al., 2010</xref>), creating nanoCHIP. We hypothesized that nanoCHIP would selectively target and catalyze ubiquitination of Q1-YFP, leading to three possible (but not mutually exclusive) outcomes of reducing protein stability, altering trafficking, or modulating channel function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>nanoCHIP abolishes Q1 surface population, with modest effect on total channel pool</title><p>We utilized optical fluorescence assays to conveniently measure surface and total pools of Q1-YFP in a robust and high throughput manner. We introduced a 13-residue high-affinity bungarotoxin binding site (BBS) into the extracellular S1-S2 loop of Q1, enabling detection of surface channels in non-permeabilized cells with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated bungarotoxin (BTX<sub>647</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aromolaran et al., 2014</xref>). The C-terminal YFP tag provides a fluorescent measure of total Q1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The nanoCHIP construct was generated in a P2A vector that expressed CFP as a separate reporter protein in a 1:1 ratio with nanoCHIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We performed two types of control experiments. First, BBS-Q1-YFP was expressed with nanobody-P2A-CFP alone (nano) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Second, nanoCHIP was co-expressed with BBS-Q1 lacking the C-terminus YFP tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We used flow cytometry to rapidly quantify total (YFP) and surface (red; BTX<sub>647</sub>) Q1 expression in ~50,000 live cells, with single cell resolution. Control cells (nano + BBS-Q1-YFP) displayed robust total Q1 expression (YFP signal) in CFP-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Test cells expressing nanoCHIP + BBS-Q1-YFP showed little change in YFP fluorescence compared to control (YFP = 577 ± 11 a.f.u, <italic>n</italic> = 1727 for nano; YFP = 630 ± 18 a.f.u, <italic>n</italic> = 783 for nanoCHIP), suggesting that the presumed targeted ubiquitination did not substantively affect Q1 stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). By contrast, the surface density of BBS-Q1-YFP between the two conditions revealed an entirely different picture. Whereas control cells (nano) displayed a sizable population of surface BBS-Q1-YFP as reported by robust mean red fluorescence signal (BTX<sub>647</sub> = 822 ± 26 a.f.u, <italic>n</italic> = 4837), this surface pool was almost completely eliminated in cells co-expressing nanoCHIP (BTX<sub>647</sub> = 55 ± 2 a.f.u, <italic>n</italic> = 2257) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). To assess specificity, we co-expressed nanoCHIP with BBS-Q1. In sharp contrast to the result obtained with BBS-Q1-YFP, nanoCHIP had no effect on surface expression of BBS-Q1 channels (BTX<sub>647</sub> = 527 ± 16 a.f.u, <italic>n</italic> = 6425 for nano; BTX<sub>647</sub> = 633 ± 24 a.f.u, <italic>n</italic> = 3657 for nanoCHIP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). These data were obtained with a 1:3 transfection ratio of Q1 to nanoCHIP cDNA. Similar results were obtained using transfection ratios of 1:1 and 1:5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As a further control, co-expression of a CHIP deletion mutant (nanoCHIP*) that abolishes E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nikolay et al., 2004</xref>) did not alter Q1 surface expression, confirming the requirement of catalytic activity for nanoCHIP-dependent surface modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We used a similar strategy to selectively target distinct E3 ligase classes to Q1-YFP, notably two members of the RING family (nanoNSlmb and nanoMDM2), as well as NEDD4-2 from the HECT family (nanoNEDD4-2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). We obtained qualitatively similar results with nanoNSlmb and nanoMDM2 to what we observed with nanoCHIP in that they all reduced BBS-Q1-YFP surface density with minimal effects on total expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, nanoNEDD4-2 diminished total Q1-YFP expression concomitant with the decreased surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Both effects on Q1 stability and surface density were abolished with co-expression of a NEDD4-2 catalytic inactive mutant (nanoNEDD4-2*) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Given that nanoCHIP had the most robust effect on reducing Q1 surface density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) we focused the rest of the study on this engineered E3 ligase.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29744.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>nanoCHIP selectively abolishes Q1 surface expression.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Cartoons of experimental strategies.

Cells were then incubated at 37°C for varying time periods to resume trafficking processes (chase). Following the chase period, cells were labeled with streptavidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor 647 at 4°C. In this paradigm, red fluorescent labeling would only occur on channels that were initially present at the surface and labeled with BTX-biotin during the pulse period. A decrease in fluorescence with increasing chase times would be expected due to internalization of BTX-biotin-labeled channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Indeed, control cells (no rapamycin pre-treatment) displayed an exponential decline in red fluorescence with increasing chase time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

The approach has two major utilities: (1) it provides a method to facilitate mechanistic understanding of how ubiquitination may regulate diverse aspects of membrane protein fate including, trafficking, stability, and function; and (2) it provides a method for regulating functional expression of ion channel macromolecular complexes in a manner that complements, and has particular advantages over, pre-existing genomic/mRNA interference technologies. We discuss these two aspects of the work in the context of previous studies.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Complexities in decoding ubiquitin regulation of membrane proteins</title><p>The precise mechanisms and signals regulating the dynamic trafficking of ion channels among membrane compartments are not completely understood and difficult to study, in part, due to their complexity and a lack of enabling tools. This is a serious limitation given that a number of ion channelopathies (e.g. cystic fibrosis, epilepsy, Liddle syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias) may arise due to dysregulation in ion channel surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Abriel and Staub, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Ubiquitination is a critical post-translational modification capable of regulating diverse aspects of protein fate including trafficking, sorting, and stability. Several ion channels and transporters are known to be regulated by ubiquitination, including ENaC, ClC-5, KCNQ1, and Na<sub>V</sub> channels, which have all been found to be regulated by NEDD4-like family ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Staub et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abriel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwake et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fotia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Bemmelen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Abriel and Staub, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jespersen et al., 2007</xref>). Many of these channels possess PY motifs (P-P-X-Y-X-X-ϕ where P is proline, Y is tyrosine, X is any amino acid, and ϕ is a hydrophobic residue) to which NEDD4-like proteins bind using WW protein interaction modules. In co-expression studies, NEDD4-like proteins have been shown to bind to these membrane proteins, to increase their ubiquitination, and to promote their degradation presumably via targeting to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Staub et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Staub et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abriel et al., 1999</xref>). Nevertheless, significant questions remain regarding underlying mechanisms due to complexities in the ubiquitin regulatory system that arises at three levels. First, multiple E3 ligases may converge to regulate a single substrate. Second, a single E3 ligase such as NEDD4-2 catalyzes ubiquitination of multiple substrates. Third, distinct E3 ligases can give rise to monoubiquitination or polyubiquitin chains with differing lysine chain linkages and, thus, divergent functional consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Abriel and Staub, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Komander, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacGurn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foot et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The method of specifically targeting E3 catalytic domains to selected membrane proteins offers opportunities to dissect these inherent intricacies of the ubiquitin regulatory system. Using this approach, our results yield new insights into ubiquitin regulation of Q1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. First, we found that nanoCHIP increased ubiquitination of both YFP-tagged Q1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 without significantly impacting total protein expression, demonstrating that mere ubiquitination of these channels is not sufficient to direct their degradation. By contrast, NEDD4-2 both enhances ubiquitination and decreases stability of Q1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jespersen et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). A possible explanation for this difference could lie in the fact that NEDD4-like ubiquitin ligases catalyze ubiquitination of multiple protein substrates, including components of the ESCRT complex involved in sorting membrane proteins on endosomes into multi-vesicular bodies and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacGurn et al., 2012</xref>). Alternatively, the intrinsic differences in the type of ubiquitination conferred between NEDD4-2 and CHIP E3 ligase could be important. The finding that nanoNEDD4-2 was more effective than nanoCHIP in reducing Q1 stability, mirroring full-length NEDD4-2, is consistent with this interpretation. Overall, these results emphasize that distinct ligases can differentially impact the stability and subcellular localization of ion channels. Moreover, this work illustrates how engineered E3 ligases can be utilized to systematically and selectively probe the impact of particular E3 ligases on target proteins in the complex cellular environment. The targeted E3 ligase approach is complementary to a recently developed method that uses ubiquitin variants that are selective for distinct HECT ligases, and can either activate or inhibit their cognate E3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A second unique observation was that iN-CHIP suppressed Q1 surface density by selectively diminishing forward trafficking of the channel, with no apparent effect on the rate of endocytosis. A common assumption is that ubiquitination of membrane proteins enhances their internalization from the cell surface, although recent results suggest a more complex picture in mammalian cells. For example, the E3 ligase Cbl is important to the internalization of activated epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs). Nevertheless, mutation of ubiquitination sites on EGFRs did not abolish their endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, a ubiquitin-deficient β2 adrenergic receptor was also internalized to a similar extent as the wild type protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shenoy et al., 2001</xref>). A complication in our experimental system is that Q1 displays a basal level of ubiquitination due to the activity of an endogenous E3 ligase of unknown identity. It is possible that this basal level of ubiquitination is sufficient to set a level of internalization that is not further enhanced by nanoCHIP.</p><p>The iN-CHIP-induced decrease in forward trafficking is intriguing though questions remain regarding the mechanistic bases of this effect. There are endogenous ubiquitin-mediated quality control mechanisms that would be expected to limit forward trafficking of membrane proteins. For example, the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway is a prominent quality control mechanism which is accomplished by a chaperone-mediated ubiquitination of misfolded membrane proteins which are then retrotranslocated to the cytosol and targeted to the proteasome for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacGurn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foot et al., 2017</xref>). There are also ubiquitin-dependent quality control mechanisms present at the Golgi which results in the diversion of membrane proteins to endosomes where they are sorted by the ESCRT system into multi-vesicular bodies and fusion with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fire et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacGurn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foot et al., 2017</xref>). Both these quality control pathways result in the degradation of target proteins which is fundamentally different from our observations of the impact of nanoCHIP on Q1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. Ultimately, precise identification of the intracellular compartments in which nanoCHIP arrested Q1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels reside will be important for deducing the mechanism of the compromised forward trafficking of these channels.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Engineered E3 ligase approach as a tool to manipulate functional expression of membrane proteins</title><p>Eliminating protein function by preventing expression or with pharmacological agents is a cornerstone of modern biological research and disease therapy. Several approaches have been developed to eradicate expression of target proteins by interference at the genomic (knockout, zinc finger nucleases, TALENs, CRISPR/Cas) or mRNA (siRNA, shRNA, microRNA) levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fire et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boettcher and McManus, 2015</xref>). These methods are widely used and powerful, but do have certain limitations that may be addressable with the tools developed here. The temporal control and resolution of mRNA interference methods is relatively poor because they are dependent on the degradation of the targeted native protein. For stable proteins with a long half-life this can adversely impact the efficacy of the mRNA interference approach. This gap can be potentially addressed by post-translational degradation of target proteins using engineered ubiquitin ligases. Indeed, several groups have utilized this approach to target diverse cytosolic proteins for degradation in situ. Yet none to date have applied this approach to ion channels, a specialized class of proteins that rely on a very different post-translational lifecycle of maturation, sorting, and trafficking.</p><p>The first implementation of targeted ubiquitination exploited SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF) E3 ligase complexes, in which a peptide motif was fused to a modular F-box-domain-containing protein in order to target the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein for degradation by a Cullin/RING E3 ligase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>). Seeking a more generalizable approach, Caussinius et al fused the N-terminus F-box domain of Slmb (a <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> F-box protein) to vhhGFP4 (NSlmb-vhhGFP4, also termed deGradFP), which effectively degraded various GFP-tagged proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>). Yet because approaches that exploit SCF complexes have the potential to sequester endogenous components by over-expressed engineered F-box proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hatakeyama et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Portnoff et al., 2014</xref>), other studies have utilized E3 ligases that are not similarly reliant on endogenous scaffold proteins for their mechanism of action. One such approach replaced the substrate binding (TPR) domain of CHIP to enable targeted ubiquitination and degradation of the proto-oncogenes c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hatakeyama et al., 2005</xref>) and K-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). Further proof of concept experiments replaced the TPR of CHIP with intrabodies directed against β-galactosidase and maltose binding protein, which yielded effective destruction of these target proteins in transfected HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Portnoff et al., 2014</xref>). More recently, a technique referred to as Trim-Away exploits the high affinity of the E3 ligase TRIM21 for the Fc domain of antibodies for selective degradation of target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clift et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Against this background, nanoCHIP represents a hybrid of these previously engineered E3 ligases, wherein the TPR region of CHIP is replaced with a vhhGFP4 nanobody. Without exception, all previous renditions of this technology have relied on degradation of target proteins as the ultimate expression of efficacy. In comparison, our results suggest a fundamental difference between ion channels and cytosolic proteins in which targeted ubiquitination with nanoCHIP (as well as nanoNSlmb and nanoMDM2) yielded impaired trafficking and functional inactivation without frank degradation of the protein. As such, our results indicate that absolute degradation is not necessary for potent functional knockdown of Q1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels, and highlight the importance of employing functional/cell biological assays to assess the efficacy of post-translational knockdown. Furthermore, we demonstrate here that nanoNEDD4-2 can selectively degrade the ion channel Q1 in situ, emphasizing the potential for customized protein manipulation with engineered E3 ligases.</p><p>One advantage of this post-translational knockdown approach is the potential to uniquely manipulate ion channel macromolecular complexes. Many ion channels, including Q1, are multi-protein complexes made up minimally of pore-forming proteins associated with accessory subunits. For example, Q1 can associate with any of five KCNE auxiliary subunits (KCNE1-KCNE5), each of which confers distinctive functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, some KCNE subunits may interact with other K<sup>+</sup> channel pore-forming subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abbott, 2016</xref>). Cardiac ventricular myocytes express all five KCNE subunits together with Q1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Radicke et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, a method to selectively inactivate protein complexes composed of specific Q1/KCNE combinations in heart cells could be powerful in illuminating the physiological logic for having multiple KCNE subunits expressed in heart cells. The capability to inactivate specific macromolecular complexes is beyond the capacity of genomic and mRNA interference approaches since simply knocking out expression of a particular KCNE could have reverberations on multiple channel types, thereby limiting specificity. By contrast, post-translational based methods such as the engineered E3 ligase approach potentially offer a platform to address this blind spot in macromolecular complex inactivation. The observation that targeting nanoCHIP to KCNE1 effectively arrests trafficking of Q1 offers rational strategies in pursuit of this goal.</p><p>Finally, it is worth commenting on potential therapeutic dimensions of our findings. Gain-of-function mutations in distinct ion channels cause diverse diseases including but not limited to: (Na<sub>V</sub>1.7) inherited erythromelalgia and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waxman, 2013</xref>); (Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1) familial hemiplegic migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pietrobon, 2010</xref>); (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2) Timothy syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Splawski et al., 2004</xref>); (TrpV4) heritable skeletal dysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rock et al., 2008</xref>); (KCNQ1 and HERG) short QT syndrome and familial atrial fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giudicessi and Ackerman, 2012</xref>). Targeted ubiquitination of overactive channels may provide a viable therapeutic strategy for some gain-of-function channelopathies. Although the nano-E3 ligases reported here are only effective against GFP/YFP-tagged proteins and do not target endogenous proteins, this is addressable by development of antibody mimetic proteins capable of binding specific target peptides in situ with high affinity. Various methods to develop such antibody mimetic proteins have recently emerged, including; nanobodies, single chain variable fragments (scFv), DARPins, and FingRs/monobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koide et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pardon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Plückthun, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gross et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sha et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, a chemical strategy has been developed that utilizes hetero-bivalent small molecules referred to as PROTACS (proteolysis-targeting chimeras) to bridge endogenous substrates to endogenous ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schneekloth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lai and Crews, 2017</xref>). Our results suggest that development of PROTACS capable of selectively targeting endogenous E3 ubiquitin ligases to ion channels may be a promising therapy for diverse cardiovascular and neurological diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">gene (human)</td><td valign="top">KCNQ1</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">NM_000218</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">gene (rabbit)</td><td valign="top">Cav1.2</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">NM_001136522</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">strain, strain background (E. coli)</td><td valign="top">XL10-Gold</td><td valign="top">Agilent</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">cell line (human)</td><td valign="top">HEK293</td><td valign="top">other</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0045">CVCL_0045</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Laboratory of Robert Kass</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">cell line (human)</td><td valign="top">CHO</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0214">CVCL_0214</ext-link></td><td valign="top">CHO-K1, ATCC, CCL-61</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">nano-P2A-CFP</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Made from GFP-nanobody (vhhGFP4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kubala et al., 2010</xref>);

The xx-P2A-CFP fragment was amplified by PCR and cloned into the PiggyBac CMV mammalian expression vector (System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) using NheI/NotI sites. To generate nano-xx-P2A-CFP, we PCR amplified the coding sequence for GFP nanobody (vhhGFP4) and cloned it into xx-P2A-CFP using NheI/AflII sites.

HEK cells cultured in 60 mm diameter dishes at 70–80% confluency were transfected with PacI-digested linearized adenoviral DNA. Transfected plates were monitored for cytopathic effects (CPEs) and adenoviral plaques. Cells were harvested and subjected to three consecutive freeze-thaw cycles, followed by centrifugation (2,500 × g) to remove cellular debris. The supernatant (2 mL) was used to infect a 10 cm dish of 90% confluent HEK293 cells. Following observation of CPEs after 2–3 d, cell supernatants were used to re-infect a new plate of HEK293 cells.

This is done by adding tags and protein-protein interaction motives to these proteins and looking at either their total cellular expression or specific membrane expression. The paper not only describes the CHIP-dependent ubiquitination of KCNQ1, but also its ubiquitination by other E3 ligases such as the NEDD4-2 ligase, already shown to ubiquitinate KCNQ1. This cellular system was also active on a more &quot;complex&quot; ion channel, i.e. the Cav1.2 large protein.</p><p>The presented data are in general well presented and convincing. Some controls are missing, however, such as dead-E3 ligase or mutation of the PY motif of KCNQ1.</p><p>Overall the system developed by the authors is convincing and potentially interesting to elucidate the specific and distinct roles of E3 ligases targeting ion channels.</p><p>Substantive concerns:</p><p>The main serious concern related to this work is that at this stage this is &quot;only&quot; a methodological paper describing a sophisticated way to artificially ubiquitinate a target, in this case the KCNQ1 channel. What do we learn? The only original new finding would be that the reduced membrane expression of KCNQ1 when CHIP is active and co-expressed seems to be caused by reduced forward trafficking. Note that this effect could be challenged with the use of the brefeldin A.</p><p>I think that this approach may have been useful to address many open questions as to the &quot;site of action&quot; of the different ligases, the types of ubiquitination of the specific ligases, and others. Another problem is the fact that all these systems are still very &quot;artificial&quot; and all what will be learned can be very different from really native conditions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Kanner et al. fused the catalytic domain of the E3 ligase CHIP to nanobody recognizing GFP/YFP and targeted this nanoCHIP to YFP-tagged KCNQ1 +/- its associated subunit KCNE1 (a K<sup>+</sup> channel defective in LongQT) to ubiquitinate and degrade or endocytose this channel in cells, in order to generate a tool to regulate/eliminate this channel at will. They found that this maneuver reduced cell surface levels of this K<sup>+</sup> channel by decreasing its forward trafficking to the plasma membrane, but not increasing its internalization.</p><p>Evaluation:</p><p>The authors developed a neat system to post-translationally regulate PM protein levels at will, and moreover, generated an inducible system that enables temporal control of targeting of these TM proteins. This is a very useful tool that can be of great benefit for future studies. This paper, however, has some issues, as follows:</p><p>1) Novelty: There have been quite a few papers published (several of them cited by the authors) that already describe various systems to regulate cellular stability of proteins at will by targeting them for degradation by E3 ligases (including CHIP). Some of them actually tested the system in vivo (in mice). The paper here combines some of the published methods into an improved one, but the idea is not novel, nor use of CHIP to achieve the goal.</p><p>2) The proteins targeted are not necessarily the ones that are the cognate substrates for the chosen E3 ligase. While this is OK to get rid of a specific protein (akin to knockdown or knockout, but with better regulation post-translationally) for analyses such as cell fate, survival/proliferation, or other whole cell function(s), using this method for analysis of regulation of trafficking and endocytosis of a channel that is artificially targeted in this manner in cells may be problematic. In fact, it is probably not a surprise that CHIP regulates forward trafficking of this channel (based on its known function in cells), but not its endocytosis. Endogenously, it is quite likely that other E3 ligases (e.g. Nedd4-2) regulate Q1 endocytosis. Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> actually suggests that i.e., the biological significance of studying trafficking/endocytosis of a PM protein with an artificial E3 ligase (that anyway only weakly ubiquitinates it) is not clear.</p><p>3) Adding a tag to proteins (YFP here) requires their overexpression, thus creating an artifact. The authors suggest that the method they created can be used with antibodies to endogenous proteins, but (i) they have not done it, and (ii) such a system will rely on exquisitely specific antibodies (or parts of them), which are not easy to generate, let alone prove that they target a single protein in a cell.</p><p>4) CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of Q1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is very weak and not convincing (and the experiments lack loading controls).</p><p>5) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> (showing Nedd4-2 mediated enhanced removal of Q1 from the cell surface) are not in agreement with those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and described in the subsection “nanoCHIP abolishes Q1 surface population, with modest effect on total channel pool”. Please explain the discrepancy.</p><p>6) Why was channel function analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) done on CHO cells while all biochemical/IF studies on 293 cells?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Kanner and Colecraft focuses on the development of a novel and innovative technique for modulating expression of membrane proteins. They utilize a fusion between an intrabody (in this case a nanobody) with the catalytic domain of an E3 ubiquitin ligase to generate a &quot;nanochip&quot; capable of specifically modulating target protein activity. They show specific downregulation of activity of their target of choice, the KCNQ1 ion channel, by targeting wither the principle KCNQ1 or auxiliary KCNE1 subunit. They provide data to support a model whereby the downregulation occurs via loss of cell surface expression of the ion channel (that is, a decrease in n), as opposed to downregulating the activity of cell surface channels (via effects on open probability or single channel conductance). They also provide support for a mechanism whereby it is cell surface delivery of the ion channels that is the basis of the nanochip-mediated downregulation. The data are generally of high quality (although see concerns below), and are not overinterpreted. The writing is very clear, and the figures are for the most part of high quality and clear.</p><p>One concern with the data is that in the flow cytometry plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>), there are substantial populations of KCNQ1expressing cells with YFP but not CFP signals, and vice versa. There are many cells with levels of CFP at the same level of those with maximal YFP levels, but that have no YFP (those in the upper left quadrant), and vice-versa (in the lower right quadrant). This also holds for BTX labeling, with lots of cells with one or the other. This does not make sense given how the authors describe the experiments. In both cases I would have expected something more like a diagonal line, with the origin in the lower left, and then going towards the upper right, such that the levels of the two labels are correlated. This also holds for the analysis of the KCNE1 expression and effects of the nanochips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>One other concern is that it appears that nanochip expression lowers the levels of CFP in expressing cells (and the representation of CFP expressing cells in the population). This should not be the case and suggests non-specific effects of the nanochips on protein expression.</p><p>Given these apparent discrepancies greatly strengthen the paper. This would confirm loss of cell surface expression of KCNQ1 by a technique independent of flow cytometry, which is used exclusively to assay levels of cell surface expression (that is, n) independent of effects of nanochips on channel open probability or single channel conductance. Biotinylation analyses could be combined with the type of anti-ubiquitin blots already presented to further support that ubiquitinated proteins are internalized.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29744.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] The presented data are in general well presented and convincing.

That we can achieve effective functional knockdown of ion channels without degradation is a fundamental, novel and non-trivial distinction from previous studies. The combination of acute temporal control over the targeted ubiquitination process and optical pulse chase approaches to assess relative impact on distinct trafficking processes is also new.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The proteins targeted are not necessarily the ones that are the cognate substrates for the chosen E3 ligase. While this is OK to get rid of a specific protein (akin to knockdown or knockout, but with better regulation post-translationally) for analyses such as cell fate, survival/proliferation, or other whole cell function(s), using this method for analysis of regulation of trafficking and endocytosis of a channel that is artificially targeted in this manner in cells may be problematic. In fact, it is probably not a surprise that CHIP regulates forward trafficking of this channel (based on its known function in cells), but not its endocytosis. Endogenously, it is quite likely that other E3 ligases (e.g. Nedd4-2) regulate Q1 endocytosis. Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> actually suggests that i.e., the biological significance of studying trafficking/endocytosis of a PM protein with an artificial E3 ligase (that anyway only weakly ubiquitinates it) is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Our argument in the paper is that promiscuity among E3 ligase/substrate interactions makes it difficult to define the full complement of E3 ligases that are capable of acting on a particular substrate, and also the complement of proteins that a particular E3 ligase acts upon. The method is a useful tool for simplifying some of these complexities so that specific questions about how ubiquitination regulates diverse aspects of ion channel fate and function can be asked and answered. Moreover, the method offers an approach to study the putative in situ functions of distinct E3 ligases with known enzymatic characteristics.</p><p>The fact that nanoCHIP only weakly ubiquitinates the channel is not necessarily a weakness. That this relatively modest ubiquitination can have such flagrant effects on protein sub-cellular localization (&gt;90% decrease in surface density) is the new insight that this particular result provides. It clearly goes against the assumption apparently made by the reviewer (and ourselves coming into the work) that more ubiquitin correlates to larger effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Adding a tag to proteins (YFP here) requires their overexpression, thus creating an artifact. The authors suggest that the method they created can be used with antibodies to endogenous proteins, but (i) they have not done it, and (ii) such a system will rely on exquisitely specific antibodies (or parts of them), which are not easy to generate, let alone prove that they target a single protein in a cell.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the studies utilize heterologous expression of tagged ion channels which does have drawbacks, but is, nevertheless, a useful system for proof-of-principle studies such as those conducted in the manuscript. Though we have not generated intrabodies to membrane proteins (we are in the middle of this and have in fact recently made some good progress with nanobodies to cytosolic proteins for a different project) others have, including nanobodies and monobodies. That we have not done this ourselves so far is not germane to whether the approach can be generally useful to the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of Q1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is very weak and not convincing (and the experiments lack loading controls).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see point #2 above with respect to this actually being a strength rather than a weakness. These are pulldown experiments for which a loading control per se does not make sense. Rather, we normalize the ubiquitin staining to the intensity of the pulled down channel. This normalization represents the most appropriate control for this type of experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> (showing Nedd4-2 mediated enhanced removal of Q1 from the cell surface) are not in agreement with those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and described in the subsection “nanoCHIP abolishes Q1 surface population, with modest effect on total channel pool”. Please explain the discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>There is no discrepancy here. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows the data with nanoCHIP, which we contrast with wild-type Nedd4-2 which does decrease both surface density and total KCNQ1 expression. Subsection “nanoCHIP abolishes Q1 surface population, with modest effect on total channel pool” refers to nanoNedd4-2 (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) which behaves similar to wt Nedd4-2 (and different from nanoCHIP). We suggest the differences between nanoCHIP and nanoNedd4-2 illustrates a strength of the approach as it allows evaluation of distinctive functional effects of different E3 ligases on an ion channel.</p><p>To clarify this point, we have sharpened our discussion of the differences between nanoCHIP and nanoNEDD4-2 with respect to their relative impact on Q1 stability in the third paragraph of the subsection “Complexities in decoding ubiquitin regulation of membrane proteins”. This discussion culminates in the following conclusions:</p><p>“Overall, these results emphasize that distinct ligases can differentially impact the stability and subcellular localization of ion channels. Moreover, this work illustrates how engineered E3 ligases can be utilized to systematically and selectively probe the impact of particular E3 ligases on target proteins in the complex cellular environment.”</p><p>Also relevant to this point:</p><p>“Without exception, all previous renditions of this technology have relied on degradation of target proteins as the ultimate expression of efficacy. […] Furthermore, we demonstrate here that nanoNEDD4-2 can selectively degrade the ion channel Q1 <italic>in situ</italic>, emphasizing the potential for customized protein manipulation with engineered E3 ligases.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Why was channel function analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) done on CHO cells while all biochemical/IF studies on 293 cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We have traditionally conducted electrophysiological studies of KCNQ1 channels in CHO cells, because some HEK293 cells can have a small level of endogenous KCNQ1 channels. This would not affect the flow cytometry experiments which detect tagged exogenously-expressed channels. To address the reviewer’s concern we performed electrophysiological experiments in HEK293 cells expressing Q1-YFP + KCNE1 with either nanobody alone, or nanoCHIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The results showed that nanoCHIP was similarly effective in reducing <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> in HEK293 cells as it was in CHO cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] One concern with the data is that in the flow cytometry plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>), there are substantial populations of KCNQ1expressing cells with YFP but not CFP signals, and vice versa. There are many cells with levels of CFP at the same level of those with maximal YFP levels, but that have no YFP (those in the upper left quadrant), and vice-versa (in the lower right quadrant). This also holds for BTX labeling, with lots of cells with one or the other. This does not make sense given how the authors describe the experiments. In both cases I would have expected something more like a diagonal line, with the origin in the lower left, and then going towards the upper right, such that the levels of the two labels are correlated. This also holds for the analysis of the KCNE1 expression and effects of the nanochips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s questions about the flow cytometry method. We interpret the cases of cell populations having either CFP or YFP/BTX fluorescent signals, but not both, as reflecting the stochastic nature of transient transfections (and protein expression) with multiple plasmids (i.e. some cells may have one or other of the plasmid, but not both). Actually, we view this as a strength of the approach as we can see and differentiate our analysis among the different populations of cells in a way that is not accessible by conventional biochemical methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One other concern is that it appears that nanochip expression lowers the levels of CFP in expressing cells (and the representation of CFP expressing cells in the population). This should not be the case and suggests non-specific effects of the nanochips on protein expression.</p></disp-quote><p>The nanoCHIP is expressed in a bicistronic P2A vector with CFP such that the fluorescent reporter protein is expressed in a 1:1 ratio with the engineered ligase. Therefore most likely explanation for the observations that CFP is lower for nanoCHIP compared to nano in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> is that in these particular transfections we had a comparatively lower expression of nanoCHIP. Please note that this is not the case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, for example. It is known (and we have confirmed this) that the vhh4 nanobody recognizes GFP/YFP, but not CFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given these apparent discrepancies greatly strengthen the paper. This would confirm loss of cell surface expression of KCNQ1 by a technique independent of flow cytometry, which is used exclusively to assay levels of cell surface expression (that is, n) independent of effects of nanochips on channel open probability or single channel conductance. Biotinylation analyses could be combined with the type of anti-ubiquitin blots already presented to further support that ubiquitinated proteins are internalized.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
