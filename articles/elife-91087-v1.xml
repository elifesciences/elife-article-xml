Before release, one or several synaptic vesicles (SVs) are thought to bind to each docking site, forming the readily releasable pool (RRP). Determining the RRP size per docking site has important implications for short-term synaptic plasticity. Here, using mouse cerebellar slices, we take advantage of recently developed methods to count the number of released SVs at single glutamatergic synapses in response to trains of action potentials (APs). In each recording, the number of docking sites was determined by fitting with a binomial model the number of released SVs in response to individual APs. After normalization with respect to the number of docking sites, the summed number of released SVs following a train of APs was used to estimate of the RRP size per docking site. To improve this estimate, various steps were taken to maximize the release probability of docked SVs, the occupancy of docking sites, as well as the extent of synaptic depression. Under these conditions, the RRP size reached a maximum value close to two SVs per docking site. The results indicate that each docking site contains two distinct SV-binding sites that can simultaneously accommodate up to one SV each. They further suggest that under special experimental conditions, as both sites are close to full occupancy, a maximal RRP size of two SVs per docking site can be reached. More generally, the results validate a sequential two-step docking model previously proposed at this preparation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic terminals</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>molecular layer interneurons</kwd><kwd>parallel fibers</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicles</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPF201809007190</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tran</surname><given-names>Van</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>294509</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marty</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Counting the number of synaptic vesicles released in simple synapses under high release probability conditions revealed a maximum readily releasable pool size of two vesicles per docking site.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Before undergoing exocytosis, synaptic vesicles (SVs) interact with a number of specialized proteins in the presynaptic active zone (AZ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Südhof, 2012</xref>).

The number of docking sites per AZ has been estimated in a wide range of preparations, with results varying over a range of 1–15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Malagon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maschi and Klyachko, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pulido et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sakamoto et al., 2018</xref>). Morphologically, each docking site has been proposed to be associated with a cluster of RIM 1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tang et al., 2016</xref>), voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miki et al., 2017</xref>), and/or Unc 13/Munc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reddy-Alla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sakamoto et al., 2018</xref>). In each case, several clusters of the relevant protein occur inside one AZ.</p><p>As its name suggests, the readily releasable pool (RRP) contains SVs that are readily released after a short burst of presynaptic action potentials (APs). It is widely accepted that exhaustion of the RRP is a main mechanism underlying synaptic depression during high-frequency neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Betz, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elmqvist and Quastel, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schneggenburger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thanawala and Regehr, 2013</xref>; review: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>). While the size of the RRP is likely related to the number of docking sites, the exact relation between the two quantities has remained unclear. This relation ultimately depends on the specific nature of the interactions between SVs and docking sites. Under electron microscopy, filaments with various angles and lengths can be seen linking SVs to the AZ membrane (review: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Silva et al., 2021</xref>). Nonetheless, the number and spatial arrangement of docked SV around individual docking sites is unknown.</p><p>Recently developed models assuming sequential steps of SV binding to individual docking sites have provided an explanation for a range of synaptic changes at several types of central synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doussau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eshra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fukaya et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kobbersmed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). The basis for these models came from functional and modeling studies at parallel fiber to molecular layer interneuron (PF–MLI) synapses and at the calyx of Held indicating calcium-dependent docking within 5 ms after an AP stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taschenberger et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, rapid freezing electron microscopy studies in cultured hippocampal neurons show that, following an AP stimulation, SVs move rapidly (within 10 ms) to the AZ membrane in a calcium-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kusick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). These results suggest that the RRP comprises two classes of SVs representing the last two steps of preparation before release. One variant of sequential models assumes that a docking site can accommodate only one SV of either class (‘loose state/tight state [LS/TS] model’: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>), while another variant assumes that a docking site can simultaneously accept two SVs, one of each class (‘replacement site/docking site [RS/DS] model’: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We recently developed a method allowing us to count SV release events at single PF–MLI synapses reliably and with an excellent time resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Malagon et al., 2016</xref>). In the present work, we take advantage of this to estimate the maximal RRP size in these synapses and to compare it with the number of docking sites. By adjusting experimental conditions, we increase docking site occupancy, release probability, and docking rate. Under these conditions, we find a ratio between RRP size and docking site number close to 2, thus strongly constraining docking site models at this synapse.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Theoretical considerations regarding the maximum RRP size per docking site</title><p>The purpose of the present work is to measure the maximum RRP size per docking site at PF–MLI synapses and to compare that maximum with the predictions of the RS/DS model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The basic features of the RS/DS model are pictured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

Each of these probabilities refers to one AP interval during the train. Conditions for an effective transition are: for <italic>s</italic>, that the replacement site is empty; for <italic>r</italic>, that the replacement site is occupied, and that the docking site is empty; for <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>, that the docking site is occupied. Thus, if the probability of docking site occupancy before stimulation is <italic>δ</italic>, the probability that the site releases an SV after the first AP of the train is <italic>P</italic> = <italic>δp</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scheuss and Neher, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Calcium elevation in presynaptic terminals promotes the replenishment of SVs to emptied docking sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kobbersmed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kusick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakaba, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang and Kaczmarek, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Accordingly, we assume that calcium increases not only <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>, but also <italic>r</italic> and <italic>s</italic>. As the probability of transition <italic>r</italic> increases after an AP, SVs can move from the distal to proximal site within a few ms. In the framework of the RS/DS model, due to the high speed of this transition, both replacement and docked SVs are regarded as belonging to the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, in the related LS/TS model, the RRP comprises the sum of SVs occupying a distal and a proximal SV-binding site, which are called in this model the loosely and tightly docked state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Neher and Taschenberger, 2021</xref>). A key difference between these two models is that the sites in the RS/DS model can be simultaneously occupied while in the LS/TS model a docking site can only accommodate one SV in either state at a time. Thus, the RS/DS model predicts a maximum RRP size per docking site of 2, whereas the LS/TS model predicts a maximum RRP size per docking site of 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Maximizing RRP size and its release during AP trains</title><p>We used previously developed methods to record from simple synapses between cerebellar granule cells (GCs) and MLIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). At these synapses, it is possible to count the release of individual SVs with an effective time separation of 0.2 ms between consecutive release events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Malagon et al., 2016</xref>). It is also possible to count the number of docking sites precisely, giving an opportunity to evaluate the maximum number of released SVs per site.</p><p>To determine the maximum number of SVs that a docking site can accommodate, it was essential to maximize the RRP size and its release during an AP train, that is, to maximize <italic>δ</italic>, <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>, and <italic>r</italic>. In the extreme case where <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> and <italic>r</italic> are both equal to 1, a first AP should release all SVs that were initially in the docking site, and a second AP should release all SVs that were initially in the replacement site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tran et al., 2022</xref>). The RRP size is then given by the sum of the number of released SVs for the two APs.</p><p>Recordings from simple synapses between cerebellar GCs and MLIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) were initiated in an elevated external calcium concentration (3 mM), a condition that has been shown to elevate <italic>δ</italic>, <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>, and <italic>r</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malagon et al., 2020</xref>). In this condition and for the example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, responses to the first two stimuli of an 8-AP (8-action potentials) train (100 Hz within each train, 10 s intervals between trains) were mostly comprised between 0 SV (failure) and 2 SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left). While keeping 3 mM Ca<sub>o</sub>, we next performed two modifications aiming at further enhancing release probability and docking site occupancy: we applied the potassium channel blocker 4-amidopyridine (4-AP), which increases <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>, and we performed a post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) protocol, keeping 4-AP in the perfusion (see Methods). For the example shown, responses to the first two stimuli were clearly enhanced by 4-AP (now comprised between 2 and 4 SVs, with no failure: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, center). In contrast, responses to stimuli 6–8 were reduced with respect to the control. We then applied a series of 60 AP trains, each with 8 APs evoked at 100 Hz, with an inter-train interval of 2 s. This protocol (called ‘PTP’hereafter) results in an increase in docking site occupancy lasting several minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tran et al., 2023</xref>). After PTP induction, the responses to the first stimuli increased, or remained similar to those in 4-AP (as in the experiment shown), while responses to later stimuli displayed more synaptic depression.

In the RS/DS model, this number is determined by <italic>r</italic>, the probability of transition from replacement site to docking site. As this transition is known to occur within a few milliseconds after a strong calcium entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>r</italic> is likely elevated (possibly close to 1) during the 10-ms interval separating the first two APs.

Such SVs can be released at a low rate within the following inter-AP interval after moving through distal and proximal docking sites, provided that these sites are empty. Therefore, the proportion of asynchronous release gives an indication on the degree of filling of the RRP. In control, only synchronous release was observed at the beginning of AP trains, but a significant share of asynchronous release was observed near the end of the train (top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In 4-AP and during PTP, the proportion of asynchronous release was initially as low as in control, but this proportion increased more rapidly as a function of stimulus number (second and third panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Strikingly, when increasing the stimulation frequency to 200 Hz during PTP, most release events near the end of the trains were asynchronous, and synchronous release was not detectable for <italic>i</italic> &gt; 5 (bottom right panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Differences in release time courses between experimental conditions can be appreciated by examining superimposed cumulative release curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Altogether, the evolution of the synchronous component of release during trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and that of the proportion of synchronous vs. asynchronous release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) both indicate that RRP depletion during trains increases markedly from one condition to the next and becomes close to complete for 200 Hz stimulation during PTP.</p><p>According to the scheme of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, in the extreme case where the RRP is full and <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = <italic>r</italic> = 1, the RRP should be equally distributed between <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>, with values close to 1 per docking site in both cases, while <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> should be small for <italic>i</italic> &gt; 2. The bottom right panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> depicts the evolution of synchronous release in the 200 Hz condition (recorded under 4-AP and after PTP induction). Here, <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub> is only slightly smaller than <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, and <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> falls off abruptly as a function of <italic>i</italic> for <italic>i</italic> &gt; 2. This fall-off can be fitted by an exponential function with an asymptote at 0 ordinate value, and a time constant of 1.66 inter-AP intervals (corresponding to 8.3 ms). These data indicate that synaptic depression is weak for <italic>i</italic> = 2, but very rapid and complete thereafter, thus approaching the predictions of the scheme of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. To quantify the extent of synaptic depression in the various experimental conditions, we calculated the amount of synchronous release per AP at the end of the trains from the slopes of regression lines fitted to the cumulative synchronous release during the steady state of each condition (gray lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We then divided this number by the number of SVs released by the first AP. The resulting curve steeply decreased from 0.83 in control conditions to 0.23, 0.14, and 0.10 in 4-AP, PTP, and 200 Hz, respectively (red curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, bottom). This confirms the increasing effectiveness of the various conditions chosen in the present study to enhance synaptic depression. In contrast, the paired-pulse ratio, calculated as <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>/<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, changed much less steeply across experimental conditions, and it remained close to 1 even when <italic>s</italic><sub>8</sub>/<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> had reached very low values (green curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, bottom). This indicates that the second response in a train is largely immune to synaptic depression, as predicted by the scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>RRP estimate obtained from summed released SV numbers</title><p>To obtain a more accurate estimate of the RRP size, we adapted the classical Schneggenburger–Meyer–Neher (SMN) method of back-extrapolation of cumulative excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSC) amplitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schneggenburger et al., 1999</xref>), using SV numbers in place of EPSC amplitudes. The SMN method is accurate only under conditions where the synapse is strongly depressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neher, 2015</xref>). As described above, synaptic depression and RRP depletion were marked under our experimental conditions. Therefore, we applied the SMN method to the synchronous release points obtained 5 ms after each AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schneggenburger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thanawala and Regehr, 2013</xref>). Summed numbers of synchronously released SVs for stimuli 6–8 (in control conditions) or 5–8 (other conditions) were fitted to straight lines that were back-extrapolated to the time of stimulus number 1, giving a value <italic>P</italic><sub>back</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, gray lines and open circles). The estimated RRP was 0.85 SV per docking site in control, 1.66 SVs per docking site in 4-AP, and 1.87 SVs per docking site in PTP. Thus, both in 4-AP and during PTP, the SMN method indicates an RRP size that exceeds 1 SV per docking site. This confirms the earlier findings on the sum of <italic>P</italic><sub>1</sub> + <italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> in the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Finally, when using 200 Hz stimulation, the SMN method gave an RRP estimate of 2.09 SVs per docking site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, bottom). The higher extrapolated value obtained for 200 Hz stimulation compared to 100 Hz was attributable to a more profound extent of synaptic depression, as discussed earlier.

As <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> is very high (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = 0.9 according to the simulation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, upper panels), successful release in response to the first AP mainly depends on the docking site being occupied prior to that AP. Following release elicited by this AP, almost all docking sites are empty. They refill during the first inter-AP interval with a probability <italic>r</italic>, independently of the initial state of occupancy prior to the first AP. Therefore, the variations in <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub> primarily originate in variations in the docking site occupancy prior to the second AP, and they are almost entirely independent of the variations in <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>.

Following the second AP, some sites have released their entire RRP during the first two APs, following a successful <italic>r</italic> transition during the first inter-AP interval. These sites tend to have a high (<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> + <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>) value and a low <italic>s</italic><sub>3</sub> value.

These other sites tend to have a low (<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> + <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>) value and a high <italic>s</italic><sub>3</sub> value.

Near the end of a train, as the IP is depleted, RRP replenishment is reduced, so that the synaptic output is also reduced. Accordingly, the deficit of synaptic output observed for <italic>i</italic> = 6–8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is likely explained by a depletion of the IP. To explore this possibility further, we performed additional simulations assuming an IP with an initial pool size of 10–15 SVs for an AZ of four docking sites, corresponding to 2.50–3.25 SVs per docking site. The IP was replenished by an infinite recycling pool with a transition probability of <italic>r</italic><sub>IP</sub>. Coupling between IP size and RRP was introduced by making the transition probability <italic>s</italic> proportional to the filling state of the IP. This resulted in an improvement of the fit near the end of the train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>After performing the IP correction, a residual discrepancy remained between simulated and experimental data near the end of AP trains. To explain this discrepancy, we note that our model does not include a provision accounting for asynchronous release. At the end of AP trains, asynchronous release reflects the movement of replenishment SVs across the RRP without stopping at RS or DS sites, due to persistent elevation of the presynaptic calcium concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miki et al., 2018</xref>). Our model artificially forces these SVs to stop at RS and/or DS sites and to be counted as synchronous release. This causes synchronous release to appear larger in the model than in experimental data near the end of trains, even after IP correction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Comparison between RS/DS and LS/TS models</title><p>We next compared the predictions between the RS/DS model (without consideration of the IP) and the LS/TS model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the LS/TS model, as in the RS/DS model, we optimized parameters to fit the first five <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> values. In control conditions, both RS/DS and LS/TS models gave reasonably close representations of the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

A variation on the LS/TS model adds a transitory state, the tight labile state, which is present only at high frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). It consists of LS vesicles that tightly dock for a short time after an AP. This can be understood as a short-lived increase in <italic>r</italic>. In our model such a modification cannot increase synaptic output significantly, as <italic>r</italic> = 0.95. Introducing an IP with a size of 10 improved the fitting only marginally (upper panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref> ).</p><p>The LS/TS model could account for cov(<italic>S</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>+1</sub>) data in control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>, lower panel), but it failed to do so in 4-AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>, lower panel). In 4-AP, whereas data and RS/DS simulations display a peak amplitude for <italic>i</italic> = 2, the LS/TS simulation displays a peak amplitude for <italic>i</italic> = 1. In the LS/TS model, release events following the first AP come from sites initially in the TS. Such release events are unlikely to be followed by an immediate TS refilling from the LS, since LS occupancy is incompatible with TS occupancy. Conversely, most release events following the second AP are due to sites that were in the LS state before the first AP, and were therefore unable to release in response to the first AP. This results in a large amplitude negative covariance point for <italic>i</italic> = 1. The covariance then decreases for higher <italic>i</italic> values as the RRP is depleted and release increasingly relies on replenishment through the s pathway.</p><p>These simulations suggest that the LS/TS model, which is simpler than the RS/DS model and contains less free parameters, can be considered as a good approximation for synapses where release probability and/or docking site occupancy are moderate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our estimate of RRP size per docking site is 1.66 SVs in 4-AP and 1.87–2.09 SVs in 4-AP after PTP (at 100 and 200 Hz stimulation rates, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results suggest a maximum RRP size of two SVs per docking site at PF–MLI synapses, in agreement with the predictions of the RS/DS model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Functional evidence in favor of the RS/DS model at PF–MLI synapses, and remaining uncertainties on the molecular composition and morphological arrangement of docking sites</title><p>Previous studies have led to the proposal of the RS/DS model at PF–MLI synapses based on (1) variance–mean analysis of SV counts in response to AP trains; (2) variance–mean analysis of cumulative SV counts; (3) covariance analysis of SV counts for successive AP stimulations in a train; and (4) two-step release during trains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miki et al., 2018</xref>). The present study adds to this evidence by extending covariance data to conditions of very high docking site occupancy and release probability, as discussed above, and by showing that the ratio of RRP size to number of docking site reaches a maximum of 2 under the same conditions. Taken together these studies build a strong case in favor of the RS/DS model in the present preparation from a functional point of view.</p><p>However, uncertainties remain concerning the molecular composition and the morphological arrangement of docking sites. This is particularly true for PF–MLI synapses. Disrupting actin filaments by latrunculin B or inhibiting myosin II by blebbistatin results in an uncoupling between RS and DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). Activating synapsins following PKA activation increases the RRP size without changing <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaden et al., 2019</xref>). Apart from these findings, the effects of specific molecular modifications on the RS/DS system of PF–MLI synapses remain to be explored. Likewise, morphological data indicating SV movement between RS and DS are lacking in this preparation, although such data have been found in other preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kusick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martín et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vandael et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fukaya et al., 2023</xref>). Further molecular and morphological studies are needed to ascertain the applicability of the RS/DS model to the PF–MLI synapse.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Assumptions behind our analysis, and possible limitations of our conclusions</title><p>Our analysis and conclusions rest on several critical assumptions that are examined in turn below.</p><p>A first assumption of our RS/DS model is that within an AZ, all RS/DS assemblies operate in a similar manner. Alternative models would hold that release sites are not equivalent, and that some sites release SVs with much higher <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> values than others (parallel models: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eshra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hallermann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ritzau-Jost et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ritzau-Jost et al., 2018</xref>). In general, distinguishing between parallel and sequential models is a difficult task that cannot be solved with absolute certainty. A study of mean and variance results at the synapse between PFs and Purkinje cells (PF–PC synapses) suggested at first a parallel model for this synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Valera et al., 2012</xref>), but additional results from the same group examining the behavior of PF–PC synapses in response to long trains at various stimulation frequencies favored a sequential model instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doussau et al., 2017</xref>). At PF–MLI synapses, our previous study of variance–mean data indicated a sequential model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). Based on this previous work, we framed the interpretation of the present results on sequential models (RS/DS or LS/TS) with homogeneous docking/release properties; but alternative parallel models cannot be ruled out entirely.</p><p>A second assumption is that <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> does not change during a train, that is, <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> is independent of <italic>i</italic>. In other synapses, a moderate increase of calcium entry occurs as a function of <italic>i</italic>, accounting for part of facilitation (e.g., in the calyx of Held: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borst and Sakmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, at synaptic boutons of cerebellar GCs, AP-driven calcium entry is independent of <italic>i</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kawaguchi and Sakaba, 2017</xref>). In addition, since our results and analysis indicate that <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> is high in the present work (with an estimated value of 0.9 in 4-AP), any potential further increase of <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> during trains is bound to be small.</p><p>A third assumption is that RRP release is kinetically separate from RRP replenishment from upstream pools (recycling pool and IP). In the SMN analysis, RRP replenishment is assumed to be linear as a function of time, and to correspond to the late linear part of the plot of cumulative release as a function of time. The initial rate of SV release calculated for the first two stimuli in the cumulative plot of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> in 200 Hz conditions is markedly higher than that calculated for the corresponding late period asymptotic line (with ratios of 2.6 in 4-AP, 3.3 in PTP, and 4.3 in 200 Hz), suggesting a good separation between release and replenishment. The actual ratio is likely larger than suggested by these numbers, since the rate of RRP replenishment is slower at the onset of the stimulation train (due to the cumulative calcium rise driving replenishment yet to reach its peak and the initial high filling state of the RRP inhibiting replenishment: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thanawala and Regehr, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neher, 2015</xref>). We calculated the contribution of replenishment to <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub> release and found that it is negligible even under high <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> conditions (see Methods). The large extent of synaptic depression of synchronous release obtained in 4-AP, after PTP and when using 200 Hz stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), is consistent with a good separation between RRP release and replenishment.</p><p>Altogether, departures from the above assumptions (homogeneous release site properties inside an AZ; constant <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> during a train; kinetic separation between RRP release and replenishment) cannot be ruled out, but such departures, if they occurred, are unlikely to have affected the main conclusions of our study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Our approach to measure the maximal RRP size: maximizing <italic>ρ</italic>, <italic>δ</italic>, and <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub></title><p>While the RS/DS model had been previously proposed in this preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miki et al., 2018</xref>), a key model prediction that the RRP size per docking site could reach a value close to 2 SVs had not been tested until the present work. An early estimate based on the SMN method gave a value close to 1 SV per docking site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>); this value was obtained in rats in a 3-mM external calcium concentration without K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker, leaving open the possibility for alternative models such as the LS/TS model. Likewise, in the present study the SMN method gives an estimate of 0.85 SV per docking site for mice in the same solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, top). The question remained open as to whether larger values could be obtained under certain experimental conditions.</p><p>Importantly, the SMN method actually measures the difference between the original size of the RRP and the size reached at steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neher, 2015</xref>). Because RRP depletion is incomplete during sustained AP stimulation, the extrapolation measurement yields an underestimate of the RRP size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neher, 2015</xref>). In addition, the original RRP size does not necessarily correspond to the number of available SV-binding sites because at rest, a fraction of these sites is not occupied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trigo et al., 2012</xref>). Altogether, because of incomplete RRP depletion and because of incomplete site filling, traditional RRP measurements return values that can be markedly smaller than the number of available binding sites in the RRP. In order to perform a meaningful RRP size measurement for the purpose of the present work, it appeared important to maximize release probability (and consequently, synaptic depression) and to maximize site occupancy.</p><p>No special step was taken to increase <italic>ρ</italic> since earlier studies in rats suggested high <italic>ρ</italic> values (0.9: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with these previous studies, high <italic>ρ</italic> values were needed in the present work to explain high <italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> values under conditions of very high release probability (in 4-AP after PTP). Our simulations indicate <italic>ρ</italic> values indistinguishable from 1 in all experimental conditions (control, 4-AP, and PTP). In all three cases, <italic>ρ</italic> estimates were larger than <italic>δ</italic> estimates. These results indicate that in basal conditions, the rate constant of the undocking transition (from docking site to replacement site) is larger than that of the docking transition (from replacement site to docking site).</p><p>Previous work indicates that elevating the external calcium concentration enhances the RRP size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thanawala and Regehr, 2013</xref>) and more specifically, increases <italic>δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanchard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kobbersmed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malagon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanaka et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, all experiments were carried out in 3 mM external calcium. Under these conditions, our <italic>δ</italic> estimate is 0.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), higher than our previous estimates (0.45–0.47: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malagon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). The difference is likely due to species difference (mice in the present work, vs. rats in previous studies), since the estimate by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref> rested on a similar approach to that of the present work. Thus, selecting mice rather than rats for the present experiments, together with using a high external calcium concentration, contributed to enhancing docking site occupancy. In addition, we were able to further increase <italic>δ</italic> (from 0.7 to 0.9 according to the analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) by applying a PTP protocol. This result is consistent with previous work at the calyx of Held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2010</xref>) and at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vandael et al., 2020</xref>), as well as with our recent finding that at PF–MLI synapses, PTP increases SV docking of a specific subclass of SVs originating from a local, calcium-sensitive recycling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tran et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to maximize <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>, we combined the effects of the potassium channel blocker 4-AP with those of the high external calcium concentration. In agreement with earlier results in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malagon et al., 2020</xref>), this combination allowed us to reach <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> values close to 1 (estimated at 0.9 in 4-AP both before and after PTP induction: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Combining large values of <italic>δ</italic> and <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> in the present work led to a <italic>P</italic><sub>1</sub> value close to 1 during PTP (<italic>P</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.88, compared to a maximum <italic>P</italic><sub>1</sub> value of 0.51 in our previous work: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malagon et al., 2020</xref>). Obtaining a <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> value close to 1 was important here as it ensured that initially occupied docking sites would be cleared after a single AP, thus freeing the way for the docking of SVs initially in the replacement site during the following inter-stimulus interval.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Reliability of our <italic>N</italic> estimates</title><p>Our conclusions depend on the accuracy of our <italic>N</italic> estimates. <italic>N</italic> estimates in the present work are particularly reliable because (1) SV counting eliminates potential errors linked to receptor saturation or desensitization in classical EPSC studies and (2) high P conditions make N estimates via variance–mean analysis or binomial analysis accurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malagon et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Even though high P conditions result in accurate <italic>N</italic> determination, one possible pitfall could be that under these conditions, certain SV release events could be too close in time to be distinguished, leading to <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> undercount. Undercounting should worsen as release probability or docking site number grow, and to be worst for <italic>i</italic> = 1. <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> undercount could lead to left shifts of variance–mean and binomial probability plots and hence to <italic>N</italic> underevaluation. Against this possibility, our estimates of the numbers of overlapping events at short intervals indicate a small extent of undercounting even under conditions of high release probability (see Methods). Secondly, our <italic>N</italic> estimates obtained either with variance–mean analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) or with binomial analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>) were independent of release probability. Finally, undercounting at high <italic>P</italic> values predicts that apparent values of <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> should grow sublinearly as a function of the estimated <italic>N</italic> value, while apparent <italic>P</italic><sub>1</sub> values should increase as a function of <italic>N</italic>. Contrary to this prediction, we found that <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> values increased linearly as a function of <italic>N</italic>, and that our <italic>P</italic><sub>1</sub> estimates were independent of <italic>N</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Altogether, it appears that undercounting did not significantly affect our <italic>N</italic> estimates.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>RRP size in various experimental conditions</title><p>Our results indicate that a single docking site can be associated with up to 2 SVs at simple PF–MLI synapses, thus giving strong experimental support in favor of the RS/DS model. Nevertheless, it is important to stress that under physiological conditions, the actual RRP size is likely significantly less than 2 SVs per docking site. In our control conditions, with 3 mM Ca<sub>o</sub>, we obtained an estimate of 0.85 SV per docking site with the SMN method. This value is an underestimate since the residual synaptic responses were significant near the end of the AP train for these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, top), indicating incomplete RRP depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neher, 2015</xref>). A more realistic estimate based on the sum of <italic>ρ</italic> and <italic>δ</italic> values obtained in our simulations for this condition is 1.65 SVs per docking site (with estimated values of 1 and 0.65 for <italic>ρ</italic> and <italic>δ</italic>, respectively: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). After PTP induction, corresponding estimates are 2.09 SVs per docking site (SMN method: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, top panel) and 1.9 SVs per docking site (sum of <italic>ρ</italic> and <italic>δ</italic> in relevant simulations, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Earlier studies in the rat suggested a value of 0.9 for <italic>ρ</italic>, independently of Ca<sub>o</sub>, and a value <italic>δ</italic> = 0.2 in 1.5 Ca<sub>o</sub> and <italic>δ</italic> = 0.5 in 3 Ca<sub>o</sub>, suggesting RRP sizes of 1.1 SVs and 1.4 SVs per docking site, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malagon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). These results suggest that the RRP size varies across species and across experimental conditions. They further indicate that synapses do not operate at full RRP capacity under ordinary physiological conditions. Finally, our results together with previous work suggest that synapses modulate their RRP size during certain forms of synaptic plasticity, as discussed above for the case of PTP.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Maximum RRP size for other synaptic types</title><p>Central mammalian synapses are very diverse functionally, and this is reflected in differences in the structure and molecular composition of their AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sakamoto et al., 2022</xref>). PF–MLI synapses, as well as other synapses of the cerebellar molecular layer involving PF signaling (including mossy fiber-granule cell synapses and PF–Purkinje cell synapses), are characterized by a high level of synaptic facilitation as well as by fast SV replenishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atluri and Regehr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hallermann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ritzau-Jost et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saviane and Silver, 2006</xref>). In contrast, other synapses such as the calyx of Held display less facilitation and slower SV replenishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taschenberger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taschenberger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). At synapses between hippocampal mossy fibers and CA3 interneurons, where synaptic depression is prominent, the RRP size per docking site was recently estimated with the SMN method at 1.6 SVs in 3 mM Ca<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanaka et al., 2021</xref>), compared to 0.85 SV in the present study. Based on these results and on the simulations in the present work, it can be speculated that synapses with high p values exhibiting synaptic depression may more readily reach conditions where the ratio of RRP size to <italic>N</italic> is larger than 1, compared with synapses with low p values exhibiting synaptic facilitation. Future work will be needed to test this prediction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Relation with EM studies</title><p>The finding of 2 SVs per docking site implies the existence of two separate SV-binding sites able to accommodate two SVs simultaneously. In EM studies performed at amphibian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Szule et al., 2012</xref>) and mammalian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nagwaney et al., 2009</xref>) neuromuscular junctions, as well as in hippocampal cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cole et al., 2016</xref>), two sets of SVs likely belonging to the RRP have been identified. These EM data are consistent with the suggestion that the RRP comprises two classes of SVs that bind at distinct distances from release sites, with distance differences on the order of one SV diameter. In such a situation an RRP size of 2 per release site is plausible. Other EM studies identified a separate set of SVs located at a distance of about 5–10 nm from the plasma membrane. For these SVs, docking appears to involve a short distance movement from their pre-docked resting state to a fully docked state where they are in direct contact with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2018</xref>). This second set of EM results is consistent with the suggestion of two mutually exclusive pre-docked and docked states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>). In such a situation each docking site can accommodate maximally one SV, such that the maximal RRP size is 1 per docking site (LS/TS model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Altogether, some EM results appear to favor the RS/DS model (RRP size up to 2 SVs per docking site) while other EM results appear to favor the RS/DS model (RRP size up to 1 SV per docking site). It is possible that these differences reflect differences in synapse structure depending on synaptic class.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Potential functional advantages of having up to 2 bound SVs per docking site</title><p>Various potential functional advantages can be envisaged for having up to 2 bound SVs per docking site.</p><p>Firstly, the RRP capacity is increased, since the RRP size can reach up to 2 SVs per docking site, compared to up to 1 SV per docking site in the LS/TS model. The increased RRP capacity translates into a larger responsiveness of the synapse at the onset of AP train stimulation. This is potentially important for simple synapses, having but a few docking sites, as a larger total number of released SVs improves the reliability of synaptic output during the first APs in a train.</p><p>Secondly, a mechanism of facilitation based on a calcium-dependent increase in docking occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Silva et al., 2021</xref>) is more feasible if each docking site can accommodate up to 2 SVs compared to 1 SV. This is because the complement of SVs available to refill the docking sites is larger in the former case than in the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Third, doubly occupied docking sites contribute to spreading the release of the RRP over a wider range of AP numbers. For docking sites that are doubly occupied at train onset, the movement of SVs from replacement site to docking site must await clearing of the docking site by exocytosis, thus delaying the release of the SV initially occupying the replacement site to later AP numbers in the train. This effect, together with facilitation, counterbalances the synaptic depression following release of docked SVs, and helps retaining a relatively stable synaptic output as a function of AP number during trains.</p><p>A fourth potential functional advantage of doubly occupied docking sites is that the replacement site can act as an entry gate into the RRP. A high occupancy of the replacement site may result in a reduction of the flow of SVs into the RRP, independently of the state of occupancy of the docking site. By controlling the filling state of a separate replacement site, in ways that remain to be investigated, the synapse may be able to control RRP replenishment rate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model</title><p>C57BL/6 mice (10–16 days old; either sex) were used for preparation of acute brain slices.

Both effects should help minimizing the difference between the number of SVs released after two APs and the number of SV-binding sites. Therefore, in the present work, we used an elevated external calcium concentration (3 mM). We also used the potassium channel blocker 4-AP, which is very effective in increasing release probability at various synapses including PF–MLI synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heuser et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ishikawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malagon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tan and Llano, 1999</xref>).

These five parameters were then used for deconvolution of the template and of individual data traces, producing a narrow spike (called spike template) and sequences of spikes, respectively. Next, each deconvolved trace was fitted with a sum of scaled versions of the spike template, yielding the timing and amplitude of each release event. The amplitude was further corrected for receptor saturation and desensitization, using the exponential relationship between individual amplitudes and the time interval since the preceding release events.

For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, the IP was added to the RS/DS model and transitions and replenishment conditions were adapted accordingly.</p><p>In the LS/TS model transitions are equivalent to the RS/DS model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), however only one SV can occupy the DS at a time, being either in TS or LS. The replenishment step was adapted to fit this condition. As in the RS/DS model, the distal–proximal (TS–LS) transition is sequential and release can only happen from distally bound (TS) vesicles.</p><p>For the models, parameter values are shown in figures or figure legends and were obtained by fitting using least mean squares of free parameters. For the RS/DS model with IP, parameters were kept as in the RS/DS original fitting and a new fitting was performed for the two new parameters (IP size and IP replenishment probability). Calculations were done 5000 times for each condition and the averaged values are displayed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>C57BL/6 mice (10–16 days old; either sex) were used for preparation of acute brain slices.

The study aims to determine whether there are multiple binding sites for SVs at each docking site, which could lead to a higher RRP size than previously thought.</p><p>The researchers used this glutamatergic synapse to conduct their experiments. They employed various techniques and manipulations to enhance release probability, docking site occupancy, and synaptic depression. By counting the number of released SVs in response to action potential trains and normalizing the results based on the number of docking sites, they estimated the RRP size per docking site.</p><p>The key findings and observations in the manuscript are as follows:</p><p>Docking Site Occupancy and Release Probability Enhancement: The researchers used 4-amidopyridine (4-AP) and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) protocols to enhance the release probability of docked SVs and the occupancy of docking sites, respectively.</p><p>Synchronous and Asynchronous Release: Synchronous release refers to SVs released in response to individual action potentials, while asynchronous release involves SVs released after the initial release response due to calcium elevation. The study observed changes in the balance between synchronous and asynchronous release under different conditions, revealing the degree of filling of the RRP.</p><p>Modeling of Release Dynamics: The researchers employed a modeling approach based on the &quot;replacement site/docking site&quot; (RS/DS) model, where SVs bind to a replacement site before moving to a docking site and eventually undergoing release. The model was adjusted to experimental conditions to estimate parameters like docking site occupancy and release probabilities.</p><p>Comparison of Different Models: The study compared the RS/DS model with an alternative model known as the &quot;loosely docked/tightly docked&quot; (LS/TS) model. The LS/TS model assumes that a docking site can only accommodate one SV at a time, while the RS/DS model considers the possibility of accommodating multiple SVs.</p><p>Maximum RRP Size: Through a combination of experimental results and model simulations, the study revealed that the maximum RRP size per docking site reached close to two SVs under certain conditions, supporting the idea that each docking site can accommodate multiple SVs.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study is rigorously conducted and takes into consideration previous work of RRP size and SV docking site estimation. The study addresses a long-standing question in synaptic physiology.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>It remains unclear how generalizable the findings are to other types of synapses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91087.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Silva</surname><given-names>Melissa</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Université Paris Cité</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tran</surname><given-names>Van</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Universite Paris Cite</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris Cedex 6</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Marty</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Université Paris Cité</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Weaknesses: The interpretation is somewhat model-dependent, and it is unclear if the interpretation is unique.

In the Discussion we have a paragraph titled 'Maximum RRP size for other synaptic types' where we discuss this point. As we say in this paragraph, central synapses are clearly diverse, and the level of applicability of our results across preparations will depend on our ability to extend SV counting to various types of brain synapses. For the moment SV counting has been applied to only two types of synapses: PF-MLI synapses and hMF-IN synapses. We are encouraged by the fact that the simple synapse study by Tanaka et al. (2021), carried out at hMF-IN synapses, offers another example where the ratio between RRP size and N is larger than 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations to Authors,</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>The manuscript is at times difficult to read or reads like a review. The introduction could be shortened to concisely outline the motivation and premises for the study. The results and methods sections should not contain excessive interpretation and discussion. Although very informative, it distracts from the simple principal message.</p></disp-quote><p>To address these criticisms, we have shortened the Introduction and parts of the Results section. These changes have resulted in a presentation of Results that is shorter and more focused on data and simulations than in the previous version. Nevertheless, readers need to be informed of ongoing research on docking sites and the principles of sequential models to understand the usefulness of our work. For this reason, we have maintained a theoretical section at the beginning of Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The rationale for the choice of synapse and experimental conditions remains unclear until the discussion. This needs to be clearly addressed at the beginning, in the introduction, or in the results. In particular, the extracellular calcium concentration and the addition of 4-AP to the recording solution should be addressed in the results.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason to choose the PF-MLI synapse is now indicated at the end of the Introduction. The rationale underlying our choice of experimental conditions including the extracellular calcium concentration and the addition of 4-AP is now briefly explained in the beginning the second section of Results (titled 'Maximizing RRP size and its release during AP trains'), and more extensively in the Methods section (as in the previous version of the manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Potential confounds of the approach should be discussed e.g. could a broadened AP in 4-AP alter synchronicity of release, i.e. desynchronization of release, especially during trains. That could be complemented with information on the EPSC kinetics (rise, decay) under different experimental conditions, as well as during train stimulation. How could presynaptic calcium concentration and time course in 4-AP impact the conclusions?</p></disp-quote><p>To study the effects of 4-AP on AP broadening we have performed a new analysis of EPSC latencies in control and in 4-AP. In both cases the first latencies were independent of i. In 4-AP, first latencies displayed a small right shift of 0.2 ms (see additional figure below). This indicates that 4-AP does broaden the AP waveform, but that the extent of this broadening is limited. This new information has been added in the Methods of the revised manuscript.</p><p>As suspected by the Reviewer, the latency distribution changes as a function of i and in the presence of 4-AP. Consistent with earlier findings (Miki et al., 2018), the proportion of 2-step release (with longer latencies) augments as a function of i both in control and in 4-AP. We also find that the value of the fast time constant of the latency distribution,τf, is larger in 4-AP than in control. This last result probably indicates a longer presynaptic calcium entry in 4-AP.</p><p>In the revised version, we describe these results in the Methods section, in a new paragraph titled 'Changes in latency distributions as a function of i and of experimental conditions'.</p><p>While the latency distributions change as a function of i and as a function of experimental conditions, this does not affect our conclusions, because these conclusions are based on the summed number of release events after each AP (or in other words, on the integral of the latency distributions).</p><p>The kinetics of mEPSCs (risetime and decay time) are unchanged by 4-AP or by PTP. Consequently, in a given experiment, we used the same template to perform our deconvolution analysis for all conditions that were examined (starting with 3 mM Cao up to 200 Hz). This information has now been added in Methods.</p><p>Following an AP stimulation, the amount of calcium entry in the presence of 4-AP is presumably much larger than in control. TEA, a weaker K channel blocker than 4-AP at PF-MLI synapses, elicits a marked increase in calcium entry (Malagon et al., 2020). This suggests an even larger increase with 4-AP, even though this has not been directly confirmed in the present work. The enhanced calcium entry translates in an increase in the parameters pr, r and s of our model. The important thing for our study is to increase pr and r as much as possible to promote the emptying of the RRP during trains. Knowing the exact amount of calcium entry and its relation to pr /r increase is not essential for this purpose. Likewise, whether r (and/or s) increase as a function of i is of little practical importance since much of the RRP is emptied already after the second stimulation, at least in the most extreme case (200 Hz stimulation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The applicability of this model to other synapses needs to be addressed more thoroughly. This synapse, under physiological conditions, has a very low Pr, and the experimental conditions have to be adjusted dramatically to achieve a high-Pr. How applicable are the conclusions to high-Pr synapses and/or synapses that operate in a multivesicular release regime? Although that might be difficult to test experimentally it should be addressed in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The applicability issue to other synapses has been addressed above, in response to the public comments of the same Reviewer.</p><p>As the Reviewer points out, the PF-MLI synapse has a small P value under physiological conditions. One can speculate that synapses that exhibit a higher P value may have a higher docking site occupancy than PF-MLI synapses. This feature would increase their chance of having a ratio of RRP size over N larger than 1, as it occurs in PF-MLI synapses in high docking occupancy conditions. A sentence making this point has been added to the paragraph titled 'Maximum RRP size for other synaptic types' in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Latency histograms for s1 in control and in the presence of 4-AP.</title><p>After normalization, the averaged latency histogram in 4-AP displays an additional delay of 0.2 ms, and a slowing of the time constant τf from 0.47 ms to 0.70 ms.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91087-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
