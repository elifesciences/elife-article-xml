of the process (spanning days or weeks), and the fact that cellular resolution must be achieved without damage caused by lengthy exposures to light. Building on previous work that allowed us to image different parts of the process of leg regeneration in the crustacean <italic>Parhyale hawaiensis</italic>, we present here a method for live imaging that captures the entire process of leg regeneration, spanning up to 10 days, at cellular resolution. Our method includes (1) mounting and long-term live imaging of regenerating legs under conditions that yield high spatial and temporal resolution but minimise photodamage, (2) fixing and in situ staining of the regenerated legs that were imaged, to identify cell fates, and (3) computer-assisted cell tracking to determine the cell lineages and progenitors of identified cells. The method is optimised to limit light exposure while maximising tracking efficiency. Combined with appropriate cell-type-specific markers, this method may allow the description of cell lineages for every regenerated cell type in the limb.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Parhyale hawaiensis</italic></kwd><kwd>leg regeneration</kwd><kwd>cell lineage</kwd><kwd>cell fate</kwd><kwd>hybridisation chain reaction</kwd><kwd>HCR</kwd><kwd>live imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2015-AdG 694918</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Averof</surname><given-names>Michalis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-21-CE13-0044-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Averof</surname><given-names>Michalis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Çevrim</surname><given-names>Çağrı</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Core Research for Evolutionary Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR1926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sugawara</surname><given-names>Ko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Live imaging allows tracking cellular behaviours and cell fates during the entire course of leg regeneration, spanning approximately one week, in a crustacean model.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In contrast to imaging embryonic development, live imaging of regeneration presents unique challenges that have so far been difficult to overcome. First, unlike developing embryos which can be easily immobilised, regenerating juvenile or adult animals are mobile and cannot easily be fixed under a microscope over long periods of time. These animals need to move to capture food and, in many cases, to breathe. Anaesthesia is possible for short periods, but lethal if applied over many hours or days.</p><p>Second, imaging embryonic development has been particularly successful in animals with rapid development. Developmental processes with a duration of hours or a few days, such as the embryonic development of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and zebrafish, or the process of somitogenesis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Masamizu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tomer et al., 2012</xref>), can be followed with high temporal resolution. Processes with a longer duration, however, present greater challenges due to the damaging effects that prolonged exposure to light has on living tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Icha et al., 2017</xref>). Long-term live imaging also requires robust microscope-camera setups that can maintain image quality and record images over long periods. Regeneration typically takes place on a timescale of several days or weeks.</p><p>Third, the larger size of juvenile or adult organisms can impact live imaging in a number of ways, for example, by constraining how large specimens can be mounted on a microscope (or, indeed, how a microscope might be mounted on the animal, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aharoni et al., 2019</xref>), or by exceeding a microscope’s field of view or imaging depth.</p><p>In spite of these difficulties, live imaging of regeneration – under anaesthesia – has been developed in zebrafish and mice, allowing for successful imaging of cell dynamics during repair or regeneration in different organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chioccioli et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gurevich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kamimoto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mateus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Park et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pineda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rompolas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Webster et al., 2016</xref>). The duration of continuous time-lapse recordings, in these cases, has been constrained by poor survival under long-term anaesthesia and is typically limited to less than one day. An alternative approach has been to immobilise a regenerating animal for the time required to acquire an image stack and then to release it, until the next imaging time point when one re-captures the animal and re-visits the same body part. This approach has allowed imaging experiments to run over much longer time periods (several days, even weeks), but with much lower temporal resolution, typically 12 or 24 h between successive time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chioccioli et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Currie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Simone et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mateus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pineda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rompolas et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>A major challenge in the latter approach is identifying the same cells at different time points, especially after cell divisions and movements. This can be made easier by sparse labelling of cells, or mosaic labelling of cell clones, for example using <italic>Brainbow</italic>-like methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbosa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Currie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ritsma et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, the crustacean <italic>Parhyale hawaiensis</italic> has emerged as a promising experimental system for studying regeneration, in which transgenic tools can be combined with live imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grillo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Konstantinides and Averof, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paris et al., 2022</xref>). For live imaging, a major advantage of <italic>Parhyale</italic> is our ability to immobilise its regenerating legs over long periods without needing to keep the animals under anaesthesia. This is achieved by fixing the chitinous exoskeleton that surrounds the leg onto the microscope coverslip using surgical glue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Konstantinides and Averof, 2014</xref>). Thus, <italic>Parhyale</italic>’s cuticle – which is both sturdy and transparent – serves as a straitjacket to immobilise the leg, and as a window through which we can visualise regeneration. Our first systematic study using this approach presented continuous live imaging over periods of 2–3 days, capturing key events of leg regeneration such as wound closure, cell proliferation and morphogenesis of regenerating legs at single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we extend this work by developing a method for imaging the entire course of leg regeneration, optimised to reduce photodamage and to improve cell tracking. We also develop a method of in situ staining of gene expression in cuticularised adult legs, which we combine with live imaging to determine the fate of tracked cells.</p><p>Our objective is to image legs during the entire time course of leg regeneration, with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to support the tracking of individual cells in 3D. We also want to determine the identities and molecular signatures of the tracked cells. In the long term, this will enable us to identify progenitors for each cell type in the leg, to trace their complete genealogies, and to characterise the molecular and cell state transitions associated with leg regeneration.</p><p>Leg regeneration takes place over approximately 1 week in adult <italic>Parhyale</italic> (3–10 days, depending on the age of the individual, the injury sustained, and other unknown factors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Konstantinides and Averof, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sinigaglia et al., 2022</xref>). Our previous studies showed that imaging at 20-min intervals is sufficient to capture cell divisions and to track cells reliably over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, a complete recording of a regenerating leg would require capturing at least 360 image stacks, at 20-min intervals, over a period of 5 days. A major challenge we must address in such long-term imaging experiments is balancing the need for high spatial and temporal resolution with the need to minimise photodamage. Increasing spatial or temporal resolution (e.g. by using higher numerical aperture objectives, finer sampling in <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic> or <italic>z</italic>, or shorter imaging intervals) improves our ability to resolve and to track cells in a crowded cellular environment, but also leads to increased light exposure and resulting tissue damage.</p><p>Among the various imaging modalities available for live imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schroeder, 2008</xref>), we have used confocal microscopy. Light-sheet microscopy would have been preferable for minimising light exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stelzer et al., 2021</xref>), but the currently accessible light-sheet designs are incompatible with mounting and imaging through a glass coverslip, which we need in order to immobilise our specimens. Confocal microscopy is now widely established and commercial systems are stable enough to support automated 3D image acquisition over very long time courses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Imaging the entire course of leg regeneration at cellular resolution</title><p><italic>Parhyale</italic> can regenerate their limbs independently of the site of amputation.

To minimise photodamage, we image at long wavelengths, using a construct expressing H2B-mRFPruby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wolff et al., 2018</xref>). To induce transgene expression, a heat shock (45 min at 37°C) is applied, typically 12–18 h before amputation, yielding high levels of nuclear fluorescence which can persist for many days in non-dividing cells. Heat shocks may be repeated during the course of imaging, using the microscope’s temperature-controlled stage, to maintain adequate levels of fluorescence in dividing cells. The temperature change causes a slight displacement in the acquired images, which is corrected post acquisition (see Methods).</p><p>To minimise light-induced damage, we select transgenic individuals that show the highest levels of nuclear fluorescence and set the power of the excitation laser to the lowest setting that yields acceptable image quality on our most sensitive GaAsP detector. Previous experiments had shown that imaging with a pixel size of 0.31 × 0.31 μm, a <italic>z</italic> step of 2.48 μm, and a time interval of 20 min is sufficient for cell tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>), both manually and using the Elephant tracking software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sugawara et al., 2022</xref>). To improve image quality while keeping light exposure in check, we have tested different settings for scanning speed and image averaging and determined that a scanning speed of 2.06 μs per pixel with an averaging of two images (or 1.03 μs per pixel with an averaging of four images) are the fastest settings that generate images of sufficient quality for tracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Most animals imaged under these settings regenerate their legs within 5–10 days from amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), unless they have been amputated shortly before molting. In the latter case, the wound is closed and the animals molt before regenerating.

Within 24 hours post amputation (hpa), a melanised scab forms at the site of injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). This is accompanied by stretching and migration of epithelial cells to cover the wounded surface, under the scab (10–30 hpa in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). There is little (if any) cell division during these early stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Between 1 and 3.5 days post amputation, the epithelium detaches from the scab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; 31 hpa in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, 65 hpa in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). The timing of detachment varies considerably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), but we find that it often coincides with the onset of cell proliferation, cell–cell rearrangements and apoptosis in the cells that lie within ~100 µm from the scab. More proximally located tissues detach from the cuticle and retract towards the body, making space for the growth of regenerating tissues in the distal part of the stump (40–85 hpa in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; 80–120 hpa in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). The boundaries of the leg podomeres typically appear within a day from epithelial detachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>; 45–60 hpa in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; 80–95 hpa in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). In some recordings, the tissues making up the podomeres can be seen pulsating with a periodicity of 6–7 h (see 105–145 hpa in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). This pulsating movement had not been observed previously, and its significance is unclear. Later, the rates of cell proliferation and movement gradually decline and the nuclear positions within the tissue become stabilised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Based on transcriptome profiling data, we think that many cells differentiate during this phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sinigaglia et al., 2022</xref>). Once regeneration is completed, the newly regenerated leg is trapped inside the exoskeleton of the amputated leg stump. It is released from the old exoskeleton and becomes functional during the animal’s next molt. When the animal molts, the regenerated leg is fully formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almazán et al., 2022</xref>). Molting allows the animal to detach from the coverslip and therefore marks the end of our imaging.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Temporal pattern of cell divisions in regenerating <italic>Parhyale</italic> legs<bold>.</bold></title><p>The number of cell divisions detected per time point is shown for five recordings of regenerating legs.

Our fastest recordings show the leg of a young adult regenerating in less than 3 days at 29°C (li51-t4 and li51-t5). In contrast, the longest ones take ~10 days to complete regeneration (li16-t5 and li34-t4, imaged at 26–27°C). We find that the overall speed of leg regeneration is determined largely by variation in the speed of the early (wound closure) phase of regeneration, and to a lesser extent by variation in later phases when leg morphogenesis takes place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). There is no clear relationship between the <italic>relative</italic> duration of each phase and the speed of regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1 A',B'</xref>).</p><p>We note that pairs of adjacent T4 and T5 legs that were amputated simultaneously (in datasets li24, li41, li48, li51, and li5) appear to regenerate at a similar pace, suggesting variation in the speed of regeneration is influenced by systemic factors, such as the age, health or physiology of the individual.</p><p>During the course of regeneration, some cells undergo apoptosis (reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>). Using the H2B-mRFPruby marker, apoptotic cells appear as bright pyknotic nuclei that break up and become engulfed by circulating phagocytes (see bright specks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). While some cell death might be caused by photodamage, apoptosis can also be observed in regenerating legs that have not been subjected to live imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Computer-assisted cell tracking during regeneration</title><p>Continuous live imaging provides a unique opportunity to track cells and determine their behaviours, lineages and fates during the course of regeneration. We use the Mastodon cell tracking platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mastodon-sc/mastodon">https://github.com/mastodon-sc/mastodon</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tinevez et al., 2025</xref>) to perform cell tracking on regenerating <italic>Parhyale</italic> legs. We previously presented Elephant, a Mastodon plug-in that enables semi-automated cell tracking (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elephant-track">https://github.com/elephant-track</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sugawara et al., 2022</xref>). Elephant uses deep learning on sparse annotations provided by the user to identify and track nuclei across an entire image dataset, in 3D. The computationally predicted tracks must then be proofread and validated by the user.</p><p>The regenerating legs of <italic>Parhyale</italic> make challenging datasets for cell tracking, due to large variations in signal intensity and poor image quality in the deeper tissue layers. This is exacerbated by the need to limit the tissues’ exposure to light, which constrains signal intensity, spatial and temporal resolution (see above). Moreover, the datasets capturing the entire course of regeneration are large, typically consisting of image stacks of 15–30 <italic>z</italic> slices collected over 300–700 time points (i.e. ~10,000 images per dataset), which makes both manual tracking and proofreading of computer-generated tracks very laborious.</p><p>The initial implementation of Elephant generated tracking predictions over the entire image stack. We have now added a ‘backtracking’ function (see Methods), which allows users to focus on tracking cells of particular interest. With this function, users are able to select individual cells and obtain predictions on their progenitors, moving up towards earlier points in their cell lineage. This is particularly useful when specific cells of interest can be identified based on molecular or other markers (see below).</p><p>Using this mode of semi-automated cell tracking, we find that most cells in the upper slices of our image stacks (top 30 μm) can be tracked with a high degree of confidence. A smaller proportion of cells is trackable in deeper layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Tracking efficiency in relation to imaging depth.</title><p>Elephant’s performance in detecting nuclei at different depths was assessed in the datasets presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1A</xref>.

We approached this question by exploring the trade-offs between spatial resolution, temporal resolution and image quality, keeping in mind that the crowding of nuclei (in relation to <italic>z</italic> resolution) and the speed of mitosis (in relation to temporal resolution) are likely to limit tracking accuracy.</p><p>We started by recording leg regeneration at higher than usual spatial and temporal resolutions (0.31 × 0.31 µm pixel size, 1.24 µm <italic>z</italic> step, 10-min time intervals, four image replicates) and tracking all the nuclei in this volume to generate ground truth track annotations. We then simulated different imaging conditions by subsampling this recording to generate five datasets that differ in spatial resolution, temporal resolution and/or image quality: (#1) a dataset corresponding to our standard imaging settings, described earlier; (#2) a dataset with improved <italic>z</italic> resolution, but lower image quality; (#3) a dataset with improved temporal resolution, but lower image quality; (#4) a dataset with improved <italic>z</italic> and temporal resolutions, but lower resolution in <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic>; and (#5) a dataset with improved <italic>z</italic> and temporal resolutions, but lower image quality (summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To assess the trade-offs between these parameters, we made sure that each of these five datasets would require precisely the same amount of light exposure. We then evaluated and compared the performance of Elephant across these datasets, in relation to the ground truth, using different metrics, including overall cell detection (DET) and tracking (TRA) scores, measurements of precision and recall rates for the detection and linking of spots across time points, and an estimate of the time or effort required to proofread the resulting cell tracks (see Methods).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Evaluating image acquisition settings and post-processing settings based on cell tracking performance.</title><p>(A) Elephant’s tracking performance was evaluated on the same image dataset rendered at different resolutions and image quality (datasets #1–5), as described in the Methods.

This improvement is particularly evident in the deeper layers of the imaging stacks, which are usually the most challenging to track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Tracking of nuclei across time points (linking) can be enhanced by doubling the temporal resolution at the expense of <italic>xy</italic> resolution and image quality (compare linking metrics in #1 versus #3, #4, and #5). Taking both detection and linking into account, it appears that the best tracking performance is achieved by improving both <italic>z</italic> and <italic>t</italic> resolution, at the expense of <italic>xy</italic> resolution or image quality (conditions #4 and #5). However, doubling the temporal resolution requires much more effort for proofreading (see last column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1A</xref>), because the datasets contain many more time points.</p><p>We conclude that improving the <italic>z</italic> resolution (condition #2) should be the preferred option when taking into account the efforts required for proofreading.

During the last years, we have tried to develop cell-type-specific fluorescent markers for live imaging using different approaches (CRISPR knock-ins, gene trapping, promoter reporters), but we have not yet succeeded in developing such tools. To overcome this limitation, we have turned to in situ staining of molecular markers. Our method involves live imaging, fixation and post hoc staining of the regenerated legs, and manual image registration, allowing us to associate the stained cells with specific nuclei tracked in the live recordings.</p><p>Initially, we developed this approach using immunostaining with antibodies for the <italic>Parhyale</italic> Repo protein (identifying putative glial cells, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almazán et al., 2022</xref>), a cross-reactive antibody raised against Prospero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Perry et al., 2016</xref>) and an antibody for acetylated tubulin (see Methods).

Using single-nucleus transcriptional profiling, we previously identified approximately 15 transcriptionally distinct cell types in adult <italic>Parhyale</italic> legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almazán et al., 2022</xref>), including epidermis, muscle, neurons, haemocytes, and a number of still unidentified cell types. Numerous marker genes can be identified in these data, but generating and validating antibodies for these markers is a severe bottleneck. To overcome this problem, we developed an alternative approach for detecting these marker genes by in situ staining, using short nucleotide probes.</p><p>Numerous efforts to apply in situ hybridisation protocols on <italic>Parhyale</italic> legs have failed in the past, because the chitinous exoskeleton surrounding the adult legs is impermeable to probes or gives high unspecific staining. By fragmenting the legs and using long incubation times, the permeability problem was partly solved for antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almazán et al., 2022</xref>) but could not be overcome with conventional in situ hybridisation probes, presumably due to their large molecular size. We therefore turned to hybridisation chain reaction (HCR), a sensitive in situ hybridisation method that makes use of much shorter probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2018</xref>). Starting from an HCR protocol used in <italic>Parhyale</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruce et al., 2021</xref>), we adapted HCR to adult legs by extending the permeabilisation step, adding a decalcification step to soften the cuticle, adjusting probe concentrations and extending the incubation and washing steps (see Methods). Using this method, we are able to label specific populations of cells, such as neurons (using probes for <italic>futsch</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hummel et al., 2000</xref>) and mechanosensory organs (using probes for <italic>nompA</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2001</xref>), in late embryos and adult legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is the first time we are able to apply an in situ hybridisation approach in adult legs, overcoming the cuticular permeability barrier.</p><p>As described earlier for immunostainings, we applied HCR to regenerated legs immediately after live imaging and were able to locate the stained cells in the live image recordings. This approach allows us to track the origins of molecularly identified cells during the course of regeneration. As a proof of principle, we tracked the origin of a population of <italic>spineless</italic>-expressing cells in the distal part of the regenerated carpus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>spineless</italic> is expressed in a ring of cells in the distal part of developing legs; it encodes a transcription factor that plays a role in patterning of the tarsal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duncan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Natori et al., 2012</xref>).

This provides unique opportunities to identify the progenitors of regenerated tissues, their degree of commitment, locations, division patterns and behaviours during regeneration. Combined with high-resolution live imaging of developing embryonic legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wolff et al., 2018</xref>), it also offers the chance to compare the cellular dynamics of leg regeneration with those of leg development.</p><p>Currently, there are two major limitations in this research approach. First, image quality limits the efficiency with which we can track cells, particularly in the deeper tissue layers. Improved image quality could be achieved with higher numerical aperture objectives, stronger fluorescence signals and longer exposure times, to increase signal-to-noise ratios and resolution. These improvements, however, come with trade-offs in terms of increased light exposure and tissue damage. An obvious improvement, in this respect, would come from replacing confocal microscopy by a more gentle imaging method, such as light-sheet microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stelzer et al., 2021</xref>). Unfortunately, our current method for immobilising <italic>Parhyale</italic> legs for live imaging is incompatible with conventional light-sheet microscopy, because it requires glueing and imaging the specimens through a glass coverslip. At present, the method we describe here provides the most robust approach to image leg regeneration in <italic>Parhyale</italic>.</p><p>A second limitation is the dearth of fluorescent markers that we can use to identify different cell types and cellular transitions during the course of live imaging.

The divisions in li13-t4 were extracted from the extensive cell tracking carried out previously in that dataset using Elephant and manual proofreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sugawara et al., 2022</xref>). The divisions in the other datasets were detected by training an Elephant detection model to identify the nuclei of dividing cells at metaphase, followed by manual proofreading of the predictions. Training was conducted on cropped volumes of size (96 × 96 × 96 pixels) extracted from the resized image volumes that were rescaled by a factor of eight along the <italic>Z</italic>-axis to render them nearly isotropic. Each volume was augmented with random flips along all three dimensions to enhance the robustness of the model. In each iteration of training, the model was trained over 10 epochs with a batch size of 20, using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. Prediction was performed on the resized image volumes using patches of size (96 × 96 × 96 pixels). A threshold of 0.8 was applied to the probabilities to filter out low-confidence predictions. The parameters for the centre detection were set to: minimum radius (rmin) 1 µm, maximum radius (rmax) 5 µm, and suppression distance (dsup) 3 µm (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sugawara et al., 2022</xref>).

A ‘backtracking’ function was added to Elephant (v.0.4.3, released 9 June 2023), allowing users to track cells of particular interest. This function allows users to automatically trace the position of a selected cell backward in time using the flow estimation algorithm integrated in Elephant. Prior to initiating the tracking process, a detection model and a flow estimation model are trained on the target image data (or a similar dataset) to ensure precise tracking. Users can select the target cell in the Elephant graphical user interface. The method then processes each time point iteratively, creating track links by predicting the target cell’s position at the previous time point and identifying the closest detected cell. This is achieved by predicting spots around the cell’s estimated position. If no cells are detected in the vicinity, the algorithm interpolates a new spot at the position estimated by the flow model. The maximum number of time points for interpolation can be specified.

We did this using a Mastodon plug-in (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mastodon-sc/mastodon-averoflab">https://github.com/mastodon-sc/mastodon-averoflab</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugawara, 2025d</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15162873">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15162873</ext-link>), generating a reduced set of ground truth annotations with 7068 spots and 6790 links. These annotations include 356 spots and 346 links in the 10 tracks selected for training Elephant.</p><p>To ensure a fair comparison of the tracking metrics across datasets of varying sizes, the training of the models was conducted using resized volumes, standardised to the same dimensions as the highest resolution data (512 × 512 × 20 pixels). Additionally, the number of iteration steps during training was kept nearly identical across all datasets, ensuring consistent model training and allowing for a reliable comparison of tracking performance.</p><p>The detection models were trained using a standardised approach to ensure consistency across the datasets. For datasets #1, #3, and #4, the input image volumes were resized to dimensions of (512 × 512 × 20 pixels) with nearest-neighbour interpolation. For the remaining datasets, which were already sized at (512 × 512 × 20 pixels), no resizing was necessary. Training was conducted on cropped volumes of size (128 × 128 × 16 pixels) extracted from the resized image volumes. Each volume was augmented with random flips along all three dimensions to enhance the robustness of the model. The models were trained over 10 epochs with a batch size of 20, using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01. For datasets #1 and #2, which contain 28 time points with annotations, 100 volumes were cropped from each time point for training in each epoch. For the other datasets, which contain 55 time points with annotations, 50 volumes were cropped from each time point for training in each epoch. During training, the centre ratio was set to 0.4, and the background threshold was set to 0, meaning that only explicitly annotated voxels were utilised in the training process. The source code used for training the detection models is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elephant-track/elephant-server/blob/trackathon-paper/script/train_trackathon.sh">https://github.com/elephant-track/elephant-server/blob/trackathon-paper/script/train_trackathon.sh</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sugawara, 2025e</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15161691">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15161691</ext-link>). The trained detection models were then used to predict nuclei in datasets #1–5, following the same procedure across all datasets. The input image volumes were resized in the same manner as during training, ensuring that the model operated on images of dimensions (512 × 512 × 20 pixels). Prediction was performed directly on the resized image volumes without further patching, allowing the model to process the entire volume in one step. A threshold of 0.7 was applied to the probabilities to filter out low-confidence predictions. The parameters for the centre detection were set to: minimum radius (<italic>r<sub>min</sub></italic>) 1 µm, maximum radius (<italic>r<sub>max</sub></italic>) 5 µm, and suppression distance (<italic>d<sub>sup</sub></italic>) 3 µm (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sugawara et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The flow models were trained following a similar preprocessing as described for the detection models. Input image volumes were resized and cropped with random flips across all dimensions, as in the training of detection models. The flow models were trained over 10 epochs with a batch size of 1, employing the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.00001. For datasets #1 and #2, which include 27 pairs of successive time points with annotations, 100 volumes were cropped from each time point for training in each epoch. For the other datasets, which include 54 pairs of successive time points with annotations, 50 volumes were cropped from each time point for training in each epoch. The source code used for training the flow models is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elephant-track/elephant-server/blob/trackathon-paper/script/train_trackathon_flow.sh">https://github.com/elephant-track/elephant-server/blob/trackathon-paper/script/train_trackathon_flow.sh</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sugawara, 2025e</xref>). The trained flow models were then employed for tracking by providing flow predictions. To ensure a fair comparison of the tracking metrics across datasets of varying sizes, the input image volumes were resized in the same manner as during training, ensuring that the model operated on images with dimensions of (512 × 512 × 20 pixels). Tracking was performed directly on the resized image volumes without additional patching, allowing the model to process the entire volume in a single step. In the nearest neighbour linking algorithm, the maximum distance threshold of 5 µm was applied (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sugawara et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, the maximum number of links per cell was set to 2, enabling the tracking of dividing cells.</p><p>The tracking results were evaluated using several metrics to comprehensively assess performance under each condition. Detection and tracking accuracy (DET and TRA) were defined in the Cell Tracking Challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matula et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ulman et al., 2017</xref>); DET was used to evaluate the model’s ability to correctly identify the locations of cells, and TRA to assess the overall performance of the tracking model, including the accuracy of both detection and linking.</p><p>Detection precision and recall were calculated based on the DET analysis, offering insights into the model’s ability to correctly identify true positives (<italic>precision = TP</italic>/(<italic>TP + FP</italic>)) and its capability to recall all relevant instances (<italic>recall = TP</italic>/(<italic>TP + FN</italic>)). Linking precision and recall was derived in the same manner from the TRA analysis. In order to measure specifically the linking performance, independently of detection, we measured the linking precision and recall from tracking performed on the spots of the ground truth data (TRA on GT, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). DET and TRA scores were normalised to the range [0, 1] by calculating the cost of transforming the computed set of detections and links into the reference set (ground truth data). This normalisation provides a representation of model performance that is comparable across different datasets, independent of their size.</p><p>Last, we estimated the time or effort that would be required to proofread the tracking results (in arbitrary units) based on the acyclic oriented graphs matching metric, which is part of the calculation of TRA scores (see Table 6 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matula et al., 2015</xref>). This metric depends both on the model’s performance and the total number of spots and links across all time points; as the number of time points increases, the number of data points requiring correction also increases, thereby impacting the proofreading time.</p><p>To account for variation in the training, three detection and three linking (flow) models were trained and evaluated independently on each dataset. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> shows the averaged scores of the three iterations.

Parhyale is an emerging and tractable model system that offers insights into the evolution and mechanisms of development and regeneration. Çevrim et al. demonstrate the ability to image the complete leg regeneration process, spanning several days, with 10-20 minute time intervals and cellular resolution. They have concurrently optimized imaging conditions to enable cell tracking while minimizing phototoxicity. Additionally, they report successfully implementing HCR in situ hybridization in Parhyale, allowing for specific gene transcript staining at the endpoint of live imaging. This opens the possibility of assigning molecular identities to tracked cells.</p><p>A key challenge in many regeneration models is achieving continuous imaging throughout the entire regenerative process, as many organisms are difficult to immobilize or cannot tolerate extended imaging without stress. This manuscript's major strength lies in providing practical solutions to these challenges in Parhyale, a compelling and accessible arthropod model for limb regeneration. The authors also employ complementary tools to analyze time-lapse movies and correlate them with endpoint staining. Together, these advances will serve as a useful resource for researchers studying regeneration in Parhyale or in other systems where parts of this workflow can be adapted.</p><p>While the data demonstrating the methodological advancement and technical feasibility are solid, much of the benchmarking and regeneration characterization remains qualitative. This does not undermine the validity of the proof-of-principle, but limits the study's broader appeal.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107534.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The manuscript by Çevrim et al. presents a live-imaging workflow that captures the complete leg regeneration process in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis, at a resolution suitable for cell tracking and gene expression analysis. Building on earlier work describing selective stages of leg regeneration (Alwes et al., 2016), the authors recorded 22 confocal time-lapse movies, starting from amputation to full regeneration. They defined three distinct phases of regeneration (wound closure, cell proliferation and morphogenesis, and differentiation) based on cellular and morphological features.</p><p>One movie was used to assess how imaging parameters (z-spacing, time intervals, and image quality) influence tracking reliability and the time required for manual proofreading, with an effort to minimize phototoxicity. Tracking was performed in the upper tissue layers using an improved version of the Mastodon plug-in Elephant in Fiji. The same sample was fixed post-imaging for in situ hybridization using an HCR protocol adapted for adult legs, targeting the gene spineless. This enabled the alignment of gene expression with specific cell lineages and the identification of progenitor cells present at the time of amputation.</p><p>In summary, the study provides a proof-of-principle for combining long-term live imaging, cell tracking, and gene expression analysis during regeneration. Given the labor-intensive nature of tracking over a 5-10 day time-lapse movie, the use of a single movie for this study is well justified. The workflow, from imaging to lineage reconstruction and molecular annotation, is successfully demonstrated and well documented with this dataset.</p><p>Although the biological insights from the cell lineage and molecular mapping are still limited, the methodology offers significant potential in regenerative biology to uncover the cellular and molecular contributions to tissue and cell type re-formation.</p><p>Confocal microscopy was used for live imaging, which restricted imaging to the upper 30 µm tissue layer. Light-sheet microscopy could have provided gentler imaging and enabled imaging from multiple angles to image the whole leg. While the authors acknowledge this possibility in the manuscript, they discarded it due to incompatibility between their mounting strategy and available light-sheet microscopes. As a future direction, optimizing the mounting approach for compatibility with light-sheet microscopes could enable more comprehensive tissue imaging.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107534.2.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Çevrim</surname><given-names>Çağrı</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Laplace-Builhé</surname><given-names>Béryl</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sugawara</surname><given-names>Ko</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kobe</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rusciano</surname><given-names>Maria Lorenza</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Labert</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>École Normale Supérieure de Lyon</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Brocard</surname><given-names>Jacques</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>École Normale Supérieure de Lyon</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Grenoble</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Almazán</surname><given-names>Alba</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Averof</surname><given-names>Michalis</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank the reviewers for their feedback on our paper.

Of the 22 movies recorded one was used for cell tracking. One movie seems sufficient for the second part of the manuscript, as this manuscript presents a proof-of-principle pipeline for an imaging experiment followed by cell tracking and molecular characterisation of the cells by HCR. In addition, cell tracking in a 5-10 day time-lapse movie is an enormous time commitment.</p><p>My only major comment is regarding &quot;Suppl_data_5_spineless_tracking&quot;. The image file does not load.</p><p>It looks like the wrong file is linked to the mastodon dataset. The &quot;Current BDV dataset path&quot; is set to &quot;Beryl_data_files/BLB mosaic cut movie-02.xml&quot;, but this file does not exist in the folder. Please link it to the correct file.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the file path in the updated version of Suppl. Data 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>The authors state that their imaging settings aim to reduce photo damage. Do they see cell death in the regenerating legs? Is the cell death induced by the light exposure or can they tell if the same cells die between the movies? That is, do they observe cell death in the same phases of regeneration and/or in the same regions of the regenerating legs?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we observe cell death during Parhyale leg regeneration. We have added the following sentence to explain this in the revised manuscript: &quot;During the course of regeneration some cells undergo apoptosis (reported in Alwes et al., 2016). Using the H2B-mRFPruby marker, apoptotic cells appear as bright pyknotic nuclei that break up and become engulfed by circulating phagocytes (see bright specks in Figure 2F).&quot;</p><p>We now also document apoptosis in regenerated legs that have not been subjected to live imaging in a new supplementary figure (Suppl. Figure 3), and we refer to these observations as follows: &quot;While some cell death might be caused by photodamage, apoptosis can also be observed in similar numbers in regenerating legs that have not been subjected to live imaging (Suppl. Figure 3).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on 22 movies, the authors divide the regeneration process into three phases and they describe that the timing of leg regeneration varies between individuals. Are the phases proportionally the same length between regenerating legs or do the authors find differences between fast/slow regenerating legs? If there is a difference in the proportions, why might this be?</p></disp-quote><p>Both early and late phases contribute to variation in the speed of regeneration, but there is no clear relationship between the relative duration of each phase and the speed of regeneration. We now present graphs supporting these points in a new supplementary figure (Suppl. Figure 2).</p><p>To clarify this point, we have added the following sentence in the manuscript: &quot;We find that the overall speed of leg regeneration is determined largely by variation in the speed of the early (wound closure) phase of regeneration, and to a lesser extent by variation in later phases when leg morphogenesis takes place (Suppl. Figure 2 A,B). There is no clear relationship between the relative duration of each phase and the speed of regeneration (Suppl. Figure 2 A',B').&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on their initial cell tracing experiment, could the authors elaborate more on what kind of biological information can be extracted from the cell lineages, apart from determining which is the progenitor of a cell? What does it tell us about the cell population in the tissue? Is there indication of multi- or pluripotent stem cells? What does it say about the type of regeneration that is taking place in terms of epimorphosis and morphallaxis, the old concepts of regeneration?</p></disp-quote><p>In the first paragraph of Future Directions we describe briefly the kind of biological information that could be gained by applying our live imaging approach with appropriate cell-type markers (see below). We do not comment further, as we do not currently have this information at hand. Regarding the concepts of epimorphosis and morphallaxis, as we explain in Alwes et al. 2016, these terms describe two extreme conditions that do not capture what we observe during Parhyale leg regeneration. Our current work does not bring new insights on this topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 5. The authors mention the possibility of identifying the cell ID based on transcriptomic profiling data. Can they suggest how many and which cell types they expect to find in the last stage based on their transcriptomic data?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this sentence: &quot;Using single-nucleus transcriptional profiling, we have identified approximately 15 transcriptionally-distinct cell types in adult Parhyale legs (Almazán et al., 2022), including epidermis, muscle, neurons, hemocytes, and a number of still unidentified cell types.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 6.

The HCR in situ protocol probably has another important advantage over the conventional in situ protocol, which is not mentioned in this study. The hybridisation step in HCR is performed at a lower temperature (37°C) than in conventional in situ hybridisation (65°C, Rehm et al., 2009). In other organisms, a high hybridisation temperature affects the overall tissue morphology and cell location (tissue shrinkage). A lower hybridisation temperature has less impact on the tissue and makes manual cell alignment between the live imaging movie and the fixed HCR in situ stained specimen easier and more reliable. If this is also the case in Parhyale, the authors must mention it.</p></disp-quote><p>This may be correct, but all our specimens were treated at 37°C, so we cannot assess whether hybridisation temperature affects morphological preservation in our specimens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 9. The authors should include more information on the spineless study. What been is spineless? What do the cell lineages tell about the spineless progenitors, apart from them being spread in the tissue at the time of amputation? Do spineless progenitors proliferate during regeneration? Do any spineless expressing cells share a common progenitor cell?</p></disp-quote><p>We now point out that spineless encodes a transcription factor. We provide a summary of the lineages generating spineless-expressing cells in Suppl.

Given that most of the technical advances necessary to achieve the work described in this manuscript have been published previously, it would be helpful for the authors to more clearly identify the primary novelty of this manuscript. The abstract and introduction to the manuscript focus heavily on the technical details of imaging and analysis optimization and some additional summary of the implications of these advances should be included here to aid the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>This paper describes a technical advance. While previous work (Alwes et al. 2016) established some key elements of our live imaging approach, we were not at that time able to record the entire time course of leg regeneration (the longest recordings were 3.5 days long). Here we present a method for imaging the entire course of leg regeneration (up to 10 days of imaging), optimised to reduce photodamage and to improve cell tracking. We also develop a method of in situ staining in cuticularised adult legs (an important technical breakthrough in this experimental system), which we combine with live imaging to determine the fate of tracked cells. We have revised the abstract and introduction of the paper to point out these novelties, in relation to our previous publications.</p><p>In the abstract we explain: &quot;Building on previous work that allowed us to image different parts of the process of leg regeneration in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis, we present here a method for live imaging that captures the entire process of leg regeneration, spanning up to 10 days, at cellular resolution. Our method includes (1) mounting and long-term live imaging of regenerating legs under conditions that yield high spatial and temporal resolution but minimise photodamage, (2) fixing and in situ staining of the regenerated legs that were imaged, to identify cell fates, and (3) computer-assisted cell tracking to determine the cell lineages and progenitors of identified cells. The method is optimised to limit light exposure while maximising tracking efficiency.&quot;</p><p>The introduction includes the following text: &quot;Our first systematic study using this approach presented continuous live imaging over periods of 2-3 days, capturing key events of leg regeneration such as wound closure, cell proliferation and morphogenesis of regenerating legs with single-cell resolution (Alwes et al., 2016). Here, we extend this work by developing a method for imaging the entire course of leg regeneration, optimised to reduce photodamage and to improve cell tracking. We also develop a method of in situ staining of gene expression in cuticularised adult legs, which we combine with live imaging to determine the fate of tracked cells.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>MC 2. The description of the regeneration time course is nicely detailed but also very qualitative. A major advantage of continuous recording and automated cell tracking in the manner presented in this manuscript would be to enable deeper quantitative characterization of cellular and tissue dynamics during regeneration. Rather than providing movies and manually annotated timelines, some characterization of the dynamics of the regeneration process (the heterogeneity in this is very very interesting, but not analyzed at all) and correlating them against cellular behaviors would dramatically increase the impact of the work and leverage the advances presented here. For example, do migration rates differ between replicates? Division rates? Division synchrony? Migration orientation? This seems to be an incredibly rich dataset that would be fascinating to explore in greater detail, which seems to me to be the primary advance presented in this manuscript. I can appreciate that the authors may want to segregate some biological findings from the method, but I believe some nominal effort highlighting the quantitative nature of what this method enables would strengthen the impact of the paper and be useful for the reader. Selecting a small number of simple metrics (eg. Division frequency, average cell migration speed) and plotting them alongside the qualitative phases of the regeneration timeline that have already been generated would be a fairly modest investment of effort using tools that already exist in the Mastodon interface, I would roughly estimate on the order of an hour or two per dataset. I believe that this effort would be well worth it and better highlight a major strength of the approach.</p></disp-quote><p>The primary goal of this work was to establish a robust method for continuous long-term live imaging of regeneration, but we do appreciate that a more quantitative analysis would add value to the data we are presenting. We tried to address this request in three steps:</p><p>First, we examined whether clear temporal patterns in cell division, cell movements or other cellular features can be observed in an accurately tracked dataset (li13-t4, tracked in Sugawara et al. 2022). To test this we used the feature extraction functions now available on the Mastodon platform (see link). We could discern a meaningful temporal pattern for cell divisions (see below); the other features showed no interpretable pattern of variation.</p><p>Second, we asked whether we could use automated cell tracking to analyse the patterns of cell division in all our datasets. Using an Elephant deep learning model trained on the tracks of the li13-t4 dataset, we performed automated cell tracking in the same dataset, and compared the pattern of cell divisions from the automated cell track predictions with those coming from manually validated cell tracks. We observed that the automated tracks gave very imprecise results, with a high background of false positives obscuring the real temporal pattern (see images below, with validated data on the left, automated tracking on the right). These results show that the automated cell tracking is not accurate enough to provide a meaningful picture on the pattern of cell divisions.</p><p>Third, we tried to improve the accuracy of detection of dividing cells by additional training of Elephant models on each dataset (to lower the rate of false positives), followed by manual proofreading. Given how labour intensive this is, we could only apply this approach to 4 additional datasets. The results of this analysis are presented in Figure 4.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-107534-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>MC 3. The authors describe the challenges faced by their described approach:</p><p>Using this mode of semi-automated and manual cell tracking, we find that most cells in the upper slices of our image stacks (top 30 microns) can be tracked with a high degree of confidence. A smaller proportion of cell lineages are trackable in the deeper layers.</p><p>Given that the authors quantify this in Table 1, it would aid the reader to provide metrics in the manuscript text at this point. Furthermore, the metrics provided in Table 1 appear to be for overall performance, but the text describes that performance appears to be heavily depth dependent. Segregating the performance metrics further, for example providing DET, TRA, precision and recall for superficial layers only and for the overall dataset, would help support these arguments and better highlight performance a potential adopter of the method might expect.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we have added data on the tracking performance of Elephant in relation to imaging depth in Suppl. Figure 3. These data confirm our original statement (which was based on manual tracking) that nuclei are more challenging to track in deeper layers.</p><p>We point to these new results in two parts of the paper, as follows: &quot;A smaller proportion of cells are trackable in the deeper layers (see Suppl. Figure 3)&quot;, and &quot;Our results, summarised in Table 1A, show that the detection of nuclei can be enhanced by doubling the <italic>z</italic> resolution at the expense of <italic>xy</italic> resolution and image quality. This improvement is particularly evident in the deeper layers of the imaging stacks, which are usually the most challenging to track (Suppl. Figure 3).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>MC 4. Performance characterization in Table 1 appears to derive from a single dataset that is then subsampled and processed in different ways to assess the impact of these changes on cell tracking and detection performance. While this is a suitable strategy for this type of optimization it leaves open the question of performance consistency across datasets. I fully recognize that this type of quantification can be onerous and time consuming, but some attempt to assess performance variability across datasets would be valuable. Manual curation over a short time window over a random sampling of the acquired data would be sufficient to assess this.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that similar trade-offs will apply to all our datasets because tracking performance is constrained by the same features, which are intrinsic to our system; e.g. by the crowding of nuclei in relation to axial resolution, or the speed of mitosis in relation to the temporal resolution of imaging. We therefore do not see a clear rationale for repeating this analysis. On a practical level, our existing image datasets could not be subsampled to generate the various conditions tested in Table 1, so proving this point experimentally would require generating new recordings, and tracking these to generate ground truth data. This would require months of additional work.</p><p>A second, related question is whether Elephant would perform equally well in detecting and tracking nuclei across different datasets. This point has been addressed in the Sugawara et al. 2022 paper, where the performance of Elephant was tested on diverse fluorescence datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>Major comments:</p><p>• The authors should clearly specify what are the key technical improvements compared to their previous studies (Alwes et al. 2016, Elife; Konstantinides &amp; Averof 2014, Science).
