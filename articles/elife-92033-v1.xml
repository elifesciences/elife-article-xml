frequency range, correlate with memory-guided decision-making. However, the degree to which this form of long-range synchronization influences memory-guided choice remains unclear. We developed a brain-machine interface that initiated task trials based on the magnitude of prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchronization, then measured choice outcomes. Trials initiated based on strong prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchrony were more likely to be correct compared to control trials on both working memory-dependent and -independent tasks. Prefrontal-thalamic neural interactions increased with prefrontal-hippocampal synchrony and optogenetic activation of the ventral midline thalamus primarily entrained prefrontal theta rhythms, but dynamically modulated synchrony. Together, our results show that prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchronization leads to a higher probability of a correct choice and strengthens prefrontal-thalamic dialogue. Our findings reveal new insights into the neural circuit dynamics underlying memory-guided choices and highlight a promising technique to potentiate cognitive processes or behavior via brain-machine interfacing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>prefrontal</kwd><kwd>synchrony</kwd><kwd>theta</kwd><kwd>thalamus</kwd><kwd>brain-machine interfacing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 MH117687</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Griffin</surname><given-names>Amy L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Brain-machine interfacing was used to align trials with heightened prefrontal-hippocampal oscillatory synchronization on spatial working memory-dependent and -independent tasks, and these trials were associated with correct choices.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Working memory, the ability to temporarily maintain and mentally manipulate information, is fundamental to cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baddeley, 1986</xref>).

Long-range interactions are thought to be supported by the proper timing of action potentials (spikes), and brain rhythms are thought to act as a clocking mechanism to synchronize the timing of spike discharges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fries, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buzsáki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colgin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fries, 2015</xref>). Fluctuations in the local field potential (LFP) are coupled to the organization of hippocampal spiking activity in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref>), primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jutras et al., 2009</xref>), and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qasim et al., 2021</xref>), although the exact frequency can vary over mammalia. The hypothesis that brain rhythms coordinate brain communication by synchronizing neuronal activity, known as ‘communication through coherence’, is just beginning to be experimentally tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fries, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buzsáki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fries, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reinhart and Nguyen, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In rats, decades of research have shown that computations within, and communication between, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus are required for spatial working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dudchenko et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee and Kesner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang and Cai, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horst and Laubach, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Churchwell and Kesner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hallock et al., 2013a</xref>). Recording studies specifically implicate theta synchrony within the mPFC-hippocampal network as a mechanism for mPFC-hippocampal communication. One metric of oscillatory synchrony, coherence, has been repeatedly correlated with memory-guided choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones and Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sigurdsson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O’Neill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>), but also with attention and task engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guise and Shapiro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bygrave et al., 2019</xref>). In a cornerstone experiment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones and Wilson, 2005</xref>, showed that 4–12 Hz mPFC-hippocampal coherence was stronger before rats made a correct choice when compared to a choice error or a forced navigation trial on a spatial memory task. Importantly, these results are derived from measurements of magnitude squared coherence, a measurement of signal correlation, with no requirement for exact numerical phase consistency. For example, two structures can exhibit strong magnitude squared coherence, despite two signals being approximately 180 degree offset in phase. This is an important distinction because there currently exist two versions of the communication through coherence hypothesis; first, that inter-areal communication varies with signal phase, irrespective of coherence, and second that inter-areal communication varies with coherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vinck et al., 2023</xref>). Likewise, the finding that mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence was stronger on correct choice outcomes is potentially conflated with the fact that rodent movement behaviors also change with task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Redish, 2016</xref>). Due to constraints on experimental design, it remains unclear as to whether strong theta coherence increased the likelihood of a correct choice, or whether a correct choice led to stronger theta coherence. Addressing this question is of critical importance for the potential use of oscillatory dynamics in therapeutic settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reinhart and Nguyen, 2019</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that if magnitude squared coherence represents a valid mechanism for prefrontal-hippocampal communication, that we could use times of strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence to gate access to the choice, and that these trials would be associated with better performance on memory-guided tasks. To circumvent a purely correlational experimental design, we developed programmatic algorithms to define and detect strong and weak oscillatory synchronization, then tied theta (6–11 Hz) coherence magnitude with task manipulation. This brain-machine interface monitored details about task trials, like delay duration and choice outcome, while dynamically adjusting future trials to serve as within-subject controls. Trials initiated during times of strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence were associated with correct choice outcomes on both spatial working memory-dependent and -independent tasks. In follow-up experiments, we found that mPFC theta rhythms and mPFC-thalamic interactions increased with mPFC-hippocampal theta synchrony. Consistent with these results, optogenetic activation of the ventral midline thalamus (VMT), a structure known to coordinate mPFC-hippocampal interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vertes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKenna and Vertes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gabbott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vertes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoover and Vertes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dolleman-van der Weel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Griffin, 2021</xref>), dynamically modulated mPFC and hippocampal theta oscillation power and coherence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of a closed-loop brain-machine interface for coherence-dependent task manipulation</title><p>Our first objective was to design and implement a brain-machine interface that would time the initiation of task trials to periods of strong or weak prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchronization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). To do this, we first trained rats to perform a delayed spatial alternation task in a T-maze until reaching 70% choice accuracy on 2 consecutive days. On this spatial working memory task, rats are rewarded for alternating between left and right reward zones and sequestered at the base of the maze before each choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The ability of this task to tax working memory was validated by measuring the impact of delay duration on choice outcome.

The solenoid valves and air compressor were placed in a large wooden box, with foam insulation walls, in order to reduce noise. The MazeEngineers hardware was also programmed to control the release of chocolate pellets for reward delivery. Using Arduino-powered infrared beam breaks (yellow lines denote connections), MATLAB could detect the exact location of the rat in order to carry out the programmed sequence of the task.

If on a high coherence trial, theta coherence exceeded delta coherence, and theta coherence was higher than the predetermined threshold, a door was opened, releasing the rat from being sequestered in the delay zone that separated trials.

Trial initiation is defined by the lowering of the choice point door to allow access to the maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>High medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-hippocampal theta coherence can be used to enhance performance of a working memory-dependent task.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Left panel:</italic> Histology from a representative rat showing electrode tracks in the dorsal hippocampus (<italic>top</italic>) and mPFC (<italic>bottom).

This closed loop system allowed us to monitor prefrontal-hippocampal theta coherence in real time and on a subset of trials, initiate the start of the trial when coherence was strong or weak. While coherence was being monitored, rats were confined to an area at the base of the maze. Trials were initiated by opening a door, providing access to the maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Strong prefrontal-hippocampal theta coherence leads to correct choices on a spatial working memory task</title><p>Based on multiple reports, mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence is positively correlated with memory-guided decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones and Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>), but whether theta coherence can be harnessed to bias choice accuracy remains unexplored. To test this idea, we implemented the algorithms described above with an automatic maze to control trial onset via lowering the door for access to the choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). During experimentation, our brain-machine interface was activated as rats occupied the delay zone and rats were presented with various trial types within a given session as follows. A small proportion of trials were initiated when mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence was above the strong theta coherence threshold (~10% of trials) or below the weak theta coherence threshold (~10% of trials) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Since increasing delay durations led to worse task performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), rats also experienced trials that were yoked to high and low coherence trials via identical delay durations. For example, if trial <italic>N</italic> was a high coherence trial, our algorithm logged the duration spent in the delay zone to be presented back to the rat within a 10-trial block. Thus, initiation of yoked trials was independent of the strength of theta coherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and by comparing choice accuracy on strong/weak coherence trials to that on yoked trials, we were able to rule out the possible confounding variable of working memory load on choice accuracy.</p><p>We predicted that, relative to yoked control trials, trials presented during states of strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence would be more likely to be correct and trials presented during states of weak mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence would be more likely to be incorrect. Consistent with our first prediction, presenting trials during elevated states of mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence improved choice accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, choice accuracy on trials presented during states of low mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence did not differ from choice accuracy on yoked control trials, indicating that naturally occurring weak theta synchronization does not impair choice outcomes.</p><p>Most task trials (~80%) were initiated after a random delay, irrespective of the magnitude of mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence. We next analyzed whether random delay trials that were coincident with strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence also led to correct choice outcomes. First, compared to brain-machine interfacing trials, random delay trials coincident with strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence were found to be significantly longer in duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; BMI trials: mean = 11.55 s, std = 1.51 s; random trials with strong theta coherence: mean = 15.5 s, std = 2.2 s), an important finding because task performance is impacted by time spent in the delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Unlike brain-machine interfacing trials, which had yoked conditions built into 10-trial blocks to account for changing behavior over time, random delay trials that were triggered during strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence states were not programmed to have a control. As such, we approximated a yoked condition by identifying random delay trials with identical delay durations as random delay trials with high theta coherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). These trials were distributed throughout the session and were unequal in contribution (i.e. there may exist multiple 7 s trials to match a 7 s random trial with coincident strong theta coherence). Although there was no significant difference between random delay trials coincident with strong theta coherence compared to trials with identical delay durations (p=0.059; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), 6/8 animals showed better task performance when mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence was strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Given that this comparison is fundamentally different from the brain-machine interfacing experiment due to imbalanced design between estimated yoked trials and random trials with high coherence, and did not account for trials with potential salient/distracting events in the environment, we consider these results consistent with our brain-machine interfacing findings.</p><p>We then examined various measurements of overt behavior to test if behaviors differed between coherence-triggered trials and yoked trials. First, we examined the amount of time spent until rats made a choice, defined as the amount of time from the point at which a trial is initiated until rats passed the infrared beam that triggers the reward dispenser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). While we found no difference in time to choice between high coherence trials and yoked trials, there was a trending difference between low and yoked trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Using an analysis to test head-movement complexity (IdPhi; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Papale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Redish, 2016</xref>), we found no differences between high coherence trials and yoked trials but did observe less head-movement complexity on low coherence trials relative to yoked trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Next, we analyzed total distance traveled in the epoch used to trigger trials during high and low coherence states (last 1.25 s before trial initiation). Since the amount of time was always consistent (1.25 s), this approach is a proxy for speed, an indirect correlate of theta frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kropff et al., 2021</xref>). We found no differences in movement behavior between coherence trials and yoked trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Finally, we found that rats spent similar amounts of time in the delay zone during high and low coherence trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These analyses show that high coherence trials could be used to promote correct choices in the absence of overt differences in behavior between trial types, indicating that mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence preceding the choice potentially influences choice outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Trials initiated by strong prefrontal-hippocampal theta coherence are characterized by prominent prefrontal theta rhythms and heightened pre-choice prefrontal-hippocampal synchrony</title><p>Next, we performed offline data analysis to understand the neural dynamics occurring during the high coherence states that improved spatial working memory task performance. First, we noticed that theta rhythms were better characterized by changes within the 6–9 Hz range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and as such, offline analyses focused on this narrow band. Relative to low coherence states, mPFC theta rhythms were stronger during high coherence states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> for example LFP traces). Hippocampal theta rhythms only exhibited a modest elevation in theta power relative to low coherence states.

While there was no significant difference in hippocampal theta frequency, 6/8 rats showed higher theta frequency during high mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence states (mean theta frequency during high coherence states = 7 Hz; mean theta frequency during low coherence states = 6.5 Hz). We then analyzed whether these signals exhibited evidence of directionality, the ability for one signal to predict another signal as measured by Granger causality analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen, 2014</xref>). Relative to low coherence states, high coherence states were characterized by stronger hippocampal-to-mPFC theta directionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Using previously collected data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>), we extracted mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence epochs across the duration of a 30 s delay on the delayed alternation (DA) task from three rats (<italic>N</italic>=22 sessions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2A</xref>). We performed an autocorrelation analysis on theta coherence values on a trial-by-trial basis, then compared the results to a temporally shuffled theta coherence distribution. Since we performed a moving window approach (1.25 s in 250 ms steps), comparisons between real and temporally shuffled coherence estimates were only included after five lags (lag #4 relative to 0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). While theta coherence values were predictive of future theta coherence values, this effect slowly decayed over time, indicating that despite some observations of periodicity, the fluctuations were largely non-periodical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>In our brain-machine interfacing experiments, trials were initiated when mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence was strong or weak.

Most importantly, these results show that strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence is optimal for decision-making behavior regardless of whether working memory and mPFC/hippocampal function is necessary to perform a task.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Prefrontal-thalamo-hippocampal network dynamics vary with prefrontal-hippocampal synchronization</title><p>So far, we have shown that initiating trials when mPFC-hippocampal theta synchrony is strong leads to correct memory-guided choices. What are the mechanisms supporting strong mPFC-hippocampal theta synchrony leading to improved choice accuracy? Past research showed that mPFC-hippocampal theta synchrony during choice was supported by the VMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>). The VMT is anatomically connected with the mPFC and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sesack et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vertes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKenna and Vertes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vertes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoover and Vertes, 2012</xref>), providing a source of glutamatergic excitation to both structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dolleman-van der Weel et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we wondered how mPFC-VMT and VMT-hippocampal interactions varied with mPFC-hippocampal theta synchronization.</p><p>To probe this question, we examined datasets with simultaneous mPFC, VMT, and dHPC recordings from three rats performing a spatial working memory task (<italic>N</italic>=22/28 sessions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stout and Griffin, 2020</xref>).

Corroborating the findings from our brain-machine interfacing experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), high theta coherence states were characterized by strong 6–9 Hz theta rhythms in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Intriguingly, the magnitude change of theta power between high and low coherence states was strongest in the mPFC, followed by the VMT, then the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Relative to low coherence epochs, the mPFC was differentially and simultaneously synchronized to the VMT and hippocampus during high coherence states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Moreover, high coherence states were characterized by a stronger change in neural synchronization between the mPFC and VMT, relative to the VMT and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This latter result suggested that mPFC-VMT interactions may be particularly sensitive to mPFC-hippocampal synchronization. In support of this conclusion, multivariate Granger prediction revealed that mPFC-VMT directionality was elevated during strong relative to weak mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>; <italic>middle panel</italic>). mPFC-hippocampal directionality was also modulated by mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence magnitude.

Out of 126 mPFC neurons, 46 neurons met criterion for inclusion (see Methods). When comparing strong to weak mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence states, there were no significant differences to theta phase entrainment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) nor to spike-field coherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>) of mPFC spikes to VMT and hippocampal theta.</p><p>We then wondered if strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence states modulated the spike timing of a select group of mPFC neurons. During strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence states, 8.9% and 7% of mPFC neurons were modulated by hippocampal theta and VMT theta, respectively. This contrasted with weak mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence states, where 4.4% and 2.3% of mPFC neurons were significantly modulated by hippocampal and VMT theta, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). These findings indicate that the magnitude of mPFC-hippocampal theta synchronization was unrelated to global changes to mPFC spike entrainment to VMT and hippocampal theta rhythms.

Stimulation of the VMT at 7, 15, or 30 Hz produced clear changes to the mPFC power spectrum, while 4 Hz stimulation was more variable across shanks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>). VMT theta stimulation did not always increase or change hippocampal theta rhythm power, but it often increased or changed the shape of the power spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–G</xref>). Surprisingly, optogenetic activation of the VMT at 7–8 Hz was largely disruptive to mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–G</xref>), but was nonetheless capable of increasing mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence at unexpected frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Specifically, VMT stimulation was better capable of increasing mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence when timed with real-time monitoring of hippocampal oscillations and with sufficient activation. For example, in rat #2, we detected hippocampal oscillation power between 1 and 50 Hz and timed VMT stimulation when 8 Hz power was the strongest frequency. This approach increased mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence in the 9 Hz band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Yet, 7 Hz stimulation without timing it to hippocampal oscillatory activity had no effect on mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Likewise, in rat #3, 7.5 Hz stimulation was sufficient to enhance mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence at 8.3–8.4 Hz at 4.5 mW, but the same was not true at 1 mW power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).</p><p>While we expected VMT stimulation to strengthen mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence, these results indicate that square wave optogenetic stimulation of the VMT does not pose a viable approach to strengthen mPFC-hippocampal coherence without consideration of ongoing oscillatory dynamics. Instead, VMT stimulation most effectively produces closely matched oscillations in the mPFC, a finding with interesting implications for diseases characterized by a disrupted thalamic complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elvsåshagen et al., 2021</xref>). Future research should perform a systemic characterization of the parameter space and opsins that allow VMT activation with optogenetics to produce mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence. This study is warranted given the growing hypothesis that the VMT regulates mPFC-hippocampal oscillatory dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dolleman-van der Weel et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous research showed that mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence was stronger when memory was used to guide choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones and Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sigurdsson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O’Neill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>), but this conclusion required correlating choice outcome with mPFC-hippocampal theta synchrony. Unlike past work, we manipulated the timing of trial onset relative to the strength of mPFC-hippocampal theta synchrony and as such, the detection of coherence state always preceded choice outcome. Our brain-machine interfacing experiments allowed us to implement various within-subject controls and we showed that trials initiated during states of strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence led to better task performance on two separate paradigms.</p><p>While we expected this form of long-range theta synchronization to be particularly useful when spatial working memory was used to guide decision-making, we also observed that mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence enhanced the performance of a task that did not require the mPFC, VMT, nor hippocampus for successful performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hallock et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hallock et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shaw et al., 2013</xref>). These findings raise an interesting discrepancy – mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence led to improved task performance on the conditional discrimination task, yet pharmacological inactivation of these structures did not impair task performance. Given that the conditional discrimination task is dependent on the dorsal striatum, it is possible that pharmacological techniques, which work on the scale of minutes, provided time for the brain to adapt to a disrupted mPFC-hippocampal network. In support of this view, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goshen et al., 2011</xref>, showed that optogenetic suppression of the CA1 on a time scale similar to pharmacological agents, like muscimol, did not impair the retrieval of a contextual fear memory. However, when optogenetic inactivation was temporally specific to the testing phase of the contextual fear memory paradigm, memory retrieval was disrupted. These findings show that the timescale of inactivation impacts the results and conclusions drawn from research, raising the possibility that the mPFC-hippocampal network can indeed be beneficial to the performance of working memory-independent tasks. Future research should be dedicated to testing the causal link of mPFC-hippocampal theta synchronization to choice outcome by implementing procedures similar to what is described here with optogenetic perturbations.</p><p>To then characterize the neural dynamics co-occurring with strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence events, we tested whether mPFC-thalamic and hippocampal-thalamic interactions changed with strong and weak mPFC-hippocampal theta synchronization events. For these analyses, we focused on the VMT, a structure that is bidirectionally connected with the mPFC and hippocampus and supports mPFC-hippocampal neuronal interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vertes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKenna and Vertes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vertes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoover and Vertes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence reflecting heightened neural coordination across the brain, VMT theta rhythms showed stronger coherence to mPFC and hippocampal theta rhythms when the mPFC and hippocampus were strongly coherent. Likewise, optogenetic activation of the VMT modulated mPFC and hippocampal theta rhythms, while dynamically altering the way in which these structures were coherent at theta. It should be noted that because hippocampal theta rhythms were already prominent, the effect of VMT stimulation could have appeared less dramatic for hippocampal theta relative to mPFC theta. Nonetheless, our physiological and optogenetic work point toward cortico-thalamic dialogue as a central component of mPFC-hippocampal theta synchronization. Importantly, this latter assertion is supported by anatomy, as the mPFC receives no direct projections from the dHPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jay and Witter, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</xref>), but influences hippocampal neuronal activity via the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito et al., 2015</xref>). We suspect that the VMT may coordinate mPFC-hippocampal neural interactions through cortico-thalamo-cortical looping mechanisms, as the VMT projects directly to entorhinal cortex neurons that target the CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wouterlood, 1991</xref>) and modulates CA1 neurons with concurrent cortical activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dolleman-van der Weel et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, mediodorsal thalamus is known to sustain mPFC neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolkan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schmitt et al., 2017</xref>), and the VMT supports mPFC firing and mPFC-hippocampal synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jayachandran et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>If mPFC-hippocampal oscillatory synchronization structured cortico-thalamic and cortico-hippocampal neuronal communication, then we would have expected strong theta synchronization events to correlate with mPFC spike entrainment to hippocampal and VMT theta rhythms. When examining all mPFC neurons, we found no differences to spike-LFP synchronization between strong and weak mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence events. Instead, we found a rather small increase to the percentage of theta modulated units in the mPFC. This observation is consistent with recent experimental, modeling, and theoretical work, implicating coherence as a product of communication, rather than a scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schneider et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vinck et al., 2023</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schneider et al., 2021</xref>, showed that LFP signal coherence between a sending and receiving structure can be explained by a sending structures signal power and strength of projectors and can emerge without changes to spike entrainment in the receiving structure. Given that the ventral hippocampus and VMT are necessary for mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O’Neill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>), we suspect that afferents from these structures contribute significantly to mPFC-hippocampal oscillatory synchronization. When taken together, mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence events may represent short temporal periods of neural communication, rather than scaffolding communication. As such, the existing literature combined with our findings strengthen a claim for using patterns of oscillatory synchronization in a therapeutic setting.</p><p>Consistent with our work, a recent study found that inducing states of theta synchrony between frontal and temporal regions via transcranial alternating-current stimulation rescued age-related memory impairments in human participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reinhart and Nguyen, 2019</xref>). Our findings suggest that tapping into pre-existing neural dynamics holds significant promise for improving memory. We hypothesize that non-invasive stimulation techniques prior to therapy, paired with synchrony-dependent attention or working memory practice via brain-machine interfacing, could pose a viable intervention to improve cognitive deficits. In closing, the use of brain-machine interfacing holds significant promise for clinical and neuroscientific advance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were 20 adult (&gt;postnatal day 90) Long Evans Hooded rats.

Three adult male rats were selected from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>, for their mPFC single units, mPFC LFPs, and hippocampal LFPs (only DA sessions included). For the optogenetic experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), three male rats received optogenetic virus injections and fiber placement targeting the VMT (two with simultaneous mPFC/hippocampus recordings and one with silicon probe recording from the mPFC). Each rat was placed on mild food restriction (three to four pellets for females, four to five pellets for males) to maintain ~85–90% ad libitum body weight. Rats maintained a 12 hr light/dark cycle in a humidity-controlled colony room. Experimentation was performed during the light cycle (8 am to 5 pm) at approximately the same time each day ±~1 hr. All procedures and protocols were approved by the University of Delaware Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol AUP 1177. ARRIVE guidelines were followed for this research.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Automated T-maze</title><p>The automated maze was in the shape of a figure eight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and was purchased from MazeEngineers. The total width of the maze was 136.5 cm and the total length was 74.8 cm. Floor width corresponded to ~12.7 cm, while wall height was ~20.3 cm. The delay zone was a rectangular shape, 12.7 cm wide and 32.7 cm long. Doors were pneumatically controlled via a silent air compressor (SilentAire Super Silent 30-TC), reward delivery (45 mg bio-serv chocolate pellets) was controlled through an automated pellet dispenser, and both were under the control of Arduino powered infrared beams (Adafruit) via custom MATLAB programming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Walls were placed on the exterior of the maze with distinct visual cues on the left and right choice arms. For two rats on DA, interior walls were placed to improve maze running behavior. These walls were kept in place for the conditional discrimination task. In the delay zone, the south facing wall was lowered on the DA task, but was kept in place for the conditional discrimination task. The maze was surrounded by black curtains with visual cues matching the maze and experimentation occurred in a dimly lit room.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Brain-machine interface</title><p>The brain-machine interface relied upon extracting real-time LFPs, performing coherence analysis, and triggering the choice point door to open according to the magnitude of prefrontal-hippocampal theta coherence. Real-time signal extraction was performed using the Neuralynx Netcom v3.1.0 package code (<italic>NlxGetNewCSCData.m</italic>). Since signals were extracted serially, this code was modified in-house (<italic>NlxGetNewCSCData_2signals.m</italic>) and verified by feeding the same recording lead through two separate recorded channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). By iteratively extracting signals into MATLAB from the Neuralynx acquisition system at systematically increasing lags (25–300 ms), we found that waiting 250 ms before extracting new signals provided reliable streaming between the brain and MATLAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). We then tested the impact of dataset sizes on the strength and the shape of the coherence distribution within the 4–12 Hz range, in real time (<italic>mscohere.m, frequency range = 1:0.5:20</italic>). By linearly increasing the amount of data being analyzed, and calculating coherence over 50 separate intervals from an example rat in real time, we noticed that the dataset sizes strongly impacted the shape of the coherence distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>), although the effect on coherence magnitude was less robust (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Since the strongest frequency (4–12 Hz) plateaued at ~8 Hz when analyzing dataset sizes of 1.25 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>), we chose to use 1.25 s dataset sizes with 250 ms steps forward in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>). In practice, sampling windows were typically ~1.28 s with ~280 ms overlap and yielded stable coherence estimates across epochs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>). ‘Theta coherence’ was then defined as 6–11 Hz synchrony according to the frequency × coherence plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This approach led to clear transitions between high and low magnitude theta coherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>) indicating that we were accurately tracking coherence in real time. Since brain-machine interfacing handles data acquired in real time, multiple procedures were taken to lower the incidence of signal artifact being used in brain-machine interfacing trials. First, real-time LFPs were detrended by subtracting a third-degree polynomial (<italic>detrend.m</italic>). Then, using a mean and standard deviation calculated over a 10 min recording session that occurred prior to brain-machine interfacing experimentation, LFPs were z-score transformed in real time. During brain-machine interfacing experimentation, real-time detrended LFPs were excluded if &gt;1% of the LFPs were saturated with voltages exceeding 4 std from the mean. Since movement-related artifacts often coincided with strong delta (1–4 Hz) power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>), we also excluded epochs if delta coherence was stronger than theta coherence. When combined, these approaches isolated coherence distributions with clear theta synchrony (6–11 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and high consistency across rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I and J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavior and experimentation</title><p>Rats were handled for 5 days in the experimentation room with the lights on and placed on mild food restriction prior to habituation to the automated T-maze. Habituation consisted of ‘goal-box’ training and ‘forced-runs’ training. For goal-box training, rats were placed near the reward dispensers for 3 min and were required to eat all pellets within 90 s for 6 trials (3 left dispenser/3 right dispenser). One rat was excluded after not passing goal-box training for 7 consecutive days. For forced-runs, rats traversed the maze to receive a reward at the reward dispenser and were required to eat all rewards for at least 1 day. Rats were often run for multiple forced-runs days. In between traversals, rats waited in the delay pedestal. After maze habituation, rats were trained to perform the continuous alternation (CA) task, where choice alternations were reinforced with chocolate pellets. The CA task was performed 5 days/week for 30 min or 40 trials. Rats were required to perform at 80% accuracy for 2 consecutive days before and after surgery. After surgical recovery, rats were re-handled for 5 days, then placed on the CA task until they again reached criterion. The CA task was implemented to ensure that coherence-contingent choice outcomes (see Brain-machine interface) were not confounded by alternation rule acquisition. Rats were then exposed to the spatial working memory DA task, where in between choice alternations, rats waited in the delay zone for a 5–30 s delay period (randomly distributed). Once rats performed the DA task for 2 consecutive days at 70% accuracy, our brain-machine interface testing occurred. DA task training was implemented to rule out any effect of changing environmental demands on the rats (e.g. the introduction of a delay period), as well as to normalize task performance prior to experimentation. During testing, the experimenter was blinded to trial type and trials were excluded if unexpected events occurred before the choice (e.g. loud noises, fear behavior, twisted recording tether) then saved as a MATLAB variable after the session ended. 20% of trials were experimental (10% high coherence/10% low coherence), while 80% of trials were controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Exclusion criteria was determined prior to data collection. Trial types were presented psuedo-randomly because high and low coherence trials were required to be presented prior to delay matched control trials. Within blocks of 10 trials, 2 were experimental, 2 were delay matched controls, and 6 were random delays. On a given experimental trial, if rats did not breach the coherence threshold, the trial was initiated after 30 s, and the delay matched control trial was replaced with a random delay. After data collection, LFPs were visualized from trials and trials were marked for exclusion if signal artifacts were present.</p><p>For the conditional discrimination experiment, pre-training procedures were similar to what is described above. Rats were randomly assigned to wood-left/mesh-right or wood-right/mesh-left contingencies. Forced-runs training (5 days) included the wood/mesh floor inserts. After recovery from surgery, rats began conditional discrimination training, where a floor insert type dictated the turn direction at the choice (e.g. wood floor insert may require a left turn for a reward). Unlike the DA experiment, brain-machine interfacing began on day 1 of conditional discrimination training to ensure adequate data collection (i.e. it was unclear as to how fast rats could acquire this task on the automatic maze). Data were included for analysis once rats reached a criterion of 70% for 2 consecutive days. The conditional discrimination task was initially designed such that a random sequence of trials was generated where no more than three same-turn directions were rewarded, and so that rats could not receive reward from alternation &gt;60% of the time. Later in data collection, this alternation criterion was lowered to 45% to improve conditional discrimination acquisition. Analysis required that rats performed &gt;70%, alternated &lt;70% of the time, and contributed at least three trials to a session. Unlike the DA dataset, which included high and low coherence trials, the conditional discrimination experiment focused on high coherence trials. The distribution of trial types were as such: 40% high coherence, 40% yoked control (identical delay duration as high coherence trials), and 20% random delay trials. Trial types were distributed in blocks of 10 trials so that corresponding yoked control trials would follow closely to high coherence trials. Per each session, 60% of trials were not controlled by the brain. A trial was initiated if rats did not reach high coherence threshold after 20 s, but rats were required to wait in the delay zone for ~3.5–5 s to segment trials. A computer monitor was placed in the room with the experimenter which provided trial-by-trial instructions (i.e. trial 1: wood-left, trial 2: mesh-right, etc.). This monitor was also used to monitor LFP data in real time, but the experimenter remained blinded to trial type. Trials were marked for exclusion if unexpected events occurred before the choice (see above).</p><p>With respect to data used from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hallock et al., 2016</xref> (<italic>N</italic>=3 rats) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stout and Griffin, 2020</xref> (<italic>N</italic>=3 rats), six rats were trained to perform a DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>) or delayed non-match to position task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stout and Griffin, 2020</xref>) to 80% criterion for 2 consecutive days. With respect to the DA task, sessions were included if performance was &gt;75% because rats switched between performing the DA task and the conditional discrimination task. Unlike the brain-machine interfacing experiment where delays varied between 5 and 30 s, rats from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>, had predictable delay durations of 30 s. With respect to the delayed non-match to position task, sessions were included if performance was &gt;80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stout and Griffin, 2020</xref>). This task differs from delayed alteration in that each trial is comprised of a sample phase, where rats are forced to navigate toward the left or right reward zone, followed by a free choice. Rats were rewarded if their choice was an alternation from the sample phase. Sample phase turn directions were pseudo-randomized to ensure there were no more than three same-turn directions in a row. Data were extracted from delay periods, which separated the sample from choice phase and were 20 s in duration. From choice to sample, there was an intertrial interval of 40 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Surgery</title><p>Isoflurane (1–4%) anesthetic was used prior to shaving the scalp and placing rats in the stereotaxic instrument (Kopf). Puralube was applied to rats’ eyes throughout the surgery. Lidocaine was injected subcutaneously in the scalp, the scalp was sterilized using chlorhexidine solution (0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate), then incised if rats did not exhibit a kick reflex and eye blink reflex. Bleeding was controlled using hydrogen peroxide. Once the skull was level, bregma was identified, and craniotomies were made above the mPFC and dHPC. mPFC craniotomies were made at +3.1 mm anterior and ±1.0 mm lateral to bregma, while dHPC craniotomies were made at –3.7 mm posterior and ±2.2 mm lateral to bregma. Implants were always on the same hemisphere, but hemispheres were decided pseudo-randomly for each rat in a sex matched manner. For the DA brain-machine interfacing experiment, three right hemisphere (two female, one male) and five left hemisphere (two female, three male) implants were successful. Six rats received cannula implants targeting the contralateral VMT and one rat received electrode implants targeting the contralateral striatum for separate experiments that occurred after the data collected in this report. For the conditional discrimination brain-machine interfacing experiment, all three successful implants were in the right hemisphere. One rat received a 64-channel silicon probe implant (Buzsaki 64L, Neuronexus) at 3.7 mm anterior to bregma and 0.7 mm lateral. A small burr hole was made over the cerebellum for reference wire implants at –10 to –12 mm posterior and ±~1.5 mm lateral to bregma. Five to six bone screws (Fine Science Tools) were implanted as support screws, and one to two bone screws were implanted over the cerebellum for grounding. LFP implants were mounted to the skull using Metabond and the remainder of the micro-drive was mounted using dental acrylic (Lang Dental). A shield surrounding the electronic interface board was built using a plastic medicine cup or a copper mesh shielding. Copper mesh shielding was grounded to the same screw grounding the electronic interface board. Rats were given a dose of flunixin (Banamine; 2.5 mg/kg) at least 20 min prior to removal from anesthesia and were placed on ~15 mg children’s ibuprofen for a 7-day recovery.</p><p>For optogenetic infusions (AAV5-hSyn-ChR2-eYFP) and fiber implants, rat #3 and rat #1 received viral injections at 1.8, 2.4, and 3 mm posterior to bregma.

The injection at 1.8 mm posterior to bregma was injected at 2.2 mm lateral to bregma and 6.6 mm ventral to brain surface at a 15 degree angle. Once the microsyringe was placed into the brain, it sat for 10 min, after which, an injection of.1 µL/min was performed for 2.5 min at each location.

After 1–2 weeks, or when brains sunk to the bottom of the vial, brains were sectioned at 30–50 μm. For implant verification, sections were cresyl stained and imaged with a digital microscope (plugable).

High and low mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence thresholds were determined (see above), then high and low coherence epochs were extracted for each session. Two procedures were implemented for the removal of epochs saturated with recording artifacts. First, large voltage fluctuations were detected on a session-by-session basis by concatenating signal epochs, z-score transforming the concatenated signal, then assigning a standard deviation cut-off value for large voltage events for mPFC, VMT, and hippocampal signals separately. These standard deviation cut-offs were referenced back to a voltage value, and epochs were searched for fluctuating voltage estimates exceeding this threshold. If epochs were saturated by &gt;1% of extreme voltage fluctuations, the epoch was removed. Epochs were also removed if the mPFC or VMT voltages exceeded 3500 mV in the positive or negative direction (tended to fluctuate between –2000 and 2000 mV) in order to minimize the confound of movement-related artifacts on spike-phase comparisons. The cleaned high and low mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence events were then concatenated to create LFP strings. To ensure that spikes were not counted twice in entrainment analysis, the concatenated signal was then filtered for uniquely occurring timestamps.</p><p>Spike-phase values were estimated by transforming the filtered signal (4–12 Hz via third-degree Butterworth filtering) via Hilbert transform.

Spike-LFP phase angles were estimated using the analytic signal and calculating the length of the average vector using Euler’s formula, defined as SFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen, 2017</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msqrt><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:msub><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>SFC was calculated over each frequency <italic>f,</italic> where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> reflects the LFP phase angle per neuron spike timestamp <italic>k</italic> through <italic>N</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Behavioral quantification and recording</title><p>Behavior was recorded from the rat using two approaches: (1) using a mounted camera sampled at ~30 pixels/s (Cheetah; Neuralynx) that detects LEDs on the recording headstage and (2) by sending TTL pulses to Cheetah when infrared beams were broken on the maze via MATLAB. Time spent to choice was estimated using TTL pulses from the central door opening and from choice point exit (as defined by the infrared beam controlling the closing of the choice point door behind the rat). Behavioral complexity was calculated using the integrated change in absolute angular velocity (IdPhi; code provided by D Redish; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Papale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Redish, 2016</xref>) using position data obtained from central door opening to choice point exit.

Phi is defined as the arctangent of <italic>dX</italic> and <italic>dY</italic>, and dPhi is calculated by applying the time-adaptive windowing methodology on the unwrapped Phi estimates. IdPhi is then defined as the integral over the |dPhi| scores. Thus, for each trial, there is one IdPhi score that represents the overall head-movement complexity of the rat. Distance traveled in delay was used to assess whether general mobility differed between experimental and control groups. Position data was extracted from the 1.25 s interval before the choice point door opened (e.g. delay exit), and total distance traveled was defined as the summation across instantaneous distance, calculated according to the distance equation:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msqrt><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:msqrt></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> refers to each video tracking data point through point <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, and <italic>x</italic>/<italic>y</italic> refer to Cartesian coordinates obtained through video tracking.

To test if VMT stimulation could enhance theta synchrony, a variety of stimulation parameters were tested. For theta stimulation, 6–8 Hz frequencies were tested under various conditions. Laser power was tested prior to stimulation and red/blue lasers were matched in terms of mW output. Laser powers varied from 1 to 20 mW. Quiescent states were detected by calculating a ratio between theta and delta LFP power in the hippocampus. Theta:delta ratio values &lt;1 was defined as a candidate quiescent state. Coherence thresholds were also used for the stimulation of the VMT. During awake states, stimulation occurred if theta coherence was greater than the high coherence threshold but less than the low coherence threshold. The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> represent single sessions recorded across animals similarly, with 80–100 red and blue laser stimulation events. The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> show various parameter states and their effect on coherence when paired with VMT stimulation across recording sessions. A stimulation event typically lasted 1.5–2 s and then the laser was turned off for 2–6 s. Stimulating the VMT of rat #2 revealed mixed results and sometimes visual observations failed to reveal clear theta in the mPFC, despite clear power increases. Rat #2 received a single anterior-posterior injection of AAV5-hSyn-ChR2-eYFP (see Surgery above).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistics</title><p>Each figure panel was considered an independent analysis, and when significant p-values were observed (e.g. p&lt;0.05), they were corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni’s method (original p-value multiplied by the number of tests performed) or in some cases using the Benjamini-Hochberg method for many comparisons (i.e. &gt;5 comparisons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; code: <italic>fdr_bh.m</italic> by David Groppe).

This study attempts to test this causally by linking trial start times to theta-band coherence between these two structures. The authors find that trials initiated during periods of high coherence led to a dramatic improvement in performance. This applied not only to a spatial working memory task, but also to a cue-guided navigation task, suggesting that coherence in these regions may be a signature of a heightened attentional or preparatory state. The authors supplement this behavioral result with electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic manipulations to test whether ventral midline thalamus is likely to mediate hippocampal-prefrontal coherence.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study demonstrates a striking behavioral effect; by changing the moment at which a trial is initiated, performance on a spatial working memory task improves dramatically, from around 80% correct to over 90% correct. A smaller but nonetheless robust increase in accuracy was also seen in a texture discrimination task. Therefore, prefrontal-hippocampal synchronization in the theta band may not only be important for spatial navigation, but may also be associated with improved performance in a range of tasks. If these results can be replicated using noninvasive EEG, it would open up a powerful avenue for modulating human behavior.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Ventral midline thalamic nuclei, such as reuniens, have reciprocal projections to both prefrontal cortex and hippocampus and are therefore well-situated to mediate theta-band interactions between these structures. However, alternative mechanisms cannot be ruled out by the results of this study. For example, theta rhythms are globally coherent across the rodent hippocampus, and ventral hippocampus projects directly to prefrontal cortex. Theta propagation may depend on this pathway, and may only be passively inherited by VMT.</p><p>The optogenetic manipulations are intended to show that theta in VMT propagates to PFC and also affects HPC-PFC coherence. However, the &quot;theta&quot; induced by driving thalamic neurons at 7 Hz is extremely artificial. To demonstrate that VMT is causally involved in coordinating activity across HPC and PFC, it would have been better to optogenetically inhibit, rather than excite, these nuclei. If the authors were able to show that the natural occurrence of theta in PFC depends on activity in VMT, that would be much more convincing test of their hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92033.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>A number of previous reports have demonstrated that theta synchrony between the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with correct performance on spatial working memory tasks. The main goal of the current study is to examine this relationship by initiating trials either randomly (as has typically been done in previous studies) or during periods of high or low PFC-HPC coherence. To this end, they develop a 'brain-machine interface' (BMI) that provides real-time estimates of PFC-HPC theta coherence, which are then used to control trial onset using an automated figure-eight maze. Their main finding is that choice accuracy is significantly higher on trials initiated when theta coherence is high whereas performance on low coherence trials does not differ from randomly initiated control trials. They also observe a similar result using a non-working memory task in the same maze.</p><p>Overall the main experiments (Figures 1-4) are well designed and the BMI approach is convincingly validated. There are also appropriate controls and analyses to rule out behavioral confounds and the results are clearly presented. Although the BMI can not establish a causal relationship between PFC-HPC coherence and behavior, it is helpful for examining how extremes in the distribution of brain states are associated with behavioral performance, something that might be more difficult to examine if trials are initiated randomly. As such, the BMI is an interesting approach for studying the neuronal basis of behavior that could be applied in other fields of neuroscience.</p><p>In addition to the behavioral results, the authors also examine what neuronal mechanisms might support enhanced PFC-HPC synchrony (Figures 5-6). Here, they examine the potential contribution of the ventromedial thalamus (VMT) but the results are inconclusive. In particular, the results of optogenetic stimulation of the VMT (Figure 6) show that it both increases and decreases PFC-HPC theta synchrony, depending on the exact frequency range examined. These results are also somewhat preliminary as they come from only 2 animals.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92033.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Stout et al investigate the link between prefrontal-hippocampal (PFC-HPC) theta-band coherence and accurate decisions in spatial decision making tasks. Previous studies show that PFC-HPC theta coherence positively correlates with task learning and correct decisions but the nature of this relation relies on correlations that cannot show whether coherence leads, coincides or is a consequence of decision making. To investigate more precisely this link, the authors devise a novel paradigm. In this paradigm the rat is blocked during a delay period preceding its choice and they control on a trial-by-trial basis the level of PFC-HPC theta coherence prior to the decision by allowing the rat to access the choice point only at a time when coherence reaches above or below a threshold. The design of the paradigm is very well controlled in many ways. First, using the PFC-HPC theta coherence during the delay period to gate when the rat accesses the choice zone clearly separates this coherence from the behavioural decision itself. Moreover, the behaviour of the animal is similar during high and low coherence periods. Finally, control trials are matched trial-by-trial to the time spent waiting by the rat when gated on theta coherence, which is crucial given that working memory performance depends on delay duration. All these features bolster the specificity of the author's main finding which is that PFC-HPC theta coherence prior to choice making is strongly predictive of accuracy in two tasks : one that requires working memory and another in which behaviour is cue-guided. Although this paradigm does not provide direct causal evidence, it convincingly supports the idea that PFC-HPC theta coherence prior to the behavioural decision is related to correct decision making and is not simply temporally coincidental or a consequence of the decision output.</p><p>The authors also investigate the mechanisms behind the increase in PFC-HPC coherence during the task and show that it likely involves the recruitment of a small population of PFC neurons, via interactions with the Ventral Midline Thalamus that could mediate prefrontal/hippocampal dialogue.</p><p>A key point of interest is the unexpected result showing a link between theta coherence even in the cue-driven version of the task. As the authors point out, muscimol inhibition of neither PFC nor HPC, nor the ventral midline thalamus impacts performance in this task. This raises the question of why coherence between two areas is predictive of choice accuracy when neither area appears to be causally involved. The authors discuss various options and explanations for this discrepancy which clearly adds to the current debate. Moreover their novel paradigm provides new tools to interrogate when inter-area synchrony is associated with information transfer and when this information is then used to drive behavioural decisions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92033.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Stout</surname><given-names>John J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Delaware</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Newark</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>George</surname><given-names>Allison E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stony Brook University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Suhyeong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Delaware</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Newark</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hallock</surname><given-names>Henry L</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lafayette College</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Easton</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Griffin</surname><given-names>Amy L</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Delaware</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Newark</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The brain-machine interface used in this study differs from typical BMIs in that it's not intended to give subjects voluntary control over their environment. However, it is possible that rats may become aware of their ability to manipulate trial start times using their neural activity. Is there any evidence that the time required to initiate trials on high-coherence or low-coherence trials decreases with experience?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great question. First, we designed the experiment to avoid this possibility. Rats were experienced on the sequence of the automatic maze both pre and post implantation (totaling to weeks of pre-training and habituation). As such, the majority of the trials ever experienced by the rat were not controlled by their neural activity. During BMI experimentation, only 10% of trials were triggered during high coherence states and 10% for low coherence states, leaving ~80% of trials not controlled by their neural activity. We also implemented a pseudo-randomized trial sequence. When considered together, we specifically designed this experiment to avoid the possibility that rats would actively use their neural activity to control the maze.</p><p>Second, we had a similar question when collecting data for this manuscript and so we conducted a pilot experiment. We took 3 rats from experiment #1 (after its completion) and we required them to perform “forced-runs” over the course of 3-4 days, a task where rats navigate to a reward zone and are rewarded with a chocolate pellet. The trajectory on “forced-runs” is predetermined and rats were always rewarded for navigating along the predetermined route. Every trial was initiated by strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence. We were curious as to whether time-to-trial-onset would decrease if we repeatedly paired trial onset to strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence. 1 out of 3 rats (rat 21-35) showed a significant correlation between time-to-trial onset and trial number, indicating that our threshold for strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence was being met more quickly with experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa4fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). When looking over sessions and rats, there was considerable variability in the magnitude of this correlation and sometimes even the direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa4fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). As such, the degree to which rat 21-35 was aware of controlling the environment by reaching strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence is unclear, but this question requires future experimentation.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence was used to control trial onset for the entirety of forced-navigation sessions.</title><p>Time-to-trial onset is a measurement of how long it took for strong coherence to be met. (A) Time-to-trial onset was averaged across sessions for each rat, then plotted as a function of trial number (within-session experience on the forced-runs task). Rat 21-35 showed a significant negative correlation between time-to-trial onset and trial number, indicating that time-to-coherence reduced with experience. The rest of the rats did not display this effect. (B) Correlation between trial-onset and trial number (y-axis); see (A) across sessions (x-axis). A majority of sessions showed a negative correlation between time-to-trial onset and trial number, like what was seen in (A), but the magnitude and sometimes direction of this effect varied considerably even within an animal.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92033-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there any evidence that rats display better performance on trials with random delays in which HPC-PFC coherence was naturally elevated?</p></disp-quote><p>This question is now addressed in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and discussed in the section titled “strong prefrontal-hippocampal theta coherence leads to correct choices on a spatial working memory task”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The introduction frames this study as a test of the &quot;communication through coherence&quot; hypothesis. In its strongest form, this hypothesis states that oscillatory synchronization is a pre-requisite for inter-areal communication, i.e. if two areas are not synchronized, they cannot transfer information. Recent experimental evidence shows this relationship is more likely inverted-coherence is a consequence of inter-areal interactions, rather than a cause. See Schneider et al. (DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2021.09.037) and Vinck et al. (10.1016/j.neuron.2023.03.015) for a more in-depth explanation of this distinction. The authors should expand their treatment of this hypothesis in light of these findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Our introduction and discussions have sections dedicated to these studies now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6 - It would be much more intuitive to use the labels &quot;Rat 1&quot;, &quot;Rat 2&quot;, and &quot;Rat 3&quot;; the &quot;21-4X&quot; identifiers are confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>This was corrected in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6C - The sub-plots within this figure are rather small and difficult to interpret.

While we point towards 3 examples in the manuscript now, we focused this section on the autocorrelation analysis, which did not support our observation as we noticed a rather linear decay in correlation over time. As such, the periodicity observed was almost certainly a consequence of overlapping data in the epochs used to calculate coherence rather than intrinsic periodicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Shortly after the start of the results section (line 112), the authors go into a very detailed description of how they validated their BMI without first describing what the BMI actually does. This made this and the subsequent paragraphs difficult to follow.

However, it is unclear what the heatmap represents: is it a single trial, single session, an average across animals, or something else? In Figure 3F, however, the increase appears to be much more sustained.</p></disp-quote><p>The sample size was rats for every panel in this figure.

This is now clarified at the end of Fig 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Describing the study of Jones and Wilson (2005), the authors write: &quot;While foundational, this study treated the dependent variable (choice accuracy) as independent to test the effect of choice outcome on task performance.&quot; (line 83) It was not clear to me what is meant by &quot;dependent&quot; and &quot;independent&quot; here. Explaining this more clearly might clarify how the authors' study goes beyond this and other previous studies.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. A discussion on independent/dependent variables in the context of rationale for our experiment was removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>As explained in the public review, my comments mainly concern the interpretation of the experimental paradigm and its link with previous findings. I think modifying these in order to target the specific advance allowed by the paradigm would really improve the match between the experimental and analytical data that is very solid and the author's conclusions.</p><p>Concerning the paradigm, I recommend that the authors focus more on their novel ability to clearly dissociate the functional role of theta coherence prior to the choice as opposed to induced by the choice. Currently, they explain by contrasting previous studies based on dependent variables whereas their approach uses an independent variable. I was a bit confused by this, particularly because the task variable is not really independent given that it's based on a brain-driven loop. Since theta coherence remains correlated with many other neurophysiological variables, the results cannot go beyond showing that leading up to the decision it correlates with good choice accuracy, without providing evidence that it is theta coherence itself that enhances this accuracy as they suggest in lines 93-94.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. A discussion on independent/dependent variables in the context of rationale for our experiment was removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding previous results with muscimol inactivation, I recommend that the authors expand their discussion on this point. I think that their correlative data is not sufficient to conclude as they do that despite &quot;these structures being deemed unnecessary&quot; (based on causal muscimol experiments), they &quot;can still contribute rather significantly&quot; since their findings do not show a contribution, merely a correlation. This extra discussion could include possible explanations of the apparent, and thought-provoking discrepancies that they uncover such as: theta coherence may be a correlate of good accuracy without an underlying causal relation, theta coherence may always correlate with good accuracy but only be causally important in some tasks related to spatial working memory or, since muscimol experiments leave the brain time to adapt to the inactivation, redundancy between brain areas may mask their implication in the physiological context in certain tasks (see Goshen et al 2011).</p></disp-quote><p>The second paragraph of the discussion is now dedicated to this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Possible further analysis :</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>In Extended 4A [now Figure 1—figure supplement 4] the authors show that performance drops with delay duration. It would be very interesting to see this graph with the high coherence / low coherence / yoked trials to see if the theta coherence is most important for longer trials for example.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion. Due to 10% of trials being triggered by high coherence states, our sample size precludes a robust analysis as suggested. Given that we found an enhancement effect on a task with minimal spatial working memory requirements (Fig. 4), it seems that coherence may be a general benefit or consequence of choice processes. Nonetheless, this remains an important question to address in a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Figure 6: The authors explain in the text that although the effect of stimulation of VMT is variable, overall VMT activation increased PFC-HPC coherence.

We have added an extended figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) showing our VMT stimulation recording sessions.
