The medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system is part of a reflex arc that critically controls auditory sensitivity. Multiple central pathways contact MOC neurons, raising the question of how a reflex arc could be engaged by diverse inputs. We examined functional properties of synapses onto brainstem MOC neurons from ascending (ventral cochlear nucleus, VCN) and descending (inferior colliculus, IC) sources in mice using an optogenetic approach. We found that these pathways exhibited opposing forms of short-term plasticity, with the VCN input showing depression and the IC input showing marked facilitation. By using a conductance-clamp approach, we found that combinations of facilitating and depressing inputs enabled firing of MOC neurons over a surprisingly wide dynamic range, suggesting an essential role for descending signaling to a brainstem nucleus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auditory</kwd><kwd>facilitation</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>efferent</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC016226</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Romero</surname><given-names>Gabriel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gilliam Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Romero</surname><given-names>Gabriel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC004450</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trussell</surname><given-names>Laurence O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In a fast brainstem relay controlling hearing sensitivity, descending synaptic control from midbrain provides the dominant source of excitation, due to a distinct form of synaptic plasticity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cochlea is the peripheral organ of hearing. As such, it communicates with the central nervous system by its centrallyprojecting afferent fibers. However, the cochlea also receives inputs from a population of cochlear efferent fibers that originate in the brainstem. The medial olivocochlear (MOC) system provides many of these efferent fibers, and may serve to protect the cochlea from acoustic trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rajan, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kujawa and Liberman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darrow et al., 2007</xref>) and to dynamically enhance the detection of salient sound in diverse sensory environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Winslow and Sachs, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kawase and Liberman, 1993</xref>) by controlling cochlear gain in a frequency- and intensity-specific manner. MOC efferent fibers arise from cholinergic neurons whose somata primarily reside in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB) of the superior olivary complex (SOC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Warr, 1975</xref>) and project to outer hair cells in the cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guinan et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guinan et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wilson et al., 1991</xref>), and this peripheral control by efferents has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guinan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guinan, 2018</xref>). MOC fibers respond to sound and form a negative feedback system, and is thus described as a reflex providing frequency-specific feedback to the cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liberman and Brown, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Winslow and Sachs, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown, 2016</xref>). This feedback is mediated by acetylcholine released from terminals of MOC fibers, thereby inhibiting outer hair cell motility and decreasing cochlear sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wiederhold and Kiang, 1970</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to this detailed understanding of peripheral efferent mechanisms, the electrophysiological properties of the efferent neurons and their control by central pathways remain unclear, and indeed, it is not known even to what extent these neurons function as a reflex arc or as mediators of descending control by higher brain regions. For example, excitatory synaptic inputs that modulate and control MOC neuron function are made both by ascending inputs from the cochlear nucleus (termed here the âreflex pathwayâ) and by descending inputs from areas that include brainstem, inferior colliculus (IC), and auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thompson and Thompson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vetter et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mulders and Robertson, 2002</xref>). The reflex MOC pathway receives ascending auditory inputs from principal neurons in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN), possibly by T-stellate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thompson and Thompson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Venecia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Darrow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2013</xref>). While T-stellate cells are anatomically and physiologically well suited to provide auditory information to MOC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oertel et al., 2011</xref>) and receive inputs from type I spiral ganglion neurons, whose axons form the auditory nerve, in fact no direct evidence shows that these neurons activate MOC neurons. Descending projections from the IC contact MOC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Faye-Lund, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thompson and Thompson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vetter et al., 1993</xref>) and are tonotopically arranged, as low-frequency fibers project laterally and high frequencies increasingly project more medially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caicedo and Herbert, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Suthakar and Ryugo, 2017</xref>). Descending inputs may utilize the MOC system to suppress cochlear inputs during non-auditory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wittekindt et al., 2014</xref>) and are well positioned to aid sound detection in noise by contextually inhibiting background frequency spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farhadi et al., 2021</xref>). However, again, direct evidence for the significance of such descending control is lacking and, in particular, whether such inputs can drive the efferent system or merely modify the control mediated by the reflex pathway.</p><p>We have investigated the physiological properties of MOC neurons, testing the relative efficacy of synaptic inputs made by reflex vs descending pathways. MOC efferent neurons were labeled for targeted patch-clamp recording in brain slices from 30- to 48-day-old ChAT-IRES-Cre mice, and properties of ascending and descending synaptic inputs onto these neurons from VCN and IC were analyzed using virally driven optogenetic excitation. By making recordings from identified neurons in mature mice, we found that MOC neurons are exceptionally homogeneous in their electrophysiological properties and are well suited to encoding stimulus intensity and duration with sustained firing at constant rates. Synaptic inputs to MOC neurons from the VCN and IC are glutamatergic, and both transmit using fast-gating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. Using a novel intersectional adeno-associated virus (AAV) approach that enabled optical excitation of only T-stellate cells in the VCN, we were able to provide direct evidence that T-stellate cells are an excitatory interneuron involved in MOC reflex circuitry. However, comparing the short-term synaptic plasticity of VCN and IC inputs, we discovered that at the same stimulus rates, VCN inputs exhibited rapid short-term depression, while IC inputs exhibited augmentation, increasing severalÂ fold in synaptic strength. Conductance-clamp experiments, in which these inputs were simulated with realistic patterns of activity, showed that descending control of hair cell activity may be a potent means for engaging the full dynamic range of activity of MOC neurons, thus permitting broad control of cochlear sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cholinergic auditory efferent neurons are tdTomato-positive in ChAT-Cre/tdTomato mice</title><p>The SOC features two groups of cholinergic olivocochlear efferent neurons, lateral olivocochlear (LOC) neurons and MOC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Warr and Guinan, 1979</xref>).

To investigate how intrinsic membrane properties of MOC neurons underlie in vivo responses, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from tdTomato-positive MOC neurons in the VNTB from acute brain slices of ChAT-Cre/tdTomato mice. We found that the majority of MOC neurons had a resting membrane potential of â80.4 Â± 0.8 mV (<italic>N</italic> = 56) and were silent at rest (only 3/59 neurons were spontaneously active), consistent with the low frequency of spontaneous activity observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fex, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cody and Johnstone, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Robertson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Robertson and Gummer, 1985</xref>). The membrane capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>) and resistance (R<sub>m</sub>) were 36.5 Â± 1.6 pF and 123 Â± 9 Mâ¦ (<italic>N</italic> = 59), respectively. In response to hyperpolarizing current injections, MOC neurons lacked an apparent voltage âsagâ, indicating minimal expression of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Depolarizing currents near action potential threshold revealed a biphasic after-hyperpolarization waveform following each spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, see arrowhead in +0.5 nA example, observed in 57/59 MOC neurons). In response to theÂ increasing amplitude of 500-ms depolarizing current injections, MOC neurons fired action potentials that encoded stimulus current intensity with a remarkably linear increase in spike rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâD</xref>). For injections up to 900 pA, MOC neurons (<italic>N</italic> = 33) responded with linearly increasing spike rates, such that the rate nearly doubled when current injections were doubled in intensity, as reflected by the slope of a linear fit to the mean data (slope = 0.150 Hz/pA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Many MOC neurons continued to respond linearly to current injections up to 2â4 nA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A &amp; D</xref>) before entering depolarization block. Throughout the duration of these 500-ms depolarizing current injections, action potentials fired with a generally consistent instantaneous rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B &amp; E</xref>). The ratio of instantaneous spikeÂ rate during the last five action potentials (i.e., the steady-state frequency) compared to spikes #5â10 (initial frequency) decreased somewhat with increasing current intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E &amp; F</xref>); 0.86 Â± 0.01 at 200 pA and 0.69 Â± 0.02 at 900 pA (<italic>N</italic> = 11).

These results using current steps suggest that MOC neurons are well suited to delivering steady efferent signals to the cochlea in exact proportion to the intensity of their ongoing synaptic inputs.

Given these results, we asked how synaptic inputs from IC and VCN, with their distinct forms of short-term plasticity, utilize the wide firing range of MOC neurons. Our opsin-dependent approach did not allow us to investigate how MOC neurons respond to this presynaptic variation, as one cannot independently control individual fibers in a large population, nor can ChR2 be reliably activated at high, physiological firing rates characteristic of auditory neurons. Thus, we examined how MOC neurons would respond to diverse inputs by injecting synaptic conductance waveforms modeled after physiological data (see 'MaterialsÂ andÂ methods' and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

In mice, the total number of inputs to a single MOC neuron from any region is currently unknown. However, comparing average minimally stimulated light responses to maximal light responses from our in vitro data, we estimated that each MOC neuron in the brain slice receives an average of 4.2 Â± 1.0 unilateral inputs from the IC (maximum of 13.8, <italic>N</italic> = 15) and 11.1 Â± 2.4 unilateral inputs from the VCN (maximum of 35.5, <italic>N</italic> = 15). As these numbers were likely an underestimation due to our experimental preparation (e.g., dependence on virally induced ChR2 expression and damage of inputs during acute brain sectioning), our EPSG waveforms were varied to simulate a broad range of inputs (10, 20, 40, or 80). Additionally, each inputâs form of presynaptic short-term plasticity could be set to facilitating or depressing, based on our measured parameters. All of our modeled inputs simulated activity of neurons that tonically fire, as we hypothesize that this type of input is most likely to drive sustained responses in MOC neurons. For example, the majority of T-stellate cells in the VCN fire tonically at a constant rate in response to tones (termed âsustained choppersâ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oertel et al., 2011</xref>).

With only 10 facilitating inputs at ~40 Hz, two out of six MOC neurons failed to reach action potential threshold (e.g., first row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). MOC neurons responded to increasing numbers of facilitating inputs, with a linearly increasing number of spikes during each stimulus for both ~40 Hz and ~180 Hz paradigms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Facilitating EPSGs at ~180 Hz generally elicited more action potentials with an earlier onset than ~40 Hz EPSGs with the same number of inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Bii,E, and F</xref>). Additionally, the slope (increase in number of spikes for a given increase in number of inputs) of linear fits to the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> also significantly increased with presynaptic firing rate; this slope will be referred to as firing sensitivity (FS).

In a small number of experiments (<italic>N</italic> = 3), an EPSG waveform would drive an MOC neuron into depolarization block toward the end of each trial, likely due to voltage-gated sodium channel inactivation (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8D</xref>, 80 facilitating inputs at ~180 Hz). When this occurred, we measured the average instantaneous frequency (spikes per second) of all action potentials before the onset of depolarization block whose amplitude surpassed a â20 mV threshold and divided this number by half to extrapolate the number of spikes per 500 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Facilitating inputs to MOC neurons can override or be enhanced by depressing inputs, depending on their number and rate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Raster plot of presynaptic excitatory postsynaptic conductance (EPSG) onset timing for the ~110 Hz paradigm, which had an average rate of 111 Â± 1 Hz for all 80 trials.

Some MOC neurons failed to reach action potential threshold in response to depressing waveforms at ~40 Hz (6/6 failures with 10 inputs and 3/6 with 20 inputs) and ~180 Hz (3/6 failures with 10 inputs) (e.g., last two rows of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). When action potentials were elicited and the number of simulated inputs were equivalent, depressing waveforms at ~180 Hz always drove MOC neurons to threshold earlier than those at ~40 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). At ~40 Hz, with 20â40 simulated inputs, depressing waveforms often elicited an onset response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Ci</xref>) that occurred earlier than facilitating waveforms at the same rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and F</xref>). When the presynaptic firing rate was increased to ~180 Hz, facilitating waveforms with 10â20 simulated inputs generally elicited an onset response sooner than with depressing inputs. As our previously described experiments demonstrated that inputs from IC facilitated and those from VCN depressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), our simulated inputs suggest that, individually, VCN inputs best drive slow rates of sustained activity in MOC neurons and IC inputs best drive highÂ rates of activity. Combinations of these inputs are needed to access the full dynamic range of MOC neuron firing, as our simulated VCN-like (depressing) EPSGs could only drive the firing rate (47.8 Â± 5.9 Hz average maximum, <italic>N</italic> = 6) to about half of the maximum rates measured in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liberman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown, 1989</xref>), while IC-like (facilitating) EPSGs could drive MOC neurons to fire at maximal rates (180 Â± 12 Hz average maximum, <italic>N</italic> = 6) more comparable to our in vitro experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Descending input to MOC neurons can enhance or override ascending reflex input</title><p>The output of MOC neurons in vivo depends on the integration of multiple input subtypes, where weaker ascending inputs may be optimized or overridden by more powerful descending inputs. To investigate how MOC neurons would respond to this type of integration, we injected EPSG waveforms simulating combinations of ascending (depressing) and descending (facilitating) inputs. In order to avoid artificially introducing synchrony between the modeled VCN and IC inputs, we introduced a third average presynaptic firing rate, ~110 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1Bii</xref> and Cii). Using the ~180 Hz paradigm, 20 depressing inputs elicited a low number of action potentials in MOC neurons without any failures (5.5 Â± 1.4 spikes on average, <italic>N</italic> = 6) (dashed gray line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), with the first action potential occurring at 36.5 Â± 6.6 ms after the stimuli onset (dashed gray line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). To experimentally test how IC-like inputs altered this VCN-like response, we concurrently introduced 10â80 facilitating inputs at ~40 Hz or ~110 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). As expected, the number of action potentials evoked by facilitating or depressing input was increased when the both types were combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9BâD</xref>). However, the magnitude of this effect was dependent on the strength of the facilitating input, as spikes evoked by weaker facilitating inputs (1.6 Â± 0.8 spikes on average for 10 inputs at ~40 Hz and 8.6 Â± 2.6 spikes at ~110 Hz) were significantly enhanced when combined with the depressing paradigm (9.2 Â± 2.3 spikes at ~40 Hz, 16.1 Â± 3.1 spikes at ~110 Hz) (p =Â 0.022 at ~40 Hz and p =Â 0.0034 at ~110 Hz; paired samples Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test), whereas stronger facilitating inputs were not enhanced (for example, 67.3 Â± 8.0 spikes on average for 80 inputs at ~110 Hz vs 68.7 Â± 0.4 when combined) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Thus, our modeled facilitating IC inputs effectively drive MOC firing, and theÂ input from depressing VCN synapses only enhanced firing when the IC input was relatively weak.</p><p>Combining facilitating and depressing inputs is expected to impact the timing of postsynaptic action potentials, and so we also examined the onset time of firing. At ~40 Hz, the onset of the first action potential evoked by facilitating inputs occurred earlier when combined with the depressing paradigm, but the strength of this effect decreased with increasing number of facilitating inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). The same was true for ~110 Hz facilitating inputs when simulating only 10 or 20 inputs. However, there was little difference as the number of inputs increased. The FS of facilitating inputs (0.32 Â± 0.06 at ~40 Hz and 0.82 Â± 0.18 at ~110 Hz) was not significantly altered with the addition of a depressing input (0.30 Â± 0.09 at ~40 Hz and 0.74 Â± 0.12 at ~110 Hz, <italic>N</italic> = 5) (p =Â 0.38 at ~40 Hz and p =Â 0.088 at ~110 Hz; paired samples Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), demonstrating that MOC neurons generally summate concurrent inputs and confirming that they linearly respond to signals in proportion to the intensity of their input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that relatively weak descending inputs to MOC neurons are enhanced when combined with theÂ ascending input, while relatively strong descending inputs override theÂ ascending inputâevoking an equivalent amount of spikes with similar onset, whether or not the ascending input is active. The data, therefore, confirm the potency of the descending control of the MOC system, as compared to the reflex pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we contrasted excitatory inputs onto MOC neurons through two distinct sources, an ascending, reflex pathway and a descending pathway from the midbrain. Few studies have explored the properties of MOC neurons, in part due to the difficulty of identifying the neurons in mature, heavily myelinated tissue. In order to overcome previous limitations and visualize MOC neurons in acute brain sections from older mice, we utilized a ChAT-Cre mouse line, which genetically marks cholinergic neurons in the SOC. This line was recently characterized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Torres Cadenas et al., 2020</xref>, where it was shown to label cholinergic MOC efferent neurons. Using CTB-mediated retrograde tract tracing originating from the inner-ear, we were able to confirm and expand on their results. Agreeing with classic anatomica<bold>l</bold> tract-tracer studies of MOC neurons (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Warr, 1992</xref>), we demonstrated that approximately two-third of ChAT-Cre/tdTomato-positive VNTB neurons project to contralateral cochlea, whereas one-third project to ipsilateral cochlea. Additionally, retrogradely labeled VNTB neurons were always positive for tdTomato, confirming that the ChAT-Cre mouse line expressed Cre recombinase in most, if not all, MOC efferent neurons in the VNTB.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Firing rates of MOC neurons</title><p>Our examination of intrinsic properties of MOC neurons revealed a remarkable capacity to encode the intensity of current steps with a linear increase in postsynaptic firing over a wide range. Further, we showed that this linearity is recapitulated in the responses to synaptic activity, as modeled through conductance clamp. Previous work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujino et al., 1997</xref> reported MOC and LOC neuron intrinsic membrane properties of neonatal rats (P3-9). However, due to the difficulty of visualizing brainstem neurons in older animals with tract tracers, they were not able to record from MOC neurons after the onset of hearing (P12-14). Additional studies on MOC neurons that used whole-cell recording and tract tracing were also limited to younger animals near or prior to onset of hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang and Robertson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mulders and Robertson, 2001</xref>). Consistent with properties described in prehearing rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujino et al., 1997</xref>), we reported that a majority of matured MOC neurons did not spontaneously fire and that their spike frequency linearly increased with theÂ intensity of injected current pulses. This conclusion is supported by in vivo recordings at the level of the auditory nerve, where MOC efferents exhibit little-to-no spontaneous firing and respond linearly to increasing sound intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cody and Johnstone, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Robertson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Robertson and Gummer, 1985</xref>). A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Torres Cadenas et al., 2020</xref>) reported that MOC neurons from P12-23 mice exhibited spontaneous firing, which may be due to developmental changes specific to mice (we recorded from P30-48) or due to differences in acute brain slice preparation. Developmental transcriptomics of auditory efferent neurons could reveal the basis for these changes.</p><p>Intriguingly, in vivo recordings rarely report sound-driven firing rates in MOC efferents above 100 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liberman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown, 1989</xref>), yet we report that many MOC neurons can fire action potentials at rates greater than 250 Hz in response to somatic current injections. The high firing rates achieved in vitro may better reflect MOC neuron capabilities, as in vivo experiments are often performed with anesthetics that produce extensive systemic changes in neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Robertson and Gummer, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guitton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aedo et al., 2015</xref>). An alternative interpretation is that the wide firing range intrinsic to MOC neurons ensures that over the narrower range used in vivo, the linearity of input-output relations remains preserved. MOC neurons are known to receive modulatory inputs from adrenergic, serotonergic, and peptidergic sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thompson and Thompson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Woods and Azeredo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mulders and Robertson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mulders and Robertson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oliver et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">HorvÃ¡th et al., 2003</xref>), and can be excited by a handful of neuromodulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang and Robertson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang and Robertson, 1998</xref>).

It may be that sound-evoked inhibition of MOC neurons could prevent saturation of firing and thereby broaden the input-output relationships we have described. Alternatively, if some of the descending excitation is not acoustically driven but relayed through the IC, then it may be independent of the type of inhibition described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Torres Cadenas et al., 2020</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Excitatory MOC neuron inputs utilize fast-gating CP-AMPARs</title><p>The ability of the MOC system to dampen cochlear sensitivity likely depends on the convergence of excitatory synaptic inputs from ascending and descending brain regions. Tract-tracer and lesion studies have determined that ascending projections originate from the posteroventral cochlear nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thompson and Thompson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Venecia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Darrow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2013</xref>). These ascending projections are involved in the reflex MOC pathway and are likely mediated by T-stellate neurons. However, bushy cells may also play a role, as in cats they send axon collaterals, which terminate in VNTB, the primary location of MOC neuron somata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith et al., 1991</xref>). Descending projections to MOC neurons originate from auditory and non-auditory regions, including brainstem, IC, thalamus, and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thompson and Thompson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vetter et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mulders and Robertson, 2002</xref>).

We demonstrated that MOC neurons receive excitatory inputs from VCN and IC, both of which transmit using fast-gating CP-AMPARs. Together with somatic puff application of glutamate and mEPSC analysis, our investigation revealed that inwardly rectifying, fast-gating CP-AMPARs are a fundamental postsynaptic feature of excitatory synaptic transmission at MOC neurons. However, it is unknown if calcium influx through these receptors can induce some form of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cull-Candy and Farrant, 2021</xref>) or if the receptor kinetics play an important role in postsynaptic transmission.</p><p>The utilization of GluR2-lacking AMPARs, with ultra-fast mEPSC decays (less than 200 Î¼s), is reminiscent of auditory nerve synapses in the VCN, including those onto T-stellate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gardner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gardner et al., 2001</xref>). Higher regions of the auditory pathway typically lack this feature of the synapse, even in the adjacent medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, whose mEPSCs are slower than in MOC neurons and likely contain GluR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koike-Tani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lujan et al., 2019</xref>). We do not know if the mEPSCs originated from synapses made by VCN or IC neurons or both, but the uniformity of mEPSC properties suggests that even descending fibers from IC can trigger activation of such fast-gating receptors. While the presence of fast kinetic receptors is considered to be an adaptation to preserve microsecond precision of sensory timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gardner et al., 1999</xref>), it seems unlikely that such aÂ precise timing is needed in the efferent system. Further studies are needed to examine how receptor channel kinetics impact the integrative functions of the MOC neuron.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>T-stellate neurons are an MOC reflex interneuron</title><p>Neurons identified as T-stellate cells are believed to terminate in VCN, DCN, olivary nuclei, lemniscal nuclei, and IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Warr, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oertel et al., 2011</xref>), but it is not clear if axons of the same neuron can have such diverse projections. Using an intersectional AAV approach, we directly demonstrated that T-stellate neurons drive activity in MOC neurons, consistent with suggestions from previous anatomical and lesion studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thompson and Thompson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Venecia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Darrow et al., 2012</xref>). T-stellate projections and terminals in many known target nuclei were consistently observed in brain sections prepared for microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Nevertheless, eliciting a postsynaptic current was qualitatively difficult when compared to non-specific virally mediated ChR2 expression in the VCN. This was possibly due to sparse ChR2 expression among T-stellate neurons resulting from the requirement of coincident infection by two different viruses in the same neuron; alternatively, ChR2 expression may have been too low to consistently reach action potential threshold using the intersectional AAV scheme. There also may be sub-populations of T-stellate neurons, which project to MOC neurons and do not project to the IC; non-IC-projecting T-stellate neurons would not express ChR2 using this intersectional virus approach. Nevertheless, this approach highlights the enormous range of targets of these neurons, as at least a subset of IC-projecting T-stellate neurons also directly synapsed onto MOC neurons. Genetic manipulation of only T-stellate neurons with this dual-AAV approach will be useful in future studies to help elucidate theÂ functional significance of T-stellate projections in other auditory circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Effect of short-term synaptic plasticity on MOC neuron output</title><p>Neurons throughout the brain receive mixtures of synaptic inputs that vary not only in their origin or information content, but alsoÂ inÂ their short-term plasticity. A prominent example is that of cerebellar Purkinje neurons, whose parallel fiber inputs facilitate while climbing fiber inputs depress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sakurai, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hansel and Linden, 2000</xref>). The physiological functions served by this diversity likely vary with brain region. In MOC neurons, we found that synaptic responses having properties of the ascending or descending inputs alone were not capable of encoding firing over a wide range and with short latency. However, by combining these different types of inputs and varying input number and firing rate, sustained MOC output could vary over twentyfold. We suggest that this central synaptic mechanism could aid in grading the level of efferent dampening of cochlear function according to sound level.</p><p>Inputs from IC strengthened considerably for tens of seconds with repetitive presynaptic stimulation, resulting in a facilitation that resembles the augmentation seen at neuromuscular junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Magleby and Zengel, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), whereas VCN and T-stellate inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) decreased in synaptic strength, resulting in acute short-term depression. Our optogenetic stimulation was limited in frequency, and further studies will need to employ faster opsins in order to explore plasticity at still higher frequencies of stimulation. Both forms of plasticity that we observed recovered over a similar time course, suggesting that conditioning of these synapses could have lasting effects and bias efferent signaling toward top-down control. The depression of VCN inputs to MOC neurons is not likely due to desensitization of ChR2, since trains of light pulses triggered reliable spikes in VCN neurons. Moreover, injections into IC were made with the same virus, and those inputs never exhibited depression. Thus, distinct forms of presynaptic plasticity are likely exhibited by IC and VCN inputs to the same cell type. Depression of VCN inputs is surprising, given that these inputs mediate a reflex pathway and one might therefore expect reliability within such a circuit. Moreover, as with MOC neurons, the majority of T-stellate neurons fire action potentials in a relatively sustained manner in response to sound stimuli. In in vivo recordings at the level of the auditory nerve, MOC neurons respond to sound input with latencies as short as 5 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Robertson and Gummer, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liberman and Brown, 1986</xref>), and T-stellate cells are well suited to provide the rapid onset portion of this response, as demonstrated in our simulation of this input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, our results suggest that for sustained activity of MOC efferents, non-VCN inputs, such as from the IC, may be a necessary component of efferent control of cochlear function. Indeed, a recent auditory system computational model suggested that descending IC inputs to the MOC system are necessary for persistent enhancement of signal in noise and that the MOC system functions across a broad range of intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farhadi et al., 2021</xref>). These features of the model are now affirmed by our observations of potent inputs from IC, dependent on synaptic augmentation, and the intrinsic properties of MOC neurons that support a remarkably wide dynamic range. The diversity of cell types in the IC is a topic of current interest, and it will be important to determine which of these mediates descending control of the brainstem, including the efferent system, and which ascending or descending pathways activate these neurons. Indeed, it may be that the stable, excitatory control of efferent neurons by theÂ descending input raises the possibility that regulation of cochlear sensitivity may be under rapid control associated with attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wittekindt et al., 2014</xref>), preceding sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr"

expressing Cre recombinase under the endogenous choline acetyltransferase promoter (ChAT-IRES-Cre; Jackson Labs 006410) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rossi et al., 2011</xref>) were crossed with a tdTomato reporter line (Ai9(RCL-tdT); Jackson Labs 007909) to generate mice expressing tdTomato in cholinergic neurons (referred to as ChAT-Cre/tdTomato). A small fraction of ChAT-Cre/tdTomato mice exhibit ectopic expression of Cre recombinase, which labels vasculature and astrocytes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/006410">https://www.jax.org/strain/006410</ext-link>). When ectopic expression was observed, the slices were not used for experimental data. Mouse lines were maintained in an animal facility managed by the Department of Comparative Medicine at Oregon Health and Science University. All procedures were approved by the Oregon Health and Science Universityâs Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and met the recommendations of the Society for Neuroscience.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Immunohistochemistry and imaging</title><p>Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and then perfused through the heart with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, 33Â°C, followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS using a peristaltic pump. Brains were surgically extracted and incubated with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS overnight at 4Â°C. Brains were washed in 0.1 M PBS three times, 10 min per wash, and then 50 Âµm sections were made on a vibratome (Leica, VT1000S) and saved as floating sections in 0.1 M PBS. To visualize theÂ cells that were filled with biocytin during whole-cell recording, 300 ÂµM acute brain slices were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS overnight at 4Â°C. Sections used for antibody labeling were permeabilized and blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin, 2% fish gelatin, andÂ 0.2% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PBS for 2 hr at room temperature on a 2-D rocker. Sections were then incubated in primary antibodies for 2 days at 4Â°C on a 2-D rocker. Sections were washed in 0.1 M PBS three times, 10 min per wash, and then incubated in secondary antibodies and streptavidin-conjugated fluorophores for 2 days at 4Â°C on a 2-D rocker. See 'Key Resources' table for a full list of antibodies and reagents used. Sections were washed in 0.1 M PBS three times, 10 min each wash, followed by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS for 30 min. Some brain sections with high fluorophore expression were not enhanced with antibody labeling to reduce background. All sections were mounted on microscope slides and coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech) mounting medium, andÂ then sealed with clear nail polish. All images of histological sections were acquired on a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope system. Images were processed for contrast, brightness, and gamma using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Acute brain slice preparation</title><p>Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. The brain was rapidly extracted while submerged in warm (40Â°C) artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM) 130 NaCl, 2.1 KCl, 1.2 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 3 Na-4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acidÂ (HEPES), 11 glucose, 20 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, andÂ 1.7 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, bubbled with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% O<sub>2</sub>. Parasagittal and coronal sections of theÂ brain containing the superior olive, cochlear nucleus, or inferior colliculus were cut at 300 Âµm with a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica, or 7000smz-2, Campden) in warm aCSF. Throughout sectioning, brain slices were collected and stored in aCSF at 31Â°C. When sectioning was completed, slices were incubated forÂ an additional 30 min at 31Â°C, followed by storage at room temperature, ~23Â°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Acute brain slices were transferred to a recording chamber and submerged in aCSF. Slices were anchored to the chamber using a platinum harp with nylon threads and placed on a fixed-stage microscope (Axioskop 2 FS Plus, Zeiss). The recording chamber was perfused with aCSF at 3 ml/min and maintained at 31â33Â°C with an in-line heater (TC-344A; Warner Instrument Corp). Neurons in each slice were viewed using full-field fluorescence with a white-light LED attached to the epifluorescence port of the microscope that was passed through a tdTomato filterÂ set with a X40 water-immersion objective (Zeiss) and a digital camera (Retiga ELECTRO; QImaging). In slices from ChAT-Cre/tdTomato mice, MOC neurons were identified in the VNTB by their tdTomato fluorescence and morphology. Borosilicate glass capillaries (OD 1.5 mm; World Precision Instruments) were pulled on a P-97 Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (Sutter) to a tip resistance of 1â5 Mâ¦. All whole-cell current-clamp experiments were conducted with an internal pipette solution containing (in mM) 113 K-gluconate, 2.75 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.75 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 9 HEPES, 0.1 ethylene glycol tetraacetic acidÂ (EGTA), 14 tris-phosphocreatine, 0.3 tris-GTP, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH, and osmolality adjusted to 290 mOsm with sucrose. Whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments were conducted using a K-gluconate-based pipette solution or a cesium-based pipette solution containingÂ (in mM) 103 CsCl, 10 tetraethylammonium chlorideÂ (TEA-Cl), 3.5 N-ethyllidocaine chlorideÂ (QX-314-Cl), 2.75 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.74 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 9 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA, 0.1 spermine, 14 tris-phosphocreatine, 0.3 tris-GTP, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, with pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH, and osmolality adjusted to 290 mOsm with sucrose. All IV-relation experiments used a cesium-based pipette solution. Polyamine-free cesium-based pipette solutions omitted spermine. Reported voltages were corrected for their liquid junction potential: â12.4 mV for K-gluconate-based pipette solution and â2.8 mV for cesium-based pipette solution. Loose-patch recordings were conducted with aCSF as the pipette solution. In some experiments, 0.1% biocytin (B1592, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the pipette solution for post-hoc identification of MOC neurons. Whole-cell recordings were amplified (5X gain), low-pass filtered (14 kHz Bessel, Multiclamp 700B; Molecular Devices), and digitized using pClamp software (50â80 kHz, Digidata 1440A; Molecular Devices). Series resistance compensation was set to 60% correction and prediction with a bandwidth of 1.02 kHz. The majority of pipettes used for voltage clamp were wrapped with Parafilm M (Bemis) to reduce pipette capacitance. Cells were voltage-clamped at â62.8 mV unless noted otherwise. The average uncompensated series resistance (R<sub>s</sub>) when patched onto a neuron was 14.5 Â± 0.9 Mâ¦. 1 mM glutamate in aCSF was puffed onto cells from a patchÂ pipette attached to a Picospritzer II (Parker). The puff pressure was adjusted between 5Â andÂ 10 psi for 2â15 ms duration to achieve stableÂ glutamate-evoked currents. The baseline current (50â200 ms) was subtracted from the data in all example current traces unless noted otherwise. ChR2 was activated using 2 ms flashes of light through a green fluorescent proteinÂ (GFP) filter set from a 470 nm LED attached to the epifluorescence port of the microscope. Light stimulation was made through a X40 water immersion objective (Zeiss). At some synapses, ChR2 stimulation can exhibit artificial synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jackman et al., 2014</xref>). To confirm that light-evoked short-term plasticity observed from activation of MOC neuron inputs was not an artifact of ChR2 stimulation at presynaptic boutons (i.e., action potential broadening, increasing the probability of vesicle release), light stimulation was compared over input axons and MOC neuron somata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In sagittal sections, moving the objective lens away from the recorded neuron and toward the IC in 230 Âµm steps delayed the onset of light-evoked EPSCs. No EPSC could be evoked when light stimulation was directly ventral to the recorded neuron where there was an absence of brain tissue, confirming that light stimulation was confined to the location of the objective lens. A plot of change in EPSC delay over camera position was best fit with a linear equation, and the axon conductionÂ velocity was calculated to be 0.571 m/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Similar short-term plasticity was observed with both axonal and somatic stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Miniature EPSC analysis</title><p>Miniature EPSCs were recorded in the presence of 1 ÂµM TTX to block spontaneous spike-driven events, 0.5 ÂµM strychnine and 10 ÂµM SR95531 to block inhibitory receptors, and 10 ÂµM MK-801 to block NMDA receptors. Spontaneous miniature events were detected using a template search function in AxoGraph (1.7.4) from continuously collected data that were stable for more than 3 min. Events were captured and aligned by their onset, and then the average amplitude, time course, and IEI was calculated. Events that appeared artificial or contained multiple EPSCs were rejected by eye.

Mice (P22-24) were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 1.5â2% maintenance) and secured in a small stereotaxic frame (David Kopf). While mice were under isoflurane anesthesia, viral injections were made with a single-axis manipulator (MO-10; Narishige) and pipette vice (Ronal) attached to a triple-axis motorized manipulator (IVM Triple; Scientifica). After application of 10% povidone iodine, the scalp was cut, and the head was leveled using bregma and lambda. The lateral-medial axis was leveled by focusing a X10 objective 2 mm lateral from lambda to be in the same focal plane on the left and right skull. The location of IC was visually detected after removing a 1 mm<sup>2</sup> unilateral section of occipital bone directly caudal to the lambdoid suture and was pressure injected at a depth of 1 mm. After removing a 1 mm caudal by 2 mm lateral unilateral section of occipital bone caudal to the lambdoid suture, the VCN was located by stereotactic coordinates (0.7 mm lateral, 0.95 mm rostral, and 4.0 mm depth) starting from the surface junction point of the IC, cerebellar lobule IV-V, and simple lobule, which is often marked by a Y-shaped branch from the transverse sinus. Post-injection, the incision was closed with nylon sutures. For analgesia, mice were subcutaneously administered 1 mg/kg meloxicam during surgery and once a day for the 3 following days. Experiments were conducted 1â3 weeks post-surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Posterior semi-circular canal injections</title><p>Our protocol was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Suzuki et al., 2017</xref>, who developed a procedure to deliver viral vectors to the cochlea via the posterior semi-circular canal (PSCC), which minimizes auditory system damage. Briefly, mice were anesthetized and secured to a stereotaxic frame in a manner identical to stereotactic injections, and then rotated 90 degrees onto their side. A small post-auricular incision was made and muscle tissue overlying the temporal bone was dissected to reveal the bony wall of the PSCC. A small hole was made in the PSCC using a 26-gauge hypodermic needle (Kendall), and lymphatic fluid was allowed to drain for 5 min. The tip of a small polyethylene tube (PE-10) attached to a pipette vice (Ronal) containing CTB (0.5% in 0.05 M Tris, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.001 M NaEDTA, 0.003 M NaN3, pH 7.5) was placed into the PSCC oriented toward the ampulla, and sealed with fragments of muscle and cyanoacrylate glue (3M Vetbond Tissue Adhesive). 1â2 microliters of CTB was injected into the PSCC, and the polyethylene tube was left in place for an additional 5 min. After removing the polyethylene tube, the hole was plugged with small pieces of muscle and covered with cyanoacrylate glue. The skin was closed with nylon sutures and mice were perfused for histochemistry 1â5 days later.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Experimental design and statistical analysis</title><p>Electrophysiological traces were analyzed with pClamp 10.7 (Molecular Devices) and IGOR Pro 8 (Wavemetrics) using the NeuroMatic 3.0 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rothman and Silver, 2018</xref>). Miniature events were analyzed with Axograph 1.7.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clements and Bekkers, 1997</xref>) and IGOR Pro 8. Averages are represented as mean Â± SEM. Statistical analysis was conducted with IGOR Pro 8, and theÂ significance between group means was examined using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with a post-hoc Tukey test to identify means that significantly differed. Two-tailed Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test was used for comparison between two means. The significance threshold was set at p&lt;0.05 for all statistical tests. Figures were created with IGOR Pro eight and Adobe Illustrator (CS2).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Ruby Larisch, Jennifer

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Conny Kopp-Scheinpflug (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. We see some issues (detailed below) but agree that your primary findings are significant. We suggest the following essential revisions, to modify claims and make clear that some conclusions will need supporting data in the future.</p><p>We are of the opinion that an understanding of the impact of inhibition would provide a more complete picture, but acknowledge that this would require a new study. We also think the application of faster opsins would be informative. In both cases, however, this would require new experiments. We suggest instead that you discuss these caveats.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Please adjust some of the claims of the paper to reflect the limitations in your interpretation. Specifically, to fully support the claims from the dynamic clamp experiments, you should acknowledge that substantial additional work would be needed. Suggestions include addressing inhibition, identifying the IC neurons that are the source for the descending excitatory input, and extending the frequency range in the optogenetic component.</p><p>2) The dynamic clamp extrapolation in the frequency domain should be more clearly acknowledged and discussed. More detail is available in the full reviews below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Romero and Trussell elegantly investigates the inputs to cholinergic neurons in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body, which provides the primary efferent projections to the outer hair cells of the cochlea (the &quot;MOC&quot; system). This efferent control system is thought to play a role in adjusting the cochlear gain, improving the detection of signals in noise, and potentially providing some protection from acoustic trauma. The authors use a combination of genetically modified mice, virus tracing and cell-type-specific insertion of channelrhodposins, and electrophysiology methods to identify and characterize the synaptic inputs to these cells.</p><p>They focus on two sources. The first source is ascending input from cochlear nucleus neurons, T-Stellate cells, which are identifiable at a cellular and molecular-genetic level. The second source is descending input from unidentified neurons of the inferior colliculus. The work convincingly demonstrates several features of these excitatory inputs. Both inputs drive rapidly desensitizing, rectifying, and calcium-permeable AMPA receptors. However, the synapses show opposing release dynamics. The ascending synapses exhibit depression at the two frequencies tested, 20 and 50 Hz, whereas the descending synapses show facilitation at these frequencies. Somewhat surprisingly, the recovery from depression and facilitation for the two inputs follow similar time courses. Some of the potential concerns regarding the limitations of optical activation of ChR2-expressing axons and terminals are addressed. These experiments are thoughtfully performed and presented, and provide the first detailed characterization of these two excitatory synaptic inputs to the MOC neurons. These results suggest that the ascending inputs provide sensory information, whereas the descending inputs offer a slower, modulatory control over the efferent neurons. A limitation is that the exact cellular source of the descending inputs is not known.</p><p>The authors extend the characterization of the two input sources with dynamic clamp experiments that compare how the firing of the MOC neurons is affected when the inputs are simulated both separately and simultaneously, including at a higher firing rate. The experiments attempt to reveal distinct functional roles for the ascending and descending inputs. The authors use in vitro responses to current pulses recorded from T-Stellate neurons for spike timing. The experiments are technically challenging (two-electrodes on one target cell for dynamic clamp) and could provide valuable information. The results suggest that the combination of depressing and facilitating inputs better supports sustained firing and enhances the dynamic range of firing rates with increasing input. The combined inputs also result in a relatively constant, short-latency to the first spike compared to when tested independently. However, there are several limitations to these experiments. The most significant limitation is the choice of input stimulus patterns, which do not accurately reflect the adapting responses of the afferent neurons to acoustic stimuli (and in the case of the IC input, we do not know what the response patterns should be as the source neurons have not been characterized). A second limitation is that the synaptic dynamics are treated as independent of frequency. This assumption conflicts with data shown in the paper, where the depression and facilitation rates are frequency-dependent in a manner typical of many previously studied synapses. Further, some frequencies used in the dynamic clamp experiments (110, 180 Hz), although reasonable based on in vivo data, were outside the range studied optogenetically (20, 50 Hz), so it is not clear that the same synaptic dynamics apply. An additional concern is that the dynamic clamp method only simulates somatic inputs, so dendritic filtering effects are lost (Figure 3 shows that putative terminals from the VCN appear in the neuropil around the cells in the VNTB; the preponderance of somatic versus dendritic targeting is not clear). The dynamic clamp experiments are essentially thought experiments that suggest possible roles for the distinct synaptic dynamics of the ascending and descending inputs and incorporate a number of the non-linear factors inherent in the biology of the system. However, they also have significant limitations.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript generally provides well-documented new and intriguing observations regarding the pathways driving the MOC neurons. Perhaps the most important result is the characterization of the descending input to the MOC neurons and the suggestion that it plays an essential role in how the MOC neurons operate. There are many open questions that are raised by the observations in this paper, including the types, sensory responses, and other inputs of the inferior colliculus neurons that project to the MOC neurons. To their credit, the authors do carefully address several caveats regarding the interpretations and limits of the approaches in the discussion and provide an appropriately cautious interpretation of their results.</p><p>Overall in the development of the background and in the discussion, the system is viewed from the standpoint of experiments in cats, and to some extent rats, and a lesser extent, mice. Although there may be some equivalences, and these are excellent strong motivations for your work, I would be cautious about making arguments from other species when interpreting specific points. This may require a deeper dive into the literature. Looking particularly at line 503-504.</p><p>Although the authors emphasize the linearity of the FI relationship this is really only clear up to about 1 nA, and even then a few cells show the more typical roll-over of spike rate. Therefore, it would be appropriate to temper the &quot;linearity&quot; conclusions.</p><p>Dynamic Clamp Experiments:</p><p>Although these experiments are well motivated and some aspects are technically well done, I had concerns about the specific parameters used for the synaptic facilitation and depression, as indicated in the Public Review. To clarify, a better model of the synaptic dynamics, incorporating a wider frequency range appropriate to the stimuli used, would provide stronger support for the conclusions of these experiments. Clearly there is a difference in the depression and facilitation rates between 20 and 50 Hz, and I would expect that there would be even greater differences at lower and higher frequencies. The best approach would be to do a full assessment of the dynamics over a wider frequency range (10-400 Hz), including post-train recovery, and then fitting these to a single model (e.g., Tsodyks or Dittman et al.,) to use in the dynamic clamp. Then the facilitation and depression rates for each synapse would be tailored to the full frequency range and the use of frequencies outside of the experimentally-measured range would not be an issue. On the other hand, it may not be easy to obtain the required data rigorously from an experiment at present. Electrical stimulation would likely be problematic, but optogenetics would require using faster opsins, if the appropriate controls could be done.</p><p>The recording from unidentified ChR2 positive neurons in the IC (Figure 5) provides some evidence that the cells can follow 20 Hz stimulation, but does not provide sufficient characterization of the properties of those cells. Excitatory IC neurons exhibit a diversity of intrinsic physiology, responses to acoustic stimuli, and molecular identity. An experiment to identify which specific IC neuron class(es) project to the MOC neurons may be difficult and would take some time to work out and is beyond the scope of the present work. However, it is unclear that those cells in the IC that are labelled and were recorded in slices are necessarily the same ones that project to the MOC neurons. This presents a weakness that needs to be considered when interpreting the dynamic clamp data. The dynamic clamp experiments assume that the inputs from the IC fire regularly, without adaptation, but this may not be the case. This needs to be carefully discussed in terms of the importance of synaptic facilitation versus depression.</p><p>Figure 1 panel F: I found this presentation confusing (because CTB-positive refers to CTB+ChAT-td cells; theoretically there could be CTB-positive, ChAT-td negative cells). Perhaps clarifying the labeling would help.</p><p>line 333: I am not sure what &quot;fully engage&quot; means in this context.</p><p>line 357: It is also possible that the facilitation is a compensation for firing rate adaptation, such that over time the synaptic strength is relatively constant. In that case, the cells may be tonic firing, but show strong adaptation. See also comment on Figure 5.</p><p>line 405: As the IC is at least one synapse later than the VCN input, and has a longer pathway to travel (both ascending and descending), it would be expected that it is also delayed. In the experiments where two inputs are combined, was this delay taken into account?</p><p>line 373: &quot;small number&quot; : be more specific.</p><p>line 486: This needs a few citations. There are examples in the auditory system that may be relevant (or even lead to an opposing conclusion), but at least some backup for the statement should be present so readers know what you are thinking about.</p><p>Line 530: The speed of the receptor kinetics might not be the important observation here given the relatively slow output of the MOC system. Did you consider that the receptor-associated calcium influx might be important? This could be discussed.</p><p>line 572: &quot;Insertion&quot; seems the wrong word here. Perhaps &quot;Activation&quot;?</p><p>Line 670: this should include &quot;uncompensated&quot; in the description for clarity.</p><p>line 673: &quot;baselined&quot; ? You mean the baseline current (define time frame) was subtracted from the data. Please reword.</p><p>line 734-735: The tau values and amplitudes have units; I assume these are in sec and nA respectively, but they should be specified. The meaning of &quot;n&quot; and &quot;n0&quot; is not defined.</p><p>Figure 4Ai shows T-stellate cells projecting to the DCN in the schematic. However, 4Ei does not show any visible terminals in the DCN. Also, the lack of terminals in the DCN is not mentioned in the text (lines 216-218). At face value, this suggests that those T-stellate cells that project to the DCN are not the same population that projects to the IC. However, this would contradict data in the cat (Adams, 1983), which shows that double-labeling of a substantial population of &quot;multipolar&quot; cells in the VCN after combined IC and DCN injections. On the other hand, it is not clear from Oertel's reconstructions that all T-stellate cells have a collateral to the DCN (though clearly limitations on that data). Those of Smith and Rhode's (89) cat paper, where axons could be traced, do. Perhaps some comment on this would be appropriate.</p><p>Figure 5: The sample size for the loose-patch cell attached recordings in the IC is not given.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In addition to the main conclusion, the manuscript includes a general description of MOC neuron physiology in mature mice using a reporter line to visualize cholinergic neurons.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Andrew King (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor following consultation with the original reviewers. Here is a summary of our evaluation of the revised version.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved, but some remaining issues have been raised by reviewer #2 that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. Regarding: &quot;To these points we would like to note that the T-stellate cell firing in vivo does not mirror the adapting responses of the afferent neurons. Rather they show the characteristic 'chopper' responses described by Sachs and colleagues years ago. Moreover, we found that the chopper response of the T-stellate cell is recapitulated by simply applying current injection stimuli repeated over and over.&quot;</p><p>I think that the authors and I have somewhat different readings of the past literature here. &quot;Choppers&quot; in the VCN exist as a continuum of discharge patterns in cat (Godfrey et al., 1976; Bourk, 1976; Typlt et al., 2012), some of which have pronounced adaptation during short tone bursts (Bourk, 1976; Young et al., J. Neurophys. 1988; Blackburn and Sachs, J. Neurophysiol. 1989; Winter and Palmer, Hearing Res. 1990 Figure 7; guinea pig; Rhode and Smith, 1986, Figure 17 at 40dB SPL). Similar adaptation is evident in mouse (see Roos and May, Hearing Res. 2012 Figures 5 and 6). Quantification of regularity in responses to longer tone bursts (seen in Godfrey et al., 1975) is generally lacking in the literature. The point is that in some &quot;choppers&quot;, there is rate adaptation, driven by a combination of the multiple phases of adaptation in the auditory nerve rate, and by inhibition that increases over time. I agree that most stellate cells in the CN show little adaptation in slice recordings in response to direct current injection, as indicated by the authors, but a few do (Figure 3, Manis et al., 2019).</p><p>It is ok for the authors to do the experiment in the way that they did, but they also should not ignore the literature that indicates that in responses to tone bursts in vivo, adaptation over the time scale of their stimulus sets does occur in some potential afferent cell populations.</p><p>2. Regarding: &quot;A second limitation is that the synaptic dynamics are treated as independent of frequency. This assumption conflicts with data shown in the paper, where the depression and facilitation rates are frequency-dependent in a manner typical of many previously studied synapses.&quot; Response: &quot;We respectfully disagree with this point. Our figure 7D clearly shows profiles of depression or facilitation that are identical after nearly tripling the stimulation rate, from 20 to 50 Hz.&quot;</p><p>This depends on the assumptions that are made regarding the dynamic behavior of synapses when challenged with different rates of spikes, and on the lack of data at these synapses regarding the dynamic behavior across a wider range of stimulus frequencies. The data shown in the paper at two frequencies are plotted as a function of spike number during the train, which translates into two different depression rates (e.g., time constants). Synapses are inherently non-linear, so that measurements made at two relatively low frequencies (20, 50 Hz) should not be extrapolated to higher frequencies (180 Hz) without acknowledging this limitation. The demonstration by Wang and Kaczmarek (1998) of the engagement of a frequency-dependent recovery from depression at high rates is a clear example of this point (and one that has been shown at other synapses). The authors should recognize in the text that they have used a simplified situation in which rate-dependent factors that may accrue outside the range that they were able to study are not considered. I do not think it much affects their conclusions as far as they go, but it is just a caveat worth mentioning.</p><p>3. The issue with dynamic clamp is a real one, but is also second-order. It also cannot be properly evaluated because the roles of dendritic ion channels in these cells are not known, and the consequences of dendritic conductance changes (e.g., synaptic inputs) and somatic conductance changes imposed by dynamic clamp are not exactly the same, although they are qualitatively very similar. I accept that you do the experiments that you can; however I do wish that the authors would acknowledge that there are limitations to this approach.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66396.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Please adjust some of the claims of the paper to reflect the limitations in your interpretation.

This efferent control system is thought to play a role in adjusting the cochlear gain, improving the detection of signals in noise, and potentially providing some protection from acoustic trauma. The authors use a combination of genetically modified mice, virus tracing and cell-type-specific insertion of channelrhodposins, and electrophysiology methods to identify and characterize the synaptic inputs to these cells.</p><p>They focus on two sources. The first source is ascending input from cochlear nucleus neurons, T-Stellate cells, which are identifiable at a cellular and molecular-genetic level. The second source is descending input from unidentified neurons of the inferior colliculus. The work convincingly demonstrates several features of these excitatory inputs. Both inputs drive rapidly desensitizing, rectifying, and calcium-permeable AMPA receptors. However, the synapses show opposing release dynamics. The ascending synapses exhibit depression at the two frequencies tested, 20 and 50 Hz, whereas the descending synapses show facilitation at these frequencies. Somewhat surprisingly, the recovery from depression and facilitation for the two inputs follow similar time courses. Some of the potential concerns regarding the limitations of optical activation of ChR2-expressing axons and terminals are addressed. These experiments are thoughtfully performed and presented, and provide the first detailed characterization of these two excitatory synaptic inputs to the MOC neurons. These results suggest that the ascending inputs provide sensory information, whereas the descending inputs offer a slower, modulatory control over the efferent neurons. A limitation is that the exact cellular source of the descending inputs is not known.</p><p>The authors extend the characterization of the two input sources with dynamic clamp experiments that compare how the firing of the MOC neurons is affected when the inputs are simulated both separately and simultaneously, including at a higher firing rate. The experiments attempt to reveal distinct functional roles for the ascending and descending inputs. The authors use in vitro responses to current pulses recorded from T-Stellate neurons for spike timing. The experiments are technically challenging (two-electrodes on one target cell for dynamic clamp) and could provide valuable information. The results suggest that the combination of depressing and facilitating inputs better supports sustained firing and enhances the dynamic range of firing rates with increasing input. The combined inputs also result in a relatively constant, short-latency to the first spike compared to when tested independently. However, there are several limitations to these experiments. The most significant limitation is the choice of input stimulus patterns, which do not accurately reflect the adapting responses of the afferent neurons to acoustic stimuli (and in the case of the IC input, we do not know what the response patterns should be as the source neurons have not been characterized).</p></disp-quote><p>To these points we would like to note that the T-stellate cell firing in vivo does not mirror the adapting responses of the afferent neurons. Rather they show the characteristic âchopperâ responses described by Sachs and colleagues years ago. Moreover, we found that the chopper response of the T-stellate cell is recapitulated by simply applying current injection stimuli repeated over and over. It was therefore reasonable to use these responses to drive the simulated synaptic conductances. In order to help clarify this point, we have added to Figure 8 Suppl 1 original traces demonstrating the âchoppingâ pattern of firing in the T-stellate cell used for our stimuli, a pattern well known to reflect the in vivo response profile of these neurons. We do agree that in the case of the IC input, we do not know the response patterns as those neurons have not been characterized (as now pointed out in the text). However, the firing rate of these neurons is not likely to match that of the VCN, as shown in numerous studies. We assumed that the IC input does show some degree of regular firing, simply because their synapses appear uniquely suited to respond to regular firing with facilitation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second limitation is that the synaptic dynamics are treated as independent of frequency. This assumption conflicts with data shown in the paper, where the depression and facilitation rates are frequency-dependent in a manner typical of many previously studied synapses.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with this point. Our figure 7D clearly shows profiles of depression or facilitation that are identical after nearly tripling the stimulation rate, from 20 to 50 Hz.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, some frequencies used in the dynamic clamp experiments (110, 180 Hz), although reasonable based on in vivo data, were outside the range studied optogenetically (20, 50 Hz), so it is not clear that the same synaptic dynamics apply. An additional concern is that the dynamic clamp method only simulates somatic inputs, so dendritic filtering effects are lost (Figure 3 shows that putative terminals from the VCN appear in the neuropil around the cells in the VNTB; the preponderance of somatic versus dendritic targeting is not clear).</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the stimulation mimics only the effects of the filtered EPSPs on spike generation. But since we measured those EPSPs at soma and mimicked them quantitatively in the dynamic clamp, the dendritic filtering effects are in fact preserved, not lost. Again, the key measurement here is spiking, and that is driven by the somatic/AIS depolarizations which we have both measured and mimicked.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall in the development of the background and in the discussion, the system is viewed from the standpoint of experiments in cats, and to some extent rats, and a lesser extent, mice. Although there may be some equivalences, and these are excellent strong motivations for your work, I would be cautious about making arguments from other species when interpreting specific points. This may require a deeper dive into the literature. Looking particularly at line 503-504.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for reminding us of this caution. We have now updated the text (line 535) to specify that bushy cell projections to VNTB were observed in cat.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the authors emphasize the linearity of the FI relationship this is really only clear up to about 1 nA, and even then a few cells show the more typical roll-over of spike rate. Therefore, it would be appropriate to temper the &quot;linearity&quot; conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is true that a few cells lose their SR linearity after a 1 to 2 nA square pulse current injection (Figure 2D), stimuli of these intensities are very likely beyond physiological range. MOC neurons have rarely been reported to fire more than 100 Hz in vivo (lines 504-505), while the majority of the responses we reported exceed this rate even at 900 pA (Figure 2C). Additionally, our conductance clamp experiments which simulated more synaptic-like stimuli recapitulated our linearity observation (Figure 8E, and 9D). Also see lines 494-498, where we compare our results to those of previous studies that also observed a linear increase in spike rate with increasing stimulus intensity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Dynamic Clamp Experiments:</p><p>Although these experiments are well motivated and some aspects are technically well done, I had concerns about the specific parameters used for the synaptic facilitation and depression, as indicated in the Public Review. To clarify, a better model of the synaptic dynamics, incorporating a wider frequency range appropriate to the stimuli used, would provide stronger support for the conclusions of these experiments. Clearly there is a difference in the depression and facilitation rates between 20 and 50 Hz, and I would expect that there would be even greater differences at lower and higher frequencies.</p></disp-quote><p>Respectfully, our observation (Figure 7) was that facilitation and depression did not differ in their recovery, nor in their corresponding plasticity index between 20 and 50 Hz. Figure 7D demonstrates that the increase in EPSC amplitude was stimulus # dependent at these rates, and not dependent on the rate itself. Therefore, we felt it appropriate to extrapolate our observations to higher simulated rates. Additionally, our goal was to determine how MOC neurons would respond to inputs with similar properties to those we observed, but at higher rates, as this was not possible with our ChR2 construct. We highlighted this in the text (lines 347-350).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The best approach would be to do a full assessment of the dynamics over a wider frequency range (10-400 Hz), including post-train recovery, and then fitting these to a single model (e.g., Tsodyks or Dittman et al.,) to use in the dynamic clamp. Then the facilitation and depression rates for each synapse would be tailored to the full frequency range and the use of frequencies outside of the experimentally-measured range would not be an issue. On the other hand, it may not be easy to obtain the required data rigorously from an experiment at present. Electrical stimulation would likely be problematic, but optogenetics would require using faster opsins, if the appropriate controls could be done.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the sentiment of this statement and in fact did attempt experiments with alternative opsins (ChETA and Chronos). However, even with the same AAV serotype and promoter, these opsins were consistently observed in MOC neurons postsynaptic to our infected inputs â in other words, the opsin expression was aberrant. Additionally, when using AAVs expressing these opsins to transduce IC neurons, we often observed that T-stellate cells in the VCN were retrogradely infectedâsomething that never happened with AAV1-CAG-ChR2-Venus. Understanding why this transsynaptic and retrograde expression occurred was beyond the aim of our investigation and use of these constructs would unfortunately have confounded our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The recording from unidentified ChR2 positive neurons in the IC (Figure 5) provides some evidence that the cells can follow 20 Hz stimulation, but does not provide sufficient characterization of the properties of those cells. Excitatory IC neurons exhibit a diversity of intrinsic physiology, responses to acoustic stimuli, and molecular identity. An experiment to identify which specific IC neuron class(es) project to the MOC neurons may be difficult and would take some time to work out and is beyond the scope of the present work. However, it is unclear that those cells in the IC that are labelled and were recorded in slices are necessarily the same ones that project to the MOC neurons. This presents a weakness that needs to be considered when interpreting the dynamic clamp data. The dynamic clamp experiments assume that the inputs from the IC fire regularly, without adaptation, but this may not be the case. This needs to be carefully discussed in terms of the importance of synaptic facilitation versus depression.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the specific class of IC projection to MOC neurons is unknown and discovering the identity of this input would be a worthwhile follow-up experiment. We have updated lines 371-375 to clarify that the tonic firing simulated in our dynamic clamp experiments was an assumption due to a lack of knowledge about these descending inputs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 panel F: I found this presentation confusing (because CTB-positive refers to CTB+ChAT-td cells; theoretically there could be CTB-positive, ChAT-td negative cells). Perhaps clarifying the labeling would help.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we updated Figure 1F to say âCTB and ChATâ positive. Surprisingly, we never encountered a CTB-positive, ChAT-td negative VNTB neuron.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>line 333: I am not sure what &quot;fully engage&quot; means in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed to âutilize the wide firing rangeâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>line 357: It is also possible that the facilitation is a compensation for firing rate adaptation, such that over time the synaptic strength is relatively constant. In that case, the cells may be tonic firing, but show strong adaptation. See also comment on Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting comment. As we understand it, what is meant is that presynaptic firing slows down, but facilitation somehow compensates by making larger EPSPs. How this would play out in postsynaptic firing however is not clear and would depend on that relationship between the time constant of presynaptic adaption determining EPSP rate and the postsynaptic membrane time constant which determines temporal integration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>line 405: As the IC is at least one synapse later than the VCN input, and has a longer pathway to travel (both ascending and descending), it would be expected that it is also delayed. In the experiments where two inputs are combined, was this delay taken into account?</p></disp-quote><p>A delay in IC input was not taken into account. Adding a delay would also mean assuming that these descending IC neurons solely respond to acoustically driven inputâwhich is unknown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>line 373: &quot;small number&quot; : be more specific.</p></disp-quote><p>Added â(N = 3)â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>line 486: This needs a few citations.

The meaning of &quot;n&quot; and &quot;n0&quot; is not defined.</p></disp-quote><p>For these equations, tau and amplitude are unitless. This is because they are used as scaling factors, affecting the amplitude for each individual EPSG by weighting Gmax. Tau could alternatively be described as a stimulus constant, e.g. Tau = 12.9 stim #, but we believe this is still better expressed as a unitless value. We tried to clarify by specifying that the exponential equations were fit to normalized physiological data, and by simplifying the equations (n<sub>0</sub> always equals 0, so n<sub>0</sub> was redundant and therefore removed).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4Ai shows T-stellate cells projecting to the DCN in the schematic. However, 4Ei does not show any visible terminals in the DCN. Also, the lack of terminals in the DCN is not mentioned in the text (lines 216-218). At face value, this suggests that those T-stellate cells that project to the DCN are not the same population that projects to the IC. However, this would contradict data in the cat (Adams, 1983), which shows that double-labeling of a substantial population of &quot;multipolar&quot; cells in the VCN after combined IC and DCN injections. On the other hand, it is not clear from Oertel's reconstructions that all T-stellate cells have a collateral to the DCN (though clearly limitations on that data). Those of Smith and Rhode's (89) cat paper, where axons could be traced, do. Perhaps some comment on this would be appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>Perhaps the reviewer was viewing a printed version of this figure? Terminals in the DCN are clearly visible in Figure 4Ei, and to a much lesser extent in Eii. The purple labeling in DCN is not background as it is absent in the DCN molecular layer. Our data agree with Adams, 1983, and Smith and Rhodeâs, 1989âthat at least a subset of, if not all, IC projecting T-stellate cells send collaterals to the DCN.
