How therapies alter this post- translational cancer hallmark and the consequences thereof remain elusive. Here, we show that an elevated secretome fucosylation is a pan-cancer signature of both response and resistance to multiple targeted therapies. Large-scale pharmacogenomics revealed that fucosylation genes display widespread association with resistance to these therapies. In cancer cell cultures, xenograft mouse models, and patients, targeted kinase inhibitors distinctively induced core fucosylation of secreted proteins less than 60 kDa. Label-free proteomics of N-glycoproteomes identified fucosylation of the antioxidant PON1 as a critical component of the therapy-induced secretome (TIS). N-glycosylation of TIS and target core fucosylation of PON1 are mediated by the fucose salvage-FUT8-SLC35C1 axis with PON3 directly modulating GDP-Fuc transfer on PON1 scaffolds. Core fucosylation in the Golgi impacts PON1 stability and folding prior to secretion, promoting a more degradation-resistant PON1. Global and PON1-specific secretome de-N-glycosylation both limited the expansion of resistant clones in a tumor regression model. We defined the resistance-associated transcription factors (TFs) and genes modulated by the N-glycosylated TIS via a focused and transcriptome-wide analyses. These genes characterize the oxidative stress, inflammatory niche, and unfolded protein response as important factors for this modulation. Our findings demonstrate that core fucosylation is a common modification indirectly induced by targeted therapies that paradoxically promotes resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fucosylation</kwd><kwd>n-linked glycosylation</kwd><kwd>targeted therapy</kwd><kwd>secretome</kwd><kwd>drug resistance</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N11190234</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Yoosik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2019R1C1C1006672</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Yoosik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2018R1A6A3A01012494</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Pilnam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2016M3A9B6026771</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Je-Yoel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2021R1A5A1033157</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Je-Yoel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003625</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Health and Welfare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HI14C1324</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Je-Yoel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100015697</institution-id><institution>Hyundai Motor Chung Mong-Koo Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Global Scholarship FHS-20–008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aldonza</surname><given-names>Mark Borris D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeted therapies induce an aberrant fucosylation of complex tumor secretomes stimulating the expansion of minority drug-resistant clones and promoting therapy resistance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Complete responses to targeted therapies remain rare for a vast majority of cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krause and Van Etten, 2005</xref>). While long-term disease stabilization can be achieved by therapeutic inhibition of oncogenic drivers, resistance to this targeted strategy is inevitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krause and Van Etten, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Baselga, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lin and Shaw, 2016</xref>). In the clinic, partial remission can be achieved by classes of inhibitors that target amplified or mutationally activated kinases such as EGFR mutations or ALK translocations in lung adenocarcinoma, BRAF mutations in melanoma, or HER2 amplifications in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lin and Shaw, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chapman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arteaga et al., 2011</xref>). Both genetic and non-genetic mechanisms of resistance to these inhibitors exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Salgia and Kulkarni, 2018</xref>). However, the innate nature of many of these resistance acquisition models precludes the critical role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in contributing to an incomplete tumor regression after therapy. For instance, a complex network of secreted signals from drug-stressed tumors termed therapy-induced secretomes (TIS) was shown to facilitate the selective expansion of a small number of pre-existing resistant clones, paradoxically explaining relapse to targeted therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Obenauf et al., 2015</xref>). Systemic understanding of this therapy-induced niche could lead to a paradigm shift in our current management of clinical drug resistance in cancer.</p><p>The cancer secretome comprises a set of secreted proteins that is pro-tumorigenic in nature. Many components of this secretome serve as disease biomarkers and are major druggable targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Robinson et al., 2019</xref>). Both classical and non-classical pathways regulate the secretion of these components including extracellular matrix proteins, exosomes, growth factors, cytokines, shed receptors, and proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Robinson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanash et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kalluri and LeBleu, 2020</xref>). During stress, these secretome components are remodeled depending on tissue architecture and cell composition of the TME, stress-inducing stimuli, or conditions that affect liver homeostasis—a systemic dictator of the secretome and plasma proteome states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gupta and Massagué, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>). Substantially, secreted soluble proteins undergo post-translational modifications (PTMs) that functionally predominate their trafficking, stability, and folding prior to secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barlowe and Miller, 2013</xref>). These PTMs in the secretory pathway are constantly employed to form tumorigenic niches upon chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barlowe and Miller, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Madden et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pitt et al., 2016</xref>). Among these PTMs, phosphorylation and glycosylation are the most common. Glycosylation—the covalent addition of sugar moieties to target scaffolds—is the most abundant PTM of the secretome, as nearly all secreted mammalian proteins have at least one glycan, a sugar-based assembly, attached to them at a specific site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spiro, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reily et al., 2019</xref>). For example, therapy-induced apoptotic disassembly of the Golgi is associated with the anomalous synthesis of specific glycan types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang and Wang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wlodkowic et al., 2009</xref>). In some cases, direct glycosylation of apoptotic signals upon therapy can restrain or trigger their cell-killing capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lichtenstein and Rabinovich, 2013</xref>). Moreover, therapies that act as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressors can inhibit protein glycosylation and reduce disulfide bonds initiating an unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cubillos-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Costa et al., 2020</xref>). While there is little evidence suggesting a post-ER quality control that operates at the Golgi following UPR, stress-induced regulation of terminal glycosylation is a complementary mechanism of Golgi-localized machinery that predominates the assembly of newly synthesized secretory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pothukuchi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>An abnormal glycome is a cancer hallmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pinho and Reis, 2015</xref>). Cancer-specific changes in two of the most frequent glycosylation types, O- and N-linked glycosylation, are coordinated with expression of genes encoding for glycosyltransferases–enzymes that catalyze glycosidic linkages–and glycosidases–enzymes that cleave glycosidic bonds–and their localization within the secretory pathway (Golgi apparatus and ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pinho and Reis, 2015</xref>). We note that expressions of other enzyme-coding genes–many are known to mediate congenital disorders of glycosylation (i.e. those involved in sugar metabolism and transport and glycan sulfation)–are also relevant for understanding aberrant glycosylation in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leroy, 2006</xref>). Throughout malignant transformation, unique alterations in both glycan level and composition, their conjugation and linkages, are reflected in the cell surface, intracellular, and extracellular scaffolds of mostly lipids and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lauc et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pearce, 2018</xref>). Lewis antigens, components of exocrine epithelial secretions, are among the most frequently overexpressed fucosylated epitopes during carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blanas et al., 2018</xref>). Most obviously, this is attributed to the extensive activity of glycosyltransferases, mainly by fucosyltransferases (FUTs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schneider et al., 2017</xref>). However, more nuanced and complicated dysregulations can arise from incomplete synthesis–truncated glycosylation common in early carcinogenesis–or neo-synthesis–de novo production of atypical glycosylation patterns–which are mediated by a complex interplay of glycosyltransferases such as FUTs and other factors that regulate fucose metabolism in the Golgi/ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reily et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keeley et al., 2019</xref>). As a result, several types of Lewis antigens, including sialylated Lewis structures, are currently being utilized in the clinic as prognostic cancer biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blanas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keeley et al., 2019</xref>). Given that these glycan alterations influence the cancer secretome, therapy-induced remodeling of the local TME, particularly its secreted components, must involve modified functionalities in the multi-step process of glycosylation.</p><p>Here, we identify that core fucosylation, modification at the N-glycan core, is a major post-translational signature of the pan-cancer TIS. Using pharmacogenomics, label-free proteomics, and a panoply of perturbation assays, we reveal that the therapy-induced aberration in secretome fucosylation involves (i) a differential induction of relatively smaller fucosylated proteins (&lt;60 kDa), (ii) α1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8)-dependent transfer of GDP-β-L-fucose (GDP-Fuc) onto N-glycan core structures in the Golgi compartment, (iii) expression of fucose salvage genes and the GDP-Fuc transporter SLC35C1, and most significantly, (iv) core fucosylation of the antioxidant paraoxonase 1 (PON1). By utilizing several cellular and xenograft mouse models of drug resistance paired with patient specimens, we show that an elevated secretome fucosylation is likely a complementary mechanism of cancer relapse and targeted therapy resistance. In addition to uncovering the regulation of this TIS modification, we tested the functional consequences of generally blocking secretome core fucosylation or specifically constraining fucosylated PON1. Indeed, secretome de-N-glycosylation by a glycosidase, fucosylation inhibition by FUT8 or SLC35C1 RNA interference (RNAi), or site-specific blockade of PON1 core fucosylation dramatically prevented TIS-directed rebound of minority resistant clone population in a regressing heterogeneous cell pool. Furthermore, a targeted screen and transcriptome-wide gene expression analysis unveil effectors of redox stress sensing, inflammation regulation, and the UPR as secretome fucosylation-specific resistance modulators. Our findings point to a new view of the TIS that extends its role in establishing a resistance-promoting microenvironment niche via core fucosylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Core fucosylation of therapy-induced cancer secretomes</title><p>While fucose is naturally present in a variety of glycolipids and glycoproteins, fucose moieties on N-glycans of secreted proteins are often dysregulated in cancer and are among the most aberrant sugar moieties of cancer glycoproteomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spiro, 2002</xref>). How therapies alter their on-site linkages and regulate their overall levels remain obscure. We investigated whether fucosylation is correlated with drug sensitivity by comprehensive mining of available data on genes involved in fucose metabolism (FUK, FPGT, FX, GMDS), fucosylation branching (FUTs, protein O-fucosyltransferases [POFUTs]), and GDP-Fuc transport (SLC35C1) in the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancerrxgene.org/">https://www.cancerrxgene.org/</ext-link>) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.broadinstitute.org/ccle">https://sites.broadinstitute.org/ccle</ext-link>), two of the largest publicly available pharmacogenomics data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iorio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>). We first evaluated the consistency of the pharmacogenomic data from the two datasets in the context of our query. Comparative analysis using the correlation between FUT gene expression and overall drug sensitivity (IC50 for GDSC and area under the curve, AUC for CCLE) as a metric showed that the molecular data are in concordance despite the apparent differences in cell lines and drug components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although we should emphasize that there are obvious variabilities between the two datasets (i.e. variation in FUT expression values) that should be taken into consideration which might be the result of different cell lines representing a cancer lineage or/and assay protocols. Regardless, the consistent correlation between FUT expression and drug sensitivity reiterates the findings of previous efforts that looked into the reproducibility and biological consilience between profiling data from GDSC and CCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia Consortium and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Consortium, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haverty et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Upon clustering of cell-line-derived data into 30 cancer types, we determined a univariate correlation between gene expression and a summary drug response measure (based on IC50 or AUC means). Spearman’s correlation coefficient indicated that there is a variable but widespread association between fucosylation gene expression and drug resistance in both data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Of interest in terms of its consistent high pan-cancer expression profile in both data sets is FUT8—notably the only enzyme-encoding gene known to directly mediate core fucosylation via N-linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). To scrutinize whether the correlation between FUT8 expression and drug resistance is significantly cumulated in drug-resistant cells, we categorized cell lines that are either sensitive or resistant based on the generalized drug response measurement and determined their correlation per class of drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Indeed, FUT8 broadly correlated with resistance to a variety of compounds but more strongly to inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR). Across all compound types, resistance to targeted therapies displayed the strongest correlation with FUT8 expression. Moreover, cell lines that contain mutations near or specifically at GDP-Fuc binding sites (resulting in amino acid change that eliminates or decreases fucosylation) in FUTs or other fucosylation genes collectively exhibited higher sensitivity to drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Secretome fucosylation is a post-translational mechanism associated with targeted therapy resistance in cancer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dot plot visualization of correlation between indicated FUT gene expression and drug response per cancer type screened in GDSC and CCLE.

In addition, using publicly available microarray and RNA-seq data, we found that high expressions of FUK, SLC35C1, and FUT8 are generally correlated with poor first progression or relapse-free survival (RFS) in various cancer patient cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Given that many of the target N-glycoprotein scaffolds of FUT8-mediated fucosylation are secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), we next asked whether the association between fucosylation gene expression and drug resistance is interrelated with expression changes in the components of the core cancer secretome (CCS). Using defined component gene sets for CCS and protein glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Robinson et al., 2019</xref>), we observed coordinated pan-cancer increase or decrease of CCS and wide-ranging increase in expression of genes associated with glycosylation in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). It is important to note that the glycosylation gene set contains subsets of annotated gene classes involved in secretome glycosylation (i.e. FUTs, solute carriers, positive/negative regulators of glycosylation in the Golgi). To add resolution to this analysis, we also evaluated two of the largest glycosylation subsets in the dataset, protein O- and N-linked glycosylation. Similarly, there is an extensive pan-cancer gene expression increase in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Overlapping genes between CCS and glycosylation significantly correlated with resistance to both targeted cytotoxic drugs, which may indicate that glycosylation of CCS components predicates drug sensitivity states.</p><p>Regulation of the DNA methylome influences the N-glycomes of the cancer secretome and plasma proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saldova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wahl et al., 2018</xref>). Curious as to how promoter methylation of FUTs can associate with drug sensitivity, we analyzed the methylation status at 1 kb upstream of the transcription start sites (TSS) of each FUT (since this TSS proximal region often are loci for dense hyper- and hypo-methylation in cancer cell lines) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones, 2012</xref>) and queried drug sensitivity data in the GDSC. The overall fraction of FUT methylated loci varied across tumor types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As predicted, we observed a significant negative correlation between FUT mRNA expression and promoter methylation. While the association between FUT methylation and drug sensitivity appears indiscriminately, FUT methylation profiles contradicted the correlation between FUT gene expression and resistance. In other words, cancer types exhibiting higher FUT methylation are more sensitive to targeted therapies with the exception of FUT1 and FUT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that cancer cells can inhibit fucosylation upon increased methylation of FUT promoter are more susceptible to therapy. Albeit in preliminary stage, our analysis supports the growing evidence on epigenetic regulation of glycosylation-related genes, especially those that encode for glycosyltransferases, by DNA methylation with phenotypic consequences in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horvat et al., 2011</xref>), which in the context of our analysis might be important for modulating targeted therapy response.</p><p>Based on our analysis, we hypothesized that response and resistance to targeted therapies involve the systemic regulation of core fucosylation of CCS components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We performed a potpourri of biochemical assays to characterize fucosylation in multiple cancer cell lines, cell secretomes, xenograft mouse and human patient sera and tissues (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1—supplementary file 1a and b</xref> for LC patient cohort information). To enrich protein samples for core fucosylation, we used a lectin-conjugated bead capture strategy, where <italic>Aleuria aurantia</italic> lectin (AAL) served as the carbohydrate probe for core fucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; see Materials and methods). Remarkably, lectin blotting revealed a distinct signature of enriched core fucosylation of serum proteins between 30 and 60 kDa in lung cancer (LC) patients who received multiple cycles of osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), compared to those of treatment-naive patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). To quantitatively validate this result, we modified an N-glycan oxidation assay originally developed to assess the activity of PNGases in releasing N-linked oligosaccharide chains from glycosylated scaffolds. These cleaved N-glycans, upon deamination by water, possess hemiacetal moiety at their reducing terminus that is highly reactive to water-soluble WST-1, a tetrazolium salt dye that serves as an oxidation agent for N-glycans. In this reaction, WST-1 is converted to a formazan, producing a colorimetric readout (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freeze and Kranz, 2010</xref>). Due to its simplicity, we decided to adapt and optimize this assay to quantify the release of N-glycans from our samples using the glycoamidase PNGase F and glycosidases Endo S and F1. Following analysis of in-gel excised 30~60 kDa patient serum proteins, PNGase F-released N-glycans showed significantly higher levels in osimertinib-treated patients compared to treatment-naive patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>), while this apparent difference was considerably moderated when N-glycans were released by either Endo S or F1. While PNGase F can cleave all N-glycans, we assumed that the glycans released from our samples are mostly those that contain core fucose (cleavage at α1,6 site) because the subjected N-glycoproteins were captured using AAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Thus, the reduction in detected N-glycans released by Endo S or F1 reflects a specificity in cleaving different N-glycans. Note that Endo S has a high specificity for removing N-glycans within the chitobiose core of native IgG, while Endo F1 cleaves high mannose and some hybrid type N-glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trimble and Tarentino, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Collin and Olsén, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodfellow et al., 2012</xref>). The results potentially suggest that the cancer TIS from patients contains an elevated pool of both core fucosylated glycoproteins &lt;60 kDa and N-glycans.</p><p>We next characterized fucosylation in cancer cell-derived secretomes to verify the differential secretome core fucosylation signature. Targeted kinase inhibition by EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib), HER2-TKI (lapatinib), or BRAFi (vemurafenib) differentially induced fucosylation of secreted proteins &lt;60 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). To extend these findings to models of therapy resistance, we generated 16 stable drug-resistant (DR) clones from various cancer types (lung adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and breast cancer) following stepwise evolution to appropriate targeted inhibitor pressures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Similarly, secretomes derived from DR clones displayed an induced &lt;60 kDa protein fucosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). In addition, both 30~60 kDa TIS and secretome proteins from DR clones contained unanimously higher amounts of PNGase F-released N-glycans than those from DMSO or parental cell secretomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>), while N-glycans released by either Endo S or F1 did not discriminate the amounts from all samples mirroring our observations from the patient sera. Further, following targeted therapy, pooled &gt;30 kDa N-glycoproteins from sensitive cells displayed increased release of fucosylated N-glycans even at very low drug concentrations (from 0.001 µM), particularly in hypersensitive cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>). These results mimic the osimertinib-induced core fucosylation signatures in LC patient sera.</p><p>To couple these results with an overall measure of fucosylation in various samples and perturbation models, we developed a sandwich enzyme-linked lectin assay with varying affinities for AAL-captured fucosylated proteins (sandwich ELLA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>; see Methods). Using <italic>Ulex europaeus</italic> agglutinin I (UEA1)-AAL-based sandwich ELLA, we measured core fucosylation of cell-derived secretomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). TIS derived from cancer cells treated with targeted inhibitors of EGFR, BRAF, or HER2 signaling unanimously led to an elevated secretome fucosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Likewise, all DR clone-derived secretomes showed increased fucosylation compared to secretomes derived from parental clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). These are further accompanied by an overall core fucosylation increase in relapsed LC patient tissues after sequential therapy and osimertinib-treated LC patient sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, we investigated whether core fucosylation can discriminate between non-treated and osimertinib-treated LC patient sera or between non-relapsed and relapsed LC patient tissues. Total core fucosylation discriminated against the conditions with high sensitivity and specificity with the associated area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.961 and 0.915, respectively, based on sandwich ELLA measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).</p><p>To further substantiate these results, we analyzed tissues from small cohorts of breast cancer (BC) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1—supplementary file 1c</xref> for BC patient cohort information) and LC patients that received sequential multi-component therapy. Gene expression and enzyme activity analysis revealed that high expression of the fucose salvage pathway, FUT8, and SLC35C1 are strongly correlated with relapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8A and B</xref>). There was an overall immediate increase (16 h post-treatment) in Golgi-localized core fucosylation in drug-stressed LC and melanoma cells and sustained activation in their respective DR clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). We next profiled the expression of fucosylation genes in cancer cells with various oncogenic drivers upon apoptosis-inducing targeted therapy. While drug-induced expression changes varied between FUTs responsible for O- and N-linked glycosylation, there was a marked increase in FUT8 and SLC35C1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8C</xref>), all of which are associated with apoptosis (3-day treatment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8D and E</xref>). In DR clones, both expressions are also amplified except with a pronounced fucose salvage pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8F</xref>). Because FUT8 is highly expressed in relapsed patient tumors and in both drug-stressed cells and DR clones, we probed its potential role in therapy resistance. We first analyzed independent, genome-wide RNAi screening data from the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org/portal/">https://depmap.org/portal/</ext-link>) project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>), which houses pan-cancer genetic vulnerability maps. FUT8 is not classified as an essential gene in both sensitive and resistant cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9A</xref>), despite marginally higher essentiality scores in TKI-resistant cells than sensitive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9B</xref>). Regardless, treatment with EGFR-TKI or BRAFi and selection for resistance both led to higher FUT8-dependent GDP-Fuc catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9C</xref>). Non-lethal concentrations of nine kinase inhibitors induced FUT8 expression while near-lethal concentrations moderately mitigated this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9D</xref>). We then used RNAi to dissect the role of FUT8 upon targeted therapy. FUT8-targeting siRNAs augmented drug-induced cell killing and subsequent rescue was observed upon transfection with FUT8 cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9E</xref>), all independent of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9F</xref>). We obtained similar results with SLC35C1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9G–I</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, well-known core fucosylated cancer biomarkers α-fetoprotein (AFP) and α–1-antitrypsin (A1AT), both &gt;50 kDa, displayed systemic elevation in LC patient sera following osimertinib treatment and in secretomes of drug-stressed cells and DR clones, at least those expressing basal A1AT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10A and B</xref>). Using molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) filtration, we confirmed that concentrated secreted proteins of &gt;30 kDa from targeted inhibitor-treated cells, their respective DR clones, and EGFR-TKI-treated LC patients display distinctively enriched core fucosylation and core α–1,6-linkages-containing N-glycans, but less so in &gt;100 kDa pooled proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10C and D</xref>). These can be controlled by FUT8 or SLC35C1, at least shown in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10E</xref>). Similar size-dependent effects were observed in the golgi fractions of targeted inhibitor-treated cells and their respective DR clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). These results are consistent with the idea that direct or indirect mediators of core fucosylation confer resistance to targeted therapies.</p><p>To dissect whether these findings are supported in EGFR-TKI-resistant and relapsed tumors within a physiological environment in vivo, we subjected mouse xenografts derived from our H1993, PC9, and HCC827 models to EGFR-TKI therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11A</xref>). Aside from xenografted DR clones which are also resistant in vivo, residual parental tumors following EGFR-TKI therapy were also considered as ‘resistant’. Using the same array of experiments to assay core fucosylation, we observed an overall increase in serum fucosylation and a distinct signature of enriched core fucosylated serum proteins between 30 and 60 kDa in EGFR-TKI-treated parental-xenografted mice compared to vehicle-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11B and C</xref>). Following analysis of in-gel excised 30~60 kDa serum proteins, EGFR-TKI therapy led to significant increase in PNGase-F-released N-glycans in parental-xenografted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11D</xref>), while minimal to no significant differences where observed when N-glycans were released by either Endo S or F1. Using MWCO filtration, we confirmed that these &gt;30 kDa serum proteins from EGFR-TKI-treated parental-xenografted mice display distinctively enriched core fucosylation and core fucose-containing N-glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11E</xref>), but less so in &gt;100 kDa pooled proteins. As expected, while DR clone-xenografted mice displayed an overall increase in serum core fucosylation and enrichment of core fucose-containing serum N-glycans compared to untreated parental-xenografted mice, EGFR-TKI therapy did not induce significant changes in the DR setting, at least in sera. In xenograft tumor tissues, gene expression profiling showed variable FUT expressions but a unanimous marked increase in FUK-FPGT, FUT8, and SLC35C1 expressions associated with EGFR-TKI resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11F</xref>), reiterating the involvement of fucose salvage pathway in the systemic core fucosylation changes associated with TIS and EGFR-TKI resistance. Intriguingly, golgi-associated core and terminal fucosylation are both enriched in tumors of parental-xenografted and DR clone-xenografted mice following EGFR-TKI therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1—figure supplement 12</xref>).</p><p>Of note, while we consistently observed a marked 30~60 kDa core fucosylation of the TIS and drug resistance or relapse-associated secretomes across cell lines, xenografted mouse models, and LC patients, we noticed varying signatures in the core fucosylation of relatively larger proteins (&gt;60 and&gt;100 kDa) across samples. Whether this is a result of technical differences in the assays (i.e. discrepancy between AAL blots, sandwich ELLA, and N-glycan release assay) or an inherent phenotype of specific samples (i.e. depletion of fucosylated &gt;100 kDa proteins in cell-derived TIS and DR clone secretomes but not in TKI-treated LC patients or mouse models), determinants of this variation can be confronted with more relevant experimental set-up and systems-level interrogation of glycosylated proteins and glycans such as glycoproteomics. Regardless, taken together, our results suggest that targeted therapies induce a prevalent pan-cancer secretome core fucosylation that is primarily regulated by the fucose salvage-SLC35C1-FUT8 pathway and is enriched in the Golgi prior to secretion. This therapy-induced modification presumably is an evolvable mechanism towards establishing resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Therapy resistance via drug-induced secretome fucosylation</title><p>Limited tumor regression upon targeted therapy implicates that the microenvironment undergoes remodeling to sustain the remaining tumor population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Obenauf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Massagué and Obenauf, 2016</xref>). TIS, which consists of soluble mediators from this remodeled niche, predominantly promotes the survival and outgrowth of remnant tumor cells fostering subsequent disease relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Obenauf et al., 2015</xref>). Considering that our data point to core fucosylation as a widespread PTM of the pan-cancer TIS, we proposed that de-N-glycosylation of the TIS prevents the outgrowth of residual DR tumor cells. To model a regressing tumor in vitro, we performed a multicolor homotypic ‘one-pot’ admixture assay by mixing a small percentage (1%) of red-tracker-labeled DR clones with a large pool (99%) of green-tracker-labeled sensitive cells in both 2D and 3D cultures. We then subjected these admixtures to targeted therapy, exogenously added PNGase F to de-N-glycosylate secretome proteins, and tracked the rebound of DR clones and regression of the sensitive cell pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Following the formation of a 3D tumor spheroid, the population of the admixed gefitinib-resistant (GR) clone gradually expanded (observable after day 1 and steady from day 5), while the sensitive cell population significantly decreased upon targeted therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>; representative PC9 admixture in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Addition of PNGase F to these admixture secretomes led to a striking protein de-N-glycosylation in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).

In both 3D and 2D admixture assays, secretome de-N-glycosylation blocked the growth acceleration of the DR clone promoted by TIS in various cancer backgrounds and targeted therapy settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), delayed the S-phase cycle of residual cell populations, and promoted apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). Consistently, in a CM co-culture assay, TIS stimulated the proliferation of low-density seeded DR clones while exposure to de-N-glycosylated TIS limited their outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Of note, de-N-glycosylation in fresh media or DMSO CM did not affect DR clone proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). At day 5, depletion of FUT8 or SLC35C1 efficiently blocked the expansion of DR clone population in a regressed cell admixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>), suggesting that the similar effect afforded by PNGase F is via protein de-N-glycosylation. In such a circumstance, we observed depletion of fucosylation (in both apoptotic bodies and soluble secretome) and intracellular kinase phospho-proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>). We corroborated these in a CM co-culture assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), wherein de-N-glycosylated TIS prevented DR clones to form colonies and decreased kinase phosphorylation activity of EGFR, MET, and ErbB3, at least in GR and ER clones, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L and M</xref>). De-N-glycosylation by PNGase F in CM co-cultures (fresh media or CM from same cell/clone source) did not significantly influence the drug sensitivity of both sensitive cells and DR clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), except in sensitive cells cultured in their own de-N-glycosylated TIS, where there is a widespread drug sensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). These point to the idea that fucosylation of the TIS from drug-treated sensitive cells is critical to its survival-enhancing effects not only on DR clones but also in drug-sensitive cells. Across all cell lines and DR clones, PNGase F in-culture for up to 5 days did not affect cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). We assumed that PNGase F in our cell admixture assays not only de-N-glycosylates secreted scaffolds but should also affect cell surface N-glycans. We inspected the potential changes on N-glycosylation of cell membrane proteins in our admixtures by pooling subcellular fractions (admixture set-up as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). At day 5, we only observed a significant increase in fucosylation from TIS and ER/Golgi fractions, not from cell membrane fractions, of EGFR-TKI-treated H1993 and PC9 admixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>). In addition, there were no changes in the &lt;60 kDa fucosylation signature in cell membrane fractions of the admixtures, unlike the significant increase in ER/Golgi fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Regardless, PNGase F effectively de-N-glycosylated cell membrane proteins in-culture of both EGFR-TKI-treated H1993 and PC9 admixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4D and E</xref>). Although we cannot completely rule out alternative possibilities, these results favor the idea that core fucosylation of the TIS, and not of membrane proteins, promotes the DR clone population expansion observed in our cell admixture experiments.</p><p>Next, we established a ‘sequentially layered’ 3D spheroid in vitro co-culture and monitored the growth of red fluorescent protein (RFP)-expressing DR clones (H1993-GR, PC9-ER) in the absence or presence of sensitive cells treated with kinase inhibitors or vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Resembling our initial findings, co-culture with EGFR-TKI (gefitinib or erlotinib)-treated sensitive cells significantly promoted the growth of DR clones while the addition of PNGase F in the culture pronouncedly led to their growth retardation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B and C</xref>). In these 3D admixtures at day 5, TIS de-N-glycosylation triggered the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and impeded the gene expression of factors previously described to promote resistant cell outgrowth in a regressing TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Obenauf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>). It appears that the response of DR clones in these admixtures upon TIS de-N-glycosylation is independent of fucosylation gene activity since there were no marked changes in expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5D</xref>). Notably, long-term passaging and culture of DR clones in de-N-glycosylated TIS initiated a senescence response shown by strong senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, SASP activation, and arrested growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>), elucidating the inhibited proliferative capacity of these clones in cell admixtures upon TIS de-N-glycosylation. These results demonstrate that the rebound of the DR clone population in a model of tumor regression is dependent on fucosylated scaffolds of the TIS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PON1 fucosylation is a critical feature of therapy-induced cancer secretomes</title><p>To identify relevant components of the TIS- and DR clone-specific N-glycomes, we performed label-free in-gel proteomics using AAL-captured 30~70 kDa secretome proteins derived from H1993 cells treated with or without gefitinib or the GR clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Our analysis retrieved a fairly reproducible amount of peptide sequences per sample, which we used for downstream target identification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Base peak chromatogram revealed differential mass ranges in all samples, with a relatively higher overlapping similarity between gefitinib-treated cells and GR clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Because of the preliminary culture (i.e. 2% serum) and stress condition (drug treatment) requirements to produce TIS and semi-quantitative nature of our screen, many proteins identified by this method are expected to be ‘contaminants’ derived from non-secreted apoptotic proteins, serum proteins (trypsin, albumin, keratin), uncharacterized proteins, immunoglobulins, and proteins below or above the range of excised in-gel sections (&lt;30 and&gt;70 kDa). As expected, we derived &gt;60% ‘contaminant’ protein coverage. We filtered these out and retained proteins that are only classified as ‘secretory’ or ‘extracellular’ based on the annotation criteria by UniProt (i.e. possession of N-terminal signal sequence), yielding a total of 57 unique, secretory-predicted proteins across the three conditions. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed significant enrichment of biological processes (BPs) implicated in stress response, secretory pathway, and protein maturation in the ER/Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, BPs related to the metabolic regulation of oxidative stress were significantly overrepresented. Following the selection of overlapping fucosylated secretome proteins between the gefitinib-treated H1993 cells and GR clone, we identified 11 top hits using two different quantitative approaches (label-free quantification [LFQ] and intensity-based absolute quantification [iBAQ]). Many of these hits are serum proteins described to have aberrant N-glycosylation during cancer progression, such as AFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pinho and Reis, 2015</xref>) and the protein disulfide isomerase PDIA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">LaMantia et al., 1991</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Identification of fucosylated PON1 as a critical component of therapy-induced cancer secretomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the label-free secretome analysis workflow.

We previously identified PON1 to be systemically fucosylated in sera of late-stage metastatic small cell LC (SCLC) patients in an integrated glycoproteomics screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2014</xref>). In the gefitinib-treated H1993 cell secretome, we confirmed strong fucosylation of PON1, which appeared to have two isoforms: one with an apparent molecular mass of ~55 kDa while the other is ~45 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Intracellularly, PON1 has both nuclear and cytoplasmic isoforms where a~40 kDa cytoplasmic isoform is selectively enriched in LC patient tissues and cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aldonza et al., 2017</xref>). To quantitatively validate secretome PON1 fucosylation in drug-stressed cancer cells and DR clones, we employed PON1 fucosylation-specific hybrid lectin ELISA (HLE; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Despite different cell lineages, different oncogenic drivers, and different drugs, we found a widespread elevation of fucosylated secretome PON1 levels in multiple cancer cells upon targeted therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Similarly, PON1 fucosylation is enriched in secretomes derived from DR clones (at least those that have detectable PON1 gene expression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and is strikingly elevated in LC patient sera upon osimertinib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). Immunoprecipitated PON1 from core fucosylation-enriched patient sera reveals that the ~55 kDa isoform of secreted PON1 is favorably N-glycosylated than the ~45 kDa isoform, both of which have aberrantly high levels in osimertinib-treated patient sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>).</p><p>Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, we investigated whether fucosylated PON1 can discriminate between non-treated and osimertinib-treated LC patient sera. PON1 fucosylation discriminated against the conditions with high sensitivity and specificity with the associated area under the curve (AUC) of 0.901, based on HLE measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, left). We previously reported that systemic serum PON1 is diminished in LC patients where fucosylated serum PON1 is increased (i.e. extensive disease). We hypothesize that this inverse relationship reflects an N-linked glycosylation-dependent control of PON1 activity. Supporting this idea, serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activities of PON1 were significantly differentiated between non-treated and osimertinib-treated LC patient sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, right and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Also, both of these enzyme activities significantly discriminated the treatment group with AUCs ranging from 0.76 to 0.89. In LC patient tissues, PON1 fucosylation is associated with relapse and discriminated it from non-relapsed LC with an AUC of 0.77 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Next, we characterized intracellular PON1 fucosylation in DR clones. PON1 is primarily localized in the Golgi and has active fucosylation in the Golgi/ER fractions of GR and vemurafenib-resistant (VR) clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J and K</xref>). SLC35C1 RNAi significantly reduced Golgi-enriched PON1 fucosylation and promiscuously induced overall fucosylation in the nucleus of both DR clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L and M</xref>), indicating a functional defect in the transport of GDP-Fuc along the secretory pathway.</p><p>To identify direct regulators of PON1 fucosylation, we examined CCLE-annotated PON1 protein interactors based on co-expressing genes. We first clustered hits based on Spearman’s correlation and identified the cellular localization of each protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>). Among the top 20 proteins, only paraoxonase 3 (PON3) and VWA7 showed co-localization with PON1 in the secretory pathway. We were intrigued by PON3, also a serum paraoxonase known to both preferentially interact and share numerous conserved PTM (i.e. N-glycosylation) sites with PON1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harel et al., 2004</xref>). In both GR and VR clones, there is an active co-localization between PON1 and PON3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>). While PON1 expression did not discriminate non-relapsed and relapsed BC patient tissues, high PON3 expression correlated well with relapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). In addition, PON3 expression is increased in various drug-stressed cells and DR clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>). In Golgi/ER of H1993-GR, both PON3 and SLC35C1 RNAi, but not PON1 RNAi, inhibited PON1 fucosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref>), demonstrating that PON3 directs PON1 fucosylation prior to secretion. Similarly, PON1 RNAi was not sufficient to inhibit secretome PON1 fucosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Regardless, the same transient PON1 RNAi was sufficient to inhibit PON1 fucosylation in whole cell and cytoplasmic intracellular fractions of H1993-GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>), while stable PON1 RNAi via shRNA completely obliterated PON1 fucosylation to undetectable levels in both cellular fractions and secretome of a control PON1-expressing cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, only PON1 RNAi, not PON3 or SLC35C1 RNAi, impeded Golgi/ER-specific paraoxonase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref>), reflecting known differences between the two PONs in hydrolyzing paraoxon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Draganov et al., 2005</xref>). In a cross-linking GDP-Fuc activity assay, we showed that PON3 or SLC35C1 RNAi could ablate FUT8-directed transfer of fucose moiety from GDP-Fuc to N-glycan GlcNAc residue of PON1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q</xref>), implying direct functional regulation of PON1 fucosylation by PON3. Confirming the depletion of secretome PON1 fucosylation by a glycosidase, we showed that in the secretome, PON1 is de-N-glycosylated upon exogenous addition of PNGase F onto cultures of sensitive cells and DR clones but without marked changes in GDP-Fuc activity on PON1 in Golgi/ER or PON1 secretion in sensitive cells, DR clones, and cells engineered to overexpress PON1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2H–J</xref>).</p><p>As a preliminary attempt to functionally examine how PON1 core fucosylation is directly regulated by an interacting co-factor, we employed a technique in which immunoprecipitation of cross-linked PON1 and known PON1 activity regulators—PON3, von Willebrand factor (VWF), and myeloperoxidase (MPO)—from cell lysates or secretomes was performed in a multiplexed fashion on barcoded fluorescent beads (see Methods); and then further assayed for fucosylation and enzyme activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The degree of PON1 cross-linking with each of various other proteins was quantified using a PON1 antibody. Hinted by its strong co-expression with PON1 and functional implication on PON1 core fucosylation, EGFR-TKI-induced or EGFR-TKI resistance-associated abundance of PON1-interacting PON3 in whole cell lysates, golgi fractions, and secretomes are all linked with increased PON1 core fucosylation and PON1-bound core N-glycan enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). Similar signatures were observed with PON1-interacting VWF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>), at least in golgi fractions and secretomes of EGFR-TKI-treated cells and DR clones. While the plasma glycoprotein VWF has been associated with serum PON1 enzyme activity in various disease settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen, 2014</xref>), its direct regulatory effects on PON1 is yet to be explored. In contrast, MPO is associated with decreased PON1 interaction, decreased core fucosylation, and lesser PON1-bound N-glycans across EGFR-TKI-treated cells and DR clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). Although both PON1 and MPO are HDL-associated enzymes known to physically form ternary complexes with HDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2013</xref>), the results might reflect the contradicting oxidizing function of MPO as opposed to the antioxidant nature of PON1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, transcriptional control of both PON1 and PON3 by SREBP2, a master transcription factor (TF) for PON promoter activity, tightly regulate PON1-PON3 interaction and PON3-mediated PON1 core fucosylation in the golgi and secretomes of EGFR-TKI-treated cells and DR clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D and E</xref>). These data suggest that PON3’s regulatory effect on PON1 core fucosylation is dependent on its direct binding with PON1 and its effects on PON1 enzyme activity, and that direct control of PON3 is sufficient to regulate PON1 core fucosylation. Taken together, these results suggest that core fucosylated PON1 is a major component of the constitutive N-glycome of the cancer TIS and a signature of targeted therapy resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Core fucosylation enhances PON1 stability and prompts PON1 for secretion in therapy-resistant cancer cells</title><p>Given our prior knowledge on how systemic serum PON1 activity is diminished in LC patients and mouse model profiled with high serum PON1 fucosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aldonza et al., 2017</xref>), we hypothesized that therapy-induced protein glycosylation rewires the maturation steps of PON1 in the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). PON1 has 23 predicted N-glycosylation sites with four Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons–consensus amino acid sequences that determine N-glycosylation efficiency–all scored above the ‘high potential’ threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). PON1 is predicted to be mostly folded and has a negative net electrical charge (–16 at pH 7). All four sequons of PON1 (N227, N253, N270, N324) and their immediate vicinity have either neutral (0) or negative (ranging from –0.4––0.2) net charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Among the four sequons, N324(GT) and N270(IS) are well conserved throughout species while N253(WT) is uniquely conserved in mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Both N253(WT) and N324(GT) sequons are located in the outer region of PON1’s β-propeller structure while the other sequons are found in the innermost tunnel structure near the calcium-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Whether or not these indicate a preference for aberrant glycosylation remains an open question. Regardless, the net charge, polarity, and X amino acid (in Asn-X-Ser/Thr) of sequons and their vicinity can generate preferable environments for aberrant protein N-glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manwar Hussain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shakin-Eshleman et al., 1996</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Core fucosylation impacts PON1 folding and stability prior to secretion in therapy-resistant cancer cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hypothetical model of N-glycosylation control of PON1 stability.

We determined six aberrantly fucosylated glycans released from immunoprecipitated PON1, where GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>Man<sub>3</sub> + HexNAc<sub>2</sub>Fuc<sub>1</sub> putative glycan structures are commonly present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Two of the most abundant glycans (peaks 1 and 2) were identified to have high FUT8 substrate specificity, while the rest (peaks 3–6) have either low specificity or not yet identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, bottom; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">García-García et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tseng et al., 2017</xref>). To probe PON1 fucosylation in a site-specific manner, we introduced single-point mutation in two PON1 sequons [N253(WT) and N324(GT)]–predicted to display loss of N-glycosylation along with protein destabilization upon Asp→Gly mutation–and transfected the wild-type (WT) or mutant constructs into sensitive cells, DR clones, and PON1-edited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Both PON1 mutants selectively reduced PON1 core fucosylation and prevented efficient GDP-Fuc transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). Note that N253G displayed more robust effects than N324G. These mutants only had subtle effects on overall secretome N-glycosylation and did not alter gene expression of PON1, PON3, fucose salvage factors (FUK, GMD), GDP-fucose transporter (SLC35C1), and fucosylatransferase (FUT8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). WT or PON1 mutants did not have significant effects on the response of sensitive cells to EGFR-TKIs while both N253G and N324G mutants, not FL, sensitized both GR and ER clones to EGFR inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that PON1 fucosylation is a resistance selected mechanism.</p><p>To validate the predicted effects of N253G and N324G mutations on PON1 stability, we assayed PON1 folding and synthesis upon protein cleavage by trypsin or de novo protein synthesis inhibition by cycloheximide (CHX) treatment. Immunoblotting of whole GR clone lysates revealed that N253G remarkably promoted PON1 misfolding by completely sensitizing PON1 to cleavage by trypsin. N324G induced a noticeable PON1 cleavage only at a higher trypsin concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). In the Golgi/ER of GR clone, similar effects were also afforded on PON1 when tested using ELISA and on protein glycosylation after PON1 immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In Golgi/ER of A549 cells, where there is basal PON1 expression, N253G did not alter PON1’s sensitivity to trypsin. Conversely, the same mutation rendered PON1 from PON1-overexpressing cells sensitized to trypsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Furthermore, EGFR-TKI resistance or PON1 overexpression delayed the degradation of nascent polypeptides upon CHX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In the GR clone, N253G had no significant effect on overall protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). In addition, EGFR-TKI resistance delayed the degradation of total fucosylated proteins and Golgi-specific PON1-immunoprecipitated glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G and H</xref>). In the GR clone, N253G accelerated the degradation of the lower kDa isoform of PON1, presumably its fucosylated form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). More importantly, N253G significantly ablated PON1 secretion while N324G displayed a modest effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). Unexpectedly, N253G inhibited the intracellular arylesterase, but not paraoxonase, activity in GR clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>). This is consistent with our hypothesis that N-glycosylation of PON1 governs its enzyme activity. Taken together, our data suggest that core fucosylation promotes PON1 stability prior to secretion in DR clones and PON1-overexpressing cells. This offers an answer to our long-standing question of how fucosylation affords a more stable, degradation-resistant PON1 state in the secretion, which seems to involve a rewired enzyme activity.</p><p>To investigate the functional consequences of PON1-specific core fucosylation inhibition on TIS-driven therapy resistance, we performed similar PON3 RNAi and PON1 site-directed mutagenesis experiments in sensitive cells followed by 2D cell admixture assays using both sensitive cells and DR clones; and in mouse xenografts derived from our H1993-GR model subjected to EGFR-TKI therapy. Inhibition of PON1 core fucosylation via PON3 silencing or PON1-N253G mutation in sensitive cells significantly prevented the population expansion of DR clones in regressed cell admixtures at day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). More importantly, PON1-N253G markedly sensitized EGFR-TKI-resistant tumors in mice without observable weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>), and led to systemic decrease of both EGFR-TKI-induced serum PON1 core fucosylation and PON1-bound N-glycans in xenografted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Collectively, these consistently support our hypothesis that PON1 core fucosylation is a critical and functional component of the cancer TIS that promotes targeted therapy resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Blockade of secretome core fucosylation confines therapy resistance via UPR effectors and a pro-inflammatory niche</title><p>To generally address the mechanism by which TIS de-N-glycosylation prevents the rebound of DR clones in a regressing tumor model, we preliminarily employed a focused TF screen that mapped changes in 45 TF-driven intracellular signaling pathways using a dual-luciferase activity reporter array following a direct admixture assay. In a retrieved fraction of GR clone upon TIS de-N-glycosylation in 2D admixture, ER stress (ATF6), amino acid response (AAR element; ATF2, ATF3, ATF4), androgen receptor (AR) pathways, and E2F transcription were distinctively up-regulated, while stem cell factors (SOX2, NANOG, OCT4), interferon-stimulated response (ISR element; STAT1, STAT2), STAT3, and hypoxia (HIF) signaling were selectively repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

In a CM co-culture, both TIS de-N-glycosylation and fucosylated PON1 inhibition actively induced Golgi/ER-localized ATF6 with enriched co-localization with fucosylated scaffold residues in DR clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E and H</xref>), which probably implicates ER stress-induced translocation/sorting of ATF6 from ER to Golgi. Next, we asked whether these stress-induced responses are orchestrated with oxidative stress given the phenotypic response of cell admixtures to inhibition of TIS-specific PON1 fucosylation via PON1-N253G mutation. Indeed, de-N-glycosylating TIS and inhibiting TIS-specific fucosylated PON1 in regressing cell admixtures markedly stimulated the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), a hallmark of redox imbalance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I</xref>). In DR clones co-cultured in modified TIS with scarce PON1 fucosylation, silencing ATF6 prohibited the generation of intracellular ROS/RNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1J</xref>). In gefitinib-treated 3D cell admixtures, PON1-N253G-bearing sensitive cells restrained the growth of GR clone while ATF6 RNAi reverted this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). PON1-N253G promoted a pro-inflammatory environment in the same cell admixtures with increased levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and GM-CSF cytokines in the secretome while ATF6 RNAi antagonized this induced cytokine signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Meanwhile, de-N-glycosylation of the TIS or inhibition of TIS-specific fucosylated PON1 markedly induced ATF3 and ATF4—both of which contain an amino acid response element (AARE) in their promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ron and Walter, 2007</xref>) which was one of the hits identified from our TF screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>)—in DR clones but this effect is negligible in the golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Regardless, silencing ATF3 or ATF4 decreased intracellular ROS/RNS levels in DR clones co-cultured in modified TIS where fucosylated PON1 is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1L</xref>). These localization-specific effects of ATF6, ATF3, ATF4 can likely be explained by differences in their retention and translocation in ER-golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ron and Walter, 2007</xref>).</p><p>To assess in more detail how perturbations in PON1 fucosylation influence the growth of DR clones, we established cell models to differentially modify secretome PON1 fucosylation. When overexpressed at a high degree (&gt;700 fold) in cells without detectable PON1 (H460 and H1993), we observed an active PON1 fucosylation in the secretion. Stably knocking-out PON1 in wild-type PON1-expressing cells (A549) did not alter PON1 fucosylation intracellularly or in the secretion while stably knocking-out SLC35C1 in PON1-overexpressing cells led to suppression. Additionally, transfection of PON1-N253G construct or exogenous PNGase F treatment in PON1-overexpressing cells mitigated secretome PON1 fucosylation (summary in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Accordingly, modified cells with de-N-glycosylated secretome PON1 have increased ROS/RNS and a more pro-inflammatory secretome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K and L</xref>). More importantly, PON1 fucosylation-enriched TIS amplified the growth of GR and ER clones while cells with de-N-glycosylated PON1 prevented this growth coupled with increased intracellular caspase activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M and N</xref>). Furthermore, UPR target genes were consistently up-regulated in DR clones co-cultured with TIS or PON1-overexpressing cell secretomes with de-N-glycosylated PON1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1M</xref>).

In contrast to our TF-signaling screen performed on direct cell admixtures, this assay employs a CM co-culture set-up that is considerably more amenable to global profiling of genes driving the response to reactive secretomes. The similarity in gene expression profiles was observed in replicate samples and among conditions that represent control (H1993 and H460), positive fucosylation regulation (gefitinib-treated H1993 and H460-PON1), or negative PON1 fucosylation regulation (PNGase-treated and PON1-N253G-transfected H460-PON1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Secretome de-N-glycosylation and PON1 fucosylation inhibition led to 433 altered gene expression, and pathway analysis revealed that overlapped genes were enriched for negative regulators of the cell cycle and regulators of transcription and metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The same conditions generated a more down-regulated DR clone transcriptome associated with the regulation of receptor signaling pathways, cell communication, and cell proliferation, among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Enriched secretome fucosylation led to fewer differentially expressed genes that are mostly involved in cellular metabolic reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Only one overlapping altered gene was detected between the two conditions promoting secretome fucosylation (gefitinib treatment and PON1 overexpression; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To identify molecular drivers of the DR clone’s response to the suppression of secretome PON1 fucosylation, we integrated the data of differentially expressed genes in both PNGase F treatment and PON1-N253G transfection conditions.

We observed variable pan-cancer dependency signatures among the top 10 up- and down-regulated hits from our initial screen and found that only C19orf25 is denoted as ‘commonly essential’ in a pan-cancer ranking scheme. Regardless, many of these genes display high dependency scores in a fraction of cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). We then examined whether these dependency profiles correlate with drug sensitivity. Indeed, many of these gene dependencies strongly correlate with either a drug-sensitive or a drug-resistant state to inhibitors of EGFR or RTK signaling, albeit varied <italic>p</italic> values mainly due to different cancer lineages screened. Intriguingly, top overlapping up-regulated genes upon secretome de-N-glycosylation, and PON1 fucosylation inhibition mostly correlates with a drug-sensitive state, while the down-regulated genes are more associated with resistance to EGFR-TKIs or RTK inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Validating these results, their pan-cancer expression profiles also correlated with broadly similar drug sensitivity signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In large LC patient cohorts, high expression of two up-regulated gene hits, RPS27L and C19orf25, are correlated with increased first progression survival or RFS, while high expression of two down-regulated gene hits, DKK1 and THBS1, are associated with poor survival outcomes after therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We next investigated whether these hits are functionally implicated in the response of DR clones to TIS fucosylation by employing a CM co-culture assay where RFP-labeled, low-density DR clones were subjected to RNAi or lentiviral target gene overexpression followed by culture in modified TIS and then tracked overtime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Predominantly, RPS27L RNAi and DKK1 overexpression both displayed specific phenotypic responses to TIS de-N-glycosylation or TIS-specific fucosylated PON1 inhibition. In both modified TIS conditions, silencing RPS27L expression or overexpressing DKK1 promoted growth acceleration and EGFR-TKI resistance of DR clones reversing the supposed growth limitation and sensitization under such TIS modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). Further, both targeted approaches prevented senescence induction and stimulated TME-associated resistance genes upon de-N-glycosylation of TIS or inhibition of TIS-specific PON1 fucosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Collectively, our data indicate that modulatory genes controlling DR clone response to inhibited secretome PON1 fucosylation are functionally associated with drug sensitivity to targeted therapies and are potential therapeutic targets to limit DR clone outgrowth.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we identify a distinct N-glycome signature of the pan-cancer TIS. Using complementing fucosylation enrichment and detection approaches, we show that an induced secretome &lt;60 kDa protein fucosylation is systemically aberrant in cancer cells, tumor xenografts, and patients upon targeted therapy. This modification appeared to be selected during resistance evolution as cell-derived DR clones, DR clone-derived tumor xenografts, and relapsed cancer patients display the same secretome aberration. Counterintuitively, TIS marks both response and resistance to targeted therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Obenauf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Massagué and Obenauf, 2016</xref>). Subsequent regression of tumors and their TME in response to targeted therapy lead to the release of TIS that feeds the outgrowth of minority DR clones and survival of other cellular components (i.e., stromal cells) of the targeted microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Obenauf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Massagué and Obenauf, 2016</xref>). We reveal that core fucosylation of the TIS augments this effect. De-N-glycosylating the TIS by a glycosidase suppressed critical resistance-mediating survival cues and promoted a senescent state in regressing cell admixtures. Thereby glycans bound to N-glycosylated scaffolds of the TIS, not the released N-glycans per se, are required to establish a resistance-conferring niche. Mechanistically, directly blocking the transport of GDP-Fuc into Golgi or transfer of fucose onto proteins prevent the population rebound of remnant DR clones, encouraging a more drug-responsive cell population.</p><p>To date, there are 11 FUTs and two POFUTs known to catalyze fucose transfer from donor GDP-Fuc to various acceptor scaffolds such as glycoproteins and glycolipids, following Golgi-specific transport of GDP-Fuc by SLC35C1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blanas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schneider et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keeley et al., 2019</xref>). These enzymes can compete in a mutually exclusive fashion to synthesize glycans in the Golgi and are exploited during tumorigenesis. While previous studies have implicated FUTs in multidrug resistance in several cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keeley et al., 2019</xref>), there currently has no systemic analysis that describes the degree and scope of this connection. Mapping the pan-cancer pharmacogenomic profiles of these FUTs and SLC35C1 revealed that their expression broadly correlated with resistance to multiple targeted therapies while their inhibitory cues (i.e. promoter methylation and GDP-Fuc binding site mutations) are widely associated with a drug-sensitive state. We show that the FUK-SLC35C1-FUT8 core fucosylation axis is significantly correlated with patient relapse in both large and small patient cohorts. This fucose metabolism pathway appears to be a prerequisite in driving our observed secretome fucosylation in drug-stressed cells and DR clones. High-degree pan-cancer expression of FUT8 and its activity in the Golgi entail the substrate specificity of FUT8 in fucosylating scaffolds in the secretory pathway. In a much broader context, we corroborated this by showing that the gene set encoding for CCS components contains a subset of glycosylation genes that display increased expression signatures. We reveal that FUT8 or SLC35C1 can directly regulate the distinct &lt;60 kDa secretome fucosylation specifically in DR clones but not in sensitive cells. We note that &gt;100 kDa secretome fucosylation can effectively be mediated by either of the two factors in sensitive cells, uncovering differential target processing of core fucosylated products prior to their secretion.</p><p>Our discovery of PON1 fucosylation as a component of the pan-cancer TIS contextualizes its systemic regulation in cancer patients upon therapy. Our previous study along with others suggests a compelling serological biomarker potential for fucosylated PON1 in advanced SCLC and early HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aldonza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). While it is conceivable that overabundance of fucosylated PON1 in the secretion is due to overacting FUTs (i.e. FUT8) and fucose metabolic reactions in the liver, it does not provide an intuitive explanation for reduced serum PON1 level and restricted enzyme activity in multiple cancer patients and mouse models profiled previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2014</xref>) and in this study. This lack thereof has led us to examine how fucosylation influences the stability of PON1 prior to its secretion. Our data show that core fucosylation at a sequon located in the terminal region of the arylesterase domain, a conserved site among mammals, determines PON1 stability and assures proper folding prior to the secretion of PON1 from DR clones or PON1-overexpressing cells. This indicates that induction of the core fucosylation pathway rewires the maturation (i.e. folding) of PON1 along the secretory route, generating a more degradation-resistant PON1 with altered enzyme activity. We speculate that in disease states where there is an abundant serum fucosylation, non-fucosylated or less fucosylated PON1 cannot persist longer because of proteolytic insults in the blood. Among the three-member PON family, PON1 and PON3 are both secretory antioxidants bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and share considerable structural homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Draganov et al., 2005</xref>). Our data revealing PON3-mediated PON1 fucosylation in the Golgi hence establishes altered Golgi redox homeostasis prior to the secretion of proteins. We also showcased that such PON3-dependent PON1 fucosylation can be directed both at protein interaction and transcriptional control of PON3. Together with the data on VWF and MPO and the contrasting consequences of their interactions with PON1, it can be argued that regulation of PON1’s N-glycosylation state might depend on how interacting co-factors influence PON1 enzyme activity in the golgi or in secretion, at least in the setting of targeted therapy or resistance. Regardless, these are potential entry points to develop strategies to specifically control PON1 fucosylation independent of directly manipulating PON1, fucose salvage pathway, or GDP-fucose processing and attachment, all of which have physiological importance in non-disease states.</p><p>Indeed, our pathway-focused screen on cell admixtures reveals that defective secretome PON1 fucosylation in the TIS promotes the expression of TFs that regulate response to oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory niche and repression of hypoxia in a suppressed DR clone. Concurrently, our transcriptome-wide analysis in a CM co-culture setting demonstrates that genes negatively regulating the response to stimulus and inflammatory signals, and cell communication act as modulators upon inhibition of secretome PON1 fucosylation. Thus, targeted strategies to control them might limit therapy resistance.</p><p>To this end, we report an aberrant signature of secretome core fucosylation functionally associated with multi-targeted therapy resistance in different cancer lineages. Our study highlights the fucosylation of PON1 as a component of a complex, reactive secretome induced upon targeted therapy and in turn stimulates resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This proof-of-concept study underscores new insights into the biological basis of cancer recurrence. We acknowledge that while our findings are all reproducible, they still require further validation, perhaps using appropriate patient-derived models. Regardless, the generality of our findings implicates that targetable aberration in secretome fucosylation and modulatory factors controlling response to this niche should be considered in managing clinical cancer relapse.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic summary of the model proposed in this study.</title><p>Drug-sensitive cancer cells responding to kinase inhibitors induce a core fucosylated, complex secretome of mostly &lt;60 kDa proteins stimulating the clonal expansion of DR cancer cells, potentially contributing to disease relapse. Secretome core fucosylation is driven by the fucose salvage-SLC35C1-FUT8 axis. Among such secreted proteins that are heavily core fucosylated is the antioxidant PON1. Prior to secretion, PON1 is differentially fucosylated at multiple sites with the sequon at N253 critical for protein folding and stability. PON1 core fucosylation is tightly regulated by PON3 in the golgi, resulting to a more stable, degradation-resistant PON1 with a rewired enzyme activity in the secretion. Minority DR clones respond to the globally fucosylated TIS or core fucosylated secretome PON1 via activation of TF and gene effectors important for UPR, cell communication regulation and inflammatory niche neutralization.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75191-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data reporting and statistics</title><p>No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.

The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 8 min at RT, quenched for 1 min in 10 mM Tris (in PBS) at RT, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 (in PBS). Cells were then blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (in PBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100) for 30 min at RT and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 2% BSA for 2 h. Alexa Fluor or fluorescein isothiocyanate–conjugated secondary antibodies were used to label primary antibodies. DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; 0.35 μg/ml) was used to counterstain the nuclei. Cells were mounted using VECTASHIELD Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories). Confocal microscopy was carried out using a ZEISS LSM 780 ApoTome microscope (Carl Zeiss). Primary antibodies used for immunofluorescence were PON1 (ab24261, Abcam), PON3 (ab42322, Abcam), ATF6 (PA5-20215, Invitrogen), RCAS1 (12290, CST), and XBP1 (ab37152, Abcam).</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Human or mouse FFPE tumor tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene alternative (Histo-Clear, EMS; 3×5 min) and rehydrated in EtOH/H2O gradient series (100%, 95%, 70%, 40%, 5 min each). The rehydrated sections were washed in TBS for 10 min. Epitopes were unmasked using the heat-induced retrieval method with the use of the pre-heated Tris (10 mM Tris base, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0) and citrate buffers (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0). Sections were pressure-cooked for 12 min in Tris buffer, transferred to citrate buffer, heated for 12 min, cooled at RT for 40 min, and washed with TBS containing 0.1% Twee-20 for 10 min. Sections were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in TBS for 45 min and washed in TBS (2×5 min). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched in a peroxidase solution (0.3% H2O2 in TBS), and sections were blocked in a universal blocking solution (10% normal donkey serum in 1% BSA/TBS) or carbo-free blocking solution (for fucosylation detection) for 2 h. Slides were blotted to remove the serum, and then primary antibodies were applied at predetermined concentrations (1:400 or 1:800). Slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber and washed with TBS (3×5 min). Biotinylated link and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied onto sections and were incubated for 2 hr in a dark humidified chamber RT followed by washing. Replicate slides were also stained H&amp;E (Vector Labs) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A VECTASHIELD hard-set mounting medium (Vector Labs) was used to mount the slides.

Excised gels were partitioned into tubes, and destained multiple times in 75 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma) and 40% EtOH (1:1) in a shaking rack. Destained gel pieces were washed with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile (1:1), vortexed, and incubated at RT for 15 min. Gel pieces were diluted with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol at 51 °C for 1 hr. Gel pieces were cooled down to RT for 30 min followed by alkylation with 20 mM of iodoacetamide at RT for 45 min in the dark. Gel pieces were dehydrated in 100% acetonitrile and dried in a SpeedVac. In-gel proteins were digested with trypsin at a protein:enzyme ratio of 20:1 at 37 °C for 12 hr in a shaking incubator. Peptides were extracted in 100 µL extraction buffer (5% acetic acid/acetonitrile; 1:2) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in a shaking incubator.

Briefly, nanospray liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron) coupled to Agilent 1200 series G1312B binary pump SL and NanoLC AS-2 autosampler (Eksigent Technologies). Peptide mixtures (2 µL per sample) were loaded via the autosampler on 75 µm (inner diameter) fused silica capillary columns with electrospray tip packed with C18 reversed-phase resin (Magic C18, 5 µm particles, 200 Å pore size; Michrom BioResources). Peptides were separated by reversed-phase liquid chromatography with mobile phases as we described previously. The tandem mass spectra were processed using Sorcerer 3.4 beta2 (Sorcerer Web interface). All MS/MS samples were analyzed using SEQUEST Cluster (Thermo Scientific), and Mascot generic format (MGF) files were set to query the human IPI v3.68 database. Searches were performed with and without oxidation of methionine and carbamidomethyl modification of cysteine as variable modifications. False positives and false discovery rates were calibrated through the decoy option during data search in Sorcerer to reduce noise effects. Scaffold v4.0.5 (Proteome Software) was used to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identification. PeptideProphet was used to validate peptide and protein assignments to MS/MS spectra (&gt;95% probability). Subtractive proteomic analysis for each dataset was performed by normalization using total ion current (TIC; normalized by average of all the TIC values of the spectra assigned to a protein). MS RAW files were processed in MaxQuant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>), version 1.5.5.2.

Raw paired-end sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome (build hg38) with HISAT2 v2.1.0 using default parameters except with the options ‘--dta’ and ‘--dta-cufflinks’. Stringtie v.2.0.6 was used to quantify the expression of genes and transcripts by employing transcriptome information from GENCODE v27. Ballgown package was used to perform differential gene expression analysis generating FPKM for each gene. Genes with FDR &lt;0.05, fold change larger than 2 or smaller than 0.7-fold, and average read counts larger than 10 were treated as differentially expressed genes. Gene ontology analysis was performed using DAVID 6.8. GO of biological process or molecular function were detected and summarized. GO terms with <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01 were selected as significant. Semantic-similarity network visualization of GO terms was done using REVIGO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.revigo.irb.hr">http://www.revigo.irb.hr</ext-link>).

Drug sensitivity data were evaluated using IC50 values (including extrapolated values) for GDSC and activity area for CCLE. Correlation analysis between drug response and gene expression per cancer type was performed by quantitatively matching pre-processed values. All Spearman’s correlation coefficients, relative quantitation, and plotting were performed in Python (see code availability). Only correlations with p&lt;0.05 are shown.

Glycosylation (N-/O-glycosylation) gene sets were obtained by conducting gene set analysis using the GOs ‘glycosylation’, ‘protein N-linked glycosylation’, and ‘protein O-linked glycosylation’ from MSigDB. The GO ‘glycosylation’ contains 22 annotated sub-GOs. These gene sets were used in their complete form and were not filtered. Both total and overlapping glycosylation genes (n=264 or 19 for overall glycosylation, n=81 or 1 for N-linked, and n=193 or 18 for O-linked) with the CCS gene set were included in the analysis. For CCS, missing values on FC_2 were removed, and 0 was considered as a missing value. p Values were calculated by two-sided Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test and adjusted (p<sub>adj</sub>) to control for FDR using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and YM Dennis Lo as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yatrik M Shah (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were uniformly positive about the work and the impact that it would have in the cancer field. There were however several concerns raised that should be addressed.</p><p>1) A more complete explanation of how targeted therapies increase PON1 fucosylation to drive treatment resistance.</p><p>2) Formatting of the data and data presentation should be improved as discussed by both reviewers 1 and 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The authors widely use dot-scatterplot figures to represent their data, however, this representation is not easily interpreted by readers not used to reading these datasets (vs heatmaps). Additionally, sometimes these plots are overused (could be represented in a simpler format), or data is not sufficiently explained in the text or figure legends.</p><p>– Given the density of data, and mixed results of sensitivity/resistance, it may be better to move some of the data from Figure 1 to the supplement, and highlight the key information needed for readers (Figure 1B).</p><p>– For blots, samples to be compared direction should be run on the same blot (Figure 1F, for example), and sometimes the blot separation is not clearly indicated (Figure 3H, 4G). Coomassie blue staining in the supplemental figure shows higher staining in the treated samples than the untreated indicating potential for unequal loading, though as they are on separate blots, it's difficult to assess.</p><p>– In Figure 4, WT would be a more appropriate term for the control (as all proteins are full length, truncating mutants are not used) and graphs labeled with the construct names (WT, N253G, or N324G) instead of 1, 2, 3 would enhance clarity for readers.</p><p>– The transition from Figure 5 to Figure 6 is confusing. The authors already showed that UPR/ATF6 could phenocopy their findings, yet they jump back into another omics approach, which did not seem linked to the previous figure.</p><p>– Figure 7 (mechanism schematic) needs a legend and explanation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Detailed comments:</p><p>Figure 1: 1.A – FUT4 is missing in the GDSC data set, please clarify if it is not present in the data set/what happened.</p><p>1.D – The study on DNA methylation of these FUTs seems to be out of context. The study focuses the N-glycome in the secretome, which is a phenomenon at protein level. Although altered fucosylation-related gene expression could result from a number of different reasons, it is not clear why looking at the methylation status is so important here, please justify further.</p><p>1.F – There seems to be a decrease in the AAL level in the 60-180 KDa range in the drug treated samples, is there any explanation as to why drug treatment decreased fucosylation of higher molecular weight proteins? The non-treated and drug-treated patient samples should have been run on the same gel. It is unclear how much of the fucosylation-increased/decreased regions of the blots are due to differential gel running conditions. Moreover, the quality of these blots is insufficient for publication and should be run again and imaged at lower exposures. The same issue applies for the blots in Figure 2E.</p><p>Figure 2: 2.B – At 00.00 why is the total cell number or spheroid size different in the control vs gefitinib groups? Please clarify if this is a timepoint at a few days after drug treatment; if this is the case, please show the untreated control.</p><p>Figure 3: 3.H – The blots shown here are insufficient quality for publication. All of the samples should be shown on the same blot. Please show the PON1 and AAL blot separately; it's not clear if lane 17- 20 actually has PON1 band or if it's just AAL. Furthermore, as this is an IP experiment, blots showing input and loading controls are required. 3.J: It is well established that protein glycosylation occurs in Golgi/ER, so it is unclear what this figure adds to this study. 3. (O-Q) show that PON1 fucosylation requires PON3 but how is unclear. The authors should provide further explanation for the mechanistic role of PON3.</p><p>Figure 4: The authors compare the effects of WT vs. N253/324G mutants in vitro; the authors should use the same cell lines in an in vivo model to delineate the contributions to therapeutic resistance.</p><p>Figure 5: The authors focused on ATF6 only but is it possible that ATF 3 and 4 might also play a role in combination to 6 since all these are known to play a role in stress response and based on 3.C the fold change differences between these 3 is not that much. The story of ATF6 is not robust here and it feels like it's not adding much to the big picture of the paper.</p><p>Figure 6: This figure shows just the superficial screening of how is secreted fucosylated PON1 working, it would have been better if the authors provided some validation of the transcriptomics signature they saw. The validation of downstream mechanism would strengthen the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript through several unbiased analyses identifies a fucosylation secretome which is altered in drug resistant cancer cells. Moreover, the authors identify PON1 fucosylation as essential for drug sensitivity to targeted therapies. This is highly data rich manuscript that provides an interesting mechanism of drug resistance. The work provides a very precise role of the tumor secretome during drug resistance and relies on not only unbiased cell line assays, but also large cancer databases and human patient data. The major issue with the manuscript is that it is a very difficult manuscript to read and follow. Some of this is due to the sheer amount of data, but also how it is presented and described. In addition, the major experimental concern is the lack of direct evidence that indeed alteration in tumor oxidative stress and inflammation are critical downstream pathways by which PON1 mediates drug resistance.</p><p>– The data mining approach to implicate fucosylation in drug resistance is string in Figure 1, however the functional data to demonstrate an increase in fucosylation following TKIs and DR clones is not supported by the data (Figure 1L and M).</p><p>– Not very clear why PON1 fucosylation is not lower after PON1 siRNA (Figure 3P).</p><p>– More details are needed for figure 5A, it's not very clear what the assay measures. I think in general this is a major issue with the manuscript that most conclusions are made using unbiased approaches but the details on how the data was generated is lacking. Makes the figures very difficult to interpret.</p><p>– It is not clear if PON1 fucosylation-induced therapy resistance is an essential mechanism in vivo.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75191.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The authors widely use dot-scatterplot figures to represent their data, however, this representation is not easily interpreted by readers not used to reading these datasets (vs heatmaps).

Following the reviewer’s request, we moved select data (N-glycan release assay and MWCO-sandwich ELLA assay data) to Figure 1 supplements (Figure 1—figure supplement 5) and reorganized Figure 1 so we could highlight three important findings aside from the results of large-scale pharmacogenomics data analysis: (I) consistent specific signatures of fucosylated TIS and DS clone secretomes in lung cancer (LC) patients and pan-cancer cell models; (II) overall abundance and biomarker potential of fucosylated proteins in sera of LC patients that underwent osimertinib therapy and in tissues of sequential therapy-relapsed LC patients (Figure 1K); and (III) specificity of our observed core fucosylation signatures in the context of the secretory process—both in the golgi prior to secretion and in the secretion (Figure 1L and M). We believe the revised Figure 1 emphasize these findings better also considering the substantial amount of data that support the main findings (12 separate figure supplements for Figure 1 alone).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For blots, samples to be compared direction should be run on the same blot (Figure 1F, for example), and sometimes the blot separation is not clearly indicated (Figure 3H, 4G).

First, we should note that all patient sera samples were originally ran on a single midi-SDS-PAGE gel format but were incised prior to AAL and HRP-streptavidin incubations (incisions and original membranes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><p>We added text to indicate this and highlight the blot incisions clearly in the figure description. We replaced the original incised Coomassie blue stain gel for patient sera with a replicate uncut stained midi-gel scanned in a ChemiDoc instead of a printer scanner (Figure 1—figure supplement 4A). In an effort to replicate this in a single mini-SDS-PAGE gel format, we performed additional AAL enrichment and AAL blotting from select similar patient sera samples in Figure 1G (Figure 1—figure supplement 4B). Due to insufficient amounts of the remaining patient serum samples required for enrichments, we were unable to re-process the rest of the samples presented in Figure 1G. Regardless, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, the marked enrichment signature of 30~60 kDa serum protein fucosylation in osimertinib cohort can still be observed albeit the relatively poor quality of the blot and samples. We should note that the serum samples have been in our -80C deep freezer storage for over 5 years since the time we received them from the hospital and have experienced multiple freeze-thaw cycles. These factors could account for the poorer quality of AAL blots.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75191-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 4, WT would be a more appropriate term for the control (as all proteins are full length, truncating mutants are not used) and graphs labeled with the construct names (WT, N253G, or N324G) instead of 1, 2, 3 would enhance clarity for readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

The authors already showed that UPR/ATF6 could phenocopy their findings, yet they jump back into another omics approach, which did not seem linked to the previous figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s criticism. The experimental goals and co-culture setup to model and modify the TIS-driven expansion of resistant clones are different between Figure 5 and 6. In Figure 5, we aim to address the general mechanism of limited DR clone expansion via TIS de-N-glycosylation by an active PNGase F applied on a direct admixture setup. In this context, we reason that a focused TF screen covering 45 TF-driven intracellular signaling is appropriate to tease out signaling drivers of the DR clones’ response to the expansion-limiting condition. We exhaustively validated the results of the screen in both admixture and CM co-culture set-up, with additional data as a result of this revision (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>In Figure 6, we aim to broadly identify resistance-associated modulator genes important for the response of DR clones to the secretomes with altered N-glycosylation relevant to both global secretome N-glycosylation and PON1-specific N-glycosylation (core fucosylation). In this context, we reason that a transcriptome-wide analysis is more appropriate to profile modulator genes in an unbiased manner. As a result of the revision, we also validated the results of RNAseq assays via qPCR and performed additional functional assays to evaluate the effects of RNA-seq hits in our models (Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and 3).</p><p>So as not to confuse the readers and improve interpretations, we added texts in the Results and Discussion sections to highlight these differences in terms of experimental goals and set-ups, and mention the overall insights gained from these approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 7 (mechanism schematic) needs a legend and explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this.

Indeed, FUT4 data is not present in the GDSC dataset, in both the old and updated versions. We added text in the figure description to mention this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.D – The study on DNA methylation of these FUTs seems to be out of context. The study focuses the N-glycome in the secretome, which is a phenomenon at protein level. Although altered fucosylation-related gene expression could result from a number of different reasons, it is not clear why looking at the methylation status is so important here, please justify further.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for asking this important question. There is a growing body of evidence that alterations in glycosylation events and signatures at the protein level are influenced by tight regulation of glycosylation-related genes, such as those that encode for glycoenzymes (such as FUTs), by DNA methylation and other epigenetic mechanisms in disease contexts such as cancer. Since the RRBS data we used for analysis are from CCLE, we made the attempt to test this connection and correlate with drug sensitivity data from CCLE and GDSC. In many cases, FUT methylation profiles contradicted the correlation between FUT gene expression and drug resistance signatures in aggregate. Therefore, we reason that the signatures we found between FUT expression and drug sensitivity can be further supported by the signatures we found between FUT promoter methylation and drug sensitivity, strengthening the potential biological relevance. We added texts in the Results section to highlight this including a key reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.F – There seems to be a decrease in the AAL level in the 60-180 KDa range in the drug treated samples, is there any explanation as to why drug treatment decreased fucosylation of higher molecular weight proteins? The non-treated and drug-treated patient samples should have been run on the same gel. It is unclear how much of the fucosylation-increased/decreased regions of the blots are due to differential gel running conditions. Moreover, the quality of these blots is insufficient for publication and should be run again and imaged at lower exposures. The same issue applies for the blots in Figure 2E.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point and the technical issue on AAL blots. First, because of the varying signatures we have observed in AAL blots, even after independent repetitions, from both patient sera and cell-derived secretomes in terms of the &gt;60 or &gt;100 kDa fucosylation signatures we did not have the confidence to draw conclusions from them, unlike in the case of the consistent and striking differential 30~60 kDa fucosylation signatures we observed in both patient sera and cell-derived secretomes. Similarly, in our new AAL blots from mouse models, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the &gt;60 or &gt;100 kDa fucosylation other than the strong 30~60 kDa fucosylation signatures. In our quantitative measurements via sandwich ELLA, we only observed signatures of decreased &gt;100 kDa in cellderived TIS and DR clone secretomes but not in patient and mouse serum samples (Figure 1— figure supplement 10C and Figure 1—figure supplement 11E). Regardless, we now highlighted this and offered an outlook in the Results section.</p><p>Regarding the AAL blot of patient samples, we should note that the samples were originally ran on a single midi-SDS-PAGE gel format but were incised prior to AAL and HRP-streptavidin incubations (incisions and original membranes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We replaced the incised CBBstained midi SDS-PAGE gel where we ran the original samples with a replicate uncut midi gel (Figure 1—figure supplement 4A). Unfortunately, we were only able to enrich and re-run select patient samples on a single mini-format as other samples had insufficient amounts for AAL enrichment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, the marked enrichment signature of 30~60 kDa serum protein fucosylation in osimertinib cohort can still be observed albeit the relatively poor quality of the blot and samples. We should note that the serum samples have been in our -80C deep freezer storage for over 5 years since the time we received them from the hospital and have experienced multiple freeze-thaw cycles.

While AAL blotting of AALenriched patient sera and cell secretomes have been very challenging in terms of acquiring clean blots (as described above), we observed much cleaner blots when performing AAL blotting after PON1 immunoprecipitation. As suggested, we re-assayed select patient serum samples for PON1 immunoprecipitation and downstream AAL blotting and PON1 immunoblotting which now include proper input and loading controls aside from separate blot detection of AAL and PON1 (Figure 3H). We also added text in the Results section to describe N-glycosylation differences between the two secreted PON1 isoforms observed (~55 and ~45 kDa). We moved the original AAL blot after PON1 immunoblotting to the figure supplement (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.J: It is well established that protein glycosylation occurs in Golgi/ER, so it is unclear what this figure adds to this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this criticism. In our previous study (Aldonza et al., 2017), we observed that PON1 has both nuclear and cytoplasmic isoforms in cancer cells. Although it can be obvious that PON1 is processed in the golgi since it is a secreted protein, our current data is the first to show that PON1 is actively present in the golgi and that it is core fucosylated in the golgi prior to secretion, at least in the context of targeted therapy and resistance. This is important to specify that golgi-specific isoform of PON1 is heavily fucosylated than the cytoplasmic and nuclear isoforms (Figure 3K), since nuclear proteins can also be glycosylated. This piece of data can also be connected to our observation of increased overall core fucosylation and enrichment of the fucosylated 30~60 kDa proteins in the golgi of drug-treated cells and DR clones (Figure 1L and M).</p><p>Reference: Aldonza MBD, Son YS, Sung H, Ahn JM, Choi Y, Kim Y, Cho S, Cho J (2017) Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) induces metastatic potential and apoptosis escape via its antioxidative function in lung cancer cells Oncotarget 8:42817-42835.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. (O-Q) show that PON1 fucosylation requires PON3 but how is unclear. The authors should provide further explanation for the mechanistic role of PON3.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important question. Given the known strong regulatory effect of PON3 on PON1’s enzyme activity and our data pointing to the rewired enzyme activity of PON1 when core fucosylated (Figure 4M and Figure 4—figure supplement 1I), we first speculated that regulation of PON1 enzyme activity might be relevant for the aberrant PON1 core fucosylation. To test this, we employed known regulators of PON1 enzyme activity and potential PON1-interacting proteins (PON3, VWF, and MPO), subjected them to multiplex cross-linking co-immunoprecipitation with PON1, and performed relevant downstream assays to evaluate interaction and effects on PON1 levels and PON1-specific core fucosylation (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A). The results, now described in the Results section, showed that PON1-bound positive regulators of PON1 enzyme activity (PON3 and VWF) have stronger interaction with PON1 in drug-treated cells and DR clones than untreated cells, while PON1bound negative regulator of PON1 enzyme activity (MPO) has lesser interaction with PON1 in drug-treated cells and DR clones than untreated cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B). These changes in interaction with PON1 are also more pronounced in the golgi fraction and secretomes than in the whole cell fractions. More importantly, PON1-bound positive regulators of PON1 enzyme activity (PON3 and VWF) strongly promoted PON1 core fucosylation while PON1-bound negative regulator of PON1 enzyme activity (MPO) de-N-glycosylated PON1 (Figure 3—figure supplement 3C). These data hint to the possibility that PON3’s regulatory effects on PON1 core fucosylation might be dependent on its effect on PON1 enzyme activity.</p><p>Next, we wanted to test whether transcriptional regulation of PON3 is sufficient to direct PON3PON1 interaction and PON3-dependent PON1 core fucosylation. Indeed, transcriptional control of PON3 by SREBP2, a master transcription factor (TF) for PON promoter activity, tightly regulate PON1-PON3 interaction and PON3-mediated PON1 core fucosylation in the golgi and secretomes of drug-treated cells and DR clones (Figure 3—figure supplement 3D and E). We now added these details in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: The authors compare the effects of WT vs. N253/324G mutants in vitro; the authors should use the same cell lines in an in vivo model to delineate the contributions to therapeutic resistance.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important request. As suggested, we performed an in vivo xenograft study using PON1-WT and PON1-N253G cell lines (Figure 4—figure supplement 3). PON1-N253G markedly sensitized EGFR-TKI-resistant tumors in mice without observable weight loss (Figure 4—figure supplement 3A and B), and led to systemic decrease of both EGFR-TKI-induced serum PON1 core fucosylation and PON1-bound Nglycans in xenografted mice (Figure 4—figure supplement 3C). These in vivo data strongly corroborate our results in vitro. We now added these details in the Results section.</p><p>Additional in vivo studies were also performed to validate key findings presented in Figure 1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 11 and 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: The authors focused on ATF6 only but is it possible that ATF 3 and 4 might also play a role in combination to 6 since all these are known to play a role in stress response and based on 3.C the fold change differences between these 3 is not that much. The story of ATF6 is not robust here and it feels like it's not adding much to the big picture of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We agree that aside from ATF6, checking the potential roles of ATF3 and ATF4 in this context is important. We performed additional experiments to check whether ATF3 and ATF4 are important in the intracellular response of DR clones to growth-limiting effects of the globally de-N-glycosylated TIS or inhibited TIS-specific PON1 fucosylation by employing the similar experimental set-up we used to assay ATF6 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1E). TIS de-N-glycosylation or inhibition of TISspecific fucosylated PON1 markedly induced ATF3 and ATF4—both of which contain an amino acid response element (AARE) in their promoters which was one of the hits identified from our TF screen (Figure 5A)—in DR clones but this effect is negligible in the golgi (Figure 5—figure supplement 1K). Regardless, silencing ATF3 or ATF4 decreased intracellular ROS/RNS levels in DR clones co-cultured in modified TIS where fucosylated PON1 is inhibited (Figure 5—figure supplement 1L). These localization-specific effects of ATF6, ATF3, and ATF4 can likely be explained by differences in their retention and translocation in ER-golgi. We now added these details in the Results section. We believe that our validation assays provide a strong suite of preliminary data in characterizing the roles of ATF6 and UPR-associated phenotypes and so are important in contextualizing the result of the focused TF screen in this context. As mentioned by the reviewer, we recognize that such data are not robust enough to deeply elucidate the biology of how UPR and ATF6 facilitate the response of the DR clones to the growth-limiting effects of the de-N-glycosylated TIS or inhibited TIS-specific PON1 core fucosylation. As such, we acknowledge this in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6: This figure shows just the superficial screening of how is secreted fucosylated PON1 working, it would have been better if the authors provided some validation of the transcriptomics signature they saw.

As suggested, we performed qPCR assay to validate the gene expression of top RNA-seq hits, both the upregulated and downregulated DEGs, in our models (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A). The results strongly corroborated the transcriptomics signatures.</p><p>In addition, we investigated whether these hits are functionally implicated in the response of DR clones to TIS fucosylation by employing a CM co-culture assay where RFP-labeled, low-density DR clones were subjected to RNAi or lentiviral target gene overexpression followed by culture in modified TIS and then tracked overtime (Figure 6—figure supplement 3A). Predominantly, RPS27L RNAi and DKK1 overexpression both displayed specific phenotypic responses to TIS de-N-glycosylation or TIS-specific fucosylated PON1 inhibition. In both modified TIS conditions, silencing RPS27L expression or overexpressing DKK1 promoted growth acceleration and EGFR-TKI resistance of DR clones reversing the supposed growth limitation and sensitization under such TIS modifications (Figure 6—figure supplement 3B and C). Further, both targeted approaches prevented senescence induction and stimulated TME-associated resistance genes upon de-N-glycosylation of TIS or inhibition of TIS-specific PON1 fucosylation (Figure 6—figure supplement 3D). We believe that these data strengthen our results especially in indicating that modulatory genes controlling DR clone response to inhibited secretome PON1 fucosylation are functionally associated with drug sensitivity to targeted therapies and are potential therapeutic targets to limit DR clone outgrowth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript through several unbiased analyses identifies a fucosylation secretome which is altered in drug resistant cancer cells. Moreover, the authors identify PON1 fucosylation as essential for drug sensitivity to targeted therapies. This is highly data rich manuscript that provides an interesting mechanism of drug resistance. The work provides a very precise role of the tumor secretome during drug resistance and relies on not only unbiased cell line assays, but also large cancer databases and human patient data. The major issue with the manuscript is that it is a very difficult manuscript to read and follow. Some of this is due to the sheer amount of data, but also how it is presented and described. In addition, the major experimental concern is the lack of direct evidence that indeed alteration in tumor oxidative stress and inflammation are critical downstream pathways by which PON1 mediates drug resistance.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging the strengths and detailing the weaknesses of our study. As the result of the revision, new data were added to strengthen specific conclusions (summarized at the beginning) and provide insights as to how PON1 core fucosylation is regulated, both directly and indirectly, and how modulator genes control the response of DR clones to the N-glycosylated TIS or TIS-specific core fucosylated PON1.</p><p>We also re-organized Figure 1 (having the most figure panels) and moved some panels to the figure supplements so only main results are highlighted in the main figure. We also subdivided some select figure supplements for Figure 1, 3, and 4 to enhance the flow and interpretability of the figures, especially as to how they relate to their respective main figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The data mining approach to implicate fucosylation in drug resistance is string in Figure 1, however the functional data to demonstrate an increase in fucosylation following TKIs and DR clones is not supported by the data (Figure 1L and M).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s criticism. The reviewer referenced the AAL blots from secretomes of TKI-treated cells and DR clones (now in Figure 1H and I). It is difficult to draw an overall “increase” or “decrease” signatures from these blots considering the technical, nonquantitative nature of the lectin blotting assay. Therefore, we focused on the differential protein size-specific signatures we can clearly observe from these lectin blots across cell secretomes, patient sera, and mouse sera. We should note that in several cases, in areas (i.e., specific kDa range) where there is an observed overabundance of glycosylated proteins, it is very challenging to perfectly image the whole blots without avoiding the appearance of “white smears” which could be caused by fast consumption of substrate causing absorption of very little light during detection. An example of this is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>. We observed this even in cases where we exposed the blots for a very short amount of time (&lt;5 seconds) and loaded relatively few amounts of samples (&lt;2 ug of enriched sera or &lt;10 ug of enriched cell secretomes). In such cases, people usually crop the regions they would like to highlight, but we thought presenting the full blot regions is more appropriate in this case.</p><p>After countless troubleshooting from sampling to detection, the representative blots shown in our figures were relatively of best quality. We should also note that despite these technical challenges, the differential 30~60 kDa protein fucosylation signature across cell secretomes, patient sera, and mouse sera were consistently observed and unaffected. Therefore, as to not be limited by the results we derive from these lectin blots, we extensively validated both the overall abundance and the differential size-signatures via total or MWCO sampling followed by conducting relevant downstream assays such as sandwich ELLA and N-glycan release assays, both of which were developed in-house.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75191-sa2-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Not very clear why PON1 fucosylation is not lower after PON1 siRNA (Figure 3P).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for mentioning this result. The mentioned data points to the HLE analysis of PON1 fucosylation in the Golgi/ER fractions of H1993-GR clones upon PON1 siRNA. We got curious as to why the transient PON1 RNAi was not sufficient to inhibit PON1 fucosylation in the Golgi/ER. We assayed the same DR clones upon PON1 RNAi and measured PON1 fucosylation in the whole cell and cytoplasmic intracellular fractions and in cell secretome. Interestingly, while siPON1 was sufficient enough to significantly decrease PON1 fucosylation intracellularly, it was not sufficient to inhibit secretome PON1 fucosylation, corroborating our data on Golgi/ER (Figure 3—figure supplement 2F). Regardless, in a control A549 cell line, which relative expresses PON1 at high levels, stable PON1 RNAi via shRNA led to complete inhibition of PON1 fucosylation in cellular fractions and secretome (Figure 3— figure supplement 2F).
