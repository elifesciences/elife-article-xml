central axon, with different regenerative abilities. Whereas peripheral DRG axons regenerate, central axons are unable to regrow. Central axon regeneration can however be elicited by a prior conditioning lesion to the peripheral axon. How DRG axon asymmetry is established remains unknown. Here we developed a rodent in vitro system replicating DRG pseudo-unipolarization and asymmetric axon regeneration. Using this model, we observed that from early development, central DRG axons have a higher density of growing microtubules. This asymmetry was also present in vivo and was abolished by a conditioning lesion that decreased microtubule polymerization of central DRG axons. An axon-specific microtubule-associated protein (MAP) signature, including the severases spastin and katanin and the microtubule regulators CRMP5 and tau, was found and shown to adapt upon conditioning lesion. Supporting its significance, interfering with the DRG MAP signature either in vitro or in vivo readily abolished central-peripheral asymmetries in microtubule dynamics and regenerative ability. In summary, our data unveil that axon-specific microtubule regulation drives asymmetric regeneration of sensory neuron axons.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>When nerves in our body are damaged, their ability to repair themselves depends on where they are. Some nerves, like those in the arms and legs, can heal, while the ones in the spinal cord cannot. This difference is particularly striking in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, which have a unique structure. Unlike other neurons, which transmit signals along a single long projection called an axon, DRG neurons branch into two axons – one connecting to the body and the other to the spinal cord. While the branch leading to the body can heal, the one connecting to the spinal cord is unable to regenerate.</p><p>It is not clear how DRG neurons develop axons with these differing abilities. Researchers have found that an injury to the body side branch, known as the peripheral axon, can stimulate regrowth in the stretch leading to the spinal cord, known as the central axon. The damage increases the transport of molecules along both axons, boosting the repair of the whole neuron. This suggests that microtubules, the internal highways for transporting materials through cells, may contribute to the difference between the regenerative ability of the two axons of the DRG neuron.</p><p>To explore this, Costa et al. studied DRG neurons grown in the laboratory and rodents. Powerful microscopes revealed that the central axons contain more actively growing microtubules than the peripheral axons. However, when the peripheral axon was damaged, the central axon reduced microtubule growth, making it more capable of regeneration. Costa et al. also identified that injury caused changes in levels of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), which regulate microtubule behaviour. Reducing the amount of one of these MAPs prevented axon repair in both cell cultures and animal models.</p><p>These findings help explain why some nerve fibres regenerate while others do not, highlighting the role of microtubules in this process. Further research is needed to determine whether targeting MAPs may lead to new treatments for spinal cord injury or other nervous system damage in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To execute their functions, neurons evolved a high degree of polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banker, 2018</xref>). Sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons show a unique pseudo-unipolar morphology in which a single stem axon bifurcates into a peripheral and a central axon, each with distinct functions and properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nascimento et al., 2018</xref>). The peripheral DRG axon is the site of action potential generation that is transmitted to the central axon, which synapses with second-order neurons. While the different environments in which the two DRG axons lie certainly play an important role in their distinctive features, axon-intrinsic properties have emerged. In this respect, peripheral DRG axons show larger diameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suh et al., 1984</xref>), higher axonal transport rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Komiya and Kurokawa, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wujek and Lasek, 1983</xref>), and increased regenerative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Komiya, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wujek and Lasek, 1983</xref>) when compared to central ones (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nascimento et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Given the different competence of DRG axons to mount a regenerative response, DRG neurons have been widely used to study the regulation of axon regeneration. Interestingly, while DRG peripheral axons regrow following injury in vivo, the central axon only regenerates if a priming conditioning lesion to the peripheral axon is made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neumann and Woolf, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richardson and Verge, 1987</xref>). This conditioning peripheral lesion induces molecular changes in DRG neurons enabling their central axons to acquire growth competence, even in an inhibitory environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoffman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mar et al., 2014a</xref>). We have previously shown that injury to the DRG peripheral axon induces a global increase in axonal transport that extends to the central axon, supporting axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mar et al., 2014b</xref>). Since axonal transport relies on microtubule-based motors, microtubule organization in the DRG axons may determine their biological asymmetry. However, in contrast to multipolar neurons where microtubule polarity governs asymmetric distribution of cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tas et al., 2017</xref>), the mechanisms underlying differential axonal transport rates in DRG neurons are not understood. An important setback in studying DRG neurons is that while different structural aspects of their two axons may have important implications in their function, most of the studies are restricted to the use of in vitro systems in which these neurons fail to recapitulate their pseudo-unipolar morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nascimento et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here we established an in vitro model replicating DRG pseudo-unipolarization and asymmetric axon development that is an important tool to understand the biology of sensory neurons and the mechanisms underlying optimal axon (re)growth. Combining this in vitro model with in vivo studies, we show that axon-specific regulation of microtubule polymerization underlies regeneration asymmetry of sensory neuron axons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DRG neurons in vitro undergo pseudo-unipolarization, replicating in vivo asymmetries and regenerative capacity</title><p>To investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological asymmetries and regenerative capacity of DRG neurons, it is crucial to develop a primary cell culture system that promotes physiological cellular behavior. DRG neurons from developing or adult rodents cultured in vitro often fail to fully mimic their in vivo cell biology, typically producing multiple, highly ramified neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nascimento et al., 2018</xref>). Ideally, DRG neuron cultures should replicate the morphogenic process of pseudo-unipolarization while preserving the peripheral-central axonal asymmetries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nascimento et al., 2022</xref>). In this respect, we developed an in vitro system where, in the presence of DRG glial cells, pseudo-unipolarization occurs. In this system, during the early phases of development, DRG neurons exhibit a spindle or eccentric-shaped bipolar morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, stage I), and as they mature the two axons move closer, adopting a bell-shaped bipolar morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, stage II), that later converts into a pseudo-unipolar morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, stage III). At DIV21, we observed 4 ± 1% multipolar (with more than two neurites), 35 ± 8% bipolar, 17 ± 5% bell-shaped, and 43 ± 3% pseudo-unipolar DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). When we segmented pseudo-unipolar DRG neurons, the stem axon and the bifurcating axons were clearly observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). While DRG neurons undergo pseudo-unipolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>), a reduction in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>) coupled with an increased length of the stem axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>) occurs, mirroring in vivo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsuda et al., 2000</xref>). To further understand stem axon formation, we tracked the displacement of the DRG T-junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, black arrowhead) and of the top of the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, green arrowhead) in relation to the initial position of the T-junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, red dot). After establishing the DRG T-junction, the cell body is displaced significantly to the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, green arrowhead; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), while the position of the base of the stem axon remains relatively stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, black arrowhead; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This supports that cell body bulging participates in stem axon formation, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsuda et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, at early days in vitro (DIV 7–14), pseudo-unipolar DRG could be reverted to a bell-shaped bipolar morphology, while at later DIVs (DIV 14–21), this transition was never observed (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). In vivo studies have shown that peripheral and central DRG axons differ in diameter, with peripheral axons being larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suh et al., 1984</xref>).

In the case of spastin, the lack of specific antibodies for immunofluorescence precluded tissue analysis.

This is supported not only by early structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ha, 1970</xref>), but also by our current in vitro model showing that microtubule asymmetry in DRG axons is established early in development. If these distinct streams exhibit different properties, they could guide specific cargoes to either central or peripheral axons. To investigate the arrangement of microtubules at the DRG T-junction, we analyzed in vitro DRG pseudo-unipolar neurons expressing EB3-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>) that allowed to assess whether microtubule polymerization is arrested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>) or if a continuum of polymerization exists between the stem axon after the DRG bifurcation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F</xref>). In peripheral-like axons, similar numbers of EB3 comets stopped or crossed past the bifurcation point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Conversely, in DRG central-like axons, a ratio of 3:1 microtubules polymerized beyond the bifurcation point, supporting a higher microtubule continuum from the stem to the central-like axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G</xref>). As specific tubulin PTMs can favor the binding of particular motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iwanski and Kapitein, 2023</xref>), we investigated whether microtubules entering each DRG neuron axon at the DRG T-junction had different PTMs. While the levels of polyglutamylated and acetylated tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2H–K</xref>) were the same in the two DRG axon compartments, Δ2 tubulin was the single PTM that was unevenly distributed, being increased in central-like axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2L–M</xref>). Overall, it is possible that at the DRG T-junction, distinct PTMs and microtubule polymerization patterns may serve as mechanisms for selectively directing cargoes into specific DRG axons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Spastin deficiency is sufficient to abolish the asymmetry of DRG axons</title><p>To demonstrate the importance of the specific MAP signature of DRG axons, we investigated whether the absence of one of the signature proteins, spastin, was sufficient to affect DRG molecular asymmetries.

An intriguing question concerning DRG biology is how peripheral and central axons linked to the same stem axon display different properties. One major setback in the field was the lack of an in vitro system recapitulating DRG development, pseudo-unipolarization, and establishment of polarity. Here, we developed an in vitro model where DRG neurons pseudo-unipolarize and mirror in vivo asymmetries<italic>,</italic> comprising those found in axon diameter, regenerative capacity, axonal transport, and microtubule dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This model serves as a valuable resource to understand DRG neuron biology (including stem axon formation and possible sorting at the DRG T-junction), mechanisms driving axon regeneration asymmetries, and DRG-related diseases. Regarding DRG stem axon formation, our findings support that it may be driven by cell body bulging rather than fusion of the two neurites, aligning with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsuda et al., 2000</xref>). Concerning potential asymmetries in protein transport and microtubule dynamics at the DRG T-junction, while investigating these in vivo is challenging due to the length of the stem axon and the difficulty of imaging the T-junction, they can now be effectively studied using our in vitro system. Future studies should further address neuron-intrinsic mechanisms driving pseudo-unipolarization (such as the role of cytoskeletal dynamics, and of Golgi and nuclear positioning), as well as the influence of extrinsic factors, namely the identify of specific DRG glial cells supporting pseudo-unipolarization. While the current model focuses on features shared across DRG subtypes, such as pseudo-unipolarization and the higher regenerative capacity of peripheral branches, whether it favors specific DRG subtypes should be further explored. In vitro models resourcing to DRG explants and the development of compartmentalized systems with peripheral and central targets could provide additional insights into pseudo-unipolarization, regenerative capacity, and target re-innervation. However, although previous compartmentalized DRG cultures have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giorgi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vikman et al., 2001</xref>), these have not demonstrated pseudo-unipolarization.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Microtubules in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) axons are distinctively regulated both in vivo and in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In vitro DRG cultures replicate in vivo asymmetry in microtubule polymerization (established already at the bipolar stage) and reveal a potential cargo filtering mechanism operating at the DRG T-junction, where a higher continuum of microtubules from the stem axon to the central-like axonal branch is found, together with increased levels of Δ2 tubulin in the central-like axonal branch.

Despite scattered reports in the literature, markers of distinct DRG axons remained unidentified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">García-Añoveros et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Papasozomenos et al., 1985</xref>) and early studies suggested that similar proteins are transported to both DRG axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bisby, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perry and Wilson, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stone and Wilson, 1979</xref>). Our data shows, however, that the content of specific microtubule modulators including severases and the microtubule regulators CRMP5 and tau is axon-specific in DRG neurons. Other MAPs, such as MAP2, show however no differences between the two DRG axons. The mechanisms underlying this differential protein distribution remain unclear. One hypothesis is that mRNAs or proteins are asymmetrically transported at the DRG T-junction. While our data show no significant differences in the density of <italic>Spastin</italic> and <italic>Dpysl5</italic> mRNA between both DRG axons, the possibility of asymmetric protein transport cannot be ruled out. Recently, a pre-axonal cargo filtering zone mediated by MAP2 was identified in DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gumy et al., 2017</xref>). Although this may partially establish two separate compartments – the cell body and axons – how cargo filtering takes place at the DRG T-junction remains unknown. In multipolar neurons, differential cargo sorting to dendrites or axons is achieved through the axon initial segment (AIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Song et al., 2009</xref>) and by the distinct microtubule polarity in axons and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>). Similar mechanisms are however difficult to envisage in DRG neurons. Not only microtubules in both DRG axons are oriented plus-ends out, but also the AIS of DRG neurons is located in the stem axon proximal to the DRG cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nascimento et al., 2022</xref>). An alternative mechanism to establish asymmetry of DRG axons may rely on distinct microtubule streams entering peripheral and central axons as supported by early structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ha, 1970</xref>). In fact, our data suggest that there is a preferential continuous microtubule polymerization from the DRG stem axon into the central-like axon that is accompanied by increased Δ2 tubulin levels. This differential microtubule organization may serve as a mechanism for cargo filtering between DRG axons. In chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, the accumulation of Δ2 tubulin in DRGs and peripheral nerves disrupts mitochondrial motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pero et al., 2021</xref>). Accordingly, at the DRG T-junction the anterograde transport of mitochondria is biased toward the DRG peripheral-like axon, where Δ2 tubulin levels are reduced. It is thus possible that Δ2 tubulin interferes with binding of molecular motors, contributing to establish a cargo filtering mechanism at the DRG T-junction. In the future, it would be valuable to investigate whether microtubules at the DRG T-junction intermix or segregate as separate pools as they extend from the cell body towards the bifurcation.</p><p>DRG neurons are a powerful model to study axon regeneration given the distinct regenerative capacity of their axons, and the fact that a peripheral conditioning lesion enables regeneration of central axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neumann and Woolf, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richardson and Verge, 1987</xref>). We previously demonstrated that a conditioning lesion elicits a global increase in axonal transport that extends to the central DRG axon, allowing rapid and sustained support of central axon regrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mar et al., 2014b</xref>). Here we show that a conditioning lesion also induces alterations in the DRG microtubule cytoskeleton, decreasing the density of growing microtubules through an adaptive response of the MAP signature of DRG axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This decrease in microtubule dynamics extends away from the injury site, propagating to the distant axon shaft of both DRG branches. The study of changes in axonal microtubule dynamics has been mostly restricted to local effects in the growth cone. In this compartment, low doses of the microtubule-stabilizing drug taxol reduce the percentage of retraction bulbs after central axon injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ertürk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hellal et al., 2011</xref>). Microtubule stabilization is also crucial to sustain efficient axonal transport, with taxol-stabilized microtubules enhancing kinesin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kapitein et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, the reduction in growing microtubule density following a conditioning lesion may contribute to microtubule stabilization, supporting axonal transport and regeneration. Similarly to the growth cone where a delicate balance between microtubule stabilization and dynamics is necessary, a balanced regulation of microtubule dynamics in the axon shaft may also be required, as excessive stabilization may be detrimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gornstein and Schwarz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pero et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Maintaining the MAP signature is crucial for preserving the physiology and regenerative capacity of DRG neurons. Our data strongly underscore the significance of this signature, showing that the loss of spastin disrupts microtubule asymmetry in DRG neurons and results in reduced central axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Examining the effects of depleting other MAPs, such as katanin and CRMP5, which lose their asymmetry following conditioning lesion, could offer additional valuable insights into their roles in maintaining DRG axon asymmetry and supporting axon regeneration. Notably, katanin shares similar severing mechanisms with spastin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roll-Mecak and Vale, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zehr et al., 2017</xref>) and is partially regulated in a comparable manner. Both proteins undergo biphasic regulation through tubulin glutamylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lacroix et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Szczesna et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Valenstein and Roll-Mecak, 2016</xref>) and their severing activity is inhibited by tau condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siahaan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tan et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, katanin plays a role in axon outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), with RhoA negatively modulating neurite outgrowth via regulation of spastin and katanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tan et al., 2020</xref>). Despite not being functionally redundant, it is possible that katanin deficiency may impact DRG microtubule asymmetry and regenerative capacity similarly to spastin. In summary, our data unveil that axon-specific microtubule regulation drives asymmetric regeneration of sensory neuron axons. We further provide a bona fide model of DRG pseudo-unipolarization and establishment of axonal asymmetry that will contribute to push forward our understanding of sensory neuron biology and of axon growth and regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Culture of pseudo-unipolar DRG neurons</title><p>DRG cultures from Wistar rats (embryonic day 16) and <italic>Spastin</italic> knockout mice and wild-type littermates (embryonic day 13) were done as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nascimento et al., 2022</xref>).

Images were acquired every hour. Gray levels were inverted for improved visualization. Due to the random nature of viral infection and the potential light-induced toxicity associated with the longitudinal imaging setup, only a subset of the 30 selected neurons underwent pseudo-unipolarization in each experiment. To quantify the initial and final diameter and length of the stem axon, the Fiji/ImageJ segmented line tool was employed. To quantify the displacement of the base of the stem axon and of the top of the DRG cell body, we used the initial position of the base of the DRG T-junction as a reference point. Using this reference point, we tracked the displacement of both the base of the stem axon and the top of the cell body using the MTrackJ plugin in ImageJ/Fiji software. For DRG segmentation, we acquired pseudo-unipolar eGFP-positive DRG neurons at DIV14 using an inverted Leica SP8 single-point scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany) and Leica Application Suite X software (version 3.5.7.23225, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_013673">SCR_013673</ext-link>).

DRG neurons were first pre-screened to select target axons to injure (100–200 µm distally from the bifurcation point of the stem axon) and the areas to be imaged; six pseudo-unipolar DRG neurons were selected per experiment. eGFP was excited using a 488 nm laser line with a laser power of 7%.

Only bipolar and pseudo-unipolar DRG neurons with low-to-moderate expression levels of EB3-GFP were selected. The EB3-GFP comet velocity and density were quantified through kymographs using the Fiji/ImageJ <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ekatrukha/KymoResliceWide">KymoResliceWide plugin</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katrukha, 2020</xref>) or the KymoToolBox plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zala et al., 2013</xref>).

A segmented line was drawn over the DRG stem, large and thin axons, in the direction cell body-axon tip, and maximum intensity was extracted across the line width, when using the KymoResliceWide plugin. For EB3-GFP comets analyzed using the KymoResliceWide plugin, starting and end positions of the kymograph traces were defined using the Fiji/ImageJ Cell Counter plugin. The x-axis and y-axis coordinates of each trace were used to calculate the EB3-GFP comet velocity (distance, x-axis; time, y-axis). EB3-GFP comet density was calculated by dividing the total number of EB3-GFP comets counted within one kymograph by the area of the segmented line. For EB3-GFP comets analyzed using the KymoToolBox plugin, comet trajectories were manually identified using the segmented line tool. Approximately 5–10 bipolar and pseudo-unipolar DRG neurons were quantified in each experiment. The videos used to quantify EB3-GFP comet dynamics were used to quantify axon diameter in in vitro bipolar and pseudo-unipolar DRG neurons. For that, the diameter of the stem, large and thin axons was determined using the straight-line tool from Fiji/ImageJ to trace a perpendicular line connecting the two axon membrane borders. The videos of pseudo-unipolar DRG neurons where the stem, large, and thin axons were located on the same focal plane were used to quantify the total number of EB3-GFP comets that stop and cross the DRG T-junction. The number of EB3-comets that cross or stop at the DRG T-junction was traced using the composite panel obtained after analysis with the KymoToolBox plugin in a length of approximately 5 µm comprising the final part of the stem axon and the beginning of the large or thin axon.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Animals</title><p>Animal experiments followed EU Directive 2010/63/EU and national Decree-law number 113-2013 approved by the i3S Ethical Committee and Portuguese Veterinarian Board.

The authors analyze the abundance of various microtubule associated protein (MAPs) in each branch, as well as the microtubule dynamics in each branch and find significant differences between branches. Importantly, they found that a well-known conditioning paradigm (prior lesion of the peripheral branch improves the regenerative capacity of the central branch) is not only reproduced in this system, but also leads to loss of the asymmetry of MAPs between branches.

The authors developed an in vitro system that mimics the pseudo-unipolar morphology and asymmetry of DRG neurons during the regeneration of the peripheral and central branch axons. They suggest that central-like DRG axons exhibit a higher density of growing microtubules. By reducing the polymerization of microtubules in these central-like axons, they were able to eliminate the asymmetry in DRG neurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors point out a distinct microtubule-associated protein signature that differentiates between DRG neurons' central and peripheral axonal branches. Experimental results demonstrate that genetic deletion of spastin eliminated the differences in microtubule dynamics and axon regeneration between the central and peripheral branches.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While some of the data are compelling, experimental evidence does not fully support the main claims.</p><p>In its current form, the study is primarily descriptive and lacks convincing mechanistic insights. It misses important controls and further validation using 3D in vitro models.</p><p>The significance of studying microtubule polymerization to DRG asymmetry in vitro is questionable, especially considering the model's validity. Classifying the central and peripheral-like branches in cultured DRG neurons will require further in-depth characterization. Additional validation using adult DRG neuron cultures not aged in vitro will be required in future studies.</p><p>The comparison of asymmetry associated with a regenerative response between in vitro and in vivo paradigms has significant limitations due to the nature of the in vitro culture system. When cultured in isolation, DRG neurons fail to form functional connections with appropriate postsynaptic target neurons (the central branch) or to differentiate the peripheral domains associated with the innervation of target organs. Rather than growing neurons on a flat, hard surface like glass, more physiologically relevant substrates and/or culturing conditions should be considered. This approach could help eliminate potential artifacts caused by plating adult DRG neurons on a flat surface. Additionally, the authors should consider replicating their findings in a 3D culture model or using dorsal root ganglia explants, where both centrally and peripherally projecting axons are present.</p><p>Panels 5H-J require additional processing with astrocyte markers to accurately define the lesion borders. Furthermore, including a lower magnification would facilitate a direct comparison of the lesion site. The use of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) to trace dorsal column sensory axons is prone to misinterpretation, as the tracer accumulates at the axon's tip. This limitation makes it extremely challenging to distinguish between regenerating and degenerating axons.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104069.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Costa</surname><given-names>Ana Catarina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>IBMC/i3S- University of Porto</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Porto</named-content></addr-line><country>Portugal</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Murillo</surname><given-names>Blanca R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>i3S - Health Research and Innovation Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Porto</named-content></addr-line><country>Portugal</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bessa</surname><given-names>Rita</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>i3S - Health Research and Innovation Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Porto</named-content></addr-line><country>Portugal</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ribeiro</surname><given-names>Ricardo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>i3S - Health Research and Innovation Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Porto</named-content></addr-line><country>Portugal</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ferreira da Silva</surname><given-names>Tiago</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>i3S - Health Research and Innovation Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Porto</named-content></addr-line><country>Portugal</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Porfírio-Rodrigues</surname><given-names>Patrícia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lisbon</named-content></addr-line><country>Portugal</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Martins</surname><given-names>Gabriel G</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Oeiras</named-content></addr-line><country>Portugal</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Brites</surname><given-names>Pedro</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>i3S - Health Research and Innovation Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Porto</named-content></addr-line><country>Portugal</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kneussel</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hamburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Misgeld</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Technische Universität München</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Munich</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Brill</surname><given-names>Monika S</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Technical University of Munich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Munich</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sousa</surname><given-names>Monica M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>i3S - Health Research and Innovation Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Porto</named-content></addr-line><country>Portugal</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review)</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main weakness of the manuscript is that to a large degree, one of its main conclusions (MAP symmetry underlies differences in regenerative capacity) relies mainly on a correlation, without firmly establishing a causal link.

To further strengthen the claim that MAP asymmetry underlies differences in regenerative capacity, we could investigate the effect of depleting other MAPs that lose asymmetry after conditioning lesion (CRMP5 and katanin).

As suggested, we included further methodological details on the in vitro system in the revised version of the manuscript. We have previously evaluated the percentage of DRG neurons exhibiting different morphologies in our cultures: multipolar (4±1%), bipolar, (35±8%) bell-shaped (17±5%), and pseudo-unipolar neurons (43±3%). This was included in the revised manuscript on Figure 1B and page 5, line 107. All the pseudo-unipolar neurons analysed had distinct axonal branches in terms of diameter and microtubule dynamics. For imaging purposes, we selected pseudounipolar neurons with axons unobstructed from other cells or neurites within a distance of at least 20–30 μm from the bifurcation point, to ensure optimal imaging. In the case of laser axotomy experiments, this distance was increased to 100–200 μm to ensure clear analysis of regeneration. These selection criteria is now detailed in the Methods (page 19, line 417, and page 21, line 474).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>(1) Weaknesses:</p><p>While some of the data are compelling, experimental evidence only partially supports the main claims.

In future work, we plan to investigate this issue using knockout mice for katanin and CRMP5. Regarding the mechanisms underlying the differential localization of proteins in DRG axons, we performed <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridization to evaluate the availability of axonal mRNA but no differences were found between central and peripheral DRG axons (Figure 4 – figure supplement 2). To address whether differences in protein transport exist, we attempted to transduce DRG neurons with GFP-tagged spastin both in vitro and in vivo. However, these experiments were inconclusive as very low levels of spastin-GFP were detected. We are actively optimizing these approaches and will address this challenge in future studies. These points were further discussed in the revised manuscript (page 15, line 330 and page 17, line 381).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Given the heterogeneity of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, it is unclear whether the in vitro model described in this study can be applied to all major classes of DRG neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the diversity of DRG neurons and agree that assessing the presence</p><p>of different DRG subtypes in our culture system will enrich its future use.

This point was addressed on page 14, line 309 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Also unclear is the inconsistency with embryonic DRG cultures with embryonic (E)16 from rats and E13 from mice (spastin knockout and wild-type controls).</p></disp-quote><p>Given our previous experience in establishing DRG neuron cultures from E16 Wistar rats and E13 C57BL/6 mice, these developmental stages are equivalent, yielding cultures of DRG neurons with similar percentages of different morphologies.

This was further clarified in the Methods (page 18, line 404).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Furthermore, the authors stated (line 393) that only a small subset of cultured DRG neurons exhibited a pseudo-unipolar morphology. The authors should include the percentage of the neurons that exhibit a pseudo-unipolar morphology.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously evaluated the percentage of DRG neurons exhibiting different morphologies in our cultures: multipolar (4±1%), bipolar, (35±8%) bell-shaped (17±5%), and pseudo-unipolar neurons (43±3%). This was included in the revised manuscript on Figure 1B and on page 5, line 107. In line 393, we referred specifically to an experimental setup where DRG neuron transduction was done, and 30 transduced neurons were randomly selected for longitudinal imaging. From these, the number of viable pseudo-unipolar DRG neurons was limited by both the random nature of viral transduction and light-induced toxicity throughout continuous imaging over seven consecutive days at hourly intervals. This was clarified in the revised manuscript (page 20, line 438).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The significance of studying microtubule polymerization to DRG asymmetry in vitro is questionable, especially considering the model's validity. The authors might consider eliminating the in vitro data and instead focus on characterizing DRG asymmetry in vivo both before and after a conditioning lesion. If the authors choose to retain the in vitro data, classifying the central and peripheral-like branches in cultured DRG neurons will require further in-depth characterization. Additional validation should be performed in adult DRG neuron cultures not aged in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>The in vitro system here presented reliably reproduces several key features of DRG neurons observed in vivo<italic>,</italic> including asymmetry in axon diameter, regenerative capacity, axonal transport, and microtubule dynamics. Of note, most studies in the field have been done using multipolar DRG neurons that do not recapitulate in vivo morphology and asymmetries. Thus, the current in vitro model serves as a versatile tool for advancing our understanding of DRG biology and associated diseases. This system is particularly suited to study axon regeneration asymmetries, and enables the investigation of mechanisms occurring at the stem axon bifurcation, such as asymmetric protein transport and microtubule dynamics, which are challenging to examine in vivo due to the length of the stem axon and the difficulty of locating the DRG T-junction. It will be important to optimize similar cultures using adult DRG neurons. However, this comes with challenges, such as lower cell viability. This is the case with multiple other neuron types for which the vast majority of cultures are obtained from embryonic tissue. These concerns were addressed in the revised version of the manuscript (page 13, line 296 and page 14 line 302).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The comparison of asymmetry associated with a regenerative response between in vitro and in vivo paradigms has significant limitations due to the nature of the in vitro culture system. When cultured in isolation, DRG neurons fail to form functional connections with appropriate postsynaptic target neurons (the central branch) or to differentiate the peripheral domains associated with the innervation of target organs. Rather than growing neurons on a flat, hard surface like glass, more physiologically relevant substrates and/or culturing conditions should be considered. This approach could help eliminate potential artifacts caused by plating adult DRG neurons on a flat surface. Additionally, the authors should consider replicating their findings in a 3D culture model or using dorsal root ganglia explants, where both centrally and peripherally projecting axons are present.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a more sophisticated system, such as a compartmentalized culture, holds great potential for future research. In this respect, we are currently engaged in developing such models. A compartmentalized system would enable the separation of three compartments: central nervous system neurons, DRG neurons, and peripheral targets. While previous efforts to create compartmentalized DRG cultures have been reported (e.g., PMID: 11275274 and PMID: 37578145), these systems have not demonstrated the development of pseudo-unipolar morphology. Incorporating non-neuronal DRG cells into the DRG neuron compartment, may successfully support the development of a pseudo-unipolar morphology.</p><p>We also recognize the importance of dimensionality in fostering pseudo-unipolar morphology. Of note, our model provides a 3D-like environment, as DRG glial cells are continuously replicating over the 21 days in culture. In relation to DRG explants, we attempted their use but encountered limitations with confocal microscopy as the axial resolution was insufficient to resolve processes at the DRG T-junction or within individual branches. The above issues are now discussed in the revised manuscript (page 14, line 312).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Panels 5H-J require additional processing with astrocyte markers to accurately define the lesion borders. Furthermore, including a lower magnification would facilitate a direct comparison of the lesion site.</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, we relied on the alignment of nuclei to delineate the lesion site as in our accumulated experience, this provides an accurate definition of the lesion boarder. Outside the lesion, the nuclei are well-aligned, while at the lesion site, they become randomly distributed. Additionally, CTB staining further supports the identification of the rostral boarder of the lesion, as most injured central DRG axons stop their growth at the injury site. This was further detailed in the Methods of the revised manuscript (page 32, line 730).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The use of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) to trace dorsal column sensory axons is prone to misinterpretation, as the tracer accumulates at the axon's tip. This limitation makes it extremely challenging to distinguish between regenerating and degenerating axons.</p></disp-quote><p>While alternative methods to trace or label regenerating axons exist, CTB is a wellestablished and widely used tracer for central sensory projections, as shown in different studies (PMID: 22681683, PMID: 26831088 and PMID: 33349630). Regarding the concern of possiblebCTB labeling in degenerating axons, we believe this is unlikely to be the case in our system, as in spinal cord injury controls, CTB-positive axons are nearly absent. Also, as regeneration was investigated six weeks after injury, axon degeneration has most likely already occurred as shown in (PMID: 15821747 and PMID: 25937174).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>(1) Figure 1 can be improved by adding a quantification of the fraction of neurons at each stage as a function of time.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated Figure 1 to include the quantification of the percentages of different DRG neuron morphologies at DIV21 (Figure 1B), which corresponds to the stage at which all in vitro experiments were conducted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 3A: why are retrograde transport events not shown?</p></disp-quote><p>Retrograde transport events are not displayed as results did not reach statistical significance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 3 and 4: Combine the quantifications of with/without lesion, such that not only the differences between branches are apparent, but also the differences induced in each branch by the lesion.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, only combined quantifications of microtubule dynamics for naive and conditioning lesion are provided in the revised version of Figure 3 (Figures 3H and 3K), to highlight both branch-specific differences and lesion-induced changes. However, for Figure 4, as the western blots for naive and conditioning lesion were performed on separate gels, it is unfeasible to combine their quantification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 5: does spastin KO lead to a difference in the &quot;MAP signature&quot; of each branch? Also, if in addition to MAPs there are other known molecules (and an antibody is available) that show differential localization to peripheral/central branches, it would be nice to check if this asymmetry is also lost in spastin KO.</p></disp-quote><p>Evaluating the MAP signature in DRG axons from spastin KO mice will be important to explore in future experiments. Despite some scattered reports in the literature, our study is the first to identify a distinct protein signature of central and peripheral DRG axons. This is especially relevant in the case of Tau, as irrespective of the experimental conditions, its levels are always increased in the peripheral DRG axon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>(1) Please provide a more complete description of the culture method. Do all neurons develop two asymmetric branches or just a few, and how are they selected? Does the timing of the events in vitro correspond with what is happening to the neurons in embryos?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the percentages of the various DRG neuron morphologies at DIV21 in the revised manuscript (Figure 1B and on page 5, line 107). Additionally, a more detailed description of the culture method is now provided in the Methods, including the criteria used to select pseudo-unipolar neurons (page 19, line 417, and page 21, line 474).</p><p>Regarding the timing of events, upon DRG dissociation, neurons reinitiate polarization, taking 21 days to reach approximately 40% pseudo-unipolar morphology. A similar percentage is reached at E16.5 during rat development in vivo (PMID: 8729965).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Are the neurons and their branches resting on the glia? Is there any relation to the presence of glia and the type of growth that is seen?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, neurons and their branches rest on glia. This is required for DRG pseudounipolarization. In future studies, we plan to further investigate neuron-extrinsic mechanisms leading pseudo-unipolarization, and to identify the specific glial cell type(s) needed throughout this process. This is now discussed in the revised manuscript (page 14, line 306).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Is it possible to trace microtubules so as to see whether the microtubules of the two branches mix, or whether they remain separate all the way to the cell bodies?</p></disp-quote><p>We used DRG neurons transduced with EB3-GFP, to examine microtubule polymerization at the T-junction through live imaging. This revealed a high continuum of polymerization from the stem axon to the central-like axon (Figure 4 – figure supplement 2D-G). To further determine whether microtubules from both branches mix or remain separate, alternative techniques such as FIB-SEM could be performed. This point is now further discussed in the revised manuscript (page 16, line 352).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Using the term MAPs would lead readers to expect to see an analysis of different levels of MAP1, MAP2, etc. It would be interesting to see this if the authors have done it, but it is not necessary for the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We assessed the expression of MAP2 via western blot in DRG peripheral and central axons and no differences were found. This is now referred to in the Discussion (pages 15, line 327).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The regeneration experiments on the spastin knockouts are complicated by the lesion being in CNS tissue, which introduces various issues. Is there a difference in regeneration after dorsal root crush?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not yet examined whether regeneration differs after dorsal root crush in the spastin knockout model. However, this presents an interesting question, as Schwann cells in the dorsal root, may support regeneration of central DRG axons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>The authors stated that the normality of the datasets was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk or D'Agostino-Pearson omnibus normality test.

The D'Agostino-Pearson omnibus K2 test, recommended for its versatility, was used when sample size was 8 or more. For smaller sample sizes (n &lt; 8), we used the Shapiro-Wilk test, which is also widely used in biological research and can be employed with datasets of at least 3 values.
