However, how protein affects the reproduction remains largely unknown. Using <italic>Bactrocera dorsalis</italic> as the study model, we investigated how protein feeding regulated sex pheromone synthesis. We show that protein ingestion is essential for sex pheromone synthesis in male. While protein feeding or deprivation did not affect <italic>Bacillus</italic> abundance, transcriptome analysis revealed that sarcosine dehydrogenase (Sardh) in protein-fed males regulates the biosynthesis of sex pheromones by increasing glycine and threonine (sex pheromone precursors) contents. RNAi-mediated loss-of-function of Sardh decreases glycine, threonine, and sex pheromone contents and results in decreased mating ability in males. The study links male feeding behavior with discrete patterns of gene expression that plays role in sex pheromone synthesis, which in turn translates to successful copulatory behavior of the males.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sex pheromone</kwd><kwd>protein nutrition</kwd><kwd>mating behavior</kwd><kwd>rectal bacteria</kwd><kwd>amino acids</kwd><kwd>fruit fly</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The national natural science foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3212200346</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Daifeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Protein feeding stimulates the production of sex pheromones and promotes fly mating in <italic>Bactrocera dorsalis</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Females in many animal species are ‘investment breeders’, foraging for reproductive resources during adulthood, which are directed into offspring production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stearns, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stephens et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stephens et al., 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, males of many species may be categorized in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Soulsbury, 2019</xref>), depending on foraging success to secure copulations and manipulate female behavior, while prioritizing different resources than the females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gwynne, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ng et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, a number of studies on males from various insect groups suggest a strong link between adult foraging and reproductive success (e.g. Lepidoptera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boggs, 1981</xref>]; Orthoptera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gwynne, 2008</xref>]; Mecoptera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sauer et al., 1998</xref>]; Diptera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yuval et al., 2007</xref>]).</p><p>The dipteran family Tephritidae contains over 4000 species, and almost all tephritid adults need post-teneral carbohydrate and protein nutrition to realize their fitness potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pereira et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). Post-teneral protein feeding affects the reproduction of male tephritid flies in multiple ways, including the following: (1) sexual organ development. For example, the reproductive organs (testes, accessory glands, ejaculatory duct, and apodemes) of <italic>Bactrocera dorsalis</italic> males can significantly enlarge after protein consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Reyes-Hernández et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>Bactrocera tryoni</italic>, protein feeding accelerates the development of the male copulatory apodemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weldon and Taylor, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Reyes-Hernández et al., 2019</xref>); (2) pheromone release, which is a key step in reproduction. In <italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic>, protein feeding increases male intensity of sex pheromone release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yuval et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>B. tryoni</italic> males release an incomplete mixture of sex pheromones when deprived of protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weldon and Taylor, 2011</xref>) (3) mating behavior. In many species of Tephritidae, mating competitiveness, mating probability, and mating duration are significantly increased in flies supplied with protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yuval et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Prabhu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Reyes-Hernández et al., 2019</xref>); (4) sperm storage and egg fertilization. Protein supplementation for males increases the amount of sperm stored by mated females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Reyes-Hernández et al., 2019</xref>) and the probability of egg fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blay and Yuval, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shelly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yuval et al., 2007</xref>); (5) inhibition of female receptivity. Ejaculates of protein-fed males inhibit the remating behavior of females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Radhakrishnan and Taylor, 2007</xref>). Conversely, the remating rate in females increases significantly when males lack access to protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yuval et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Males of the oriental fruit fly, <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>, one of the most economically important tephritid species, attract females by emitting a pheromone produced by bacteria in the rectal glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ren et al., 2021</xref>). The pheromone has been identified as a cocktail of trimethylpyrazine (TMP) and tetramethylpyrazine (TTMP), and the pathway of sex pheromone biosynthesis has been proposed in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ren et al., 2021</xref>). Although sex pheromone-producing <italic>Bacillus</italic> in <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> have been identified, the source of the precursors has not been determined. Given that protein feeding has a significant influence on the reproductive performance of <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shelly and Edu, 2007</xref>), we hypothesized that protein feeding in <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> mediates sex pheromone biosynthesis by affecting the precursor substance content in the rectum. Accordingly, in this study, we investigated the mechanism by which protein feeding influences the biosynthesis of sex pheromones in <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>. The results indicate that protein feeding is the key factor that controls sex pheromone biosynthesis in the male rectum. Ingested protein supplies the glycine and threonine pathway and provides substrates for sex pheromone production.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Protein feeding is required for sex pheromone biosynthesis and successful mating</title><p>To determine whether protein feeding is required for reproductive performance, we tested the effects of protein feeding on male survival, rectum width, sex pheromones, and mating ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Orankanok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shelly, 2017</xref>), yeast hydrolysate (YH) was used as the protein source. Since rectal <italic>Bacillus</italic> also need to use glucose to synthesize sex pheromone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ren et al., 2021</xref>), we fed male flies three different types of sugar (sucrose, fructose, and glucose) to investigate the influence of glucose feeding or not on sex pheromone synthesis and reproductive performance of male <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The results showed that different types of sugars had no effect on survival, rectum width, sex pheromone biosynthesis, and mating ability of mature male (12 d old; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–G</xref>). Though protein feeding also did not affect the survival and rectum width of the males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), major products with the same retention time were only detected in YH-supplemented male rectums when rectal extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography‒mass spectrometry (GC‒MS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These products were tentatively identified as TMP and TTMP in all three YH-supplemented cases based on their mass spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). And the mating ability of the males deprived of YH was significantly lower than that of the males fed with YH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These results indicate that protein feeding instead of sugar type can significantly affect the male reproductive performance (sex pheromone synthesis and mating ability). Given that sex pheromones are synthesized by rectal <italic>Bacillus</italic> using glucose and amino acids as precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ren et al., 2021</xref>), we infer that dietary proteins may influence sex pheromone synthesis and mating ability by influencing the abundance of <italic>Bacillus</italic> in the rectum or the amount of the precursors.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Influence of post-teneral protein and sugar feeding on male flies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic showing how the male flies were reared and the biological parameters compared.

We first carried out RNA-seq in the rectum of YH-fed males and YH-deprived males (12 d old). Principal component analysis (PCA) using the expression profiles of the identified genes indicated that YH-deprived males were significantly different from the YH-fed ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Pearson correlation coefficients, which were generated by the expression profiles, between samples also indicated that YH-fed males had higher similarity than YH-deprived individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

To identify the DE genes involved in synthesizing glycine or threonine, a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was performed. The glycine and threonine pathway was significantly enriched in the sucrose, glucose, and fructose groups, with the sarcosine dehydrogenase gene (Sardh) and alanine-glyoxylate transaminase (AGXT2) being the significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in all groups, and the expression of Sardh was significantly induced in YH-fed males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

However, how pyrazines are synthesized in these insects has not yet been revealed. With a series of chemical analysis and molecular biology experiments, we discovered that protein fed by insects contributes to provide precursor substances for pyrazines synthesis. Specifically, we confirmed that the Sardh in the glycine and threonine pathway can convert protein into pyrazine precursor substances-threonine and glycine. Given that the glycine and threonine pathway is conserved in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crawford et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nallu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sonn et al., 2018</xref>), our findings may be relevant for all insects that use protein to synthesize pyrazines.</p><p>Previous studies suggest that the influence of protein feeding on the mating success of Tephritidae is caused by affecting the development of testes and accessory glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weldon and Taylor, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Reyes-Hernández et al., 2019</xref>) and increased levels of courtship activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pereira et al., 2013</xref>). Although researchers have speculated that there is a positive correlation between protein feeding and sex pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yuval et al., 2007</xref>), this relationship has been hard to pin down. Certain plant chemicals, such as methyl eugenol, gingerone, and raspberry ketone, which strongly attract tephritidae males of some species, are thought to be the precursors of sex pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tan and Nishida, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kumaran et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kumaran et al., 2014b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Segura et al., 2018</xref>), and a variety of chemicals have been identified and proposed as sex pheromone components in fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chuman et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker and Heath, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wicker-Thomas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Robacker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hiap et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Levi-Zada et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ono et al., 2020</xref>). However, the biosynthetic pathways of only some suspected pheromones have been elucidated. We have proposed here that protein ingested by <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> is converted into threonine and glycine, which are precursor substances of the sex pheromone. The positive relationship between protein feeding and reproductive performance in Tephritidae is elucidated in this case by showing that proteins play a role in supplying precursor substances for sex pheromone biosynthesis. One thing should be noted is that glycine and threonine levels may be elevated partly because the flies fed on YH. To answer such question, we need to further determine the composition and content of amino acids in the YH. We need to determine if the YH contains large amounts of glycine and threonine that can enter into the rectum and be used by the rectal <italic>Bacillus</italic>. In addition to investigating the influence of protein on sex pheromones, the roles of sugars were also tested by feeding males different types of sugars. The results indicate that the amount of sex pheromone produced is significantly affected by the type of sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Males fed fructose produced much higher amounts of sex pheromones than glucose-fed males. However, glucose has been described as the precursor substance for generating TMP and TTMP. We speculate that fructose may also be used in the sex pheromone production process, and the utilization efficiency of fructose may be much higher. In glycolysis, glucose is first converted into fructose 6-phosphate and then regenerated into pyruvate, which is involved in the synthesis of TMP and TTMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). However, fructose can be catalyzed directly by hexokinase to form fructose 6-phosphate in the glycolysis process. Such a step can omit the step of glucose to fructose 6-phosphate, which may increase pyruvate conversion efficiency and then generate more TMP and TTMP. This may also be related to the fact that <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> has a preference for hosts that are fructose-rich fruits. As males congregate on these hosts to attract mates, opportunities for feeding on fruit juices and fruit exudates may abound.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that in the glycine and threonine pathway of insects and bacteria, Sardh converts sarcosine into glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frisell and Mackenzie, 1962</xref>), and ltaE converts glycine into threonine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al., 1998</xref>). However, how protein ingested by <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> affects the production of sarcosine remains to be investigated. Does protein supplementation provide sarcosine directly to the fly? Or does protein supplementation provide the fly with other substances that can be converted into sarcosine? If so, what are these substances? How are they converted to sarcosine? These questions are very complex, and more experimental evidence is needed to uncover them. Both glycine and threonine were elevated in the YH-fed flies. However, only Sardh (that converts sarcosine to glycine) was upregulated and ltaE (that converts glycine to threonine) was not differentially expressed. Does YH provide threonine directly to the flies, or are there other ways to synthesize threonine? These questions also need to be confirmed by further experiments. Moreover, we found that Sardh knockdown males showed significantly decreased rectal threonine and glycine contents, but TTMP level was not significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In the pyrazine synthesis pathway of <italic>Bacillus</italic>, two molecules of glucose can be converted into TTMP, while one molecule of glucose and one molecule of threonine (or glycine) can be converted into TMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that the reason why TTMP level is not affected is that glucose content in the rectum is not regulated by Sardh. Nevertheless, the study links male feeding behavior with discrete patterns of gene expression that lead to pheromone production.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Insect rearing</title><p>The <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> strain collected from a <italic>carambola</italic> (<italic>Averrhoa carambola</italic>) orchard in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, was reared under laboratory conditions (27 ± 1°C, 12:12 hr light:dark cycle, 70–80% RH(Relative humidity)).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Sonia Sen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The sentence in 107-108: &quot;Yeast feeding only positively influenced glucose contents in males in the sucrose and fructose groups (Figure 2D).&quot; The comparison seems to be being made between YH<sup>+</sup> and YH- in each sugar group. The assessment to be made is whether the amount of glucose is affected by yeast feeding or not. So, should the comparison not be made across sugar groups? Glucose will naturally be higher in a glucose-fed fly, hence the apparent lack of difference between YH- and YH<sup>+</sup>.</p><p>5. It wasn't clear to me whether the authors were making the claim that Sardh levels were increased with age irrespective of the protein feeding. This would be interesting!

The authors first compared male B. dorsalis fed on diets with or without yeast hydrolase (&quot;YH-supplemented&quot; vs. &quot;YH-deprived&quot;) and on three different sugars (glucose, fructose, and sucrose), showing that the sex pheromone compounds (particularly TMP) were detected in YH-supplemented male fly rectums but are absent in YH-deprived counterparts. The mating ability was also significantly lower in the YH-deprived males. Following the initial observations, the team conducted a series of experiments, including 16S amplicon seq, RNAseq, and gene knockdown by RNAi to identify the mechanism underlying these effects.</p><p>The manuscript is overall well-written, and the figures are nicely presented. Results demonstrating the importance of the sarcosine dehydrogenase (Sardh) gene in sex pheromone biosynthesis and mating are novel. However, I have reservations about some of the statements and data interpretation.</p><p>1. Previous work from the group suggests that the rectal bacteria can produce sex pheromones in male B. dorsalis (Ren, Ma et al. 2021). However, the involvement of bacteria in the dietary yeast effects on sex pheromone biosynthesis and mating is not clear in this study. The microbiome data suggest that the dietary yeast treatments did not affect the dominant rectal bacterium Bacillus abundance. The only indirect evidence was that rectal threonine and glycine appeared to be elevated in YH-fed flies, and Bacillus can use these amino acids to produce sex pheromones. In my opinion, the data present are not sufficient to support statements like &quot;We show that male flies rely on rectal Bacillus to produce a complex sex pheromone. (L11-12)&quot;, &quot;This study clearly links male feeding behavior with discrete patterns of gene expression that lead to pheromone production by rectal Bacillus… (L18-20)&quot;, &quot;This is the first report that clarifies the molecular mechanism by which host feeding and rectal microbes co-regulate sex pheromone biosynthesis. (L173-174)&quot;. For these statements to be valid, one would need to use flies deprived of Bacillus or the microbiome to confirm that there is no difference between YH-fed and YH-deprived flies.</p><p>2. Some sections of the manuscript would benefit from clarification, for instance,</p><p>a. The authors reasoned that YH feeding would stimulate threonine and glycine synthesis pathways (L116-117) when they justified focusing on glycine/threonine metabolism DEGs. This is an interesting prediction but presumably, yeast can provide these amino acids directly as a protein source. Knowing how much threonine and glycine are available in the YH might be helpful.</p><p>b. The RNAseq data identified two DEGs, Sardh and AGXT2, associated with glycine or threonine synthesis. As shown in Figure 3E, Sardh can convert Sarcosine to glycine, but not much information was provided regarding where Sarcosine may come from. Does the YH provision Sarcosine to the fly? What is the alternative hypothesis for the Sardh upregulation by YH feeding if not?</p><p>3. Based on the fold changes and p values, the positive effect of YH feeding on rectal threonine level is more significant than on glycine (Figure 2E and 2F). Sardh upregulation can explain the elevated glycine level in YH-fed flies, but ltaE (that converts glycine to threonine) was not differentially expressed. The genetic basis for the elevated threonine seems unresolved and is worthy of more in-depth discussion.</p><p>4. Figure 1C shows that TTMP (blue arrow) is only detected in the glucose + YH treatment but not in the sucrose + YH or fructose + YH treatments. What are the possible explanations?</p><p>5. In Figure 5, Sardh knockdown males showed significantly decreased rectal threonine and glycine contents, but TTMP level was not significantly reduced. What are the possible explanations?</p><p>6. Please indicate the sample time (day 12?) of rectal glycine/threonine for figures 2 and 5.</p><p>7. For RNAseq analysis, the FPKM normalization method is generally not recommended for between-sample comparisons for DE analysis. Suggest using the median of ratios method in DESeq2 or TMM in EdgeR.</p><p>8. L203: &quot;Our results indicate that the amount of sex pheromone produced is significantly affected by the type of sugar (Figure 2c).&quot; – I think the authors were referring to Figure 1c, not 2c.</p><p>9. To measure rectal glycine/threonine content, the team collected 15 male recta per replicate of each treatment group. While rectal width did not differ between the YH-supplemented and YH-deprived flies, it's unclear whether the total protein content or mass was different between the groups. My concern is that the lower glycine/threonine level could be due to the lower amount of tissue collected from the YH-deprived flies. I also noticed that the scale of glycine content varied quite a bit among experiments (e.g., 1-2 μg/ml in Figure 2E, 0.4-0.6 μg/ml in Figure 4B, and 2-3 μg/ml in Figure 5C control group). Normalizing the glycine/threonine content to tissue weight or total protein content will be more appropriate than the sample volume.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83469.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.
