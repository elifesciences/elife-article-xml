to soil ecology and biogeochemistry yet are difficult to study due to soil’s opacity and complexity. To advance the study of soil processes, we constructed transparent soil microcosms that enable the visualization of microbes via fluorescence microscopy and the non-destructive measurement of microbial activity and carbon uptake in situ via Raman microspectroscopy. We assessed the polymer Nafion and the crystal cryolite as optically transparent soil substrates. We demonstrated that both substrates enable the growth, maintenance, and visualization of microbial cells in three dimensions over time, and are compatible with stable isotope probing using Raman. We applied this system to ascertain that after a dry-down/rewetting cycle, bacteria on and near dead fungal hyphae were more metabolically active than those far from hyphae. These data underscore the impact fungi have facilitating bacterial survival in fluctuating conditions and how these microcosms can yield insights into microscale microbial activities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>soil-like microcosms</kwd><kwd>microbial ecology</kwd><kwd>mucor fragilis</kwd><kwd>wet/dry cycles</kwd><kwd>raman microspectroscopy</kwd><kwd>fluorescence microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006206</institution-id><institution>Biological and Environmental Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-SC0013887</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shank</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006206</institution-id><institution>Biological and Environmental Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-SC0019012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shank</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FunKeyGut 741623</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berry</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two optically transparent substrates enable the exploration of the ecophysiology and spatiotemporal organization and activities of bacteria and fungi within heterogeneous soil-like environments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Terrestrial soils are habitats to an unparalleled abundance and diversity of bacteria and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fierer and Jackson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horner-Devine et al., 2004</xref>). The metabolic activities of these microbes drive critical biogeochemical processes with biosphere-level effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pold and DeAngelis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wieder et al., 2013</xref>). However, the opacity and complexity of natural soils present a formidable challenge to the study of soil microbes in their native habitats.</p><p>‘Transparent soils’ (TS) are model systems where particles with a similar refractive index (RI) as their saturating liquids allow transmission of light and render a porous, ‘soil-like’ system optically transparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iskander, 2010</xref>). TS systems have been used for over 25 years in geoengineering and hydrology, where they have helped solve challenging problems in soil physics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iskander et al., 2015</xref>). Despite their importance in that field, however, TS systems have only recently and rarely been used for applications in biology. In part, this is due to soil physicists favoring TS systems that use RI-matching liquids that do not support life, such as silicone oil. In 2005, however, work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leis et al., 2005</xref> introduced the synthetic fluoropolymer Nafion (Chemours, Wilmington, DE) as a TS that could be RI-matched to water-based solutions that are compatible with culturing microorganisms in situ. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Downie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Downie et al., 2014</xref> then demonstrated that plant roots with native-like architectures could be grown and visualized in Nafion-based TS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Downie et al., 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, given the novel visualization abilities it provides, the Nafion TS system has only been sparsely utilized for studying biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Downie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Downie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O'Callaghan et al., 2018</xref>). This may be due to (a) the high cost of Nafion and (b) the RI of Nafion (RI = 1.35; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leis et al., 2005</xref>) not matching water closely enough (RI = 1.333) to allow deep (millimeter to centimeter) imaging. Indeed, Ma and colleagues cited these reasons as their motivation for developing an inexpensive hydrogel-bead-based TS system for root phenotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma et al., 2019</xref>). These hydrogel beads, however, are poorly suited for microbial visualization due to their large size (~500 µm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma et al., 2019</xref>), and their susceptibility to degradation by microbes as a carbon source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rice et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite its limitations for plant root imaging studies, as we show here, Nafion remains a useful and versatile model for soil microbial ecology studies when microcosms utilizing only a few micrograms of TS are used; these chambers only require imaging depths of tens or hundreds of microns (and thus are tolerant of slight RI mismatches) and are inexpensive to build. We further show that cryolite (a naturally-occuring sodium aluminum fluoride crystal) is another promising biocompatible TS substrate with high potential for microbial studies. Cryolite’s RI (=1.339) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewis, 2007</xref>) renders it effectively entirely transparent in aqueous solutions. Cryolite has previously been utilized to gain insights into the burrowing behaviors of marine invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flessa, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Francoeur and Dorgan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorgan, 2018</xref>), the swimming behavior of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>), and the spatial patterns of oxygen consumption by a bacterial pseudomonad species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oates et al., 2005</xref>), but its potential for microbial ecology studies remains largely unexplored.</p><p>Gaining greater insight into microbial spatial distributions, migration, and growth dynamics – as well as into the physiological states and ecological functions of individual cells and species – is critical to the future of the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fike et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we critically evaluate the capabilities of both Nafion and cryolite as TS substrates for advancing experimental research in soil microbial ecology by generating three-dimensional matrices containing pore spaces analogous to those bacteria inhabit in terrestrial soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dal Ferro and Morari, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baveye et al., 2018</xref>). We show that TS microcosms made of both Nafion and cryolite are amenable to high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging by fluorescence and confocal microscopy, and additionally are compatible with Raman microspectroscopy – a powerful non-destructive method to obtain physiological information about cell states and microbial metabolic activity and nutrient uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kumar B N et al., 2016</xref>). Both TS substrates enable the measurement of deuterium uptake as a marker of microbial activity, while cryolite-based TS microcosms further enable the measurement of microbial uptake of isotopically labeled (<sup>13</sup>C) carbon.</p><p>We use these tractable, structurally complex TS systems to address an important and experimentally challenging question in soil microbial ecology: how bacteria respond to desiccation and rehydration. Specifically, we ask how metabolically active bacteria are within the TS matrix depending on their proximity to fungal hyphae after a desiccation event. To our knowledge, this is the first study to perform Raman microspectroscopy of cells within a transparent porous matrix, with important potential applications to fundamental problems in soil and sediment microbial ecology. We anticipate that approaches described here will establish these TS systems as novel tools to non-destructively monitor microbial distributions and activity as well as carbon flow through complex, porous, soil-like systems to answer important questions about the ecophysiology of microbes within soils.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overview of TS microcosms</title><p>We used standard microfluidics procedures to generate a visualization chamber out of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a non-toxic gas-permeable silicone polymer commonly used for microfluidics fabrication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; see Materials and methods). The chambers were designed as 3 × 5 mm hexagons (free of 90° corners that can produce regions of low mixing). Inlet and outlet channels were 150 µm wide and 3 mm long, and the inlet and outlet ports themselves were 1 mm circles. Chamber height was 100 µm. As detailed below, the TS matrices within these chambers were optically transparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and enabled the three-dimensional visualization of bacteria held within them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transparent soil (TS) microcosms.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Manufacture process of microcosm fluidics chambers.

(Note that for speed and ease, these fluorescence parameterization experiments were conducted in microwell slides rather than in PDMS microcosms). Nafion particle edges were visible through water by brightfield or differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Downie et al., 2012</xref>), Nafion can be rendered fluorescent in the RFP channels by staining with sulforhodamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that a small proportion (≤1%) of Nafion particles were also slightly autofluorescent in the FITC channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For context, the detected autofluorescence was quite weak: the Nafion was less autofluorescent than LB (lysogeny broth), a common microbiological growth medium. Cryolite particle edges, by contrast, are not visible in water by brightfield microscopy, presumably due to close RI matching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). They are visible by DIC microscopy or other polarized light microscopy and are partly visible in the photomultiplier tube (PMT) channel of a confocal microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Cryolite particles were not able to be stained by sulforhodamine, fluorescein, or Alexa Fluor 647 amine dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). They also were not autofluorescent in the FITC, RFP, or fRFP channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, the cryolite particle matrix can be visualized by staining the pore water around particles with non-toxic fluorescent dyes such as sulforhodamine, fluorescein, or Alexa Fluor dyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These images can be inverted to more clearly visualize the particles themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Pore water in a Nafion particle matrix can be visualized using these same dyes, which is particularly helpful when imaging unsaturated systems where it is important to be able to distinguish liquid- from air-filled pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Because cryolite particles cannot be stained and the particles therefore appear as negative space, particles cannot be distinguished from air-filled pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Nafion is therefore more suitable than cryolite for applications requiring an unsaturated TS matrix.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Visualization of TS matrices.</title><p>Nafion (<bold>A</bold>) and cryolite (<bold>B</bold>) were packed into a microwell microscope slide, saturated with water containing the fluorophore indicated, and imaged on a confocal laser scanning microscope with the noted filter sets.

Bead brightness decreased with depth for both TS substrates, although more steeply for Nafion than for cryolite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A, B and D</xref>). For example, while beads 50 µm into a Nafion microcosm have on average about 40% of the intensity of a bead at the coverslip, beads at the same depth in cryolite only decrease to approximately 60% of their coverslip intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B and D</xref>). The loss of brightness with depth results in more pixelated images and a lower signal-to-background ratio for 100-µm-deep beads in Nafion compared to 100-µm-deep beads in cryolite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The lower variances between beads deeper in the Nafion matrix are due to the relative dimness of these beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, narrow 95% confidence intervals for beads at 75 and 100 µm).

It is considerably cheaper than Nafion (tens of cents per gram as opposed to tens of dollars per gram), readily ground into powder of desired particle sizes by mortar and pestle (as opposed to Nafion, which must be cryomilled or bought pre-ground), and requires no pre-treatment before use (unlike Nafion which requires an extensive number of washes to appropriately functionalize). Cryolite also has the advantage of being extremely optically transparent: micron-sized bacteria can be resolved through even 100 µm of hydrated matrix even under brightfield or DIC illumination on a compound microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This makes cryolite an attractive candidate for soil microbial ecology studies, since bacteria may be visualized even without being fluorescently labeled, obviating the need for genetic modification or staining. Cryolite also has more natural dry-down and wet-up behavior than Nafion (which requires small amounts of surfactants [15% ethylene glycol or 0.1% Tween] to be re-wet after drying; although generally non-toxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blank et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Man et al., 2017</xref>], both of these surfactants can cause cell stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hallsworth et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nielsen et al., 2016</xref>]﻿ and can be potential sources of nutrient contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Man et al., 2017</xref>]).</p><p>An additional consideration for TS materials is their surface charge properties – notably their cation-exchange capacities. After acid washing, the sulfonyl group of Nafion becomes negatively charged with a measured cation exchange capacity of 81 meq per 100 g (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Downie et al., 2012</xref>). Cryolite particles carry a negative charge when in solutions at a pH greater than 1.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kosmulski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lindblad and Duroux, 2017</xref>); they are therefore predicted to participate in cation exchange reactions in the pH ranges found in soils (pH 3 to 10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Slessarev et al., 2016</xref>). For comparison, the point of zero charge for clays are 2.5 for montmorillonite and 4.6 for kaolinite, both of which are important determinants of the cation-exchange capacities of soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kosmulski, 2009</xref>). Thus, both of these TS substrates have cation-exchange capabilities consistent with those expected of natural soils.</p><p>These surface properties may also be important to the surprising observed difference in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 3610 growth habit in Nafion compared to cryolite microcosms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>). Cells were inoculated as single cells at low initial cell densities into TS microcosms. Cell clusters and filaments (indicating microcolony growth) were visible after 48 hr. In liquid MSgg, about 65% of cells grow into filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vlamakis et al., 2008</xref>) like the ones visible in Nafion microcosms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> [left], and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). The hydrophobic Teflon backbone of Nafion may make it resistant to attachment by <italic>B. subtilis</italic>; the cells therefore grow not on the Nafion particles but largely within the MSgg liquid phase in the microcosm, and thus resemble filaments grown in liquid MSgg. Intriguingly, cryolite appears to induce cell cluster formation in B. subtilis, even in liquid MSgg. The cells localize to cryolite particle surfaces where they form small clusters, not filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> [right], and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>). This clustering may be due to the innate surface properties of cryolite, which is less hydrophobic than Nafion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moilanen et al., 2007</xref>). It is an interesting question for future work to determine whether these cryolite-associated cell clusters are physiologically equivalent to bacterial microcolonies that have been observed in native soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grundmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nunan et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>We have demonstrated here, for the first time, that it is possible to acquire Raman spectra from cells through both Nafion and cryolite TS matrices. We chose deuterium and <sup>13</sup>C as stable isotopes because they both produce clear changes in Raman spectra upon cellular uptake, and because they allow questions about microbial activity and carbon metabolism to be explored. D<sub>2</sub>O-treated cells measured through Nafion were clearly distinguishable from H<sub>2</sub>O-treated cells using a conservative threshold. Thus, single-cell D<sub>2</sub>O uptake measurements can be made using Raman microspectroscopy through Nafion-based TS microcosms. In cryolite-based microcosms, however, variability in the CD area led to a large number (20%) of false positives (H<sub>2</sub>O-treated cells misclassified as D<sub>2</sub>O-labeled) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). It is therefore impossible to confidently assign a single cell in cryolite as being deuterium labeled. However, at the population level, comparisons of D<sub>2</sub>O uptake can be made in cryolite – for example, comparing the CD area of 30 cells exposed to a desiccation and rehydration event versus 30 cells that were not exposed to such an event. This limitation was not observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2015</xref>, whose studies measured the much stronger Raman signals from dried cells on aluminum slides.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2015</xref> previously found that an accurate metric for D<sub>2</sub>O uptake is the Percent CD, defined as the area of the CD region over the sum of the CD region and the CH region of the cell spectrum. The CH region is the area between 2800 and 3100 cm<sup>−1</sup>, and represents the carbon-hydrogen bonds in cells, which are depleted in deuterium-labeled cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2015</xref>). In TS microcosms, the CD peak cannot be normalized to the CH region because the measurements are taken in water-filled pores, which produces a large background signal in the CH region due to the Raman spectrum of water itself. In addition, interference from glass and PDMS is high in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). This may contribute to the greater variability in the CD region area when cells are measured in TS matrices than when D<sub>2</sub>O-grown cells are measured on aluminum slides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>That said, even without improvements to the optical setup used to acquire Raman spectra within TS microcosms, we expect that substantial gains could be made in cell spectrum quality through improvements in spectral analysis. In this study, our goal was to determine whether any cell signal could be detected over the background of the TS matrix at all. We did indeed detect the cell signal over the background, and used a very simple method to remove the background signal from the cell spectrum: we simply subtracted the Raman spectrum of a nearby point in x-y space from the acquired cell spectrum. However, more sophisticated techniques for removal of defocused light exist and could be applied to improve the quality of spectra obtained from cells within TS matrices, and therefore increase the amount of information that can be derived from these spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Everall, 2010</xref>). For example, nearest-neighbor deblurring methods, previously used to increase the signal of the focal Raman spectrum over the background of a different out- of-focus substrate, could be applied to TS systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Govil et al., 1993</xref>). A deconvolution-based removal of background signals based on a model of the contribution of the out-of-focus background region to final cell spectrum may also improve the final results.</p><p>Detecting <sup>13</sup>C uptake through TS matrices by Raman microspectroscopy proved more challenging than detecting deuterium: the signal intensities for the <sup>13</sup>C-associated Raman peaks are weaker than the CD peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eichorst et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, we could not distinguish single <sup>13</sup>C-labeled cells from <sup>12</sup>C-labeled cells in Nafion, which may be due to a Nafion-specific C-O-C bond peak in the same region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bribes et al., 1991</xref>); Nafion has other intrinsic Raman peaks in all of the regions that typically indicate <sup>13</sup>C uptake into cellular biomass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bribes et al., 1991</xref>) since it contains a variety of carbon-based bonds. Cryolite, in contrast, has no carbon bonds, but simply a single repeating bond type arranged in a crystal lattice, resulting in a simple Raman spectrum with a single large peak (Figure S4, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lafuente et al., 2016</xref>). This low background allows population-level differences in <sup>13</sup>C uptake to be detected in cryolite TS microcosms.</p><p>We used a binary classifier to categorize cells as either labeled or non-labeled, leading to a tradeoff between sensitivity (lower false-negative rate) and specificity (lower false-positive rate). The cut-off values for classification can be tuned to favor either sensitivity or specificity, depending on the application. For example, Ho and co-workers used a binary classifier to classify methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains based on their Raman spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ho et al., 2019</xref>). Because the consequences of a false negative (misdiagnosing a harmful resistant strain as a benign susceptible strain) were more severe than the reverse, the authors tuned the classifier to favor greater sensitivity (a lower false-negative rate). Similarly, in using Raman spectra to classify isotopically labeled and non-labeled organisms, cut-off values should be chosen with the research application and the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity in mind.</p><p>The ability to spatially monitor the distributions and activities of single and populations of cells in soil-like microcosms opens up the possibility of using these TS systems to address long-standing questions in microbial soil ecology. One such question is the role of fungal hyphae in protecting bacterial cells from desiccation and rehydration stress. As soils regularly undergo drying and rewetting events, microorganisms must rapidly adapt to the cellular stress of enormous changes in osmolarity and nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Alexander, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hallsworth et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kakumanu et al., 2013</xref>). A previous study using NanoSIMS indicated that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells take up water, carbon, and nitrogen from nearby fungal hyphae in dry, oligotrophic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Worrich et al., 2017</xref>). Our Raman microspectroscopy approach is consistent with these results. We found that most <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells (60% to 70% in each replicate microcosm) do not show any detectable uptake of D<sub>2</sub>O after dessication and rehydration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, right panel) indicating their lack of activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2015</xref> were able to detect the CD peak in exponentially growing <italic>E. coli</italic> cells in as soon as 20 min, which is about half of the cell doubling time (47 min), indicating that incorporation of deuterium into macromolecules is detectable well before cell division. In nutrient-replete liquid shaking cultures, lab strains of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> have comparable growth rates. We roughly estimate that the cells in our experiment, which were incubated for 16 hr with no detectable signal, had a doubling time over twice as long as the incubation time (therefore greater than 32 hr), indicating that they were either growing extremely slowly relative to replete liquid shaking conditions (over 50 times slower), or were dormant, non-viable, or dead.</p><p>The high percentage of non-active cells demonstrates how stressful dry-wet cycles can be, even to bacteria such as <italic>Bacillus</italic> that are considered well-adapted to life in the soil. However, of the cells that showed uptake of D<sub>2</sub>O, those attached to <italic>M. fragilis</italic> hyphae took up more deuterium than those cells far from <italic>M. fragilis</italic> hyphae (i.e. 3 mm away). Cells <italic>near</italic> but not <italic>on M. fragilis</italic> hyphae – that is cells within 20 µm of the hyphae – showed slightly but not significantly higher D<sub>2</sub>O uptake than cells far away. Unlike other single-cell resolution stable isotoping methods like NanoSIMS, Raman microspectroscopy in TS microcosms preserves pore structure since it does not require thin sectioning or dehydration of the sample. Thus, this approach allows measurement of cells not only attached to hyphae, but also those attached to nearby, undisturbed particles.</p><p>Improvements in microscopic methods, Raman spectrum analysis, and microcosm reproducibility could be made to further extend the utility of TS microcosms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sharma, 2019</xref>). Our method currently has the same limitations as most current microscopy-based methods for investigating environmental microbes: notably, the difficulty of visualizing non-fluorescently tagged, non-genetically tractable microorganisms. Using TS microcosms to study mixed microbial communities therefore presents a significant, but not insurmountable, challenge. While not universally applicable, multiple methods have recently been developed to facilitate the genetic manipulation of wild environmental bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brophy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wiles et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2020</xref>), which could enable the fluorescent labeling of native bacteria of interest. In the absence of this possibility, morphologically distinct microbes, particularly those of different sizes, could, in principle, be distinguished in TS microcosms. Although, as noted above in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, slight distortions in the axial plane may make it more difficult to distinguish rod- from sphere-shaped bacteria at deeper depths, future work could potentially use data obtained from oblong beads of varying sizes to develop normalization algorithms to account for such diffraction issues. Vital dyes such as lectin-binding dyes could be perfused gently into the system to stain cells in situ and thereby increase contrast. If fixation is an option for the experiment in question, FISH or other fixed staining approaches could be used.</p><p>There also exists the intriguing possibility of conducing ‘live’ Raman microspectroscopy within the TS microcosms: using Raman spectroscopy not for stable isotope probing (as validated here), but to distinguish and track different microbes non-destructively in situ. There is growing evidence indicating that such strain-specific identifications are possible based solely on the inherent Raman spectra of particular microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Manoharan et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rösch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gan et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, for some strains, Raman spectroscopy can even distinguish cells with distinct physiological states within a single strain – for example, sporulating <italic>Bacillus</italic> cells can be distinguished from vegetative cells by peaks indicating the presence of calcium dipicolinic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghiamati et al., 1992</xref>). Obtaining a better view of these Raman signatures may enable us to utilize Raman microspectroscopy to nondestructively monitor bacterial distributions and spatial organizations within TS microcosms. When the field of microbial ecology as a whole is able to routinely use native cell characteristics (such as these Raman signatures or inherent cellular autofluorescence) to identify ‘wild’ microbes, then this TS microcosm-based method could also be able to be applied towards visualizing native environmental microbes.</p><p>In terms of experimental workflow, since the microcosms can be manufactured in batch, the rate-limiting step of utilizing these microcosms (prior to Raman measurements) was the washing steps. The washing and inoculation of microcosms are ideally done on the day of the experiment to maintain sterility, which requires a series of 20 min to 1.5 hr washes (~4 hr of washing total) per microcosm. In addition, since each microcosm requires its own syringe connected to a syringe pump for washing, the number of microcosms that can be prepped simultaneously depends on the number and capacity of syringe pumps available. We had two syringe pumps that handled two syringes each, allowing four microcosms to be washed in parallel. After the washing steps, each microcosm can also be visually checked by microscopy prior to Raman spectroscopy to ensure initial even cell distributions. After inoculation, the rate-limiting step is the manual counting of cells with Raman spectroscopy. A relatively experienced worker can measure about 30 cells with associated background spectra in about 1 to 2 hr.</p><p>Further research is needed to definitively assess the reproducibility of TS microcosms. Here, to obtain three replicate microcosms, approximately eight microcosms were initially manufactured. Based on their full particle packing density and strong PDMS-glass seals, six of these were selected for washing; five were retained for inoculation with fungal spores based on their maintenance of high packing density (i.e. minimal loss of particles during washing); four of these were inoculated with bacterial cells based on their well-distributed hyphal growth; and the final three microcosms were used for Raman analysis due to their comparable bacterial cell distributions. For the SIP baseline studies included here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), each boxplot represents the variance within one bacterial culture inoculated into one microcosm. Thus, even within a single biological replicate within a single microcosm, the variation between cells is substantial, although the differences between differently labeled cell populations are detectable and significant. In the D<sub>2</sub>O uptake experiment after wet-dry cycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), each replicate represents a single biological culture within a different microcosm, and there are three such replicates in total. The same trends were not observed in each microcosm; as discussed above, ‘replicate’ was itself a significant source of variation. Similar heterogeneity and biological variability have been noted even in other, simpler imaging microcosms than those described here. Deng and co-workers, for example, used nearly identical replicate PDMS-based microfluidic devices that mimic the pore properties of soils, and monitored drying of these microcosms under carefully controlled humidity and temperature conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2015</xref>). Even so, variation between their microcosms was considerable, although major trends were still detected.</p><p>Thus, although our transparent soil microcosms are considerably simpler and less heterogenous than true soils -- being composed of a single particle type, known particle size distributions, no biological or organic matter at the time of inoculation, and possessing geometric constraints -- there remain several sources of heterogeneity between microcosms. The major cause is particle packing; differences in particle density leads to different rates of liquid flow through the microcosms as well as different distributions of cells within the particle matrix. Careful manufacturing technique (filling PDMS chambers as fully as possible with particles before sealing, discarding microcosms that are under- or over-packed) can help mitigate this problem, as well as the use of narrow particle size distributions, and using overall smaller particle sizes (less than 40 μm). In addition to these efforts, running multiple replicate experiments remains important for increasing confidence in findings and the sensitivity of assays. Alternatively, if the heterogeneity cannot be constrained, it can be measured. An entire microcosm can be imaged in 3D by confocal microscopy prior to or after inoculation in order to extract pore size volumes and distributions (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">do Nascimento et al., 2019</xref>). Smaller microcosms and coarser-resolution imaging would enable more rapid imaging of the full volume of the microcosm for this purpose.</p><p>In conclusion, the TS model microcosms we describe here – in which the locations, morphologies, growth dynamics, movement, and metabolic states of microbes can be non-destructively resolved – open up the possibility of directly testing many outstanding questions in soil microbial ecology. These include investigations into previously occluded processes such as predation and lysis dynamics, microbial migration patterns, conjugation and transduction networks, and interspecies interactions. The inert nature of the TS substrates described here enables the direct examination of the effects of controlled amounts of nutrients and carbon on soil microbiota. Moreover, extensions of these described TS microcosms with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH, to identify microbes and their locations) or fluorescent transcriptional reporter strains (to track bacterial gene expression in native soil-like environments) will further expand the impact of these systems for the study of soil microbial ecology and ecophysiology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>)</td><td>NCIB3610 <break/>(abbreviated as 3610);

Briefly, 30 g PowdION Nafion powder (IonPower, New Castle, DE, USA) was suspended in 300 mL 15% KOH/35% DMSO aqueous solution in a glass beaker and heated for 5 hr at 80°C to hydrolyze Nafion.

To convert Nafion to ion-exchanging form, particles were suspended in 15% nitric acid and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr in a glass beaker, then washed with Milli-Q water, and resuspended with nitric acid and left at room temperature overnight. To remove impurities from Nafion surfaces, particles were washed three times with Milli-Q water, incubated in 1 M sulfuric acid for 1 hr at 65°C in a glass beaker, washed with Milli-Q water, and incubated again at 65°C for 1 hr. Particles were then washed three times with Milli-Q water, suspended in 3% hydrogen peroxide, incubated at 65°C for 1 hr, and washed three times with Milli-Q water.

Single <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells were measured by Raman microspectroscopy as described in the previous section. <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells measured were classified as either ‘on’ (cells attached to <italic>M. fragilis</italic> hyphae), ‘near’ (cells attached to Nafion on <italic>M. fragilis</italic>-inoculated side of microcosm, within a 20 µm radius of the nearest hypha), or ‘far’ (cells attached to Nafion on the side of the microcosm lacking <italic>M. fragilis</italic> hyphae). ‘Far’ cells are 3 mm or more away from nearest <italic>M. fragilis</italic> hyphae.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We sincerely thank: Carol Arnosti, Alecia Septer, James Umbanhowar, and Peter White for comments on an early draft of the manuscript; Fletcher Halliday (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) for the kind gift of the wild <italic>Mucor fragilis</italic> strain used in this study; Ethan Garner (Harvard University) for the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> codon-optimized fluorescent protein gene sequences used in strain construction; Lionel Dupuy (James Hutton Institute) for sharing detailed protocols on Nafion functionalization; the UNC Biology Department Light Microscopy Core facility for use of the Zeiss 710 confocal laser scanning microscope and Tony Purdue for training and assistance on this instrument; the UNC Hooker Light Microscopy Core facility for use of the Zeiss 880 confocal laser scanning microscope and Robert Currin for training and assistance on this instrument; Jamie Winshell (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) for assistance in strain construction; and the Division of Microbial Ecology (University of Vienna) for use of their Zeiss AxioObserver epifluorescence microscope, Leica confocal laser scanning microscope, and Horiba high-resolution confocal Raman microspectroscopy system, as well as Markus Schmid for training and assistance on these instruments.

Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The submission by Sharma et al., (2020) for a Tools and Resources article is well-suited for <italic>eLife</italic>. The authors have provided a critical advance for microbial ecology by establishing and verifying protocols for using transparent soils (made of either Nafion or cryolite) for imaging of live microbes. The reviewers all agree that this research constitutes an important technological advance and that no additional experiments are required. However, each reviewer has noted specific places that need clarification, particularly in some data explanations and in stating the capabilities of the two transparent soil compositions. I encourage the authors to address each of the reviewers' suggestions in the resubmission of this manuscript.</p><p>The study by Sharma et al., evaluates previously published, but not regularly or widely used, methods for designing and analysing microbial soil communities. The properties of the two TS microcosms are assessed and compared, and their compatibility with isotope labelling and Raman microspectrometry is evaluated. Microbial ecology is currently in a desperate need of tools, which are reproducible, can be run in parallel, can be analysed by non-constructive sampling (to preserve spatial structure), are compatible with microscopy and, most importantly, mimics conditions faced by microorganisms in the soil. For this reason, I find the study very timely and relevant to a wide span of microbial ecologists.</p><p>For many decades, in situ high-resolution microscopy studies in soils have been limited by this medium's incredible high complexity and opacity. This manuscript describes a benchmark study focused on developing two transparent soil matrices (Nafion and cryolite) for micron-scale research applications in microbial species interactions, microbial ecology, and microbial ecophysiology. The authors studied the pros and cons of both matrices in terms of their compatibility with biology (toxicity, pore-spaces, etc), optical and fluorescence microscopy and Raman microspectroscopy. After describing a series of control experiments that lay the basis for an entire new field of studying soil microbes under in situ conditions, they then apply their new platform to studying the anabolic activity of Bacillus cells after a simulated dry-wet cycle. They achieve this by measuring the uptake of deuterium (<sup>2</sup>H) from heavy water (<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O) into fatty acids and proteins via single cell resolved and non-destructive Raman microspectroscopy, a comparatively new and yet under-utilized microscopy technique with high potential for the biological sciences.</p><p>This study provides the field of (soil and other) microbial ecologists with a new approach to studying microbial physiology and cell-cell interactions under (close to) in situ conditions, at high resolution (sub-micron to micron-scale), and at non-invasive (non-destructive) conditions. This is an exciting new approach with the potential to transform the way soil (sediment etc) microbial ecology studies are performed.</p><p>This is one of those very few manuscripts where a reviewer can do nothing but highlight the author's excellent, sound work and can do pretty much nothing else than point out a few ways how the language could be improved (but nothing else). All experiments have been excellently conducted, are well described (please take care of the very few exceptions outlined below), and are scientifically and statistically sound. In contrast to many other studies these days, the authors have done their homework and ran many necessary controls before applying their new technique on a research question. This was a great read!</p><p>In the manuscript by Sharma et al., the authors provide methods and further validation of two materials (Nafion and cryolite) for use as transparent soils in microbial ecology. This manuscript provides a valuable service to the community by expanding physical models for measuring bacterial interactions in mm-scale communities, especially for cross-kingdoms interactions. The materials and experimental designs are in an &quot;alpha&quot; version, providing a platform for more innovation and optimization.

Using TS microcosms to study mixed microbial communities therefore presents a significant, but not insurmountable, challenge. While not universally applicable, multiple methods have recently been developed to facilitate the genetic manipulation of wild environmental bacteria (10.1038/s41564-018-0216-5, 10.1128/mBio.01877-18, and 10.1111/1462-2920.15116), which could enable the fluorescent labeling of native bacteria of interest. In the absence of this possibility, morphologically distinct microbes, particularly those of different sizes, could, in principle, be distinguished in TS microcosms (although, as noted above, slight distortions in the axial plane may make it more difficult to distinguish rod- from sphere-shaped bacteria at deeper depths). Vital dyes such as lectin-binding dyes could be perfused gently into the system to stain cells in situ and thereby increase contrast. If fixation is an option for the experiment in question, FISH or other fixed staining approaches could be used.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please address a lack information on reproducibility of microcosms (although some is provided in the assessment of use of the Raman technology) and number of replicates that can be handled and run at a reasonable effort (i.e. how many microcosms can be handled at the same time in the lab with a 'normal' workload)? In line with this, it could be worth stating, how many biological and technical replicates were analysed to provide data presented and their reproducibility.</p></disp-quote><p>The following paragraphs were added to the Discussion section to address these questions of reproducibility and experimental workflow:</p><p>“In terms of experimental workflow, since the microcosms can be manufactured in batch, the rate-limiting step of utilizing these microcosms (prior to Raman measurements), was the washing steps. The washing and inoculation of microcosms are ideally done on the day of the experiment to maintain sterility, which requires a series of 20 minute to 1.5 hour washes (~4 hours of washing total) per microcosm. In addition, since each microcosm requires its own syringe connected to a syringe pump for washing, the number of microcosms that can be prepped simultaneously depends on the number and capacity of syringe pumps available. We had two syringe pumps that handled two syringes each, allowing four microcosms to be washed in parallel. After the washing steps, each microcosm must also be visually checked by microscopy prior to Raman spectroscopy to ensure initial even cell distributions. After inoculation, the rate-limiting step is the manual counting of cells with Raman spectroscopy. A relatively experienced worker can measure about 30 cells with associated background spectra in about one to two hours.</p><p>Further research is needed to definitively assess the reproducibility of TS microcosms. Here, to obtain three replicate microcosms, approximately eight microcosms were initially manufactured. Based on their full particle packing density and strong PDMS-glass seals, six of these were selected for washing; five were retained for inoculation with fungal spores based on their maintenance of high packing density (i.e. minimal loss of particles during washing); four of these were inoculated with bacterial cells based on their well-distributed hyphal growth; and the final three microcosms were used for Raman analysis due to their comparable bacterial cell distributions. For the SIP baseline studies included here (Figure 6 and Figure 7), each boxplot represents the variance within one bacterial culture inoculated into one microcosm. Thus, even within a single biological replicate within a single microcosm, the variation between cells is substantial, although the differences between differently labeled cell populations are detectable and significant. In the D<sub>2</sub>O uptake experiment after wet-dry cycling (Figure 8), each replicate represents a single biological culture within a different microcosm, and there are three such replicates in total. The same trends were not observed in each microcosm; as discussed above, ‘replicate’ was itself a significant source of variation. Similar heterogeneity and biological variability have been noted even in other, simpler imaging microcosms than those described here. Deng et al., 2015, for example, used nearly identical replicate PDMS-based microfluidic devices that mimic the pore properties of soils, and monitored drying of these microcosms under carefully controlled humidity and temperature conditions. Even so, variation between their microcosms was considerable, although major trends were still detected.</p><p>Thus, although our transparent soil microcosms are considerably simpler and less heterogenous than true soils -- being composed of a single particle type, known particle size distributions, no biological or organic matter at the time of inoculation, and possessing geometric constraints -- there remain several sources of heterogeneity between microcosms. The major cause is particle packing; differences in particle density leads to different rates of liquid flow through the microcosms as well as different distributions of cells within the particle matrix. Careful manufacturing technique (filling PDMS chambers as fully as possible with particles before sealing, discarding microcosms that are under- or over-packed) can help mitigate this problem, as well as the use of narrow particle size distributions, and using overall smaller particle sizes (less than 40 μm). In addition to these efforts, running multiple replicate experiments remains important for increasing confidence in findings and the sensitivity of assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is not clear how much the autofluorescence of Nafion will interfere with weak fluorescent signals (from e.g. bioreporters or FISH probes).</p></disp-quote><p>The following was added (subsection “Visualization of TS matrices”): “For context, the detected autofluorescence was quite weak: the Nafion is less autofluorescent than LB (Lysogeny Broth), a common microbiological growth medium.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Discussion section, it would be a stimulating read to add a few sentences on the potential of live Raman microscopy in TS to the manuscript!</p></disp-quote><p>The following section was added to address this question (Discussion section):</p><p>“There also exists the intriguing possibility of conducing “live” Raman microspectroscopy within the TS microcosms: using Raman spectroscopy not for stable isotope probing (as validated here), but to distinguish and track different microbes non-destructively in situ. There is growing evidence indicating that such strain-specific identifications are possible based solely on the inherent Raman spectra of particular microbes (Manoharan et al., 1990; Gan et al., 2017; Harz et al., 2005; Harz et al., 2009; Rösch et al., 2005). Indeed, for some strains, Raman spectroscopy can even distinguish cells with distinct physiological states within a single strain – for example, sporulating Bacillus cells can be distinguished from vegetative cells by peaks indicating the presence of calcium dipicolinic acid (Ghiamati et al., 1992). Obtaining a better view of these Raman signatures may enable us to utilize Raman microspectroscopy to nondestructively monitor bacterial distributions and spatial organizations within TS microcosms. When the field of microbial ecology as a whole is able to routinely use native cell characteristics (such as these Raman signatures or inherent cellular autofluorescence) to identify ‘wild’ microbes, then this TS microcosm-based method would also be able to be applied towards visualizing native environmental microbes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Subsection “Optical properties of TS microcosms” and throughout: rephrase to &quot;microbial cells&quot; rather than bacterial cells.</p></disp-quote><p>This change has been made throughout the manuscript except where bacterial cells are being explicitly referenced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection “Optical properties of TS microcosms”: The diffraction for a presumably circular bead was distorted in the xz, suggesting that rod-shaped organisms would be difficult to resolve fully at 100 µm in either Nafion or cryolite.

Is there a way to control for this in the future?</p></disp-quote><p>The following paragraphs were added to the Discussion section.</p><p>“Berry and colleagues (2015) previously found that an accurate metric for D<sub>2</sub>O uptake is the Percent CD, defined as the area of the CD region over the sum of the CD region and the CH region of the cell spectrum. The CH region is the area between 2800 and 3100 cm-1, and represents the carbon-hydrogen bonds in cells, which are depleted in deuterium-labeled cells (Berry et al., 2015). In TS microcosms, the CD peak cannot be normalized to the CH region because the measurements are taken in water-filled pores, which produces a large background signal in the CH region due to the Raman spectrum of water itself. In addition, interference from glass and PDMS is high in this region (Lee et al., 2019). This may contribute to the greater variability in the CD region area when cells are measured in TS matrices than when D<sub>2</sub>O-grown cells are measured on aluminium slides (Berry, 2015).</p><p>That said, even without improvements to the optical setup used to acquire Raman spectra within TS microcosms, we expect that substantial gains could be made in cell spectrum quality through improvements in spectral analysis. In this study, our goal was to determine whether any cell signal could be detected over the background of the TS matrix at all. We did indeed detect the cell signal over the background, and used a very simple method to remove the background signal from the cell spectrum: we simply subtracted the Raman spectrum of a nearby point in x-y space from the acquired cell spectrum. However, more sophisticated techniques for removal of defocused light exist and could be applied to improve the quality of spectra obtained from cells within TS matrices, and therefore increase the amount of information that can be derived from these spectra (Everall, 2010). For example. nearest-neighbor deblurring methods, previously used to increase the signal of the focal Raman spectrum over the background of a different out- of-focus substrate, could be applied to TS systems (Govil et al., 1991). A deconvolution-based removal of background signals based on a model of the contribution of the out-of-focus background region to final cell spectrum may also improve the final results.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Subsection “TS microcosms are compatible with Raman microspectroscopy and enable in situ single-cell detection of microbial activity as measured by uptake of D<sub>2</sub>O”: These cut-offs values are ok in the context of your benchmark study but please add a short discussion how more conservative rates for false positive and false negative could be reached by choosing different cut-off values.</p></disp-quote><p>The following paragraph was added to the Discussion section:</p><p>“We used a binary classifier to categorize cells as either labeled or non-labeled, where there is a tradeoff between sensitivity (lower false-negative rate) and specificity (lower false-positive rate). The cut-off values for classification can be tuned to favor either sensitivity or specificity, depending on the application. For example, Ho and co-workers used a binary classifier to classify methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains based on their Raman spectra (Ho et al., 2019). Because the consequences of a false negative (misdiagnosing a harmful resistant strain as a benign susceptible strain) were more severe than the reverse, the authors tuned the classifier to favor greater sensitivity (a lower false-negative rate). Similarly, in using Raman spectra to classify isotopically labeled and non-labeled organisms, cut-off values should be chosen with the research application and the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity in mind.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Subsection “<italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells attached to dead fungal biomass are more metabolically active after a dry-wet cycle than cells far away from fungal hyphae”: Did the authors have another way to measure whether cells were attached to surfaces?</p></disp-quote><p>The following line was added (subsection “<italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells attached to dead fungal biomass are more metabolically active after a dry-wet cycle than cells far away from fungal hyphae”): “Attachment was measured by attempting to gently pull cells away from their substrate using an optical tweezer (1,064-nm laser); attached cells did not detach from the substrate when pulled.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Discussion section: These lines state the most significant insights from this research.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this insight and moved these sentences to the top of the Discussion section to further highlight them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Discussion section: Please put these results into perspective with the expected growth rate of Bacillus under regular conditions and what the detection limit of deuterium depending on growth rate is; this can be cited away (Berry, 2015 SOI's might have all the info) but it's important to draw the readers’ attention to the fact that longer incubation in presence of heavy water might have changed the conclusion of how many cells are active overall (independent of the rate at which they are active).</p></disp-quote><p>The following was added to the Discussion section: “Berry and co-workers (2015) were able to detect the CD peak in exponentially growing <italic>E. coli</italic> cells in as soon as 20 minutes, which is about half of the cell doubling time (47 minutes), indicating that incorporation of deuterium into macromolecules is detectable well before cell division.

The particle size distribution is therefore looser and less constrained than in a PDMS-based TS microcosm.

Cells were inoculated as single cells at low initial cell densities into TS microcosms. Cell clusters and filaments (indicating microcolony growth) were visible after 48 hours. In liquid MSgg, about 65% of cells grow into filaments (Vlamakis et al., 2008) like the ones visible in Nafion microcosms (Figure 4A, Figure 5A [left], and Video 1 and Video 2). The hydrophobic Teflon backbone of Nafion may make it resistant to attachment by <italic>B. subtilis</italic>; the cells therefore grow not on the Nafion particles but largely within the MSgg liquid phase in the microcosm, and thus resemble filaments grown in liquid MSgg.

The cells localize to cryolite particle surfaces where they form small clusters, not filaments (Figure 4B, Figure 5A [right], and Video 3 and Video 4).
