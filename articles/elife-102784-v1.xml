Our previous work identified a chromatin role for IκBα, the master regulator of NF-κB signaling, that is critical for the proper regulation of various tissue stem cells. Here, we found that IκBα accumulates specifically in the chromatin fraction of mouse pluripotent stem cells. IκBα depletion does not affect NF-kB-dependent transcription, but causes a profound epigenetic rewiring in pluripotent stem cells, including alterations in H3K27me3, a histone mark catalyzed by Polycomb repression complex 2. Chromatin changes induced by IκBα depletion affect a subset of pluripotency genes and are associated with altered gene transcription. At the cellular level, IκBα-deficient embryonic stem cells are arrested in a naive pluripotency state when cultured in serum/LIF conditions and fail to exit pluripotency under differentiation conditions. By constructing separation-of-function mutants, we show that the effects of IκBα in regulating stem cell pluripotency are NF-κB-independent, but mainly rely on its chromatin-related function. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism by which IκBα participates in the regulation of the pluripotent state of mouse embryonic stem cells and shed light on the interplay between inflammatory signals and the regulation of pluripotency.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ikappabalpha</kwd><kwd>NFKBIA</kwd><kwd>NFKB</kwd><kwd>pluripotency

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) pluripotency is characterized by the capacity to generate all somatic and germline lineages both in vitro and in vivo, depending on the culture conditions. When cultured in serum plus Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) (Serum/LIF), murine ESCs (mESCs) include cells interconverting to different metastable states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Festuccia et al., 2013</xref>) that either resemble preimplantation blastocyst (naïve pluripotency) or post-implantation (primed pluripotency) embryonic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Graf and Stadtfeld, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martinez Arias and Brickman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pera and Rossant, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang and Wu, 2022</xref>). The heterogeneity of mESCs in Serum/LIF is reduced by culturing them in the presence of GSK3β and MEK1/2 inhibitors (CHIR99021 and PD0325901, respectively) along with LIF (2i/LIF). Under these conditions, mESCs enter a ground state of naïve pluripotency characterized by self-renewal activity while suppressing any pro-differentiating signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ying et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marks et al., 2012</xref>). This pluripotent state closely resembles the inner cell mass of the E4.0 mouse preimplantation blastocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boroviak et al., 2015</xref>). After implantation, pluripotent capability of the mouse embryo (E5.5) becomes restricted to Epiblast Stem Cells (EpiSCs), which represent a primed pluripotent state, characterized by coexpression of pluripotency and lineage specification markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brons et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tesar et al., 2007</xref>). EpiSCs can give rise to cells from the three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm), albeit their contribution to chimeras or to germ cells is greatly compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pera and Rossant, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weinberger et al., 2016</xref>).

Canonical NF-κB signaling is triggered by the IKK kinase complex, which induces the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα, leading to nuclear translocation of the NF-κB factors (e.g. p50/p65) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). However, we have previously identified a nuclear IκBα function, which is critical for tissue stem cell homeostasis and the proper differentiation of epidermal, intestinal, and hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mulero et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marruecos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marruecos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thambyrajah et al., 2024</xref>).

Whereas cytoplasmic IκBα is detected in the different states and its levels decrease after differentiation, in agreement with NF-κB activity as a promoter of differentiation, we specifically detected chromatin-bound IκBα in the naïve pluripotent stem cells. Importantly, IκBα depletion in ESCs did not affect NF-κB activity but it stabilizes the naïve (2i/LIF-like) state of pluripotency under Serum/LIF conditions, displaying an epigenetic rewiring, including changes in the PRC2-dependent H3K27me3 histone mark and impacting proximal and distal regulation of pluripotent genes. Using a new Separation-Of-Function (SOF) IκBα mutants, we have now definitively demonstrated that chromatin-bound IκBα is required for naïve pluripotency exit of mESCs in an NF-κB-independent manner. Overall, we identified IκBα as a novel key player in the regulation of the exit from naïve-to-primed pluripotency and essential for the activation of gene programs involved in germ layer specification.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IκBα and NF-κB have opposite expression dynamics in naïve pluripotent cells</title><p>Due to the prominent role of NF-κB signaling in mESCs regulation, we analyzed the expression pattern of the different NF-κB members, including the IκB inhibitors in the three defined pluripotent stages: ground state of naïve pluripotency (2i/LIF), naïve pluripotency (Serum/LIF), and primed pluripotency (Epiblast Stem Cells or EpiSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang and Wu, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Using mESCs to investigate the role of IκBα in pluripotency maintenance and differentiation, we discovered that the absence of IκBα severely impairs the exit of pluripotency. Furthermore, IκBα-KO mESCs stabilizes the ground state of naïve pluripotency under Serum/LIF conditions, shedding light on its function as a critical regulator of the transition from naïve to primed pluripotency. While IκBα is commonly known for its role as an inhibitor of the NF-κB signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), our laboratory has previously furnished compelling evidence of its alternative role through its interaction with histones and other chromatin components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mulero et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marruecos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilera et al., 2004</xref>). We have demonstrated that chromatin-bound IκBα plays a crucial role in regulating skin and intestinal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mulero et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marruecos et al., 2020</xref>), hematopoietic stem cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thambyrajah et al., 2022</xref>), and it influences the regenerative capacity of these tissues, and in some cases, their susceptibility to neoplastic transformation. Disentangling the chromatin-related function of IκBα from its canonical role as an inhibitor of NF-κB has been challenging, making it difficult to determine its truly biological significance. To tackle this challenge, we engineered separation-of-function (SOF) mutants of IκBα, as detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Álvarez-Villanueva et al., 2023</xref>, by identifying specific residues that are essential for binding either NF-κB elements or histones. Interestingly, we have shown that only the histone-binding proficient IκBα mutant (IκBα<sup>ΔNF-κB</sup>), which lacks the ability to bind to NF-κB, has the capability to reverse the stabilization of the ground state observed in IκBα-KO mESCs. This is sufficient to facilitate their exit from the state of naïve pluripotency, restoring their full differentiation potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The involvement of NF-κB in pluripotency has been a subject of prior investigation. Studies have revealed that pluripotent cells display a dampened inflammatory signaling pathway, which is induced upon pluripotency dissolution and activation of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Torres and Watt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo, 2019</xref>). However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the attenuated status of NF-κB during this stage remain incompletely understood. A recent work has shed light on a potential regulatory axis involving ATG5-β- TrCP1-NF-κB, proposing it as a mechanism that diminishes NF-κB activity by stabilizing the IκBα protein in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2024</xref>). In any case, since modification of canonical NF-κB activity directly impacts on the levels IκBα expression, the previous NF-κB-associated phenotypes should be reevaluated considering this chromatin role of IκBα. Furthermore, the expression of IκBα<sup>ΔChromatin</sup>, which retains the inhibitory function of NF-κB, failed to mitigate the ground state stabilization observed in IκBα-KO mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This finding suggests that the observed role of IκBα in regulating the exit from naïve pluripotency is not due to NF-κB inhibition. In fact, there is evidence that the chromatin function of IκBα is an ancestral function preceding its role as NF-κB inhibitor. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<italic>C. elegans</italic>), which lacks NF-κB orthologs but possesses two homologs of IκBα, the absence of IκBα orthologs has severe multi-organ differentiation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brena et al., 2020</xref>). This observation further supports the notion that the chromatin-related function of IκBα plays a fundamental role in developmental processes, independent of its canonical role in NF-κB signaling. Nonetheless, differences in the expression level of SOF IκBα mutants, with the IκBα<sup>ΔChromatin</sup> expressed at lower protein levels compared to the IκBα<sup>ΔNF-κB</sup>, may also impact in the rescue phenotype.</p><p>We have observed that IκBα-KO mESCs exhibit epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles resembling the ground state of naïve pluripotency under Serum/LIF culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In this regard, the fact that IκBα is preferentially located in the chromatin of mESCs cultured in Serum/LIF, when they exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity, suggests that IκBα might act as a regulator of this heterogeneity. One potential explanation might be that IκBα could be affecting the stability of fluctuating transcription factors, which is crucial to mediate the pluripotent-to-differentiation balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martinez Arias and Brickman, 2011</xref>). Thus, the lack of IκBα might stabilize those transcription factors that would favor the ground-state observed in IκBα-KO mESCs cultured in Serum/LIF. Although IκBα KO mESCs exhibit a transcriptional phenotype and hypomethylation state that resembles the ground state of naïve pluripotency, there are only modest changes on histone marks associated to enhancers (H3K27Ac) or gene regulation (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3). Altogether indicates that further experiments are required to fully elucidate the effect of chromatin IκBα. Moreover, the differences in murine and human pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weinberger et al., 2016</xref>) point out the necessity to address the real impact of IκBα modulation in the stabilization of the ground state in human pluripotent stem cells.</p><p>In summary, our work establishes that IκBα mediates the exit from naïve pluripotency by modulating the activation of naïve pluripotency genes. Importantly, this newly identified role of IκBα operates independently of its canonical function in inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. Our findings underscore the intricate interplay between inflammation and pluripotency status, revealing a previously unrecognized complexity in their interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>mESC line ES-E14TG2a (ATCC; Cat #CRL-1821) was cultured on plastic dishes precoated with 0.1% (w/v) Gelatin (Sigma; Cat #G2500-100G) in Serum/LIF medium.

Obtained log2 fold change values were shrunken with apeglm shrinkage estimator R package (v1.20.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Raw p- values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) between IκBα-KO and IκBα-WT samples were called with adjusted p-values (FDR)&lt;0.05 and absolute shrunken log2 Fold change &gt;1.

Purified genomic DNA was quantified with Qubit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Infinium Mouse Methylation BeadChip (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) arrays were used to profile DNA methylation genome-wide. This platform allows over 285,000 methylation sites per sample to be interrogated at single-nucleotide resolution. The samples were bisulfite converted using EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA) and were hybridized in the array following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>DNA methylation data analysis</title><p>The DNA methylation profile of the studied samples was assessed using the Infinium Mouse Methylation BeadChip Array (~285,000 methylation sites) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia-Prieto et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, raw signal intensities were obtained with GenomeStudio Software 2011.1 (Illumina) and DNA methylation beta values were computed from raw IDAT files using GenomeStudio default normalization with control probes and background subtraction. Quality control steps to remove erratic probe signals were performed within the R statistical environment (v4.0.3). We removed probes with detection p-value &gt;0.01, genotyping probes, and manufacturing flagged (MFG) probes described in the Illumina manifest file (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.illumina.com/downloads/infinium-mouse-methylation-manifest-file.html">https://support.illumina.com/downloads/infinium-mouse-methylation-manifest-file.html</ext-link>). The differentially methylated probes (DMPs) between IκBα-WT and IκBα-KO samples were computed separately for each time point (mESCs and EBs at 96 hr) by deriving a linear model with the limma R package (v3.46.0). Each condition included 3 samples per time point. DMPs with adjusted p-value (FDR)&lt;0.05 and absolute mean methylation beta value difference between conditions &gt;0.3 were considered significant.

It follows from previous work that identified a chromatin-specific role for IκBa in the regulation of tissue stem cell differentiation. The work presented here shows that a fraction of IκBa specifically associates with chromatin in pluripotent stem cells. Using three Nfkbia-knockout lines, the authors show that IκBa ablation impairs the exit from pluripotency, with embryonic bodies (an in vitro model of mESC multi-lineage differentiation) still expressing high levels of pluripotency markers after sustained exposure to differentiation signals. The maintenance of aberrant pluripotency gene expression under differentiation conditions is accompanied by pluripotency-associated epigenetic profiles of DNA methylation and histone marks. Using elegant separation of function mutants identified in a separate study, the authors generate versions of IκBa that are either impaired in histone/chromatin binding or NF-κB binding. They show that the provision of the WT IκBa, or the NF-κB-binding mutant can rescue the changes in gene expression driven by loss of IκBa, but the chromatin-binding mutant can not.

the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study probes the role of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBa in the regulation of pluripotency in mouse embyronic stem cells (mESCs). It follows from previous work that identified a chromatin-specific role for IκBa in the regulation of tissue stem cell differentiation. The work presented here shows that a fraction of IκBa specifically associates with chromatin in pluripotent stem cells. Using three Nfkbia-knockout lines, the authors show that IκBa ablation impairs the exit from pluripotency, with embryonic bodies (an in vitro model of mESC multi-lineage differentiation) still expressing high levels of pluripotency markers after sustained exposure to differentiation signals. The maintenance of aberrant pluripotency gene expression under differentiation conditions is accompanied by pluripotency-associated epigenetic profiles of DNA methylation and histone marks. Using elegant separation of function mutants identified in a separate study, the authors generate versions of IκBa that are either impaired in histone/chromatin binding or NF-κB binding. They show that the provision of the WT IκBa, or the NF-κB-binding mutant can rescue the changes in gene expression driven by loss of IκBa, but the chromatin-binding mutant can not. Thus the study identifies a chromatin-specific, NF-κB-independent role of IκBa as a regulator of exit from pluripotency.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strengths of the manuscript lie in: (a) the use of several orthogonal assays to support the conclusions on the effects of exit from pluripotency; (b) the use of three independent clonal Nfkbia-KO mESC lines (lacking IκBa), which increase confidence in the conclusions; and (c) the use of separation of function mutants to determine the relative contributions of the chromatin-associated and NF-κB-associated IκBa, which would otherwise be very difficult to unpick.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>In this reviewer's view, the term &quot;differentiation&quot; is used inappropriately in this manuscript. The data showing aberrant expression of pluripotency markers during embryoid body formation are supported by several lines of evidence and are convincing. However, the authors call the phenotype of Nfkbia-KO cells a &quot;differentiation impairment&quot; while the data on differentiation markers are not shown (beyond the fact that H3K4me1, marking poised enhancers, is reduced in genes underlying GO processes associated with differentiation and organ development). Data on differentiation marker expression from the transcriptomic and embryoid body immunofluorescent experiments, for example, should be at hand without the need to conduct many more experiments and would help to support the conclusions of the study or make them more specific. The lack of probing the differentiation versus pluripotency genes may be a missed opportunity in gaining in-depth understanding of the phenotype associated with loss of the chromatin-associated function of IκBa.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript investigates the role of IκBα in regulating mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency and differentiation.

This omission makes it difficult to evaluate whether the observed changes in IκBα-KO cells truly reflect naïve pluripotency characteristics.</p><p>- Several conclusions in the manuscript require a more measured interpretation. The authors should revise their statements regarding the strength of the pluripotency exit block, the extent of hypomethylation, and the global nature of chromatin changes. - From a methodological perspective, the manuscript would benefit from additional orthogonal approaches to strengthen the knockout findings, which may be influenced by clonal expansion of ES cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Overall, this study makes an important contribution to the field. However, the concerns raised regarding controls, data interpretation, and methodology should be addressed to strengthen the manuscript and support the authors' conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I have the following comments and suggestions for the authors to consider:</p><p>(1) Fig, 1D: the number of replicates for this experiment is not mentioned. It would be good to see if the apparent accumulation of IκBa on chromatin of S/L cells is reproducible. If it is, does the accumulation of IκBa &quot;prime&quot; chromatin for differentiation?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for missing this information in the figure legend. We have repeated the experiment two independent times, and confirmed the localization of IκBα in the chromatin fraction of mESCs cultured in Serum/LIF (S/L). We have included the information in the figure legend.</p><p>Regarding the second question, we do believe that the presence of IκBα primes mESCs to exit from differentiation. Previous data from the lab (Mulero et al Cancer Cell 2012; Marruecos et al EMBO Reports 2020) demonstrated that IκBα regulates important developmental genes (Hox genes and differentiation-related genes), which become dysregulated upon IκBα depletion. Based on those previous results, together with our results that demonstrated that lack of IκBα hyperactivates the pluripotency network, we conclude that IκBα is a crucial element to attenuate pluripotency programs, allowing a successful exit from naïve pluripotency and differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Fig. 1E: From what is shown, Rela doesn't agree (i.e. no enrichment in EpiSCs in the Atlasi data). Are the culture conditions in Atlasi 2020 the same as in this paper (base medium etc.)? Also, why not label all genes/proteins that are shown in 1C?</p></disp-quote><p>Differences observed between our data and the in-silico data might be due to differences in culture conditions used in Atlasi and colleagues. In particular, Atlasi et al. cultured the mESCs in 2i/LIF for 2 consecutive months, whereas we induced ground state of naïve pluripotency (2i/LIF) for only 96h. In the case of EpiSC differentiation, similar protocols are used in both our work and in Atlasi et al. Nevertheless, despite existing differences, in both studies IκBα is enriched in the ground state of naive pluripotency.</p><p>The reason why some proteins that are missing in Figure 1E but appearing in Figure 1C is because they are not detected in the mass spectrometry experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Fig. 1F: The word &quot;clustering&quot; here is misleading. While Nfkbia shows similar dynamics as pluripotency genes, clustering should not be used unless clusters of genes are shown in the same heatmap (and the transcripts naturally cluster together). The figure would be even more informative if all the genes from the 4 different categories were presented on the same heatmap.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have generated a heatmap where the genes from the different four categories (Figure 1F) are displayed and clustered together:</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Heatmap including all the genes from Figure 1F of the manuscript and clustering is simultaneously conducted over the four categories.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102784-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>As shown in previous heatmap, we can confirm that most of the Nf-kB genes (except for Nfkbia and Nfkbid) clustered together with differentiation markers.</p><p>Nonetheless, to be more conservative with original Figure 1F and for clarity upon gene categories, we have updated the figure with a combined heatmap, sliced by gene categories. In this updated version, we can observe how IkBα gene, though classified by the biological process where it classically belongs (NF-kB pathway), is higher at pluripotency, whereas it decreases upon differentiation induction, similarly as most of the pluripotency genes.</p><p>We have also changed the text accordingly and have added the following sentences in the main text (lines 121-125): “The expression pattern of <italic>Nfkbia</italic> was similar to the pluripotency genes whereas most of the NF-κB genes were upregulated upon differentiation, showing an analogous expression dynamics as developmental genes, as previously described”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) This reviewer felt that the statement &quot;Notably, several polycomb elements were highly expressed in mESCs, consistent with the possibility that chromatin-bound IκBα modulates PRC2 activity in the pluripotent state&quot; (p.5, lines 125-127) is premature here. While similar expression dynamics may be consistent with a linked function, they in no way suggest this. This can be more accurately stated to point out that Nfkbia shows similar expression dynamics in pluripotency and differentiation as Polycomb component genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the statement is premature and we have changed it by: “Previous reports have demonstrated that chromatin-bound IκBα modulates PRC2 activity in different adult stem cell models [27]. Interestingly, we observed that most of the Polycomb target genes follow a similar expression pattern of <italic>Nfkbia</italic> and pluripotency, with higher expression in mESCs (Figure 1F).” (lines 125-128 in the manucript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Top of p. 6: the results are mis-attributed to Fig. 1, it should be Fig. 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this observation. We have corrected it in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Fig. 1B and Fig. 5I: the images of the AP stains are very difficult to see, better resolution images should be used.</p></disp-quote><p>We have increased both the resolution and the size of the AP colonies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Line 142 (p.6): Fig. S1B should be S1C. In general the manuscript would benefit from review of the order and labeling of the figure panels as there are a number of inconsistencies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have better organized the figures in the new version of the manuscript. In particular, we have reorganized the Figure S1 to have a more logical order. We have done the same for the Figure 2 and Figure 5 and they are updated in the new version of the reviewed manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The authors call the phenotype of Nfkbia-KO cells a &quot;differentiation impairment&quot;. Do the EBs shown in Fig. 2 also express differentiation markers? Do they fail to up-regulate those markers or just fail to down-regulate pluripotency markers? At the transcriptomic level the Nfkbia-KO cells still change significantly upon provision of differentiation signals (Fig. 2C), what types of gene processes underlie the differences between WT and KO cells and which processes are common? Also, based on this figure, the phenotype looks to be more of a delay than a failure in differentiation, as the cells still follow the same trajectory but lag behind the WT cells. It is difficult to discern whether this is the case based on Fig. 2E-G as we don't see the later time point (up to Day 9).</p></disp-quote><p>In general, with the data presented in Fig. 2C and Fig. S1, the authors show that many of the hallmarks of exit from pluripotency are impaired in Nfkbia-KO cells, as well as the general &quot;transcriptional status&quot; of the cells, but they don't show differentiation markers (which would be necessary to conclude an impairment in differentiation). The data should be readily available in the datasets that are in the manuscript already and it will be informative to extract and present them. The data are not currently publicly accessible (unavailable until July 2025) so it was not possible to mine them.</p><p>We appreciate the observation, and we have included more data to confirm that the IκBα-KO cells show a differentiation impairment. In the first version of the manuscript, differentiation markers are displayed from Figures 2E-G, where genes from the three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm) are not activated in IκBα-KO EBs at 48h and 96h. Moreover, the volcano plot displayed in Figure S1F of the first version clearly shows a downregulation of important differentiation genes such as a <italic>T, Eomes</italic>, <italic>Lhx1</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic>. We agree that 96h EBs is an early time point to talk about differentiation impairment. For that reason, we have also included the same pluripotent and differentiation genes in 216h EBs (Figures S1F-G of the newer version of the manuscript). It is clearly observed that IκBα-KO 216h EBs maintain an upregulation of pluripotency programs which negatively correlate with a lower differentiation capability. Moreover, the impairment in the differentiation with a higher expression of pluripotency markers is confirmed by the presence of high SSEA-1 expression in IκBα-KO 216h EBs (Figure S1C of the manuscript) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining (Figure 2C of the manuscript). Lastly, the fact that IκBα-KO teratomas contain higher proportion of OCT3/4+ cells further confirming that IκBα-KO cells cannot differentiate because of the inability to exit from pluripotency.</p><p>Finally, generated data (and deposited in GEO repository with SuperSeries id GSE239565) is already publicly available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Fig. 5A: even if there are no global changes in NF-κB target genes, could a small subset of NF-κB target genes still mediate the IκBa effects?</p></disp-quote><p>We have analyzed the whole NF-κB signature, and we have identified a small cluster of genes that are differentially expressed at 96h EBs between IκBα-KO and IκBα-WT (Author response image 2). Interestingly, what we observed is the opposite as expected since we see un downregulation of that subset in the IκBα-KO 96h EBs (Author response image 3). For that reason, detected changes in the NF-κB target gene expression after deletion of Nfkbia do not support an NF-κB inhibitory role for IkBa in pluripotent ESC.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Heatmap of NF-κB genes expression at the different time points of differentiation (mESCs, 48h EBs, 96h EBs).</title><p>Highlighted region marks the genes that are differentially expressed between both genotypes at 96h EBs.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102784-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Violin plot of genes from the NF-κB pathway which are differentially expressed at 96h EBs.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102784-sa3-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Lines 233-238, the part of the text is repeated.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the observation and have deleted the repeated part.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) The data in Fig. 5D-E make it difficult to be sure whether the conclusions on the relative subcellular localisations of the different mutants are accurate, as the chromatin-binding mutant seems to be less abundant than the other mutants (judging from the Input in Fig. 5C and also from the tubulin loading controls in Fig. 5D-E). Showing the IκBa levels in total extracts would make the interpretation of these data more robust. The authors do mention that the chromatin-binding mutant IκBa protein is consistently expressed at lower levels but they do not comment on how this may affect the data interpretation - could the lack of rescue be due to lower levels of the chromatin-binding mutant IκBa relative to the wild-type IκBa? This should be addressed in the Discussion, if not tested formally by normalising the expression levels of the different forms of IκBa in the rescue experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Although protein stability is different among the SOF mutants, IκBα<sup>ΔChromatin</sup> is exclusively detected in the cytoplasm, with lack of detection in the chromatin compartment (Figures 5D-E of the reviewed manuscript). For this reason, we believe that the quantitative differences in protein levels of the different mutants cannot explain the subcellular localization differences and the phenotype observed.</p><p>Nonetheless, we cannot discard that differences in the protein levels between SOF mutants can affect the rescue phenotype, and we have specified so in the discussion section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Lines 260-261: &quot;Induction of i-IκBαWT and i-IκBαΔNF-κB reduced the expression levels of the naive pluripotent genes Zfp42, Klf2, Sox2 and Tbx3, which were increased by i-IκBαΔChromatin (Figure 5F).&quot; This is not an accurate statement. The expression was not reduced by the ΔChrom mutant in the same way as it was by the WT and the ΔNF-κB mutant, but it was not increased.</p></disp-quote><p>We have better specified the description of the results displayed in Figure 5F (lines 258-261 of the main manuscript):</p><p>“Induction of i-IκBα<sup>WT</sup> and i-IκBα<sup>ΔNF-κB</sup> reduced the expression levels of the naïve pluripotent genes <italic>Zfp42</italic>, <italic>Klf2</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Tbx3</italic>. On the other hand, the same genes either do not change their expression (<italic>Zfp42</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Klf2</italic>) or increase their levels (<italic>Tbx3</italic>) upon i-IκBα<sup>ΔChromatin</sup> induction (Figure 5F).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) In Fig. 5J the images will ideally be shown before and after Doxycycline treatment, to better support the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a new panel in Figure S4 (Figure S4E in the reviewed manuscript) where the No doxycycline control 216 EBs between the different conditions (i-IκBα<sup>WT</sup>, i-IκBα<sup>ΔChrom</sup> and i-IκBα<sup>ΔNF-κB</sup>) are included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>- The PCA analysis in Figure 2 appears to contradict the authors' conclusions about global transcriptome changes in KO cells. Furthermore, there is a discrepancy between immunofluorescence data showing near-complete methylation loss and the methylation array analysis results.</p></disp-quote><p>Although there is a differentiation block in the IkBa KO EBs, this is not complete and they show some differentiation trend after 96h (Fig 2C), moreover, acquisition of differentiation genes from all three germ layers is strongly affected (Figure 2E of the reviewed manuscript) and these programs remain downregulated and pluripotency genes are still expressed in IκBα-KO EBs at later time points (216h) (Fig 2B). Altogether demonstrates that the lack of IκBα impairs differentiation and the silencing of the pluripotency network.</p><p>Discrepancies between methylation array and immunofluorescence are expected since immunofluorescence is not quantitative and the methylation array is very precise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors should revise their statements regarding the strength of the pluripotency exit block, the extent of hypomethylation, and the global nature of chromatin changes. For example, the observed chromatin changes, including H3K27ac modifications, appear relatively modest and should be described as such. - The manuscript would benefit from additional orthogonal approaches to strengthen the knockout findings, which may be influenced by clonal expansion of ES cells. Additionally, the emphasis on overlapping H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 regions should be reduced, as these represent a minor fraction of the affected regions (only 41 regions).</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text and have included it in the discussion section the following text (lines 327-331 in the reviewed manuscript):</p><p>“Although IκBα KO mESCs exhibit a transcriptional phenotype and hypomethylation state that resembles the ground state of naïve pluripotency, there are only modest changes on histone marks associated to enhancers (H3K27Ac) or gene regulation (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3). Altogether indicates that further experiments are required to fully elucidate the effect of chromatin IκBα.”</p><p>We have also included Fig S3E-S3F to show that similar differences as WT and KO in H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 are observed in a serum/LIF and 2i conditions, further supporting the fact that KO cells in Serum/LIF resemble WT cells in 2i condition.</p></body></sub-article></article>
