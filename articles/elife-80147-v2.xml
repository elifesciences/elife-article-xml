In yeast cells, cohesin is not only required for sister chromatid cohesion but also plays a major role determining the structure of individual chromatids in metaphase. Separase cleavage is thought to remove all cohesin complexes from chromosomes to initiate anaphase. It is thus not clear how the length and organisation of segregating chromatids is maintained during anaphase in the absence of cohesin. Here, we show that degradation of cohesin at the anaphase onset causes aberrant chromatid segregation. Hi-C analysis on segregating chromatids demonstrates that cohesin depletion causes loss of intrachromatid organisation. Surprisingly, tobacco etch virus (TEV)-mediated cleavage of cohesin does not dramatically disrupt chromatid organisation in anaphase, explaining why bulk segregation is achieved. In addition, we identified a small pool of cohesin complexes bound to telophase chromosomes in wild-type cells and show that they play a role in the organisation of centromeric regions. Our data demonstrates that in yeast cells cohesin function is not over in metaphase, but extends to the anaphase period when chromatids are segregating.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cohesin</kwd><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd><kwd>chromosome condensation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UKRI MC-A652-5PY00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aragon</surname><given-names>Luis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koszul</surname><given-names>Romain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100955/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia-Luis</surname><given-names>Jonay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koszul</surname><given-names>Romain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Cohesin is a multisubunit protein complex that holds sister chromatids together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>) and promotes condensation of metaphase chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>). The core proteins of cohesin are a pair of structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins, Smc1 and Smc3, and the conserved kleisin factor Mcd1/Scc1. Together they form a tripartite complex that has a rod-shaped structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bürmann et al., 2019</xref>). Cohesin complexes also contain the HEAT-repeat proteins Scc3 and Pds5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Losada et al., 2000</xref>). In addition to its role in sister chromatid cohesion, studies have shown that cohesin also organises chromosomes through the formation of chromatin loops in interphase nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rao et al., 2017</xref>) and mitotic chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>). The role of cohesin in nuclear organisation is thought to depend on its ability to extrude DNA loops, an activity that was recently confirmed in vitro with human cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Separase cleaves cohesin’s kleisin Mcd1/Rad21/Scc1 subunit (thereafter referred to as Mcd1) in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uhlmann et al., 1999</xref>). Engineered Mcd1 cleavage in metaphase, using TEV protease expression and TEV recognition sites in Mcd1, triggers bulk separation of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>), demonstrating that one of cohesin’s functions is to hold sister chromatids together prior to their separation. Recent work using chromosome capture (Hi-C) techniques has demonstrated that cohesin mediates intrachromosomal loops that are responsible for compacting yeast chromosome arms in metaphase cells, independently of cohesin’s role in sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian cells cohesin is responsible for the organisation of the genome into loops during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rao et al., 2017</xref>). During prophase the bulk of cohesin dissociates from chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sumara et al., 2000</xref>), however since sister chromatids remain paired, it is likely that some cohesin complexes are retained on chromosomes. At metaphase, mammalian cohesin is mainly localised to centromeres where it provides cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sumara et al., 2000</xref>), while the related SMC complexes, condensin I and II (CI and CII), take over the role of folding mitotic chromosome arms into loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>). CII organises large (200–400 kb) loops, while CI sub-divides these into smaller loops (80 kb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>). During interphase CI is excluded from the nucleus and CII, although nuclear, is prevented from acting on chromosomal DNAs by a nuclear protein, Mcph1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, a rapid switch from condensin binding to cohesin binding between anaphase and cytokinesis has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramo et al., 2019</xref>). However, the function of this chromosome-bound cohesin in telophase cells is currently unknown.</p><p>Yeast cells lack a CII complex, and CI role in chromosome organisation in mitosis is restricted to the ribosomal gene array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>). Instead, yeast condensin is involved in the separation of chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leonard et al., 2015</xref>) through a role that promotes decatenation of sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baxter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The demonstration that yeast cohesin organises loops on the arms of metaphase chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>) together with the limited effect observed for condensin on yeast chromosome condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>) and the cleavage of cohesin by separase at the anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>) present a conundrum currently unexplained; how is the organisation/compaction of yeast chromatids maintained as they are segregating during anaphase? Here, we have investigated this question. We have studied the organisation of chromosome arms during segregation while we compromised cohesin function using two contrasted experimental approaches: auxin-mediated degradation and TEV-mediated cleavage of Mcd1. We demonstrate that degradation of Mcd1 severely disrupts chromosome structure and consequently the segregation of chromatids in anaphase. We demonstrate that similarly to mammalian cells, a small population of cohesin complexes are present on segregating chromatids during anaphase/telophase and show that they are important for centromere organisation. Together, these findings demonstrate that yeast cohesin has a role on segregating chromatids during anaphase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Degradation of cohesin’s kleisin at the anaphase onset causes mitotic catastrophe</title><p>To study the role of cohesin on chromosome organisation during anaphase, we searched for an approach to induce the rapid removal of cohesin’s kleisin subunit, Mcd1. To this aim, we used an auxin-inducible degron allele of Mcd1 (<italic>MCD1-AID</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>) which allows rapid degradation by poly-ubiquitylation upon exposure to auxin.</p><p>To evaluate the effect of Mcd1 degradation during chromatid segregation, we blocked cells using transcriptional depletion of Cdc20 (an activator of the anaphase-promoting complex). Under this experimental condition, cells are arrested with chromosomes bipolarly attached to mitotic spindles. Removal of cohesin by artificial cleavage of Mcd1 in Cdc20-depleted cells triggers an anaphase-like stage where chromatids segregate to opposite cell poles, despite the fact that cells are biochemically in metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In cdc20-arrested cells, we observed full degradation of Mcd1-aid 30–60 min after addition of auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), demonstrating the rapid and efficient removal of Mcd1 in this experimental setup. Like TEV-induced anaphases, auxin-mediated degradation of Mcd1 in cdc20-arrested cells precipitates an anaphase-like stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), however we observed severe disruption of nuclear segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), with many nuclei appearing to be stuck in anaphase with elongated nuclear masses for extended periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref>). To quantify the segregation defects in these cells, we introduced chromosome tags at different genomic locations, and scored the timing and efficiency of their separation. First, we used tags on the arm (<italic>tetO::469</italic>) and telomere (<italic>tetO::558</italic>) regions of chromosome 5, a small chromosome in the yeast genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–d</xref>). After 180 min of auxin addition to cdc20-blocked cultures, we observed that 48% of the cells were still stuck in anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), 35% of cells showed correct segregation of arm tags, and 20% showed missegregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Segregation errors were even higher for telomeric regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) and larger chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results demonstrate that rapid removal of Mcd1 by degradation causes an anaphase-like state with impaired separation of chromatids.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mcd1 degradation causes catastrophic chromosome segregation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cells containing <italic>MCD1</italic> tagged with the auxin degron (<italic>MCD1-AID</italic>) were arrested in metaphase (Cdc20 arrest).

We re-evaluated segregation in TEV-induced anaphases using the previously published strain and protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>). Induction of TEV expression led to cleavage of Mcd1 after 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) as expected. Bulk nuclear segregation occurred 90–120 min following the induction as it had been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>). Importantly, chromosome tags located on the centromere region of chromosome 5 segregated efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, unlike auxin-mediated degradation of Mcd1, and consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>), TEV cleavage allows nuclear segregation.</p><p>We noticed that in TEV-induced anaphases, the cleaved C-terminal fragment of Mcd1 was fully stable during the entire timecourse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The lack of Mcd1 fragment degradation after TEV cleavage stems from the fact that TEV protease cleavage occurs following the glutamine (Q) residue of the TEV recognition site (‘ENLYFQ*G’) leaving a glycine (G) amino acid residue at the N-termini (referred to as TEVG), which is not well recognised by the N-rule pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varshavsky, 2011</xref>). In contrast, separase cleavage leaves an arginine (R) residue at the N-termini of the cleaved product (‘SVEQGR*R’), which is a good substrate for N-end rule degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varshavsky, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, Beckouet et al. have shown that following TEV-induced cleavage not only the C-terminal fragment of Mcd1 is stabilised but also the N-terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beckouët et al., 2016</xref>). This raises the possibility that Mcd1 fragments could remain associated to the Smc core subunits following TEV cleavage. To test whether this is the case, we tagged Smc3 with the V5 epitope and Mcd1 with FLAG and HA tags at the N- and C-terminus, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We performed IPs on synchronised TEV anaphases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) to follow whether the cleaved fragments stay associated to the cohesin Smc core.

How chromosomes are organised during yeast anaphase, when individual chromatids are being pulled to the poles, is not well understood. Since the cohesin tripartite complex remains associated after TEV cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we considered the possibility that TEV-cleaved cohesin still plays a role in maintaining the structure of segregating chromatids. To further investigate this, we first performed ChIP analysis of Smc3 during TEV-induced anaphases along chromosome 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). We observed that significant levels of chromatin-bound Smc3 remained during initial timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>; TEV-induced). In contrast, Smc3 was rapidly lost from chromatin in anaphases induced by auxin-mediated degradation of Mcd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>; auxin-induced). Having observed that TEV-cleaved cohesin remains chromatin-bound for a significantly longer period than auxin-degraded cohesin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), we decided to use these two conditions to investigate whether the presence of cohesin, albeit cleaved, impacts on the looped organisation of chromosomes as they are pulled to the cell poles. We built Hi-C libraries from timepoints when the bulk of Mcd1 had been either TEV-cleaved or auxin-degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, we did not detect full-length Mcd1 in the TEV-cleaved samples collected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that TEV cleavage was complete. Following sequencing, we computed the corresponding normalised genome‐wide contact maps for Mcd1-TEV and Mcd1-aid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–c</xref>). When we compared the contact maps of individual chromosomes obtained from cells arrested in metaphase using Cdc20 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), to those obtained for Mcd1-TEVG and Mcd1-AID during the induced anaphases, we observed a decrease in intrachromosomal contacts structuration, with a loss of loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). The contact probability (p) as a function of genomic distances of all chromosome arms showed a reduction of contacts in the 10–50 kb range for Mcd1-TEVG and Mcd1-AID samples compared to Cdc20 arrests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In cdc15-arrested cells, condensin-dependent loop bridges the CEN12 and rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>). In cohesin-depleted cdc15-arrested cells, these contacts are also strongly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, yellow arrow), suggesting that cohesin plays a role in the formation of this structure. Furthermore, contacts between pre- and post-rDNA regions are increased when the cohesin complex is disrupted, suggesting that it promotes the isolation of these regions in cdc15-arrested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). In conclusion, these results further support an active role for cohesin in the organisation of specific regions of the genome in telophase-arrested cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The role of cohesin complexes in supporting mitotic chromosome architecture in yeast has long been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>), however, while their prominent role in mediating sister chromatid cohesion has been intensively studied, their contribution to chromosome folding has only recently become topical with the development of Hi-C techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dekker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmitt et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we set out to explore whether cohesins influence or play a role in chromosome structuration after metaphase.</p><p>Cohesin is loaded onto chromosomes by the loader complex Scc2/4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>) during G<sub>1</sub> and becomes cohesive during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Uhlmann and Nasmyth, 1998</xref>). The cohesive state requires the acetylation of cohesin Smc3 by the Eco1 acetyl transferase to make cohesin refractory to an inhibitory ‘anti-establishment’ activity dependent on Wapl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Unal et al., 2008</xref>). In yeast, cleavage of one of cohesin subunits, Mcd1/Scc1, by the protease separase (Esp1) prompts anaphase segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uhlmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>). Separase function is highly regulated to prevent its premature activation before every single chromosome has been aligned on the mitotic spindle. Firstly, separase activity is blocked by a bound inhibitor named securin (Pds1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>), which is destroyed by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis once cells are ready to enter anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen-Fix et al., 1996</xref>). Secondly, separase-mediated cleavage of Mcd1 is primed by Polo-kinase (Cdc5)-dependent phosphorylation of Mcd1 at serines 175 (S175) and 268 (S268), on the cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexandru et al., 2001</xref>). This double regulation ensures that cohesion is not destroyed before it should be. At the anaphase onset, Mcd1 cleavage by separase is thought to terminate the function of cohesin on yeast chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nasmyth, 2001</xref>). Interestingly, cohesin’s subunits have been shown to be chromatin-bound during anaphase/telophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Renshaw et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tanaka et al., 1999</xref>), however the functional contribution of this cohesin population has not been studied.</p><p>. Mammalian cohesin organises the genome into loops during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rao et al., 2017</xref>) but dissociates from chromosomes in prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sumara et al., 2000</xref>), and it is only found at centromeres by the time cells reach metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sumara et al., 2000</xref>). The role of organising loops on mammalian metaphase chromosomes is taken over by CI and CII complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>). During chromosome segregation, CI and CII are believed to maintain the structure of separating chromatids to prevent a ‘cut’ phenotype, which occurs when insufficiently condensed chromatids are trapped by the cytokinetic furrow. Recent studies demonstrate that condensin and cohesin are mutually exclusive on mammalian chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramo et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, from anaphase to cytokinesis, chromosome-bound cohesin appears as condensin comes off chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramo et al., 2019</xref>). However, chromosome folding in telophase was found to be independent of both condensin and cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramo et al., 2019</xref>). In yeast, there is a single condensin complex but it does not play a role in the overall organisation of chromosome loops during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>), instead it has a very defined function organising the ribosomal gene array on chromosome XII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lavoie et al., 2002</xref>). Since yeast condensin does not contribute to the structural organisation of chromosome arms and cohesin’s function is thought to stop at the anaphase onset, it was unclear how separating chromatids maintain the looped organisation necessary for chromosome compaction and faithful segregation.</p><p>Here, we tested the belief that cohesin has no roles after metaphase. Our results demonstrate that, in contrast to the current view, degrading Mcd1 during anaphase leads to catastrophic segregation where many cells arrest with unseparated nuclear masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–d</xref>). This result prompted us to further investigate (i) whether the structure of segregating chromatids is disrupted when Mcd1 is degraded and (ii) whether cleavage of cohesin subunit Mcd1 causes a similar phenotype to its degradation. Hi-C analysis during segregation demonstrated that Mcd1 degradation causes dramatic defects in the 10–50 kb range of <italic>cis</italic> interactions on chromatids, which correspond to cohesin-dependent loop range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Importantly, despite the exclusion of the pericentromeric regions, contacts between 20 and 200 kb remain more enriched in the Mcd1-TEV condition than in the Mcd1-AID condition suggesting that the cleaved cohesin complex still contributes, directly or indirectly, to the structuration of chromosome arms after metaphase. This data confirms that loops are affected when cohesin is not present on segregating chromatids and offers an explanation for the defective segregation observed under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–d</xref>).</p><p>To study the effect of cohesin cleavage on the efficiency and structure of segregating chromatids, we used the TEV protease system previously established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>). Our analysis revealed that unlike Mcd1 degradation, TEV-induced cleavage does not prevent bulk nuclear separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), although it causes some segregation errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Importantly, using HiC we could detect the maintenance of <italic>cis</italic> contacts in the 10–50 kb range on chromosomes with TEV-cleaved Mcd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), demonstrating that chromatid loops are not fully disrupted and explaining why bulk segregation is still achieved. We ensured that TEV cleavage of Mcd1 proceeded to completion in our samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) to prevent that residual Mcd1 (that might escape cleavage) significantly affected the experimental outcome. An important difference between cohesive cohesin and loop extruding complexes lies in the way that these complexes interact with the DNA substrate. While cohesive cohesin topologically embraces DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Srinivasan et al., 2018</xref>), loop extruding complexes rely on non-topological interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that cohesin complexes cleaved by TEV are still able to interact non-topologically with the DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>) and/or can maintain extruded loops. This would explain why TEV cleavage has only a modest effect on the loop extrusion (structural) role of cohesin, while disrupting the cohesive role (that depends on topological association) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). In contrast, auxin-mediated degradation would abolish both topological and non-topological interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>), which would result in the loss of cohesion but also structure (and compaction) thus generating a situation where unorganised chromatids would fail to efficiently segregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>).</p><p>Based on evidence that suggested a role for cohesin during segregation, we sought to investigate whether a small pool of cohesin was retained on chromosomes in telophase. Interestingly, we detected binding to centromeres in this late mitotic stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and c</xref>). Currently, we do not know whether the centromeric pool of cohesin bound in cdc15 cells is protected from separase cleavage, like centromeric cohesin during the first meiotic division, or loaded de novo during telophase. However, this pool of cohesin is actively organising, directly or indirectly, centromeric regions since depletion of cohesin in telophase revealed that bound cohesin during this late mitotic stage influences the structural organisation of pericentromeric regions, as well as promoting interactions between <italic>CEN</italic> regions of different chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b–d</xref>). Further to this role at centromeric regions, we observed condensation defects at the ribosomal gene array on chromosome XII when we inactivated cohesin function in telophase-arrested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>), demonstrating that the complex also plays a role in the organisation of this genomic site during late mitosis.</p><p>Interestingly, the loss of cohesin-dependent structures on chromosome arms, but not centromeric regions, on cdc15-arrested cells is reminiscent of the pattern reported for the inactivation of the cohesin regulator Pds5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costantino et al., 2020</xref>). Pds5 has been shown to restrict loop expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costantino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dauban et al., 2020</xref>) and therefore Pds5 absence in telophase could potentially explain our observations. In such scenario cohesin complexes loaded on centromeric regions might be able to extrude over long distances.</p><p>Currently, the functions of yeast cohesin during mitosis are thought to include: (i) the pairing of sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>), (ii) the bipolar organisation of chromatids as they attach to the mitotic spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tanaka et al., 2000</xref>), and (iii) the organisation of metaphase chromosomes into looped domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>). Recent work has shown that cohesin is necessary for the maintenance of the structure of the rDNA during metaphase and that this role is executed through the regulation of condensin localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lamothe et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, these cohesin functions occur in metaphase cells and separase cleavage of cohesin at the anaphase onset has generated the perception that cohesin’s roles are finished at the beginning of anaphase. Collectively, our data demonstrates that yeast cohesin plays important roles during segregation, possibly after separase cleavage, maintaining the looped organisation of segregating chromatids and supporting centromere organisation. Therefore, these findings extend the repertoire of cohesin roles on chromosomes, demonstrating that this complex has important post-metaphase functions critical for ensuring faithful genome segregation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strain and primers</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

One mL of cell culture was taken from each timepoint and mixed with glycerol (20% final concentration) to preserve <italic>TetO</italic>/TetR signal after being frozen at –80°C. For visualisation, cells were centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m. for 2 min and 1 μL of the pellet was mixed with 1 μL of DAPI solution (DAPI 4 μg/mL Triton 1 %) on the microscope slide. For each field 20 Z-focal planes images were captured (0.3 μm depth between each consecutive image). Images were analysed with Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). To quantify the distance between the GFP dots, a Fiji macro was developed to automatically compute the weighted centroid of the dots and measure the three-dimensional distance between them. To visualise Smc3-yeGFP, cells were imaged fresh in a DELTAVISION Elite fluorescence microscope fitted with a Lumecor Spectra LED light source, a Photometrics Coolsnap HQ camera and a ×100/1.4 lens. At least 80 cells were quantified for each timepoint. Smc3-yeGFP signal intensity was calculated as the ratio of signal at the centromeres and the signal of the same area in the nucleus on Z-projection of images taken every 0.2 μm in 6 μm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Western blot</title><p>Protein extraction was done by lysing the cells in a FastPrep FP120 (BIO101) machine with 20% TCA and glass beads. Three repetitions of a 20 s cycle, power setting 5.5. Proteins were precipitated with TCA 7.5% and centrifuging at 15,000 r.p.m. for 10 min at 4°C. Then, the pellet was resuspended in Laemmli buffer ×1.5. Western blots were resolved in 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes using the TE70X semidry blotter system (Hoefer). The antibodies used were anti-HA (Roche, 3F10), anti-Myc (Roche, 9E10), anti-PGK1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 459250) anti-V5 (Abcam, ab9116), and anti-FLAG (Invitrogen MA1-142). Blots were incubated with the ECL Prime Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare). Blots were developed by exposure to high-performance chemiluminescence films (Amersham Hyperfilm ECL, GE Healthcare) or in an ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini machine (GE Healthcare).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation</title><p>For ChIP analysis, cells were grown to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5 and arrested at the required cell cycle stage. A total of 100 OD<sub>600</sub> units of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> were collected. Cells were fixed for 15 min at 25°C and quenched with glycine (final concentration 125 mM) for 7 min before cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 r.p.m. for 1 min. The cell pellets were washed in PBS and transferred to a screw cap tube and frozen on dry ice. The pellets were stored at −80°C. Pellets were resuspended in 300 μL of IP buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 5 mM EDTA, NP-40 [0.05% vol/vol], Triton X-100 [1% vol/vol]) containing PMSF (final concentration 1 mM) and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (without EDTA, from Roche). A 500 μL volume of glass beads was added to the tubes. Cells were broken in a FastPrep FP120 cell disruptor (BIO101) by three repetitions of a 20 s cycle at power setting 5.5. The cell lysate was transferred to a new tube and 100 μL volume of IP buffer containing PMSF and protease inhibitors was added. The cell lysate was spun down for 10 min at 15,000 r.p.m. at 4°C. This pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of IP buffer containing PMSF and protease inhibitors, and sonicated for 30 (30 s on, 30 s off) at high power at 4°C in a Diagenode Bioruptor pico. After sonication samples were spun down for 10 min at 15,000 r.p.m. the supernatant was taken. A 200 μL volume of the sonicated chromatin was taken as ‘input’ and 400 μL was incubated with 40 μg of anti-V5 antibody (anti-V5 Abcam, ab9116) in a sonicator at low power for 30 min (30 s on, 30 s off). The ‘input’ DNA was precipitated with 0.3 M sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of cold ethanol and spun down at 15,000 r.p.m. for 30 min, then the supernatant was removed. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air-dried. After antibody binding, the IP sample was spun down at 13,000 r.p.m. for 5 min and the supernatant was added to 60 μL of Dynabeads protein G (Invitrogen), previously equilibrated with IP buffer. The samples were then incubated for 2 hr at 4°C in a rotating wheel and washed five times with IP buffer using a magnetic separator rack. Finally, ‘input’ samples and IP samples were resuspended in de-crosslinking buffer (TE ×1, 1% SDS, 10 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> RNase A, 1  mg ml<sup>−1</sup> proteinase K) and incubated at 65°C overnight. Samples were purified using a ChIP DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator kit (Zymoresearch) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 6b and c. Why do the authors change tags when measuring chromatin-bound cohesin in metaphase vs telophase? Changing tags would appear to compromise a comparison between metaphase and telophase arrested cells.</p><p>2) Figure 7B left. Please explain why you present a log ratio with Cdc15 in the denominator when in all the other panels they present a log ratio of Cdc15 in the numerator the more intuitive ratio (condensed- more contacts /uncondensed – fewer contacts)? The authors do not mention the large blue squares or flares. More interpretation of the findings of this figure would be helpful.</p><p>3) Figure 7B right. This reader's interpretation is that the white squares associated with each chromosome mean that the chromosome-wide contacts in cdc15 arrested cells (compared to G1) are unchanged by inactivation by Mcd1. The flairs in cdc15 arrested cells (compared to G1) seem enhanced. Thus, it seems from their data that extended interactions from the centromere exist in cdc15 arrested cells that are further enhanced by removing most of the cohesin. Please clarify.</p><p>4) 7C and 7D. It is not clear what the first three panels of these panels show.</p><p>5) Figure 8. The authors should guide the reader through this Hi C in this figure.</p><p>6) Figure 8a. Why do the authors switch to using the mcd1-73 in this experiment instead of the MCD1-AID auxin depletion that they used in all the other experiments?</p><p>The reasons for the change in reagents should be described new reagents should be characterized.</p><p>7) The first page and half reads like a review and should be deleted.</p><p>8) The authors claim that figure 1 shows the degradation of cohesin in anaphase leads to catastrophic segregation. This overstates the experimental results. What they show is the inactivation of cohesin in a metaphase arrested cell causes false anaphase with catastrophic segregation. While consistent with a function during anaphase, they cannot rule out from this experiment that cohesin function in chromosome structure is only required metaphase (where the cells are arrested) and it is revealed by the false anaphase. Thus, the function for cohesin after metaphase is critically dependent upon the Hi-C analysis of cdc15 arrested cells.</p><p>9) Mounting evidence from in vivo experiments suggests that loop extrusion may not involve topological entrapment (see Dekker and Michael Peters). The authors provide evidence that this might also be the case in vivo based on the presence of loops in the TEV cleavage experiment. However, this conclusion must be softened to include the following caveat. The pattern of expanded loops observed in cdc15 arrested cells is very reminiscent of Pds5 depleted cells. That pattern appears to reflect a very small amount of chromosome-bound cohesin that persists in the absence of Pds5. Thus, the authors cannot exclude that the loops they observe in cdc15 arrested cells or TEV induced cells are not due to a small amount of cohesin with uncleaved Mcd1. To make this conclusion the authors would have to show that all Mcd1p is cleaved by TEV.</p><p>10) The method used to invoke a cdc20 shutoff to arrest cells in metaphase should be explained in Materials and methods.</p><p>11) The assays involving various GFP-marked chromosomes should be explained better. When the GFP-marked locus is very close to the centromere, missegregation only happens when the sister chromatids have attached to microtubules of the same spindle poles. In other words, a defect in kinetochore function. When the GFP marked locus is at a CEN distal locus, a missegregation is a combination of kinetochore defects and a failure to condense the chromosome enough to ensure the distal ends can clear the mid-zone of the cells. The missegregation due to condensation defects can be calculated by subtracting the missegregation from CEN proximal marked loci.</p><p>12) The assertion that cohesin is generated loops in anaphase to support compaction is a weakly supported aspect of the paper. Figure 5B doesn't show any obvious loop structures in either TEV-induced or auxin-induced anaphase. This could be because loop boundary factors are no longer functional in anaphase, obscuring any looping function. Evidence for residual looping along chromosome arms rests on the P(s) analysis in Figure 5C. This analysis shows increased contact frequency in the Mcd1-TEV relative to Mcd1-AID at lengths from 20kb to 200+kb. This is an analysis of all contacts, including those involving centromeres. Figure 7 shows that cohesin is required for centromere contact with regions all across the chromosome arm with little evidence of cohesin-dependent contacts along chromosome arms. The extensive cohesin-dependent contacts from the centromere could be biasing the analysis of Figure 5C. The P(s) analysis in figure 5C should be re-analyzed excluding contacts containing sequences in the centromeric and pericentromeric regions. This will give a more accurate assessment of potential looping along chromosome arms.</p><p>13) In figure 2C a mis-segregation analysis of a CEN5 tetO tag is performed. This tag is not examined in figure 1 so it does not give any relevant information for comparing mis-segregation in depleted Scc1 cells compared to artificially cleaved Scc1 cells. If the authors want to use this data, they should also show the analysis of the CEN5 tetO tag for depleted Scc1 cells.</p><p>14) The relevant comparison for comparing Mcd1-TEV relative to Mcd1-AID shown is the relative mis-segregation of the 469tetO tags, shown in figure 1C and figure 4C which have relative mis-segregation rates of &lt;5% mis-segregation and 20% mis-segregation at the end of the experiment. But in figure 4C mis-segregation increases to &gt;10% at 60 minutes before reducing to &lt;5%. How can an apparent reversal of mis-segregation occur in this context?</p><p>15) Figure 1c,d, and 2b,c should show the SEM values for the points taken.</p><p>16) The authors start with the premise that all arm cohesin is destroyed in animals and plant cells by the prophase removal pathway. This is incorrect. In a normal unperturbed cell cycle, most of the cohesin is removed from chromosome arms but arms remained paired until the onset of anaphase implying that a small fraction of cohesin along the arms persists. Furthermore, substantial amounts of cohesin are reloaded on chromosomes by telophase. The purpose of this cohesin is unknown. The authors' results suggest that the presence of chromosome-bound cohesin post metaphase is conserved in yeast, and therefore is likely a general feature of all mitoses. The function of this chromosome-bound cohesin in telophase in other eukaryotes was unknown. The results from this manuscript provide a potentially important clue.</p><p>17) The failure to constrain centromere anchored loops upon inactivation of most cohesin is reminiscent of loops seen in pds5 mutants. The authors should cite this result and incorporate it into a better discussion of condensation in anaphase.</p><p>18) The results may also connect with meiosis where a subset of cohesin is protected from separase during meiosis. Authors may think of additional examples and bring it to Discussion.</p><p>19) The log ratio of G1 or Cdc15 contacts shows large chromosomal domains (blue squares) and flares (presumably condensation emanating from the centromeres). These types of domains have not been reported in previous analyses of nocodazole cells. They suggest a more and or distinct compacted state in Cdc15 cells. Interestingly this conclusion fits with the FISH of rDNA in cdc15 arrested cells which looks much more like that seen in most other eukaryotes. Authors should extend this in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80147.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 6b and c.

From the comment it is clear that we failed to explain the experiment correctly in our manuscript. In this experiment, we performed ChiP analysis of Mcd1 (Mcd1-6HA) in telophase arrested cells only (using the <italic>cdc15-2</italic> allele). We had two conditions, one with cells carrying a tagged Mcd1 (Mcd1-6HA) allele and another where Mcd1 was untagged. We used the untagged signals to subtract the background signal, thus reveal the binding due to Mcd1-6HA in telophase arrested cells.</p><p>We used the localisation of SMC1-6HA in metaphase arrested cells only to illustrate the normal position of cohesin complexes in metaphase cells (a time when they are most abundant on chromosomes), as a reference to be compared to our analysis of Mcd1 binding at telophase. The localisation of SMC1-6HA in metaphase was not meant to be qualitatively compared to Mcd1-6HA ChIP peaks in our telophase arrests. For SMC1-6HA we used a dataset already created and published previously in the lab (GSE118534). We have described the experiment in more detail in the figure legend to ensure that there is no misunderstanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 7B left. Please explain why you present a log ratio with Cdc15 in the denominator when in all the other panels they present a log ratio of Cdc15 in the numerator the more intuitive ratio (condensed- more contacts /uncondensed – fewer contacts)? The authors do not mention the large blue squares or flares. More interpretation of the findings of this figure would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct to point out this discrepancy. To avoid any confusion and facilitate comparisons we now show all ratio maps with cdc15 WT always presented as the denominator. Regarding the “large blue squares” which appeared on the cdc15 vs. G1 map, they reflect compaction of chromosomes during late anaphase with respect to G1. However, we have now removed the left panel 7b comparing the contact maps of G1 vs cdc15 arrested cells. Indeed, we believe this is not an observation directly relevant to the present work, which aims at assessing the role of cohesin after metaphase. Also, cdc15 HiC maps were reported before and their compaction shown to mostly dependent on condensins (Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 7B right. This reader's interpretation is that the white squares associated with each chromosome mean that the chromosome-wide contacts in cdc15 arrested cells (compared to G1) are unchanged by inactivation by Mcd1. The flairs in cdc15 arrested cells (compared to G1) seem enhanced. Thus, it seems from their data that extended interactions from the centromere exist in cdc15 arrested cells that are further enhanced by removing most of the cohesin. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the comparison with G1 (above) but overall, the reader’s interpretation is indeed correct to state that cohesion depletion has little effect on most cdc15 chromosomes but chr. XII.</p><p>We now discuss the two main points below:</p><p>First, the immediate depletion of cohesin subunits in cdc15 arrested cells has the major effect of altering the organisation of chromosome XII (discussed in the figure 8), as well as the contacts made by centromeric regions.</p><p>On a large scale (above 200 kb), cohesins favour cis contacts between centromeres and their chromosome arms. However, this effect is reversed at short distances (&lt;100 kb). Indeed, pannels 7c show that cohesin impedes contacts between centromeres and their ~100 kb flanking regions. To illustrate this scaling effect, we now added a pileup contact maps of 500 kb windows centered on centromeres that shows both effects. We have also highlighted this description in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) 7C and 7D. It is not clear what the first three panels of these panels show.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the lack of clarity. These panels are actually not that informative and have been moved to the supplementary data while we kept in the main figure more detailed representations of the ratio between the plots. Briefly, the first three panels of Figure 7c represented the average of 16 x 505 kb windows centered on the 16 centromeres on the diagonal of normalized and detrended contact maps. The normalization of the contact map attenuates the experimental biases, and the detrending corrects for the distance-dependent contact decay due to polymeric behavior (note that because of the symmetry of the contact map, only half of the average cis-centromere pileup was shown). For Figure 7d, these panels corresponded to trans contacts pile-ups.</p><p>We modified and detailed the methods to bring clarifications:</p><p>“Cis-centromere pile-up contact maps are the result of averaged 205 kb or 505 kb windows centered on the 16 centromere positions (bin: 5 kb) generated with Chromosight in quantify mode (option: <monospace>--pattern border</monospace>, <monospace>--perc-zero=100</monospace>) (Matthey-Doret et al., 2020). These windows are taken from a balanced and detrended contact map. The detrending corrects for the distance-dependent contact decay due to polymeric behaviour (see Matthey-Doret et al., 2020 for more details). Because the contact map is symmetric and that the cis-centromere pileup is centered on the diagonal, only half of the average pileup is presented. Trans-centromere pileup were similarly generated by Chomosight, but with the option <monospace>--inter</monospace>, and centered on the 120 centromere intersections. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 8. The authors should guide the reader through this Hi C in this figure.</p></disp-quote><p>To facilitate the description and interpretation of Figure 8 Hi-C data, we have added didactic elements to panel b.</p><p>First, we detail the figure 8b with more details in the main text to better guide the reader:</p><p>&quot;In Cdc15-arrested cells, condensin-dependent loop bridges the CEN12 and rDNA (LazarStefanita et al., 2017). In cohesin-depleted cdc15-arrested cells, these contacts are also strongly decreased (Figure 8b, yellow arrow), suggesting that cohesin plays a role in the formation of this structure. Furthermore, contacts between pre- and post-rDNA regions are increased when the cohesin complex is disrupted, suggesting that it promotes the isolation of these regions in cdc15-arrested cells (Figure 8b). In conclusion, these results further support an active role for cohesin in the organisation of specific regions of the genome in telophase-arrested cells. &quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 8a. Why do the authors switch to using the mcd1-73 in this experiment instead of the MCD1-AID auxin depletion that they used in all the other experiments?</p><p>The reasons for the change in reagents should be described new reagents should be characterized.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this point. The reason behind this change is purely technical. We have consistently observed that degradation of AID tagged proteins is not efficient when cells are at 37°C. Therefore, we felt that using the genotype <italic>cdc15-2 MCD1AID</italic> where we would need to raise the temperature to 37°C initially before inducing AIDmediated degradation of Mcd1 might generate misleading results due to the inefficiency of AID degradation at this temperature.</p><p>In order to stably arrest cells in telophase and then compromise Mcd1 function we thought we could switch to Cdc15-AID mcd1-73, where we could achieve efficient AID mediated degradation (of Cdc15) initially at 25°C, and once this degradation had been achieved and cells were stably arrested, we could then raise the temperature to inactivate Mcd1 (using the mcd1-73 allele).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The first page and half reads like a review and should be deleted.</p></disp-quote><p>The first page and half is the introduction of the manuscript. Completely removing the whole introduction would make it difficult for readers. Therefore, although we have not completely removed this section, we have changed the style to ensure that this does not read like a review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors claim that figure 1 shows the degradation of cohesin in anaphase leads to catastrophic segregation. This overstates the experimental results. What they show is the inactivation of cohesin in a metaphase arrested cell causes false anaphase with catastrophic segregation. While consistent with a function during anaphase, they cannot rule out from this experiment that cohesin function in chromosome structure is only required metaphase (where the cells are arrested) and it is revealed by the false anaphase. Thus, the function for cohesin after metaphase is critically dependent upon the Hi-C analysis of cdc15 arrested cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer. It has been described in the literature that cleavage of Mcd1 using TEV leads to TEV-induced anaphases, this has been used in a number of studies to investigate processes that occur in anaphase. However, we agree that in these induced anaphases cells are technically arrested in metaphase. Our degradation of Mcd1 in Figure 1 would be equivalent to TEV-induced anaphases and therefore carries the caveat highlighted by this reviewer. We agree that the strongest argument for the role of cohesion in anaphase is dependent on our HiC data. In order to ensure that we do not overstate the results we now state that auxin-mediated degradation of Mcd1 leads to “impaired separation of chromatids”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Mounting evidence from in vivo experiments suggests that loop extrusion may not involve topological entrapment (see Dekker and Michael Peters). The authors provide evidence that this might also be the case in vivo based on the presence of loops in the TEV cleavage experiment. However, this conclusion must be softened to include the following caveat. The pattern of expanded loops observed in cdc15 arrested cells is very reminiscent of Pds5 depleted cells. That pattern appears to reflect a very small amount of chromosome-bound cohesin that persists in the absence of Pds5. Thus, the authors cannot exclude that the loops they observe in cdc15 arrested cells or TEV induced cells are not due to a small amount of cohesin with uncleaved Mcd1. To make this conclusion the authors would have to show that all Mcd1p is cleaved by TEV.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for raising this point. We ensured that full length Mcd1 was not detectable in the TEV-anaphase samples taken and used for HiC analysis (as shown in Suppl. Figure 4). However, it is possible that a very small fraction (not detectable by western) of Mcd1 escaped TEV cleavage. We will point out in the manuscript that although. Therefore, this should soften this argument and will include the possibility raised by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The method used to invoke a cdc20 shutoff to arrest cells in metaphase should be explained in Materials and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that it would be important to include a detailed description of the arrest. We have now described the MET3-Cdc20 in more detail in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The assays involving various GFP-marked chromosomes should be explained better. When the GFP-marked locus is very close to the centromere, missegregation only happens when the sister chromatids have attached to microtubules of the same spindle poles. In other words, a defect in kinetochore function. When the GFP marked locus is at a CEN distal locus, a missegregation is a combination of kinetochore defects and a failure to condense the chromosome enough to ensure the distal ends can clear the mid-zone of the cells. The missegregation due to condensation defects can be calculated by subtracting the missegregation from CEN proximal marked loci.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for the suggestion. We agree that a better explanation for the causes leading to missegregation of different tags would be helpful to the reader to better understand the defects. We have done the calculation suggested using centromere proximal and distal tags on chromosome IV, the longest chromosome not bearing the rDNA. The new data has been included in the supplementary materials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The assertion that cohesin is generated loops in anaphase to support compaction is a weakly supported aspect of the paper. Figure 5B doesn't show any obvious loop structures in either TEV-induced or auxin-induced anaphase. This could be because loop boundary factors are no longer functional in anaphase, obscuring any looping function. Evidence for residual looping along chromosome arms rests on the P(s) analysis in Figure 5C. This analysis shows increased contact frequency in the Mcd1-TEV relative to Mcd1-AID at lengths from 20kb to 200+kb. This is an analysis of all contacts, including those involving centromeres. Figure 7 shows that cohesin is required for centromere contact with regions all across the chromosome arm with little evidence of cohesin-dependent contacts along chromosome arms. The extensive cohesin-dependent contacts from the centromere could be biasing the analysis of Figure 5C. The P(s) analysis in figure 5C should be re-analyzed excluding contacts containing sequences in the centromeric and pericentromeric regions. This will give a more accurate assessment of potential looping along chromosome arms.</p></disp-quote><p>Absolutely right. To support the point that cohesin participates directly or indirectly in the structuring of non-centromeric regions we now present the P(s) where 100 kb of regions on both sides of the centromeres are removed, each chromosome arm is considered separately, and chromosome XII is removed (three steps we also include to avoid polymer-brush like potential influence on contacts). The Materials and methods section for the P(s) calculation was modified accordingly.</p><p>Despite the exclusion of the pericentromeric regions, contacts between 20 and 200 kb remain more enriched in the Mcd1-TEV condition than in the Mcd1-AID condition suggesting that the cleaved cohesin complex still contribute, directly or indirectly, to the structuration of chromosome arms after metaphase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) In figure 2C a mis-segregation analysis of a CEN5 tetO tag is performed. This tag is not examined in figure 1 so it does not give any relevant information for comparing mis-segregation in depleted Scc1 cells compared to artificially cleaved Scc1 cells. If the authors want to use this data, they should also show the analysis of the CEN5 tetO tag for depleted Scc1 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this raising this point. In Figure 2c used the original strain used by the Nasmyth lab (in Uhlmann et al., 2000) to confirm previous results published. However, we understand the logic of the criticism and thus we have moved this figure to Supplementary Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The relevant comparison for comparing Mcd1-TEV relative to Mcd1-AID shown is the relative mis-segregation of the 469tetO tags, shown in figure 1C and figure 4C which have relative mis-segregation rates of &lt;5% mis-segregation and 20% mis-segregation at the end of the experiment. But in figure 4C mis-segregation increases to &gt;10% at 60 minutes before reducing to &lt;5%. How can an apparent reversal of mis-segregation occur in this context?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern expressed by this reviewer regarding the kinetics of chromosome missegregation in Figure 4C. In TEV induced anaphases (Figure 4C), by 60 minutes of TEV protease induction, part of the population has entered DNA bulk segregation as detected by DAPI (as can be observed in Figure 4b-anaphase category). At this timepoint chromosome tags, specially those located nearer to the telomeres have not segregated yet and consequently are scored as missegregated. At later timepoints some of these cells seem to manage to resolve and/or segregate the chromosome tags correctly and therefore the level of missegregation is reduced at later timepoints. We hope this explains the apparent reverasal of missegregation. We note that his is not observed in Mcd1-AID (Figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Figure 1c,d, and 2b,c should show the SEM values for the points taken.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern expressed by this reviewer. We have now included the SEM values in these figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) The authors start with the premise that all arm cohesin is destroyed in animals and plant cells by the prophase removal pathway. This is incorrect. In a normal unperturbed cell cycle, most of the cohesin is removed from chromosome arms but arms remained paired until the onset of anaphase implying that a small fraction of cohesin along the arms persists. Furthermore, substantial amounts of cohesin are reloaded on chromosomes by telophase. The purpose of this cohesin is unknown. The authors' results suggest that the presence of chromosome-bound cohesin post metaphase is conserved in yeast, and therefore is likely a general feature of all mitoses. The function of this chromosome-bound cohesin in telophase in other eukaryotes was unknown. The results from this manuscript provide a potentially important clue.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for this comment. We have included these points in the introduction of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) The failure to constrain centromere anchored loops upon inactivation of most cohesin is reminiscent of loops seen in pds5 mutants. The authors should cite this result and incorporate it into a better discussion of condensation in anaphase.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer and have cited this work and included the points on the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) The results may also connect with meiosis where a subset of cohesin is protected from separase during meiosis. Authors may think of additional examples and bring it to Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have mentioned the protection of cohesion from separase cleavage in meiosis in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) The log ratio of G1 or Cdc15 contacts shows large chromosomal domains (blue squares) and flares (presumably condensation emanating from the centromeres). These types of domains have not been reported in previous analyses of nocodazole cells. They suggest a more and or distinct compacted state in Cdc15 cells. Interestingly this conclusion fits with the FISH of rDNA in cdc15 arrested cells which looks much more like that seen in most other eukaryotes. Authors should extend this in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this ratio map to simplify our message.</p><p>However, this is how we interpret these results: in Cdc15, chromosomes are more compact than in G1 (also shown in Lazar-Stefanita 2017), hence the blue squares when the ratio map is plotted. Also, centromeres will tend to be brought in contact with the chromosome arms in cis because of condensin mediated looping taking place (resulting in the “flares”): loops would expand DNA until encountering the centromere which would act as a roadblock.</p></body></sub-article></article>
