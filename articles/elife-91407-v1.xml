reliable, effective diagnostic, and predictive biomarkers are used in clinical routines. A growing body of evidence shows metabolic alterations in patients with glaucoma. We aimed to develop and validate potential metabolite biomarkers to diagnose and predict the visual field progression of PACG.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we used a five-phase (discovery phase, validation phase 1, validation phase 2, supplementary phase, and cohort phase) multicenter (EENT hospital, Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital), cross-sectional, prospective cohort study designed to perform widely targeted metabolomics and chemiluminescence immunoassay to determine candidate biomarkers. Five machine learning (random forest, support vector machine, lasso, K-nearest neighbor, and GaussianNaive Bayes [NB]) approaches were used to identify an optimal algorithm. The discrimination ability was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Calibration was assessed by Hosmer-Lemeshow tests and calibration plots.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Studied serum samples were collected from 616 participants, and 1464 metabolites were identified. Machine learning algorithm determines that androstenedione exhibited excellent discrimination and acceptable calibration in discriminating PACG across the discovery phase (discovery set 1, AUCs=1.0 [95% CI, 1.00–1.00]; discovery set 2, AUCs = 0.85 [95% CI, 0.80–0.90]) and validation phases (internal validation, AUCs = 0.86 [95% CI, 0.81–0.91]; external validation, AUCs = 0.87 [95% CI, 0.80–0.95]). Androstenedione also exhibited a higher AUC (0.92–0.98) to discriminate the severity of PACG. In the supplemental phase, serum androstenedione levels were consistent with those in aqueous humor (r=0.82, p=0.038) and significantly (p=0.021) decreased after treatment. Further, cohort phase demonstrates that higher baseline androstenedione levels (hazard ratio = 2.71 [95% CI: 1.199–6.104], p=0.017) were associated with faster visual field progression.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study identifies serum androstenedione as a potential biomarker for diagnosing PACG and indicating visual field progression.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This work was supported by Youth Medical Talents – Clinical Laboratory Practitioner Program (2022-65), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82302582), Shanghai Municipal Health Commission Project (20224Y0317), and Higher Education Industry-Academic-Research Innovation Fund of China (2023JQ006).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>primary angle closure glaucoma</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd><kwd>androstenedione</kwd><kwd>diagnose</kwd><kwd>predict</kwd><kwd>visual field progression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82302582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Shengjie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Youth Medical Talents – Clinical Laboratory Practitioner Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022-65</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Shengjie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Municipal Health Commission Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20224Y0317</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Shengjie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Higher Education Industry-Academic-Research Innovation Fund of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023JQ006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Wenjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metabolomic analyses have developed and validated serum androstenedione as a reliable and effective diagnostic and predictive biomarker for primary angle closure glaucoma in clinical routines.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glaucoma is the most frequent cause of irreversible blindness worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jonas et al., 2017</xref>), and its prevalence is increasing globally, making it a public health concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). The primary form of glaucoma worldwide is primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). However, in East Asian populations, primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is predominant, affecting 70% of glaucoma patients globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Song et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tham et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, early detection of PACG and accurate prediction of visual field (VF) changes can potentially preserve vision and mitigate the risk of PACG advancement. Measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP), perimetry, gonioscopy, and optical coherence tomography is the main diagnostic testing to assess for glaucoma and to monitor for disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stein et al., 2021</xref>). However, the present clinical techniques are inadequate for the early diagnosis and prognosis of VF progression as they depend on specialized eye examination equipment and the expertise of ophthalmologists. Furthermore, patients seldom seek the services of an ophthalmologist until the symptoms worsen or visual acuity significantly deteriorates. Importantly, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">He et al., 2019</xref>, study taught us that performing laser iridotomy on patients with 180 degrees of angle closure does not prevent PACG, thus gonioscopy may not be a good tool to help distinguish PACG from controls. Therefore, the development of a straightforward and dependable biomarker or biomarker panel to facilitate early detection and prognostication of progressive VF loss in PACG is imperative, rather than relying solely on the expertise of ophthalmologists and specialized equipment.</p><p>Multiple etiology and risk factors lead to the onset/development of PACG in humans, which involves a tremendous flow of physiological changes, genetic factors, and metabolic adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). Both physiological changes, genetic factors, and metabolic adaptations should lead to profound changes in most metabolic pathways. Small molecule metabolites, as crucial biomarkers of cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yan et al., 2022</xref>), which identifies and quantified by metabolomics, are the omics product closest to clinical phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Guijas et al., 2018</xref>). A burgeoning corpus of evidence indicates metabolic changes in individuals afflicted with glaucoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hysi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Qin et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, extant metabolomics research on glaucoma is constrained by inadequate sample sizes, a dearth of validation sets to corroborate findings, and an absence of specificity analyses. Notably, investigations have yet to comprehensively characterize the serum metabolome in sizable cohorts to identify putative biomarkers capable of distinguishing patients with PACG from healthy controls.</p><p>In this study, a cross-sectional and prospective cohort design was employed to systematically profile blood metabolites using widely targeted metabolomics and chemiluminescence immunoassay in both patients with PACG and control individuals. The objectives of the study were to characterize the metabolic profile associated with PACG, identify potential blood diagnostic biomarkers of PACG, assess the specificity of diagnostic biomarkers for PACG of any severity, and verify the biomarkers used to predict the VF progression of PACG.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participant</title><p>From January 2020 to December 2021, newly diagnosed PACG and age-sex-matched controls were recruited from the Eye Center of Fudan University and Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital.

The five phases of the study are independent and are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The discovery set 1 was composed of 80 serum samples from PACG patients and 60 samples from controls which was enrolled from Eye Center of Fudan University between January 2020 and June 2020. The discovery set 2 was composed of 100 serum samples from PACG patients and 80 samples from controls which was enrolled from Eye Center of Fudan University between July 2020 and December 2020. The differential metabolites of discovery set 1 and discovery set 2 were obtained by widely targeted metabolomics. The intersection of the differential metabolites of the two discovery sets was used as a candidate biomarker. For validation phase 1, serum samples from 70 PACG patients and 50 controls were collected which was enrolled from Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital between January 2020 and December 2020. Candidate biomarkers were validated in validation phase 1 using widely targeted metabolomics, and potential biomarkers were obtained. For validation phase 2, serum samples from 98 PACG patients and 78 controls were collected which was enrolled from Eye Center of Fudan University between January 2021 and December 2021. Potential biomarkers were validated in validation phase 2 using chemiluminescence methods. For the supplemental phase, we used widely targeted metabolomics to investigate whether the same potential biomarkers were present in PACG patients’ aqueous humor. All the clinical characteristics (age, sex, BMI, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, drinking) were matched between PACG and controls in the four phases.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Study design and workflow.</title><p>A five-phase study (discovery phase [discovery set 1, the discovery set 2], validation phase 1, validation phase 2, supplemental phase, and cohort phase) design.

Following that, aqueous humor samples were quickly transferred to sterile cryotubes and kept at –80°C for metabolomic analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Sample preprocessing</title><p>The same internal standard was added to each sample during metabolite extraction (L-2-chlorophenylalanine, 4-fluoro-L-α-phenylglycine, [2H5]-kynurenic acid, [2H5]-phenoxy acetic acid, indole-3-butyric-2,2-d2 acid, LysoPC 19:0, DL-3-indole-lactic acid). Before extraction, the serum was thawed on ice, vortexed for 10 s, and mixed well. 300 µl of pure cold methanol was added to 50 µl of serum, swirled for 3 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, transfer the supernatant into a new centrifuge tube and place it in a –20°C refrigerator for 30 min. The sample was thawed on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 3 min. Transfer 180 µl of the supernatant to the injection vial for mass spectrometry analysis. Quality control (QC) samples are generated by pooling all the serum samples to monitor the retention time and signal intensity consistency. Equal volumes (10 µl) of all serum samples were combined to generate QC samples, which were employed to monitor the repeatability of the analysis. During the mass spectrometry analysis, one QC sample was included in every 10 samples to ensure the consistency of the analytical process. The PACG and control groups’ serum samples were randomly arranged and analyzed. The laboratory conducting the metabolomics measurements was blinded to the samples’ case/control/QC status.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Analytical methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gong et al., 2022</xref>)</title><sec id="s2-5-1"><title>Untargeted metabolomics analysis</title><p>Ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) (ExionLC AD, AB SCIEX) separation was performed using Waters ACQUITY HSS T3 (2.1×100 mm<sup>2</sup>, 1.8 µm).

Regrettably, existing medical protocols do not advocate for the use of blood-based biomarkers to diagnose and prognosticate PACG. Consequently, it is imperative to develop novel, uncomplicated, and practicable approaches to improve the early detection of PACG and its predictive accuracy. To address the significant challenge at hand, the present study conducted a cross-sectional and prospective cohort investigation utilizing high-throughput, widely targeted metabolomics and targeted chemiluminescence immunoassay on blood samples obtained from a substantial number of patients diagnosed with PACG and healthy individuals. The findings of this study reveal, for the first time, that androstenedione exhibits a reasonable level of precision (AUC, 0.85–1.0) in distinguishing between PACG and control groups in blood samples. Additionally, the baseline levels of androstenedione may serve as a valuable predictor of glaucomatous VF progression.</p><p>Some metabolites have been proposed to have a potential role in discriminating PACG from normal, but validation studies in larger cohorts still need to be completed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rong et al., 2017</xref>, conducted a case-control (PACG = 38, normal = 48) study using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and reported that palmitoleic acid, linoleic acid, γ-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid were identified as essential metabolites associated with PACG, but diagnostic accuracy is unknown. In our study, these metabolites were also detected, but diagnosis accuracy (AUC&lt;0.7) was limited. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Qin et al., 2022</xref>, measured plasma 22 free fatty acids (FFA) and 6 lipid classes using metabolomics analysis, shown that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and total saturated fatty acids may be screening indices (AUC, 0.82–0.85) for PACG patients but lack validation set to confirm the results. DHA (AUC, 0.74–0.85), FFA (22:6) (AUC, 0.74–0.85), and FFA (18:4) (AUC, 0.79–1.0) were also shown a diagnose value for PACG patients in the discovery set of our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), but the robustness and diagnose accuracy was weaker than androstenedione (AUC, 0.85–1.0) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>). The contribution of previous metabolites to PACG diagnosis was small, which prompted us to conduct a trial designed to develop biomarkers.</p><p>In this study, androstenedione levels achieved better diagnostic efficiency and robust calibration across the discovery and validation sets. The transformation of normal subjects into PACG is a chronic stepwise process. Given this, screening healthy individuals and those with a family history of the disease is vital. Another important finding of this research was that the level of serum androstenedione retained its diagnostic efficiency for distinguishing the severity of PACG. Furthermore, serum androstenedione levels incrementally increased from mild to moderate to severe PACG, suggesting that serum androstenedione levels may accurately reflect the progression/severity of PACG. Furthermore, androstenedione levels at baseline were a new biomarker for predicting glaucomatous VF progression. Hence, serum androstenedione levels may provide a new biomarker for early detection and monitoring/predicting PACG severity/progression.</p><p>In the supplemental phase, we asked whether the serum levels of androstenedione were significantly correlated with aqueous humor levels of androstenedione from the same PACG patients, which is an important criterion for application as a routine clinical biomarker and to explore the biological function in PACG. Fortunately, the levels of aqueous humor androstenedione were positively correlated (r=0.82, p=0.038) with serum levels. Meanwhile, the levels of aqueous humor androstenedione incrementally increased from mild-moderate to severe PACG. Furthermore, the levels of aqueous humor androstenedione remained higher in PACG than in cataracts. Together, these results confirm that androstenedione can serve as a novel biomarker for early detection and monitoring of the progression/severity of PACG.</p><p>In clinical practice, oral topical glaucoma medications and laser peripheral iridectomy were the primary therapies used to treat PACG. However, the effects of these therapies are mainly estimated by measurement of IOP and optical coherence tomography. Thus, we have wondered whether, by dynamic detection, serum androstenedione levels could reflect the therapeutic effect of these therapies. In the supplemental phase (fourth phase), in a small cohort of nine PACG patients treated with laser peripheral iridectomy or oral topical glaucoma medications, which showed a better prognosis, seven of nine exhibited decreased levels of serum androstenedione. These results reveal a new biomarker for monitoring the effect of anti-glaucoma therapy; however, they should be verified in a larger cohort.</p><p>The main strength of our study is its robustness. We conducted a five-phase study (discovery set [discovery set 1, the discovery set 2], validation phase 1, validation phase 2, supplemental phase, and cohort phase). We used large and well-characterized patients with adequate controls to confirm the results. Widely targeted metabolomics and target chemiluminescence immunoassay methods provide high reliability of the metabolite. Androstenedione achieved better diagnostic accuracy across the discovery and validation sets, with AUC varying between 0.85 and 1.0. Interestingly, baseline androstenedione levels can predict glaucoma progression via VF loss results. Of note, the clinical practice of androstenedione in patients with PACG was analyzed by supplemental phase.</p><p>The metabolites identified by this study match PACG pathophysiological concepts. Pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that these 32 significantly altered metabolites primarily belonged to 16 pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among the top altered pathways, steroid hormone biosynthesis appears to be the critical node to high-match PACG pathophysiological concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Madjedi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Prokai-Tatrai et al., 2013</xref>): it connects with androstenedione. The molecular formula of androstenedione is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>. Steroid hormone biosynthesis appears to be a key node in the pathophysiological concept of highly matched PACG, but high enrichment is observed in metabolic pathways. Hormones play critical roles in various physiological functions, such as metabolism, immune responses, and inflammation regulation. In a related study on fatigue experienced during androgen deprivation therapy, marked disparities were found in metabolite levels in the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways, underscoring their significance in metabolic shifts. These insights highlight the intricate interconnection between steroid hormone biosynthesis and other metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Feng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schiffer et al., 2019</xref>). The sex hormones pathway is a vital component of steroid hormone biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Several studies have focused on the importance of 17β-estradiol in protecting the retinal ganglion cell layer and preserving visual function in clinical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vajaranant et al., 2018</xref>) and basic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Prokai-Tatrai et al., 2013</xref>) research by anti-inflammatory effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Engler-Chiurazzi et al., 2017</xref>). Our previous studies suggested that decreased sex hormone concentrations in glaucoma lead to a hyperinflammatory state, leading to faster rates of VF damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Qiu et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that aromatase defects might lead to a decrease in estradiol levels and an increase in androstenedione, causing an inflammatory response and leading to retinal ganglion cell death in patient with glaucoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). In addition, androstenedione converted to estrogens is catalyzed by the aromatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Furthermore, some of the metabolites might also be linked to PACG physiological processes that remain unclear, and future research in this field is needed. Sex hormones, including androstenedione, might be associated with glaucoma types such as POAG, normal-tension glaucoma, and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2018</xref>). The precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear. More research is essential in understanding their relationship with different glaucoma types.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Potential mechanisms, androstenedione accumulation in patients with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Steroid hormone biosynthesis related to androstenedione.

For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">García-Sánchez et al., 2022</xref>, found that androstenedione can predict the progression of frailty syndrome in patients with localized breast cancer treated with aromatase inhibitors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adriaansen et al., 2022</xref>, reported that diurnal salivary androstenedione levels in healthy volunteers can be used for monitoring the treatment efficacy in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.</p><p>As far as our understanding goes, this is the initial investigation to methodically outline blood metabolites and scrutinize the diagnostic efficacy of a potential biomarker for PACG. Nevertheless, our study is not without its limitations: (1) The supplementary phase of our study was conducted with a restricted number of patients and healthy controls. Therefore, further investigations with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm the diagnostic accuracy of serum androstenedione for the detection of PACG. (2) Our study cohort exhibited uniform genetic and environmental traits, which may restrict the generalizability of our findings to populations with diverse ethnic or racial backgrounds. (3) Despite the matching of PACG patients and controls for age, gender, BMI, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and drinking, it is possible that unidentified residual confounding factors could impact the observed metabolomic disparities. (4) Throughout the duration of the follow-up period, the majority of individuals received pharmacological treatment, and the study’s follow-up period was limited to a mere 2 years. Consequently, the outcomes may have been impacted by either behavioral adjustments prompted by patients’ cognizance of their medical condition or by any form of therapeutic intervention. (5) Despite our examination of the impact of hormone intake (including estrogen, progestagen, and anti-androgen), the potential influence of reproductive aging cannot be entirely dismissed. (6) Understanding the link between changes in androstendione levels and glaucoma severity might hinge on metabolic and anti-inflammatory pathways. However, the current study did not delve deeply into the mechanism verification. Further research is essential to comprehensively grasp the precise relationship between androstendione and the severity of glaucoma, as well as the mechanisms at play. In conclusion, androstenedione has been identified and validated through the use of widely targeted LC-MS or targeted chemiluminescence immunoassay, demonstrating its ability to effectively differentiate between healthy individuals and those with PACG. Additionally, baseline androstenedione levels may serve as a valuable predictor of glaucomatous VF progression. However, further clinical and basic studies are required to confirm the clinical utility of serum androstenedione for early-stage PACG diagnosis, as well as its potential for monitoring/predicting VF progression and elucidating the underlying mechanisms linking androstenedione to PACG.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Software, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Validation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Data curation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University (2020[2020013]) and was conducted under the Declaration of Helsinki.

Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the prevalent form of glaucoma, while prevalence of primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is highest in Asia compared to over the world. Early detection of glaucoma and severity prediction is mandatory, and therefore the main aim of this study focused on characterizing the metabolite profile associated with PACG, identify potential blood diagnostic markers, assess their specificity for PACG and verify their applicability to predict progression of visual field loss. To this end, Li et al. implemented a 5-phases multicenter prospective study to identify novel candidate biomarkers of PACG. A total of 616 individuals were recruited, identifying 1464 distinct metabolites in the serum by metabolomics and chemiluminescence immunoassays. By applying different machine learning algorithms the metabolite androstenedione showed good discrimination between PACG and control subjects, both the discovery and validation phases. This metabolite also showed alterations in the aqueous humor and higher levels of androstenedione seemed to be associated with faster loss of visual field. Overall, the authors claimed that serum androstenedione levels may provide a new biomarker for early detection and monitoring/predicting PACG severity/progression.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>• Omics research on glaucoma is constrained by inadequate sample sizes, a dearth of validation sets to corroborate findings and absence of specificity analyses. The 5-phases study designed try overcoming these limitations. The proposed study design is very robust, with well described discovery set (1 and 2), validation phase (1 and 2), supplemental phase and cohort phase. Large and well-characterized patients with adequate control subjects contributed to the robustness of the results.</p><p>• Combining untargeted and targeted metabolomics using mass spectrometry instruments (high resolution and low resolution) with an additional chemiluminiscence immunoassay determining androstenedione levels</p><p>• Androstenedione achieved better diagnostic accuracy across the discovery and validation sets, with AUC varying between 0.85 and 1.0. Interestingly, baseline androstenedione levels can predict glaucoma progression via visual field loss results.</p><p>• Positive correlation was observed between levels of androstenedione in serum and aqueous humor of PACG patients.</p><p>• A level higher of 1.66 ng/mL of the metabolite androstenedione seems to imply high risk of visual field loss. Androstenedione may serve as predictor of glaucomatous visual field progression.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>• A single biomarker seems very unlikely to be of much help in the detection of glaucoma due to the etiological heterogeneity of the disease, the existence of different subtypes, and the genetic variability among patients. Rather, a panel of biomarkers may provide more useful information for clinical prediction, including better sensitivity and specificity. The inclusion of additional metabolites already identifying in the study, in combination, may provide more reliable and correct assignment results.</p><p>• The number of samples in the supplementary phase is low, larger samples sizes are mandatory to confirm the diagnostic accuracy.</p><p>• Cohorts from different populations are needed to verify the applicability of this candidate biomarker.</p><p>• Sex hormones seem to be associated also with other types of glaucoma, such as primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), although the molecular mechanisms are unclear (see doi:10.1167/iovs.17-22708).

A single biomarker seems very unlikely to be of much help in the detection of glaucoma due to the etiological heterogeneity of the disease, the existence of different subtypes, and the genetic variability among patients. Rather, a panel of biomarkers may provide more useful information for clinical prediction, including better sensitivity and specificity. The inclusion of additional metabolites already identifying in the study, in combination, may provide more reliable and correct assignment results.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your comment. We recognize the constraints of using single biomarkers for diagnosis. In upcoming research, we aim to incorporate multiple biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy and will consider adding more metabolites as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The number of samples in the supplementary phase is low, larger sample sizes are mandatory to confirm the diagnostic accuracy.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your comment. Collecting aqueous humor is invasive, making samples scarce. We acknowledge the small sample size limitation. In future studies, we plan to use larger samples to verify the biomarker's diagnostic accuracy. Your feedback emphasizes the need for thorough validation in our next research</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Cohorts from different populations are needed to verify the applicability of this candidate biomarker.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for the suggestion. We agree on the need to test the biomarker's relevance across varied populations. Reports from other groups will help confirm and broaden our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Sex hormones seem to be associated also with other types of glaucoma, such as primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), although the molecular mechanisms are unclear (see doi:10.1167/iovs.17-22708). The inclusion of patients diagnosed with other subtypes of glaucoma, like POAG, may contribute to determining the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed biomarker. Androstenedione levels should be determined in POAG, NTG, or PEXG patients.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: I agree with your comment and thank you for your suggestion. PACG is a major cause of irreversible blindness in Asians. While this study centers on PACG, the link between sex hormones and other glaucoma subtypes, like POAG, merits investigation. Future studies will include POAG and other subtypes to further assess androstenedione's diagnostic relevance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In addition, the levels of androstenedione were found significantly altered during other diseases as described by the authors or by conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome, limiting the utility of the proposed biomarker.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your advice. Androstenedione levels also change in conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome, which could affect the biomarker's specificity. We plan to further study androstenedione's unique changes in glaucoma versus other conditions to clarify its diagnostic value.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Uncertainty of the androstenedione levels compromises its usefulness in clinical practice.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: The uncertainty surrounding androstenedione levels and its impact on clinical applicability is a valid concern. We plan to delve deeper into understanding the variability and determinants of androstenedione levels to better assess its clinical relevance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The &quot;predict&quot; part is on much less solid ground. The visual field progression and association with serum androstenedione within the current experimental design eludes to a correlation. It truly cannot be stated as predictive. To predict one needs to put the substance when nothing is there and demonstrate that the desired endpoint is reached. Conversely, the substance (androstenedione) can be removed, and show that the condition regresses. None of these are possible without model system experiments, which have not been done. The authors could put some additional details in the methods, such as: (1) how much sample was collected, (2) whether equal serum volume for analysis had equal serum proteins (or cells). They have used a LC-MS/MS and a Chemiluminescence method, but another independent method such as GC-MS/MS or NMR to detect androstenedione for a subset of patients with different stages of visual field defect would be desirable.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: We acknowledge your constructive critique concerning our use of the term &quot;predict&quot;. In the present study, we elucidated a discernible correlation between visual field progression and serum androstenedione concentrations. We are cognizant of the critical distinction between correlation and causation, and we concur that our application of the term “predict” may have been overly assertive in this context.</p><p>Your emphasis on the imperative of employing model system experiments to unequivocally ascertain causative relationships is well-received. The experimental approach of modulating the substance, androstenedione in this case, to empirically observe its consequential impact on the condition, is a pivotal direction that warrants exploration in subsequent research endeavors.With regard to the variability of serum protein concentrations across participants, we adopted a methodological standardization by ensuring that the analyzed serum volume remained consistent across samples. This was implemented to enhance the reliability and generalizability of our findings.</p><p>Your recommendation to consider alternative detection methodologies, specifically GC-MS/MS or NMR, is duly noted. Although our choice of LC-MS/MS and Chemiluminescence was predicated on available resources, we recognize the scientific merit in leveraging multiple analytical techniques. In future investigations, we endeavor to incorporate a broader spectrum of detection methodologies for androstenedione, particularly when assessing patients with varied visual field defect stages, thereby bolstering the robustness and validity of our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. POAG is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide (see reference #4). The prevalence of PACG is highest in Asia, but the major form of glaucoma is still POAG. The authors should modify the abstract and background sections accordingly (see line 30 and lines 61-62).</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your suggestion, and we apologize for this mistake. The sentence” Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide” has been changed to” Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in Asia”. (Page 2, lines 33; Page 3, lines 62-64)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Line 69, please change the sentence &quot;the He et al. taught us...&quot; to the following &quot;the He et al. study taught us.&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your comment. The sentence &quot;the He et al. taught us...&quot; has been changed to &quot;the He et al. study taught us.&quot;. (Page 3, lines 72)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I suggest including the name of the identified candidate biomarker in the title of the manuscript. The title must be straightforward.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: We agree with your comment and thank you for your suggestion. The sentence “Metabolomics Identifies and Validates Serum Novel Biomarker for Diagnosing Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma and Predicting the Visual Field Progression” has been changed to “Metabolomics Identifies and Validates Serum Androstenedione as Novel Biomarker for Diagnosing Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma and Predicting the Visual Field Progression”. (Page 1, lines 1)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Line 88, please change &quot;normal subjects&quot; to &quot;control individuals&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your comment. We have changed &quot;normal subjects&quot; to &quot;control individuals”. (Page 4, lines 91)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Line 95 and so on along the manuscript, avoid the term &quot;normal controls&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; and use only the term &quot;controls&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your advice. &quot;normal subjects&quot; has been changed to &quot;controls&quot;. (Page 4, lines 113; Page5, lines 118,120,124,128,133)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In the participants section, indicate the ocular treatments of PACG patients. For example, on line 141, which &quot;treatment&quot; are you referring to?</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your comment. We apologize to this vague statement. Treatment included medical treatment and surgical treatment. We have revised it in the manuscript. (Page 5, lines 142)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The entire section 2.4 is confusing. According to Figure S2, untargeted metabolomics was conducted with a mixed sample containing &quot;all&quot; serum extracts in order to obtain an in-house database with molecular features present in serum by LCHRMS. Then, this database was used for targeted metabolomics in individual serum samples using LCQQQ. However, as it is described in the manuscripts, it seems that first, an untargeted metabolomics analysis was carried out to identify altered metabolites, then targeted metabolomics was carried out to validate the untargeted analysis and finally, a profiling analysis was carried out to construct the database. The workflow must be clearly discussed and amended to be understable.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your comment. We have revised the description of the experimental method section 2.4. (Page 7, lines 195-198)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Please, briefly explain what widely-targeted metabolomics is and how it works in this study (see section 2.4).</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your comment. For extensively targeted metabolome detection, a local database was first established by using the standard database, and ion pair information was obtained by scanning ion pairs of mixed samples (QC) with QTOF. A wide range of metabolites were qualitatively obtained by comparing with the local self-built database, and then the metabolites of each sample were qualitatively and quantitatively measured by MRM scanning mode of triple four-bar QQQ. This project combines the non-target public database scanning construction database and the wide target local database to build a new database, and then scans the database of the samples of this project with Q-TOF, and then carries out the qualitative and quantitative detection of metabolites of each sample in MRM mode. (Figure S2)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. On Table 1, indicate the number of patients and controls with cataracts.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: For the glaucoma group and the control group, we have excluded people with cataracts. This section is described in the inclusion and exclusion criteria for supplementary materials. (Inclusion and exclusion criteria)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. On &quot;Sample processing&quot; section, lines 152 and 153: Have you used cold methanol to ensure metabolic quenching? If not, how metabolite quenching was carried out?</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your comment. We use cold methanol to extract metabolites, and the early blood samples have been stored in a -80°C refrigerator to ensure a low temperature process and ensure metabolic quenching. (Page 6, lines 196)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. On the same &quot;Sample processing&quot; section, have you used internal standards during metabolite extraction? If yes, ones? If not, why?</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your comment. In the metabolite extraction process of each sample, the same internal standard was added, and the same volume of 50 μL serum samples were extracted. The specific internal label name has been added in &quot;Sample processing&quot; section. (Page 6, lines 153-155)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Lines 161-163, I suggest including in the supplementary material the worklist of the entire experiment run by LC-MS, including analytical replicates and QCs.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your comment. Worklist for mass spectrometry can be found in supplementary sheet1. (Page 6, lines 165)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. The title of the section &quot;Detection method&quot; does not seem appropriate, please change it to &quot;Analytical methods &quot;or something similar.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your advice. &quot;Detection method&quot; has been changed to “Analytical methods “. (Page 6, lines 168)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Section 2.4.1, I suggest changing &quot;Untargeted detection conditions&quot; to &quot;Untargeted metabolomics analysis&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your comment. &quot;Untargeted detection conditions&quot; has been changed to &quot;Untargeted metabolomics analysis&quot;. (Page 6, lines 169)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. Lines 170-172, the column used is compatible with 100% water, why start with 5% acetonitrile?</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your comment. If the acetonitrile starting gradient is 0, it will cause a lot of water-soluble substances to elute and easily clog the column, so we want to use 5% organic phase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. Section 2.4.1, the chromatographic conditions (mobiles phases) were the same in both positive and negative ion mode? It is desirable to change or adjust a basic pH when working in negative, so please amend and clarify it.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your comment. In the negative ion mode, the peak shape of the chromatogram under the acidic system is better than that under the alkaline system, so we choose the acidic system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. I am not able to clearly understand what is &quot;widely targeted conditions&quot; (see section 2.4.2). What is the difference with the conventional targeted metabolomics analysis? In my view, widely-targeted metabolomics refers to the combination of untargeted metabolomics and targeted metabolomics. This must be clarified and simplified.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your syggestion. The characterization of metabolites in this study was conducted using a non-targeted database and a self-built database. Non-targeted metabolites were characterized with mixed samples, and then combined with the laboratory self-established database to form a new metabolome database for this study. 2.4.2 The broad targeting here refers to the use of the MWDB standard self-built database to characterize metabolites, and then the QQQ MRM model to quantify metabolites. In order to clearly describe the detection process, this part of the method has been modified. (Figure S2)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18. Line 199, please, indicate the normalization carried out.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: We agree with your comment and thank you for your suggestion. The normalization description is missing from its data processing steps and has been corrected in the manuscript. (Page 7, lines 203)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19. How many instrumental replicates have you carried out both in untargeted and targeted metabolomics? Please, indicate it.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your advice. In this project, all sample mixtures were used as QC samples, which were repeated several times in the testing process (one QC sample was inserted between every 10 samples), and the repeated correlation between repeated QC was more than 99% to ensure the stability of sample testing. (Sheet1)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20. Line 267, why did you select a fold changes threshold greater than 1.15 (or lower 0.85)? In metabolomics, it would be desirable to have a minimum of 1.5-fold change considering the variability of data.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your comment. FC reduction is selected to expand potential candidate metabolites and can be repeated in three batches and refer to the literature &quot;Blood metabolomics uncovers inflammation-associated mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential mechanism. underlying ACLF &quot;method screening threshold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21. To include anywhere the molecular formula of androstenedione.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: I agree with your comment and thank you for your suggestion. We have added the molecular formula of androstenedione to the supplementary material. (Page 17, lines 475)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22. Line 290 is not Figure 4B and 4C, you may refer to Figure 3B and 3C.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your advice. We apologize to this mistake. Figure 4B and 4C have been changed to Figure 3B and 3C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23. Figure S3 was lost from Supplementary material, please include it.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your comment. We apologize to this mistake. There is an error in the ordering of the supplementary graph. Figure 3 is redundant, and we have modified it in the supplementary materials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>24. Figure 4 B, indicate in the text the average and uncertainty of androstenedione levels in both control and PACG groups.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Thank you for your comment.

Steroid hormone biosynthesis is one of these metabolic pathways, and its products, steroid hormones, participate in a wide range of physiological processes, including metabolism, immune response, and the regulation of inflammation. In a different context, a study related to fatigue during Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) showed a significant difference in metabolite levels within the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways, emphasizing the role these pathways play in metabolic alterations. The mentioned findings suggest that steroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolic pathways are intertwined. (Page 17, lines 481-488)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>36.

On lines 476-485, it would be interesting to discuss whether alterations of this metabolite could be a cause or consequence of PACG.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors’ answer: Based on the literature found, androstenedione is a naturally occurring steroid hormone produced by the gonads and adrenal glands, and serves as an intermediate in testosterone biosynthesis (Androstenedione (a Natural Steroid and a Drug Supplement): A Comprehensive Review of Its Consumption, Metabolism, Health Effects, and Toxicity with Sex Differences). Early events in the pathobiology of glaucoma involve oxidative, metabolic, or mechanical stress acting on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), leading to their rapid release of danger signals such as extracellular ATP, thus triggering microglial and macroglial activation as well as neuroinflammation (Immune Responses in the Glaucomatous Retina: Regulation and Dynamics). However, one might speculate that since androstenedione is a steroid hormone, it could potentially impact the inflammatory and metabolic stress observed in the pathophysiological processes of glaucoma (Adaptive responses to neurodegenerative stress in glaucoma). Metabolic and anti-inflammatory avenues might be crucial in understanding the relationship between alterations in androstenedione levels and the severity of glaucoma. Nevertheless, more research and literature analysis would be necessary to better understand the precise relationship and its underlying mechanisms between these two entities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>38.
