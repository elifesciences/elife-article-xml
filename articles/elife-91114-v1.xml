to metabolic dysfunction in mice. Here, we show that SPAG7 KO mice are born smaller and develop obesity and glucose intolerance in adulthood. This obesity does not stem from hyperphagia, but a decrease in energy expenditure. The KO animals also display reduced exercise tolerance and muscle function due to impaired mitochondrial function. Furthermore, SPAG7-deficiency in developing embryos leads to intrauterine growth restriction, brought on by placental insufficiency, likely due to abnormal development of the placental junctional zone. This insufficiency leads to loss of SPAG7-deficient fetuses in utero and reduced birth weights of those that survive. We hypothesize that a ‘thrifty phenotype’ is ingrained in SPAG7 KO animals during development that leads to adult obesity. Collectively, these results indicate that SPAG7 is essential for embryonic development and energy homeostasis later in life.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Obesity rates are climbing worldwide, leading to an increase in associated conditions such as type 2 diabetes. While new pharmaceutical approaches are available to help individuals manage their weight, many patients do not respond to them or experience prohibitive side effects. Identifying alternative treatments will likely require pinpointing the genes and molecular actors involved in the biological processes that control weight regulation.</p><p>Previous research suggests that a protein known as SPAG7 could help shape how mice use and store the energy they extract from food. Flaherty et al. therefore set out to investigate the role this protein plays in the body. To do so, they created a line of mice born without SPAG7, which they monitored closely throughout life.</p><p>These animals were underweight at birth and did not eat more than other mice, yet they were obese as adults. Their ability to exercise was reduced, their muscles were weaker and contained fibers with functional defects. The mice also exhibited biological changes associated with the onset of diabetes. Yet deleting SPAG7 during adulthood led to no such changes; these mice maintained normal muscle function and body weight.</p><p>Closely examining how SPAG7-deficient mice developed in the womb revealed placental defects which likely caused these animals to receive fewer nutrients from their mother. Such early-life deprivation is known to be associated with the body shifting towards maximizing its use of resources and privileging fat storage, even into and throughout adulthood.</p><p>By shedding light on the biological role of SPAG7, the work by Flaherty et al. helps to better understand how developmental events can increase the likelihood of obesity later in life. Further investigations are now needed to explore whether this knowledge could help design interventions relevant to human health.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SPAG7</kwd><kwd>embryonic development</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>insulin resistance</kwd><kwd>intrauterine growth restriction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014476</institution-id><institution>Pfizer Pharmaceuticals</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research and Development</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simmons</surname><given-names>Rebecca A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Investigation of mouse models from forward mutagenetic screen reveals that the gene <italic>Spag7</italic> is essential for embryonic development and energy homeostasis later in life.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity and associated metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), are major sources of morbidity and mortality that are reaching epidemic proportions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cawley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stokes and Preston, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">WHO, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">WHO, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zimmet et al., 2016</xref>). Lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise, can be effective in combating these afflictions in some patients. However, low adherence and counter-regulatory mechanisms that limit weight reduction and long-term weight maintenance impede the effectiveness of such interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brownell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roberts and Barnard, 2005</xref>). The new anti-obesity drugs, semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, and tirzepatide, a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, have demonstrated remarkable efficacy for weight loss and hold great promise as anti-obesity treatments to alleviate metabolic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Venniyoor, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilding et al., 2021</xref>). However, even with their recent success, there are many patients who do not respond to GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment or have to discontinue the treatment due to side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chao et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, there remains a need for additional new therapies to combat obesity.</p><p>To identify new targets for the treatment of obesity and diabetes, we began a large-scale forward genetic phenotypic screen in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Random mutations in the mouse genome were generated using the chemical ENU (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea). The genomes of the animals were sequenced, and various metabolic endpoints were evaluated to identify genes with mutations associated with obesity and insulin resistance phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Through this process, mutations in the gene <italic>Spag7</italic> (sperm-associated antigen 7) were identified. SPAG7 is well-conserved with 97% of the amino acid sequence being identical in humans and mice. Structurally, it contains a nuclear localization signal, making it likely a nuclear protein, and an R3H domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nagata et al., 2005</xref>). The function of the R3H domain is also not fully understood; however, it is predicted to bind polynucleotides, and other proteins that contain R3H domains are known to bind single-stranded DNA or RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grishin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SPAG7-deficiency causes obesity and insulin resistance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graphical representation of an ENU-driven forward genetic screen.

SPAG7 KO animals are obese in adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). But they have an unexpected growth curve; they are underweight early in life, catch up around six weeks of age, and then continue to outgrow WT littermates into and throughout adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). SPAG7-deficient mice demonstrate decreased lean mass early in life that remains below that of WT littermates throughout their lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, fat mass in the animals increases continually, growing to three-to-five-times the fat mass of WTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). SPAG7-deficient animals display decreased body length, measured nose to base of tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Bone mass density is also decreased in SPAG7 KO animals, which may contribute to the decreased lean mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>The majority of the increased body weight in SPAG7-deficient animals stems from increased adipose tissue mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). All adipose tissue depots more than double in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). SPAG7-deficient adipose tissues display adipocyte hypertrophy and increased immune cell infiltration, consistent with chronic obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>). However, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain weights are all decreased in SPAG7-deficient animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–L</xref>). Livers display no change in mass but do have increased triglyceride content, indicating hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I–K</xref>). No changes in circulating liver enzymes were observed, indicating that the lipid accumulation was not severe enough to induce significant liver damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1L–O</xref>). Plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids are all increased, consistent with an obesity phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N-S</xref>).</p><p>SPAG7-deficient animals display severely impaired glucose uptake in response to oral glucose gavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1T</xref>).

The biological function of SPAG7 is largely unknown. Utilizing constitutive and inducible SPAG7 knockout mouse models, we investigated the function of SPAG7 in vivo. The results show that SPAG7-deficient mice were born with lower body weight; however, they developed obesity and insulin resistance in adulthood. The metabolic disturbance in the SPAG7 KO animals is due to a decrease in energy expenditure, driven by decreased locomotor activity. Skeletal muscle function and exercise endurance in SPAG7-deficient animals are significantly impaired, displaying decreased force generation and oxidative capacity. In addition, these phenotypes are downstream of developmental effects, as knocking out SPAG7 in adulthood did not cause these metabolic disturbances. Furthermore, SPAG7 KO embryos display intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and aberrant development of the junctional zone of SPAG7-deficient placenta. These results demonstrate that SPAG7 is essential for fetal growth and placental function. Lack of SPAG7 results in IUGR, which leads to the development of obesity, insulin resistance, and other metabolic disturbances later in life.</p><p>Fetal nutritional status is well-known to drive metabolic health in adulthood. Perhaps the most famous example of this is the Dutch Hunger Winter. Pregnant women, exposed to acute and extreme decreases in nutritional intake, gave birth to low birthweight newborns, who were then at higher risk for developing obesity and diabetes in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roseboom et al., 2006</xref>). Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) has been linked to the development of metabolic syndrome later in life. However, the mechanisms that cause IUGR and influence its association with adult metabolic health remain poorly understood. Bilateral uterine artery ligation during gestation in rats leads to decreased birth weights, but obesity in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simmons et al., 2001</xref>).

Muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity can also be lower in IUGR skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stremming et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The deleterious effects of SPAG7-deficiency on the fetus clearly indicate an important function for SPAG7 during embryonic development. The most common cause for IUGR is placental insufficiency. In the rodent, the placenta can be roughly broken up into three zones: the decidua, the labyrinth zone, and the junctional zone. The decidua and labyrinth zones contain the vasculature of the mother and fetus, respectively. The junctional zone is the main site of nutrient and gas exchange and also the main endocrine compartment of the placenta, producing hormones, growth factors, and cytokines that are important for the normal progression of pregnancy and fetal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Woods et al., 2018</xref>). Histological examination of SPAG7 KO placenta revealed abnormal morphology of both the labyrinth and junctional zones. In addition, the junctional zone was markedly diminished in SPAG7 KO placenta, as demonstrated by decreased junctional:labyrinth zone ratios and decreased percent junctional zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–I</xref>). The mature mouse placenta is established mid-gestation (~e10.5) and continues to grow, in size and complexity, throughout the pregnancy. Early in gestation, the yolk sac supports the nutritional needs of the embryo, however, from mid-gestation onward, the fetal nutrient supply requires the transport capacity of the placenta. The success of this transition is critical for fetal survival and continued growth. During our studies, we did not observe significant loss of SPAG7 KO embryos until after the switch to placental nutrition supply, which could be due to the disruption of labyrinth and junctional zone development in the placenta.</p><p>We hypothesize the SPAG7 KO fetuses that survive do so by decreasing the mitochondrial metabolic capacity of their skeletal muscle and other tissues. Reducing muscle energy consumption in response to the decreased nutrient availability in the IUGR fetus is advantageous to ensure fetal survival. However, when these animals are born and age, this reduction predisposes them towards metabolic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pendleton et al., 2021</xref>). After birth, when nutrition is readily available, the decrease in energy expenditure, combined with food intake normalized to wild-type littermates, eventually leads to increased body weight and fat mass. It is worth noting that SPAG7 KO mice are not hyperphagic, a phenotype observed in some IUGR models, suggesting that other perturbations in SPAG7 KO animals may counter-regulate hyperphagia. The key driver for the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome in the SPAG7 KO mouse is reduced energy expenditure. Models that produce obesity, primarily driven by decreased locomotor activity, are rare. Further investigation of SPAG7-deficient mice may provide valuable information for drugs targeting energy expenditure in the treatment of obesity.</p><p>Overall, our results demonstrate that SPAG7 plays an important role in fetal development. SPAG7 is essential for the proper formation of the junctional and labyrinth zones of the placenta, which contributes to IUGR in the SPAG7 KO fetus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The surviving SPAG7 KO mice develop a range of metabolic disorders including obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, exercise impairment, reduced energy expenditure, and reduced skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity in adulthood. Our results uncover, for the first time, the biological function for the <italic>Spag7</italic> gene in vivo. Furthermore, these findings shed light into a new biological pathway regulating fetal development. The results provide insights into how skeletal muscle function contributes to systemic energy balance and how fetal nutritional status can have far-reaching effects, influencing the nutritional status of the adult. Deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in placental insufficiency, IUGR, and SPAG7 biology may give us the opportunity to reverse aberrations in fetal growth rate and prevent the metabolic co-morbidities associated with low birth weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wood, 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Graphical abstract.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SPAG7-deficiency causes intrauterine growth restriction which leads to obesity and insulin resistance in adulthood.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91114-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal experiments were conducted following study protocols and procedures reviewed and approved by Pfizer Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

The precise function of spag7 has not been fully described yet, thereby the primary objective of this investigation is to unravel its pivotal role in the development of obesity and metabolic disease in mice. First, they generated a mice model lacking spag7 and observed that KO mice exhibited diminished birth size, which subsequently progressed to manifest obesity and impaired glucose tolerance upon reaching adulthood. This behaviour was primarily attributed to a reduction in energy expenditure. In fact, KO animals demonstrated compromised exercise endurance and muscle functionality, stemming from a deterioration in mitochondrial activity. Intriguingly, none of these effects was observed when using a tamoxifen-induced KO mouse model, implying that Spag7's influence is predominantly confined to the embryonic developmental phase. Explorations within placental tissue unveiled that mice afflicted by Spag7 deficiency experienced placental insufficiency, likely due to aberrant development of the placental junctional zone, a phenomenon that could impede optimal nutrient conveyance to the developing fetus. Overall, the authors assert that Spag7 emerges as a crucial determinant orchestrating accurate embryogenesis and subsequent energy balance in the later stages of life.</p><p>The study boasts several noteworthy strengths. Notably, it employs a combination of animal models and a thorough analysis of metabolic and exercise parameters, underscoring a meticulous approach. Furthermore, the investigation encompasses a comprehensive evaluation of fetal loss across distinct pregnancy stages, alongside a transcriptomic analysis of skeletal muscle, thereby imparting substantial value. Upon addressing the previously mentioned aspects, the study is poised to exert a substantial influence on the field, its significance reverberating significantly. The methodologies and data presented undoubtedly hold the potential to facilitate the community's deeper understanding of the ramifications stemming from disruptions during pregnancy, shedding light on their enduring impact on the metabolic well-being of subsequent generations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91114.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors of this manuscript are interested in discovering and functionally characterizing genes that might cause obesity.

Furthermore, the investigation encompasses a comprehensive evaluation of fetal loss across distinct pregnancy stages, alongside a transcriptomic analysis of skeletal muscle, thereby imparting substantial value. However, a pivotal weakness of the study centres on its translational applicability. While the authors claim that &quot;SPAG7 is well-conserved with 97% of the amino acid sequence being identical in humans and mice&quot;, the precise role of spag7 in the human context remains enigmatic. This limitation hampers a direct extrapolation of findings to human scenarios. Additionally, the study's elucidation of the molecular underpinnings behind the spag7-mediated anomalous development of the placental junction zone remains incomplete. Finally, the hypothesis positing a reduction in nutrient availability to the fetus, though intriguing, requires further substantiation, leaving an aspect of the mechanism unexplored.</p><p>Hence, in order to fortify the solidity of their conclusions, these concerns necessitate meticulous attention and resolution in the forthcoming version of the manuscript. Upon the comprehensive addressing of these aspects, the study is poised to exert a substantial influence on the field, its significance reverberating significantly. The methodologies and data presented undoubtedly hold the potential to facilitate the community's deeper understanding of the ramifications stemming from disruptions during pregnancy, shedding light on their enduring impact on the metabolic well-being of subsequent generations.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to this reviewer for their thoughtful analysis and commentary. Human mutations in SPAG7 are exceedingly rare (SPAG7 | pLoF (genebass.org)), potentially because of the deleterious effects of SPAG7-deficiency on prenatal development. This makes investigation into the causative effects of SPAG7 in humans challenging. There exist mutations in the SPAG7 region of the genome that are associated with BMI, but no direct coding variants within the spag7 gene itself have been studied.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the precise role of spag7 in the placenta remains unknown. However, given its robust expression and high protein levels in the placenta, including in key cells, such as the syncytiotrophoblast (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000091640-SPAG7/tissue/Placenta">https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000091640-SPAG7/tissue/Placenta</ext-link>), it is highly likely that spag7 is critical for normal placenta development and function. Multiple studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9716072/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9716072/</ext-link>) have recently shown that sperm associated RNAs play a critical role in embryonic and early placenta development. Our findings will provide the basis for future studies that can elucidate the role of spag7 in human placenta.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors of this manuscript are interested in discovering and functionally characterizing genes that might cause obesity.

Significant effort has been made to understand the causes of the metabolic phenotypes observed in SPAG7-deficient mouse models. It is clear that hyperphagia is not the cause and the muscle energetics deficit is likely not the sole cause. We expect that decreased access to nutrition in utero will lead to widespread and varied metabolic adaptation.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that further work can be done to understand the molecular mechanism driving the metabolic phenotypes of SPAG7-deficient animals. We believe that full investigation of the processes behind the developmental abnormalities is beyond the scope of this paper and best to be done under a separate paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Flaherty III S.E. et al identified SPAG7 gene in their forward mutagenetic screening and created the germline knockout and inducible knockout mice.

The germline whole-body KO mice were female mice (Line293), however the inducible knockout mice were male mice (Line549). Sexual dimorphism is often observed in metabolic studies, therefore the metabolic phenotype of both female and male mice needs to be reported for the germline and inducible knockouts in order to make the justified conclusion.</p><p>1. SPAG7 has an NLS. Does this protein function in gene expression? Whether the overall metabolic phenotype is the direct cause of SPAG7 ablation is unclear. For example, the Hsd17b10 gene was downregulated in all tissues in the KO mice. Could this have been coincidentally selected for and thus be the cause of the developmental issues and adulthood obesity? Do the iSpag7 mice demonstrate reduced expression of Hsd17b10?</p><p>1. Figure 2c should display the energy expenditure normalized to body weight (or lean body mass).</p><p>1. Please provide more information for the figure legend, including the statistical test that was conducted for each data set, animal numbers for each genotype and sexes.</p><p>1. The authors should report how long after treatment the data was collected for figures 4F-M.</p><p>1. The authors should justify ending the data collection after 8 weeks for the iSPAG7 mice in Figures 4C-E. In the WT vs germline KO mice, there was no clear difference in body weight or lean mass at 15 weeks of age.</p></disp-quote><p>Response to point #1 (Weakness): We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful analysis and commentary. All inducible KO animals described in the paper are female (the typo in Line 549 has been corrected). We did perform studies in both male and female animals for both of these lines.

predicted to bind polynucleotides, and other proteins that contain R3H domains are known to bind RNA or ssDNA. The iSPAG7 mice do display decreased hsd17b10 expression (to a lesser degree than the germline KOs) in the tissues examined. When we knock-down SPAG7 in specific tissues, we also see hsd17b10 expression decrease specifically in those tissues. These data all suggest that hsd17b10 expression is, at least, linked to spag7 expression. They also raise the question of why these animals have no metabolic phenotype. Some possible explanations are that hsd17b10 expression is essential only during early development, or that the lower magnitude of downregulation of hsd17b10 in the iSPAG7 is insufficient to produce the metabolic phenotypes seen in the germline Kos with higher magnitude of downregulation.</p><p>Response to point #3 (Weakness): How best to normalize total energy expenditure data is a subject of debate within the energy expenditure field. As the animals have increased body weight and decreased lean mass, normalizing to either will skew the results in different directions. We have included the data normalized to body weight and to lean mass below. The decrease in total energy expenditure remains significant in either scenario.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91114-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Response to point #4 (Weakness): The information has been added to all figures.</p><p>Response to point #5 (Weakness): Weeks after treatment have been added to the figure legends for Figures 4F-M.</p><p>Response to point #6 (Weakness): Highly significant changes in fat mass, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity are already present in the germline SPAG7 KO mice at age of 15 week or earlier. Tamoxifen injection effectively induced SPA7 gene KO in less than a week in the iSPAG7 KO mice. Given the absence of significant changes or any trends towards significance in glucose and insulin tolerance test as well as other metabolic testes in the iSPAG7 KO mice at age of 15 week (same age as the germline KO when these changes observed) and 8 week after SPAG7 gene KO, we did not anticipate to see the changes beyond this point and decided to stop the study at 9 weeks after treatment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
