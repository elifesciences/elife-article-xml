uncharacterized. We employed bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) and mass spectrometry to comprehensively characterize the secretome of murine visceral and subcutaneous white and interscapular brown adip ocytes. Over 600 proteins were identified, the majority of which showed cell type-specific enrichment. We here describe a metabolic role for leucine-rich α–2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) as an obesity-regulated adipokine secreted by mature adipocytes. LRG1 overexpression significantly improved glucose homeostasis in diet-induced and genetically obese mice. This was associated with markedly reduced white adipose tissue macrophage accumulation and systemic inflammation. Mechanistically, we found LRG1 binds cytochrome <italic>c</italic> in circulation to dampen its pro-inflammatory effect. These data support a new role for LRG1 as an insulin sensitizer with therapeutic potential given its immunomodulatory function at the nexus of obesity, inflammation, and associated pathology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adipokine</kwd><kwd>secretome</kwd><kwd>LRG1</kwd><kwd>cytochrome c</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>insulin resistance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000041</institution-id><institution>American Diabetes Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1-17-ACE-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RC2 DK129961</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Chan Hee J</given-names></name><name><surname>Szwed</surname><given-names>Sarah K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sarnoff Cardiovascular Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zaman</surname><given-names>Samir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Profiling the adipocyte secretome reveals LRG1 as a novel adipokine that promotes insulin sensitivity and modulates inflammation triggered by release of cytochrome c from dead/dying cells, describing a new pathway at the intersection of obesity and its systemic sequelae.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity is a major threat to human health due to its association with serious comorbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Angelantonio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Poirier et al., 2006</xref>). Now considered an important endocrine organ, adipose tissue secretes a constellation of bioactive peptides, or adipokines, many of which regulate whole-body energy homeostasis and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Funcke and Scherer, 2019</xref>). Dysregulation of adipose tissue endocrine function is a key feature of obesity and a major contributor to its sequelae. However, the vast majority of adipokines remain unstudied. Addressing this knowledge gap calls for a detailed characterization of the adipose secretome to better understand how adipocytes communicate with other cells to coordinate systemic metabolism.</p><p>Mammals possess white (WAT) and brown adipose tissues (BAT), with divergent effects on whole-body metabolism. Visceral (Visc) WAT is particularly associated with obesity-related diseases, whereas subcutaneous (SubQ) WAT is comparatively benign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fox et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, active BAT is associated with improved cardiometabolic health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Becher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). While Visc fat contains predominantly white adipocytes that efficiently store energy, SubQ depots contain a mixture of white and thermogenic beige adipocytes which, like brown adipocytes, dissipate energy as heat via uncoupled respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chouchani et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to these bioenergetic properties, transplantation studies in mice have demonstrated that secretory mediators likely convey the metabolic effects of different adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tran et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, BAT-specific secreted factors, called batokines, are increasingly appreciated as important contributors to the benefits associated with BAT activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Villarroya et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Transcriptomic profiling coupled with secretion prediction algorithms is often utilized to identify putative secreted proteins, but this approach could omit non-classically secreted factors. Alternatively, direct detection of proteins in conditioned medium (CM) can be performed using mass spectrometry (MS). Such proteomic analyses are commonly performed in fetal bovine serum (FBS)-free conditions because FBS proteins interfere with detection of relatively low abundance secreted proteins in CM. Serum starvation, however, induces a complex and unpredictable response from cultured cells, making physiological interpretation difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pirkmajer and Chibalin, 2011</xref>).</p><p>To overcome these limitations, a chemoproteomic technology called BONCAT has been applied for secretome profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dieterich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eichelbaum et al., 2012</xref>). L-Azidohomoalanine (AHA) is a non-toxic, non-canonical amino acid with structural similarity to L-methionine (Met) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). AHA can be recognized by cells’ native translational machinery and incorporated into the nascent proteome in place of Met. The azide functional group in AHA does not exist in nature, so peptides containing AHA can be targeted for bio-orthogonal chemical conjugation strategies called click chemistry. Applying this technique to cultured adipocytes allows for selective enrichment of low abundance nascent secreted proteins for proteomic analysis of serum-containing CM.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of primary adipocyte secretome using BONCAT.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical structures of L-methionine (Met) and L-azidohomoalanine (AHA).

By day 6 of differentiation, all three cell types showed comparable lipid droplet accumulation and expression of mature adipocyte markers such as <italic>Fabp4</italic>, <italic>Pparg2</italic>, and <italic>Adipoq</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). In vitro primary adipocytes recapitulated characteristic gene expression patterns in vivo, with expression of <italic>Prdm16</italic> and <italic>Ucp1</italic> highest in Brown, intermediate in SubQ, and lowest in Visc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Adipocytes were pulsed with Met-deficient media containing 0.1 mM AHA and 10% FBS for 24 hours, after which CM was collected. Except for <italic>Pparg2</italic>, we did not observe a significant effect of AHA pulse on expression of mature adipocyte or thermogenic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To visualize azide-labeled secreted proteins, CM was subjected to a copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction with tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-alkyne. In-gel fluorescence analysis highlighted adipocyte-derived proteins in CM as bands positive for TAMRA fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>For identification and quantitative analysis of the secretome across the three adipose cell types, azide-labeled proteins were enriched from CM by conjugating with alkyne-agarose beads. On-bead digested peptides were subjected to label-free MS. We detected a total of 742 proteins, of which 138 were excluded as reverse hits or contaminants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) value estimates a protein’s molar abundance, and summation of iBAQ intensities (Σ iBAQ) of a sample can estimate total moles of proteins detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shin et al., 2013</xref>). Σ iBAQ values closely correlated with in-gel fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), both of which showed highest abundance of secreted proteins in SubQ CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>We next examined how many of these AHA-labeled proteins are reported or predicted secreted factors. Referencing gene ontology (GO) cellular component terms for 594 genes from 604 detected proteins, a large majority of proteins (413/594, 70%) were annotated to be extracellular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We performed retrospective secretion prediction analysis on 604 proteins, evaluating the proportion of proteins predicted to be secreted by the classical ER/Golgi pathway (SignalP5.0, TMHMM2.0), sequence-based deep learning method for subcellular localization prediction (DeepLoc1.0), glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchors (PredGPI), and non-classical routes (SecretomeP2.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Almagro Armenteros et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Almagro Armenteros et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bendtsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krogh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pierleoni et al., 2008</xref>). Over two-thirds of the proteins (413/604, 68%) were predicted to be secreted via the classical pathway, while non-classical secretion constituted about 10% (62/604) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Overall, 79% of detected proteins (479/604) met at least one criterion of secretion prediction. Notably, more than 20% of identified proteins would not have been predicted to be secreted by these algorithms, highlighting the imperfect nature of in silico predictions and the value of directly measuring secreted protein levels.</p><p>In-gel fluorescence analysis showed differential band patterns across the three types of adipocytes, suggesting cell type-specific secretory profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistent with this observation, principal component analysis (PCA) showed that each cell type formed a distinct cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Comparing all nine AHA-pulsed samples against each other showed higher correlations within biological replicates (<italic>R</italic>&gt;0.97) than those across different cell types (0.74&lt;R &lt; 0.91) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). For quantitative analysis, we focused on 424 proteins detected in at least 2/3 replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and compared their Log2-transformed label-free quantification (LFQ) intensities, imputing any missing values with a left-shifted Gaussian distribution. One-way ANOVA yielded 348 proteins with significantly different (<italic>q</italic>&lt;0.01) secretory profiles across cell types, and unbiased clustering was performed based on protein levels in CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Clusters 1 and 4 contained proteins enriched in CM of Visc and Brown, respectively. Cluster 2 proteins were most abundant in CM of SubQ followed by Visc, both white adipocytes. Cluster 3 was highly secreted by SubQ and Brown adipocytes with proteins such as SLIT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Svensson et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting enrichment of the beige/brown secretome, as well as regulators of immune cell migration and angiogenesis. Cluster 4 comprised the largest number of proteins (125/348), consistent with Brown CM containing the greatest number of unique proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Ranking proteins by decreasing order of abundance, we found high levels of many well-described adipocyte-derived factors such as CFD, RETN, ADIPOQ, and RBP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Interestingly, many cluster 2 proteins ranked highly in abundance, while cluster 4 proteins skewed towards lower abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Hence, while SubQ adipocytes demonstrate high secretory capacity, the brown adipocyte secretome is characterized by a diverse array of proteins, many of which are secreted at lower levels.</p><p>We next performed pathway analysis on each of the clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Visc CM-enriched cluster 1 was overrepresented with proteins involved in immune response and complement activation, such as C1QA and CFH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Proteins with a role in collagen fibril organization and extracellular matrix formation, such as COL1A1 and SFRP, were enriched in cluster 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Cluster 3 (beige/brown enriched) showed overrepresentation of angiogenesis regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>).

The majority of proteins were most highly expressed by the liver, which comprised the largest cluster (98/177, 55%). BAT, the only adipose tissue profiled in the dataset, formed a cluster of 14 genes (7.9%). As expected, classical adipokines known for highly adipose-specific expression such as adiponectin (<italic>Adipoq</italic>) and adipsin (<italic>Cfd</italic>) belonged to this group, along with a recently described batokine, <italic>Kng2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peyrou et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>BioGPS offers microarray-based transcriptomic data across a much wider variety of mouse tissue and cell types, including eWAT and BAT. We numerically scaled the degree of adipose tissue enrichment for each detected serum protein. Adipose enrichment of a gene was defined as the number of tissues with expression significantly lower than that of eWAT, BAT, or combined. We divided this value by the total number of pairwise comparisons (i.e., total number of tissues - 2 adipose tissues) to obtain the percentage adipose tissue enrichment score. Among the top-enriched genes were well-described adipokines such as <italic>Adipoq</italic>, where 76 of 86 tissues (88.4%) expressed <italic>Adipoq</italic> at significantly lower levels than eWAT and BAT combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The remaining 10 tissues that did not meet the statistical significance cutoff still expressed <italic>Adipoq</italic> at lower levels compared to eWAT or BAT and included adipose-embedded tissues such as mammary glands.

Many genes, such as <italic>Rbp4</italic>, <italic>Agt</italic>, and <italic>Lrg1</italic>, showed high expression in adipose tissues as well as liver. On the t-SNE plot, these genes were grouped with other liver-specific genes, but located closer to the adipose tissue cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Recently, whole-body LRG1 loss of function has been reported to reduce obesity and improve metabolic health by reducing hepatosteatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">He et al., 2021</xref>).

Consistent with our tissue enrichment analysis, qPCR of mouse tissues showed that <italic>Lrg1</italic> mRNA was mostly expressed in adipose tissues and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To determine which cell type(s) within adipose tissue express <italic>Lrg1</italic>, we fractionated eWAT, iWAT, and BAT to separate floating mature adipocytes from the SVF.

SVF from adipose tissues of LRG1-KO mice (generation of which is described further below) was able to differentiate into mature adipocytes in LRG1-depleted media, and the degree of adipogenesis was largely unaffected by adding back recombinant human LRG1 (rhLRG1), as determined by lipid accumulation and mature adipocyte gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>).

To visualize which genes are most significantly differentially regulated, we plotted a heatmap of 68 genes that showed significant difference (adjusted <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) with Log2 fold-change of &gt;2 or &lt;-2 between the two groups at both time points. Consistent with the pathway analysis, the LRG1 group showed significant down-regulation of cytokines and chemokines such as <italic>Ccl3</italic>, <italic>Ccl4</italic>, and <italic>Cxcl9</italic>; metalloproteinases such as <italic>Mmp12</italic> and <italic>Mmp13</italic> known to be highly expressed by macrophages; and various immunoglobulin subunit genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p><p>Our histological analysis demonstrated significantly reduced CLS in eWAT of LRG1-overexpressing animals. Deconvolution algorithms such as CIBERSORTx allow estimation of cell populations from bulk RNA-Seq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Newman et al., 2019</xref>). We performed CIBERSORTx analysis on the expression dataset to gain further insight into differences in immune cell populations. CIBERSORTx estimated that the LRG1 group contains fewer immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Macrophages were predicted to constitute the majority of immune cells in every eWAT sample analyzed, and the LRG1 group demonstrated a lower absolute quantity of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), without affecting their relative proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Many of the differentially regulated genes between eGFP- and LRG1-overexpressing animals encode chemokines and cytokines. We performed a multiplex cytokine assay to assess whether these differences are reflected in serum levels, and at midpoint (week 7), the LRG1 group showed 28–86% reduction of circulating chemokines such as MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIG, and IP-10 and cytokines such as TNFα and IFNγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Many of these differences subsided by week 10, mostly due to a reduction of cytokine levels in the eGFP group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that LRG1 overexpression attenuated pro-inflammatory processes associated with obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>LRG1 binds extracellular cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and blocks its pro-inflammatory effect on macrophages</title><p>LRG1 contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which form a structural framework for protein-protein interactions.

Because circulating monocytes contribute to adipose tissue macrophages in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oh et al., 2012</xref>), we tested whether bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) respond to extracellular Cyt <italic>c</italic> by upregulating pro-inflammatory genes. Treating BMDMs with horse Cyt <italic>c</italic> led to &gt;30-fold induction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-responsive pro-inflammatory genes such as <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, and <italic>Nos2</italic> (p&lt;0.0001), while pre-treatment of macrophages with a small molecule TLR4 inhibitor, TAK-242, prevented this induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). These data confirm that Cyt <italic>c</italic> in the extracellular space acts as a DAMP that activates innate immune signaling and polarizes macrophages into a more pro-inflammatory state. We then explored how co-treatment of Cyt <italic>c</italic> and recombinant human LRG1 (rhLRG1) affects Cyt <italic>c</italic>’s pro-inflammatory effect on macrophages. Prior to treatment, media containing Cyt <italic>c</italic>, rhLRG1, or both were incubated for one hour to allow protein-protein interactions to occur. Compared to single treatment, co-treatment with rhLRG1 significantly dampened Cyt <italic>c</italic>-mediated induction of <italic>Il1b</italic> (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001), <italic>Cxcl10</italic> (<italic>P</italic>=0.024), and <italic>Il6</italic> (<italic>P</italic>=0.0008), while <italic>Nos2</italic> induction was not affected by co-treatment with rhLRG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Interestingly, pre-treatment of BMDMs with rhLRG1 followed by addition of Cyt <italic>c</italic> did not attenuate the latter’s pro-inflammatory effect, suggesting that Cyt <italic>c</italic>-LRG1 complex formation is necessary for LRG1’s modulatory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Expression of alternatively activated (M2) macrophage markers was not affected by co-treatment with Cyt <italic>c</italic> and rhLRG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H</xref>). We next explored if this immunomodulatory role of LRG1 can in turn reduce adipose tissue damage. Western blot of <italic>db/db</italic> eWAT showed reduction of cleaved Caspase-3 in the LRG1 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>), suggesting reduction of apoptotic cells with LRG1 overexpression. We also observed decreased release of Cyt <italic>c</italic> into the ISF of eWAT and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>), consistent with lower circulating Cyt <italic>c</italic> detected in the serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest LRG1 can modulate the pro-inflammatory gene expression responses induced by Cyt <italic>c</italic> and subsequently reduce tissue damage and cell death.</p><p>Cyt <italic>c</italic> is a small (12.5 kDa), globular protein with a short half-life in circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Radhakrishnan et al., 2007</xref>). Small proteins such as Cyt <italic>c</italic> are expected to be rapidly cleared via glomerular filtration in the kidney. With the tight binding interaction between LRG1 and Cyt <italic>c</italic>, we hypothesized that much of extracellular Cyt <italic>c</italic> circulates as a complex with LRG1. To assess whether this interaction affects Cyt <italic>c</italic> clearance, we performed retroorbital injection of horse Cyt <italic>c</italic> into WT and LRG1-KO mice and collected blood at time points from 5 min to 6 hr post-injection. Plasma western blot showed that LRG1-KO animals almost completely cleared Cyt <italic>c</italic> by 2 hr, whereas in WT animals, an initial decrease in Cyt <italic>c</italic> was followed by nearly constant levels between 1 and 6 hr post-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Fitting one-phase decay functions to relative Cyt <italic>c</italic> intensities showed that while both WT and LRG1-KO curves have similar half-lives (WT: 16.10 min vs. KO: 17.32 min), the WT trace plateaus at 0.2791, whereas the LRG1-KO curve approaches zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1J, K</xref>). Concomitantly, appearance of Cyt <italic>c</italic> in the urine was observed as soon as 30 min after the injection, demonstrating that clearance of excess Cyt <italic>c</italic> is indeed through the kidneys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1L, M</xref>). Urine Ponceau S staining showed that detected proteins were all below 25 kDa, the apparent size limit for urinary excretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1L</xref>). We reasoned that in LRG1-KO animals, Cyt <italic>c</italic> circulates as an unbound, free form that can be rapidly excreted by glomerular filtration, whereas the presence of LRG1 in WT animals prevents a portion of Cyt <italic>c</italic> from excretion due to formation of a complex larger than the size cutoff for glomerular filtration. Indeed, endogenous Cyt <italic>c</italic> was virtually undetectable in the serum of HFD-fed LRG1-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1N</xref>). Taken together, these data directly demonstrate that Cyt <italic>c</italic> is a native ligand of LRG1, and that this interaction suppresses the pro-inflammatory effect of extracellular Cyt <italic>c</italic> and cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We applied a chemoproteomic technology to comprehensively profile the secretome of three major types of murine primary adipocytes, revealing unique secretory profiles of each cell type with differential functional enrichment. This method was also applied in vivo to profile the nascent serum proteome, and bioinformatic analysis suggested that adipose tissue is an important contributor to the serum proteome. The intersection of the adipocyte CM and serum proteome included classical adipokines such as adiponectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang and Scherer, 2016</xref>), adipsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gómez-Banoy et al., 2019</xref>), and RBP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yang et al., 2005</xref>), all of which have important roles in whole-body energy homeostasis. Leptin was not detected in our dataset, as has been the case in most other MS-based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali Khan et al., 2018</xref>). This is most likely due to its very low expression in in vitro-differentiated adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">MacDougald et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">O’Connor et al., 2021</xref>). LRG1 shares a similar expression signature with these adipokines, but its metabolic function has not been characterized. We demonstrate, using two types of viral vectors and two different mouse models of obesity, a novel metabolic role for adipose-derived LRG1 as a regulator of glucose homeostasis by promoting insulin sensitization. This insulin-sensitizing effect in LRG1 gain of function is associated with a dramatic reduction in systemic inflammation and with LRG1’s ability to bind Cyt <italic>c</italic> and modulate its pro-inflammatory effect as a DAMP.</p><p>There have been various other studies that used MS to profile the secretome of adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali Khan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Deshmukh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lehr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roca-Rivada et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rosenow et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). Comparison of our dataset with those from two most recent publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali Khan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Deshmukh et al., 2019</xref>) highlights key advances with our approach as well as potential caveats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Our dataset stands out for its use of all three major types of adipocytes including Visc cells, which have important implications for cardiometabolic complications of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fox et al., 2007</xref>). While the total number of secreted proteins in our dataset may be lower than the other two studies (604 vs 1337 and 1866), the number of known secreted proteins is higher (472 vs 453 and 471). The low proportion of intracellular proteins detected in our dataset demonstrates the advantage BONCAT provides by enabling FBS supplementation, which is essential for cell viability. It must be noted, however, the undefined nature and batch variability of FBS can make the study less generalizable, and that FBS contamination is still present, in up to 138/742 of proteins (18.6%). In addition, there could be a potential bias for Met-rich peptide sequences. Finally, although AHA pulse did not affect expression of adipocyte and thermogenic genes tested, its full biological effect is unknown and may include protein misfolding and deficiency in single-carbon metabolism. The remaining 20% of proteins not predicted or annotated to be secreted include intracellular proteins such as tubulin and actin. However, many are non-classically secreted proteins such as FABP4/5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hotamisligil and Bernlohr, 2015</xref>). Additionally, many proteins (such as GAPDH) that were initially thought to be leakage products turn out to be secreted in a regulated fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Takenouchi et al., 2015</xref>), and our dataset includes other novel factors we have independently confirmed as bona fide secreted factors. Our findings can therefore greatly expand the scope of the adipose secretome that includes non-classical modes of secretion, but each factor will need to be carefully studied to validate whether its presence in the media is from a regulated secretion process or from non-specific leakage.</p><p>We have also demonstrated that BONCAT can label nascent serum proteins in vivo. This technique can be further utilized to study the nascent serum proteome in response to stimuli difficult to model in vitro, such as obesity and changes in ambient temperature. Novel technologies for in vivo profiling of cell type-specific proteomes using non-canonical amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alvarez-Castelao et al., 2017</xref>) or proximity labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Branon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wei et al., 2021</xref>) are on the horizon. This study provides a baseline profile of the nascent serum proteome in lean adult mice from which cell type enrichment analyses can be performed, and bioinformatic pipelines implemented here to compare tissue expression would be useful in cross-referencing with transcriptomic datasets.</p><p>AAV-mediated LRG1 overexpression in the adipose tissues led to a constellation of metabolic effects in both B6 and <italic>db/db</italic> mice, resulting in improvement of glucose/insulin tolerance as well as a reduction of obesity-associated inflammation. While endogenous LRG1 levels increase with obesity, further induction of LRG1 expression via AAV transduction protected mice from obesity-related complications. These findings suggest that while LRG1 plays a protective role in obesity, the degree of LRG1 induction is not sufficient, and that AAV-mediated overexpression could be augmenting this physiologic response. LRG1 overexpression had a more dramatic effect in the <italic>db/db</italic> model, likely due to the severity of inflammation and metabolic derangements. In both mouse models, LRG1 overexpression led to an improvement in fasting glucose levels, which also contributed to differences in GTT and ITT profiles. We believe it is the improvement in insulin sensitivity that drives both findings, given increased IRS-1 protein levels in eWAT and lack of difference in hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression or pyruvate tolerance.</p><p>Adipose tissue expansion in mice is characterized by periods of adipocyte turnover, during which there is a sharp increase in adipocyte death and monocyte/macrophage accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Weisberg et al., 2003</xref>). In B6 eWAT, adipocyte death and CLS formation peak around 12–16 weeks on HFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Strissel et al., 2007</xref>), which corresponds to when a parallel surge in fasting blood glucose levels is observed. In <italic>db/db</italic> mice, the remodeling seems to be initiated earlier, as CLS in WAT emerge at 7 weeks of age, and chemokine/cytokine expression and circulating levels are more highly induced at week 7 than week 10. Periods when LRG1’s insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory effects are particularly effective coincide with these times of adipocyte death and turnover. In <italic>db/db</italic> mice, we also observed accelerated WAT expansion with LRG1 overexpression. Adipose tissue hypertrophy likely drives this process, given larger adipocyte cross-sectional areas and LRG1’s lack of adipogenic effect. As inflammation is a key mechanistic link between obesity and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Saltiel and Olefsky, 2017</xref>), these findings strongly suggest LRG1 promotes insulin sensitization via modulation of inflammation and cell death during adipose tissue remodeling.</p><p>Recently, whole-body LRG1 loss of function has been reported to reduce obesity and improve insulin sensitivity by reduction of hepatosteatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">He et al., 2021</xref>). In the LRG1-KO mice we generated, we have not observed any effect on body weight or glucose/insulin tolerance profiles. This discrepancy is potentially due to differences in how the knockout lines were generated (gene cassette vs. CRISPR-Cas9). The work presented here sheds light on the biology of adipose-derived LRG1 with AAV overexpression, which has not been studied before. Our work also expands our understanding of LRG1 function in its native tissue environment, the adipose tissue, where it reduces inflammation and cell death.</p><p>Our studies build on our understanding of the LRG1-Cyt <italic>c</italic> interaction that has thus far been studied in cell culture models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Codina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jemmerson et al., 2021</xref>). We propose LRG1 functions as a buffer against deleterious effects of extracellular Cyt <italic>c</italic> released from dying/dead cells. During obesity-driven adipose tissue remodeling, increase in adipocyte death contributes to increased circulating Cyt <italic>c</italic>, which could be an important pro-inflammatory signal triggering monocyte/macrophage recruitment. The pro-inflammatory setting of obesity also induces LRG1 in other adipocytes, and this increase in circulating LRG1 modulates inflammation by directly binding Cyt <italic>c</italic>. Of note, both TLR4 and LRG1 contain LRR domains, so the Cyt <italic>c</italic>-neutralizing effect by LRG1 could involve steric interference as the two proteins compete for binding Cyt <italic>c</italic>. It is interesting to note that LRG1 overexpression led to reduction in circulating Cyt <italic>c</italic> levels. As our data suggest LRG1-Cyt <italic>c</italic> complex formation inhibits renal excretion of Cyt <italic>c</italic>, the reduction of serum Cyt <italic>c</italic> in the context of LRG1 overexpression is most consistent with decreased Cyt <italic>c</italic> release from tissues. Together with our data showing reduction of Cyt <italic>c</italic> in the ISF of eWAT and liver from LRG1-overexpressing mice, LRG1’s immunomodulatory role in these metabolic tissues may contribute to decreased Cyt <italic>c</italic> release by reducing tissue damage. Many questions remain on how LRG1 and Cyt <italic>c</italic> regulate inflammation and cell death. Whether LRG1-Cyt <italic>c</italic> interaction affects tissue-resident macrophages or also impacts immune cell recruitment remain to be studied. Mechanistically, as extracellular Cyt <italic>c</italic> is pro-apoptotic, it is possible that LRG1-Cyt <italic>c</italic> binding directly prevents apoptosis either by steric hindrance or by simultaneous binding of LRG1 to Cyt <italic>c</italic> and TGF-β1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jemmerson, 2021</xref>). The scope of LRG1’s metabolic function beyond its interaction with Cyt <italic>c</italic> will also continue to be explored in our future work.</p><p>While the current study focused on LRG1’s effect on adipose tissue, it is important to emphasize that LRG1-mediated anti-inflammatory effects were systemic, as observed by the decrease in inflammatory foci in LRG1-overexpressing <italic>db/db</italic> liver. As hepatocyte apoptosis contributes to progression of NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) in NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Feldstein et al., 2003</xref>), further investigation may uncover a hepato-protective role for LRG1 in NAFLD. Multiple biomarker studies in humans have shown that increased LRG1 is associated with not only obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pek et al., 2018</xref>) but also conditions involving cell death and inflammation, such as appendicitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kentsis et al., 2010</xref>), solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Belczacka et al., 2019</xref>) and autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Naka and Fujimoto, 2018</xref>). Our study suggests that induction of LRG1 in these settings could be a compensatory mechanism to modulate inflammation.</p><p>Enhanced renal clearance of Cyt <italic>c</italic> in LRG1-KO mice provides further evidence that LRG1 complexes with Cyt <italic>c</italic> in circulation and highlights the need to measure LRG1 levels in future studies utilizing extracellular Cyt <italic>c</italic> as a biomarker. Comparable serum Cyt <italic>c</italic> half-lives between WT and LRG1-KO suggest LRG1 loss of function does not affect kidney function. Divergence in Cyt <italic>c</italic> clearance profiles occurs towards the plateau, and we believe this difference represents the portion of Cyt <italic>c</italic> that stays bound to LRG1 in WT animals. Inflammation in obesity, especially in B6 DIO mice, is chronic and relatively low grade. Given our observation that HFD-fed LRG1-KO mice have reduced Cyt <italic>c</italic> levels in circulation, enhanced clearance of Cyt <italic>c</italic> in LRG1-KO mice could serve to counteract Cyt <italic>c</italic> release and protect from its deleterious effects. It is possible therefore that the effect of LRG1 loss of function may be more pronounced in conditions involving acute or high-grade inflammation. It is interesting to note that in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse models, LRG1 loss of function had a protective role in development of diabetic nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hong et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to the reported LRG1-mediated aberrant glomerular angiogenesis as a mechanism for this finding, glomerular deposition of LRG1-Cyt <italic>c</italic> and subsequent immune response could be another potential pathogenic mechanism.</p><p>In summary, we identified LRG1 as a novel adipokine and discovered its metabolic role as an insulin sensitizer and suppressor of inflammation. LRG1’s in vivo function is associated with Cyt <italic>c</italic> binding, and this interaction sheds light on previously unappreciated molecular players of adipocyte-macrophage interaction during adipose tissue expansion and remodeling. LRG1 or targeting extracellular Cyt <italic>c</italic> could be an attractive therapeutic approach for treatment of not only obesity but a variety of inflammatory conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6 J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories.

C-terminally 3xFLAG-tagged murine LRG1 was cloned into pAdTrack-CMV (AddGene) linearized with XhoI (NEB) and HindIII (NEB) using In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Takara). pAdTrack-CMV and pAdTrack-CMV-LRG1-FL plasmids were linearized with PmeI (NEB) and recombined into pAdEasy-1 vector via electrophoretic transformation of recombination-competent BJ5183-AD-1 cells (Agilent) with the linearized product and selection for kanamycin-resistant clones. Plasmids from validated clones were transformed into recombination-deficient XL-10 Gold ultracompetent cells (Agilent), which were used to generate pAd-eGFP and pAd-LRG1-FL plasmids and purified using Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen).</p><p>Crude adenovirus was produced by transfecting PacI (NEB)-linearized pAd vectors into HEK293A cells (Invitrogen), which were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 10–14 days with media supplementation every 3–5 days until most cells showed cytopathic effect/detachment. Both cells and the culture medium were collected, lysed by 3 cycles of freeze-thaw between dry ice-ethanol and room-temperature water baths, and centrifuged at 3500×g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant crude virus. Round 1 amplification product was obtained by transducing HEK293A cells with the crude virus and repeating the above collection, lysis, and centrifugation steps.</p><p>To obtain round 2 amplification product, twelve 15 cm plates of HEK293A cells were transduced with round 1 adenovirus and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> until most cells demonstrated cytopathic effect. As with previous rounds, cells and media were collected, lysed by freeze-thaw cycles, and centrifuged to obtain the supernatant. The supernatant was treated with benzonase, and adenoviral particles were purified from the crude mixture using the Vivapure AdenoPACK 100 kit (Sartorius). Purified virus was dialyzed with buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8, 25 mM NaCl, and 2.5% (w/v) glycerol and concentrated using a 100 kDa centrifugal filter unit provided with the kit. Titer of the adenovirus was determined using Adeno-X Rapid Titer Kit (Takara).</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>AAV8 vector preparation</title><p>C-terminally 3xFLAG-tagged LRG1 was cloned into pENN.AAV.CB7.CI.eGFP.WPRE.rBG (Addgene) linearized with EcoRI (NEB) and BglII (NEB) using In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Takara). The original eGFP-expressing and cloned LRG1-FL plasmids were transformed into Stable Competent <italic>E. coli</italic> (NEB), purified using Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen), and shipped to Penn Vector Core (PA, USA) for AAV8 production.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>In vivo adenovirus/AAV8 transduction</title><p>In vivo adenoviral transduction studies were performed using purified adenovirus from second round of amplification. Adenovirus was injected at a dose of 10<sup>10</sup> pfu/mouse. AAV8 was injected at 10<sup>11</sup> GC/mouse. The mice were briefly anesthetized with isoflurane for virus injection via the retroorbital route. Following injection, the mice were quarantined in an ABSL-2 housing room for 72 hr before transferred back to regular housing conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Histology</title><p>Dissected tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 3 days at room temperature and transferred to 70% ethanol. Paraffin embedding, sectioning, and H&amp;E staining was performed by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Laboratory of Comparative Pathology. H&amp;E-stained sections were imaged using a wide-field fluorescence/brightfield/DIC microscope (Zeiss) at the Rockefeller University Bioimaging Resource Center. Crown-like structures (CLS) were identified as any adipocyte in a field of view with cellular infiltrates indicated by nuclear staining surrounding a majority of adipocyte perimeter. Objectives were used as indicated and chosen based on CLS enumerability (&lt;30 CLS per field). 5 fields from 3 animals were quantified per group. Adipocyte area was measured from a minimum of 289 adipocytes from 2 to 4 animals per group using Cellpose 2.0 for image segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stringer et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Liver Triglyceride Quantification</title><p>Per 100 mg of flash-frozen liver, 1 mL of 5% NP-40 lysis buffer was added to generate a homogenate. The homogenized tissue samples were then subject to two cycles of heating at 80–100°C for 5 minutes followed by cooling at room temperature.

Blood was collected from the tail vein immediately prior to injection (0 min) and 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h post-injection into EDTA-coated capillary tubes and kept in ice until further processing. During blood collection, each mouse was placed on a metal grating above a clean plastic wrap to allow collection of excreted urine, if any. Plasma was isolated via centrifugation at 2000×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Immunoblot against Cyt <italic>c</italic> was performed with WT and KO plasma samples run pairwise to enable relative quantification of Cyt <italic>c</italic> signal.

Statistical analysis of data involving 3 or more conditions (levels) of a single variable was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc tests using the Dunnett method to compare every mean with a control mean or the Tukey method to compare every mean with every other mean. Data measured across multiple time points as in GTT, ITT, and PTT were analyzed with repeated measures two-way ANOVA, reporting group factor p-values. Analysis of data from a two-factor experimental setup was performed with two-way ANOVA or two-way mixed effects ANOVA in the case of an uneven <italic>n</italic> number, reporting group factor p-values. For post hoc tests, the Tukey method was used when comparing every mean with every other mean and the Šídák method was employed when a selected set of means were compared.</p></sec><sec id="s4-29"><title>Materials availability</title><p>The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD035318.

They discovered LRG1 using BONCAT and mass spectrometry, which minimizes distractions produced by different conditions. Overexpression of LRG1 in both HFD-induced obesity and db/db mice revealed that LRG1 improves glucose handling, but does not affect adipogenesis. Interestingly, the data demonstrated that overexpression of LRG1 suppresses macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue in both mouse models, along with decreased cytokine/ chemokine levels. It has previously been shown that LRG1 binds to Cytc, leading them to focus on this interaction to elucidate the molecular mechanism of LRG1 action. They showed that dead adipocytes release Cytc during obesity, which activates macrophages through TLR4 receptors. They suggested that increased LRG1 captures extracellular Cytc and decreases Cytc's potential to activate macrophages, maintaining insulin sensitivity by alleviating adipose tissue inflammation.</p><p>These data add another layer of complexity to the role of adipokines in obesity. Their precise approach to analyze adipokines revealed LRG1 and expanded the range of the adipocyte secretome. By overexpressing LRG1 in two different obesity model (HFD and db/db), they showed potential role of LRG1 in glucose homeostasis.</p><p>Issues:</p><p>1) The data indicates that overexpressing LRG1 in adipocytes can suppress obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation. However, they also showed that LRG1 is increased in obesity (Figure 3). They should clarify this discrepancy as to why increased LRG1 in obesity is unable to inhibit adipose tissue inflammation.</p><p>2) The authors claim that LRG1 improves insulin sensitivity during obesity. However, they should provide better evidence to support this idea, such as showing activation of insulin signaling pathways in liver and fat (Figure 4,5).</p><p>3) The authors suggest that overexpressing LRG1 in db/db mouse improves glucose handling and suppresses adipose tissue inflammation (Figure 5). However, the protective effect disappears in 10 week old mice with increased body weight, even though inflammation in adipose tissue is still suppressed. The physiology of LRG1 overexpression in db/db mice probably requires more characterization.</p><p>4) The authors claim that overexpressed LRG1 decreases extracellular Cytc level. However, the data supporting their idea is not clear. They should provide more convincing data (Fig7.I). In addition, they should rule out the possibility that LRG1 decreases extracellular Cytc level by directly suppressing cell death to support their idea (Figure 7.H).</p><p>5) The data show that LRG1 decreases the opportunity of Cytc to activate macrophages through TLR4 signaling (Figure 7). However, how macrophages infiltrate or undergo activation are different process. Adding whether Cytc directly or indirectly (through inducing chemokines from adipocytes) recruits macrophage and LRG1 works on this step would support authors' conclusion more clearly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81559.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be helpful to provide characterization of the physiology of LRG1 overexpressing mice under normal diet if this data is available.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that characterizing the effect of LRG1 overexpression in lean mice would provide a more comprehensive picture of its metabolic effects. Because LRG1 is regulated by obesity, we prioritized studying its function in mice on HFD. We currently do not have data describing LRG1 overexpression in mice on a chow diet. Such experiments will take 6-12 months to complete, and we feel this is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. In our future work, we plan to continue to characterize LRG1 function in various physiologic and disease settings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please quantify all blots.

In LRG1-overexpressing mice, we observed a trend towards lower HOMA-IR in the B6 DIO cohort (<italic>P</italic> = 0.059, Figure 4—figure supplement 1I) and a significantly lower HOMA-IR in the <italic>db/db</italic> cohort (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Figure 5—figure supplement 1G). These results provide further evidence that LRG1 improves insulin sensitivity.</p><p>To directly assess whether LRG1 affects the insulin signaling pathway, we performed western blots of phospho-AKT (pAKT) and total IRS<sup>-1</sup> in <italic>db/db</italic> eWAT and liver. Our assessment of pAKT was limited by the fact that the mice were not stimulated with insulin prior to sacrifice. Basal pAKT levels after 6 hours of fasting showed no difference in either eWAT or liver (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). IRS<sup>-1</sup> protein levels have been shown to be decreased in humans with diabetes (Rondinone et al., 1997) and in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice (Kerouz et al., 1997). We observed that LRG1 overexpression leads to increased IRS<sup>-1</sup> protein levels in <italic>db/db</italic> mice, especially in eWAT (Figure 5—figure supplements 1J,K). Given the critical role IRS<sup>-1</sup> plays in insulin signaling, these results provide direct evidence that LRG1’s effect on glycemic profiles involves the insulin signaling pathway.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81559-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please show released Cytc level peaks at week 7 in db/db mice and week 12 in HFD mice, as they suggest sharp increase of adipocyte death at this time point.</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown in Figure 7B (now quantified in Figure 7—figure supplement 1A) that Cyt <italic>c</italic> levels are increased in 7-week-old <italic>db/db</italic> mice compared to <italic>misty</italic> controls.

These findings suggest that LRG1 induction is physiologic, but the degree of increase observed in obesity is insufficient to confer full protection. In this context, AAV-mediated overexpression could be augmenting the body’s physiologic response by raising LRG1 concentration both in the local tissue microenvironment and in the circulation.

However, they should provide better evidence to support this idea, such as showing activation of insulin signaling pathways in liver and fat (Figure 4,5).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now addressed this in Point 3 of the essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors suggest that overexpressing LRG1 in db/db mouse improves glucose handling and suppresses adipose tissue inflammation (Figure 5). However, the protective effect disappears in 10 week old mice with increased body weight, even though inflammation in adipose tissue is still suppressed. The physiology of LRG1 overexpression in db/db mice probably requires more characterization.</p></disp-quote><p>As glycemic profiles start to converge around week 10, differences in inflammatory gene expression profiles (Figure 6G) and circulating cytokine levels (Figure 6—figure supplement 1H) also become less dramatic. The persistence of histologic findings at week 10 therefore suggests a delay in histological changes compared to other signs of inflammation and glucose handling.</p><p>We agree that the constellation of metabolic effects caused by LRG1 overexpression needs further investigation and this will be the focus of our future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors claim that overexpressed LRG1 decreases extracellular Cytc level. However, the data supporting their idea is not clear. They should provide more convincing data (Fig7.I). In addition, they should rule out the possibility that LRG1 decreases extracellular Cytc level by directly suppressing cell death to support their idea (Figure 7.H).</p></disp-quote><p>Our intention was to further explore the finding in Figure 7A that LRG1-overexpressing mice have reduction in circulating Cyt <italic>c</italic>. Because our data suggest that LRG1 inhibits renal Cyt <italic>c</italic> clearance, reduction in serum Cyt <italic>c</italic> in the setting of LRG1 overexpression must be due to decreased release from tissues. Measurement of Cyt <italic>c</italic> in the interstitial fluid (Figure 7I) points towards metabolic tissues such as eWAT and liver as potential sources of this reduction. Together with the data in Figure 7H that provides direct evidence for reduction of cell death in the LRG1 group, we felt comfortable arguing that LRG1 overexpression decreases extracellular Cyt <italic>c</italic> as part of its immunomodulatory role.</p><p>We agree that mechanistically, various possible molecular phenomena could underlie our observed phenotype with LRG1 overexpression. We have not specifically assessed whether LRG1 can directly suppress cell death, but we also have not noticed changes in cell viability when treating primary adipocytes or BMDMs with LRG1-depleted FBS or recombinant LRG1. As we continue to work on the in vivo significance LRG1-Cyt <italic>c</italic> interaction as well as LRG1 function independent of Cyt <italic>c</italic>, further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms will also be an object of our future work.</p><p>We have added further explanation of these points to the main text (lines 915-926).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The data show that LRG1 decreases the opportunity of Cytc to activate macrophages through TLR4 signaling (Figure 7). However, how macrophages infiltrate or undergo activation are different process. Adding whether Cytc directly or indirectly (through inducing chemokines from adipocytes) recruits macrophage and LRG1 works on this step would support authors' conclusion more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>While our current data with cultured BMDMs provide some information about Cyt <italic>c</italic>’s ability to activate macrophages, we agree that Cyt <italic>c</italic> may act on macrophages at various other stages of immune response. We will continue to explore how LRG1 and Cyt <italic>c</italic> affect macrophage recruitment in our future work. We have explicitly stated the limitations of our findings in the discussion (lines 920-926).</p><p>References</p><p>1. Kerouz, N.J., Hörsch, D., Pons, S., Kahn, C.R., 1997.
