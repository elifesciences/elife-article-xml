Segmentation either requires arbitrary thresholds or large teaching datasets. Here, we propose a spatial autocorrelation method based on Local Moran’s <italic>I</italic> coefficient to differentiate signal, background, and noise in any type of image. The method, originally described for geoinformatics, does not require a predefined intensity threshold or teaching algorithm for image segmentation and allows quantitative comparison of samples obtained in different conditions. It utilizes relative intensity as well as spatial information of neighboring elements to select spatially contiguous groups of pixels. We demonstrate that Moran’s method outperforms threshold-based method in both artificially generated as well as in natural images especially when background noise is substantial. This superior performance can be attributed to the exclusion of false positive pixels resulting from isolated, high intensity pixels in high noise conditions. To test the method’s power in real situation, we used high power confocal images of the somatosensory thalamus immunostained for Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 (A-type) voltage-gated potassium channels in mice. Moran’s method identified high-intensity Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 ion channel clusters in the thalamic neuropil. Spatial distribution of these clusters displayed strong correlation with large sensory axon terminals of subcortical origin. The unique association of the special presynaptic terminals and a postsynaptic voltage-gated ion channel cluster was confirmed with electron microscopy. These data demonstrate that Moran’s method is a rapid, simple image segmentation method optimal for variable and high noise conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>image segmentation</kwd><kwd>thalamus</kwd><kwd>potassium channels</kwd><kwd>somatosensory</kwd><kwd>voltage-gated ion channels</kwd><kwd>cluster</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRONTHAL 742595</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Acsady</surname><given-names>Laszlo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Union</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Artificial Intelligence National Laboratory RRF-2.3.1-21-2022-00004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Acsady</surname><given-names>Laszlo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/094513</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Acsady</surname><given-names>Laszlo</given-names></name><name><surname>Nusser</surname><given-names>Zoltan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>293681</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nusser</surname><given-names>Zoltan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003825</institution-id><institution>Hungarian Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lendület_2023_90</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Acsady</surname><given-names>Laszlo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hungarian Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lendület LP2012-29</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nusser</surname><given-names>Zoltan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

A theoretically optimal segmentation process should be independent of the person performing the analysis and should be based on the intrinsic properties of the image rather than manually defined values. It should consider not only the intensities but also the spatial arrangement of the picture elements (i.e., pixels).</p><p>The current segmentation methods are either based on hard or soft computing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sinha et al., 2020</xref>). Though there is huge surge of soft computation methods based on fuzzy logic, deep learning methods neuronal networks and artificial intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hemanth and Anitha, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Devi et al., 2021</xref>), image analysis based on binary, hard computation methods have their own advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jena et al., 2020</xref>) and best results can be expected from the combination of the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Perfilieva et al., 2019</xref>). Many hard computing image segmentation methods depend on thresholding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sinha et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sahoo et al., 1988</xref>). Although more advanced threshold-based methods (TBMs) utilize local not global thresholds or multilevel thresholding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manikandan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Umaa Mageswari et al., 2013</xref>), the threshold is still defined using the intrinsic properties of the image (e.g., as deviation from the mean intensity in the picture), selection of the degree of deviation is subjective and can yield different results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, even in local thresholding there is no guarantee that spatially inhomogeneous noise reaching or approaching the intensity of the signal will not be included as signal.</p><p>Here, we propose a novel hard computing method for unsupervised image segmentation based on Local Moran’s spatial correlation coefficient (Local Moran’s <italic>I</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anselin et al., 2006</xref>). The method was originally invented for geoinformatics and was used to study large-scale spatial correlation of geological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moran, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Getis and Ord, 1992</xref>), social, or medical events for example suicide rates among counties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Helbich et al., 2015</xref>) or in geomorphological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvioli et al., 2016</xref>). The method, as used here, is based on the statistical evaluation of intensities among neighboring pixels, estimating the probability whether a given pixel intensity arrangement is due to a random process or not. The proposed method allows for selecting spatially congruent pixels with statistically similar intensity (i.e., signal and background) and pixels with intensity distribution not significantly different from random (i.e., noise).</p><p>In this paper, we systematically compare the performance of TBM and Local Moran’s method using images with different levels of noise. We show that, especially at high noise levels, Moran’s method convincingly outperforms TBM on both artificial and natural images. Finally, we also test Moran’s in a biological problem: clustering of voltage-gated ion channels in neuronal membranes. We show that the method can segment ion channel clusters, which are biologically relevant since their existence can be demonstrated using independent methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In order to demonstrate the way Local Moran’s method works for image segmentation, we used high magnification fluorescent (i.e., dark field) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–j</xref>) as well as bright field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k–t</xref>) light microscopic images showing immunoreactivity for Kv4.2 potassium channel subunit in the ventral posteromedial (VPM) nucleus of the mouse thalamus.

The results are tested by Monte Carlo simulation to identify whether the pixel intensity distribution is non-random in an image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In dark field images, contiguous clustered pixels with similarly high intensities represent object (red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>), clustered pixels with low intensities indicate no object (e.g., lumen of a blood vessel) (blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). Group of pixels with random intensity value distribution (which do not reach significance) represent noise (gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). In bright field images, the picture is reversed, contiguous low- and high-intensity pixels represent the object and no object, respectively (blue and red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1t</xref>).</p><p>Local Moran’s <italic>I</italic> differentiates between object, no object, and noise in the following way: the method first normalizes each pixel intensity value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c, m</xref>) (see Methods). Next, it defines a weight matrix in the local neighborhood (3 × 3 in this particular case) for each pixel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d, n</xref>), where the pixel in question receives zero weight. Then it calculates a weighted intensity value for each pixel in the image using the summed values of the neighboring pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e, o</xref>). Immediate neighbors of each pixel are assigned with the weight of 1. Next, it creates lagged gray values by dividing the matrix values with the number of neighboring pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f, p</xref>). This was called ‘lagged’ in the original description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anselin, 1995</xref>), since the distance (lag) was considered in the calculation of this particular value (which was 1 in our case). Finally, it generates the Local Moran’s <italic>I</italic> value for each pixel by multiplying the lagged gray values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f, p</xref>) with the normalized values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c, m</xref>).</p><p>The resulting Local Moran’s <italic>I</italic> value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g, q</xref>) will represent how the intensity of the pixel and its neighbors differs from the distribution of intensities of all pixels in the image (clusteredness). We can test the salience of this value if we repeat the same procedure with randomly selected neighboring pixels. For each pixel, the method determines the probability (pseudosignificance) of obtaining this or higher Local Moran’s <italic>I</italic> value using Monte Carlo simulations of the intensity values of all pixels in the image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h, r</xref>). Significant pixels (p &lt;0 .05) with high intensities (in case of dark field images) or low intensities (in case of bright filed images) will be considered as object. These steps ensure that signal is not determined by an arbitrarily defined threshold, but by the combination of spatial arrangement and pixel intensities. As a consequence, in this method consideration of each pixel as signal will not depend purely on the absolute intensity value of the pixel but on the intensity values of the neighboring pixels and the statistical probability that this spatial arrangement can arise (or not) randomly.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Comparison of TBM and Moran’s method on artificial images</title><p>We compared the performance of Moran’s and TBM on artificial binary objects with various levels of Gaussian noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

First-order matrix contains the immediate neighboring pixels of the central pixel (3 × 3), the second-order matrix contains all the immediate neighbors of the first-order pixels (5 × 5), and so on. We found that optimal Moran’s order was independent of the noise level, and it was 0.25 times (range: 0.238–0.253) of the object size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Thus, for these measures, we selected Moran’s order 4.

Increasing noise levels resulted in a parallel decrease in TRP values. However, in case of the TBM FPR increased dramatically (cyan dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) due to the higher fluctuation of pixel values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), which indicates a highly unreliable exclusion of false positive pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, circles), while the FPR value in case of Moran’s method remained nearly constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, triangles) with increasing noise. In case of TBM FPR increase was the consequence of that random noise frequently increased the pixel intensity values of the background above the threshold level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which were detected as positive pixels.</p><p>Next, we compared the two methods in a larger sample of images (<italic>n</italic> = 100) which contained 64 randomly distributed objects of different sizes.

However, increasing the noise level resulted again in a pronounced increase in FPR in the case of TBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) whereas using Moran’s, this effect was evident only at the edges of detected objects and FPR just marginally increased even at very high noise levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Huge increase in false positive pixels in TBM with increasing noise resulted in significantly lower FPR values compared to that of Moran’s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e, f</xref>, FPR values noise 80: threshold, 0.13333 ± 0.0009, Moran’s: 0.0085 ± 0.0003, p &lt; 5.4*10<sup>−215</sup>; noise 160: threshold, 0.3866 ± 0.0012, Moran, 0.0055 ± 0.0005, p &lt; 2.1*10<sup>–244</sup>).

We used this method to successfully delineate and quantify biologically relevant membrane protein clusters. Since Moran’s selections are based on the relative intensity values of neighboring pixels, it can select contiguous points as objects, unlike TBM. TBM does not use spatial information of the pixels. Therefore, it selects random noise as well, provided it reaches the threshold. Unlike in TBM, selection of the signal will not depend on the absolute intensity of its pixels in Moran’s method since the image processing starts with a normalization step. This way, it uses inherent properties of the image to select clusters. This will allow the systematic, quantitative comparison of images where sample preparation and image acquisition cannot be standardized, such as in most histological samples.</p><p>Local Moran’s method has not been used for image segmentation so far.

Based on these, the utilization of Local Moran’s method, as described here, will not be restricted to segmenting objects on two-dimensional images but can be extended for 3D image segmentation and analyzing temporal signals.</p><p>The strongest argument to use Local Moran’s <italic>I</italic> instead of threshold-based segmentation is the effective elimination of false positive pixels from the background. Although the intensity of noisy pixels can reach or exceed that of the objects, white noise does not cause a pattern. Detection of the lack of spatial correlation is a powerful tool to ignore false positive salient pixels in the background.</p><p>As indicated above, Moran’s method works without user-dependent intensity values. However, the size of the convolution matrix needs to be set by the user. In this study, we examined the effect of matrix size in a wide range of applications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>). We determined that selection of the signal is relatively insensitive of the exact matrix size within a certain range (Moran’s order 3–8), especially in noisy conditions. A priori knowledge of the expected object size helps to define the best matrix size since we found a linear correlation between object size and Moran’s order for optimal image segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We found that Local Moran’s method can delineate and quantitatively characterize Kv4.2 ion channel clusters in the somatosensory thalamus formed in the proximity of large vGluT2-positive afferent nerve terminals. The selective association of a given presynaptic terminal type and the postsynaptic accumulation of ion channel clusters were verified by independent electron microscopic methods. The functional relevance of this unique association remains to be determined: it may participate in timing the precision of sensory integration, but recently the non-synaptic role of voltage-gated ion channel accumulation has also been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cserép et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Six adult male C57Bl/6 mice were perfused to examine the Kv4.2 expression.

There are only sporadic papers using Moran’s spatial correlation coefficient (Global Moran’s <italic>I</italic>) for biomedical image analysis in order to detect clustering in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guy et al., 2016</xref>) without separating particular clusters. We were interested in localization of clusters that is also possible with the help of a special case of local indicators of spatial association named Local Moran’s <italic>I</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anselin, 1995</xref>).

The minimal size of detectable particles is heavily influenced by the size of the weight matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>). In our case we considered the immediate neighboring pixels (<italic>j</italic>) of each pixel when calculated (<italic>i</italic>) with an equal weight of 1 in first-order matrices. In case of larger matrices, the weights were assigned according to a Gaussian distribution. This coefficient (<italic>I</italic>) gives an estimate of the homogeneity of the spatial distribution of pixels with similar gray values. Moran’s <italic>I</italic> is close to zero if the distribution is random, whereas it has a value around −1 if the distribution is uniform and scattered, and +1 if the distribution is uniform and clustered. The result can be statistically tested by a permutation test, where the data points (pixels) are randomly redistributed and the same coefficient is calculated for each permutation. Then a pseudosignificance is computed as <italic>p</italic> = (<italic>G</italic> + 1)/(<italic>R</italic> + 1), where <italic>G</italic> is the number of instances where the absolute value of the observed <italic>I</italic> is higher than or equal to the absolute value of the original <italic>I</italic>, and <italic>R</italic> the number of repeats. For example, if none of 99 permutations have a higher <italic>I</italic> value, then the pseudo p-value is 1/100 = 0.01.</p><p>Based on the principles above we performed the following step-by-step procedures of Moran’s analysis.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Normalization of pixel intensity values (<italic>V</italic>)</p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">z</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula></p><p>where <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the normalized intensity value, <italic>V</italic> is the original intensity value, <italic>Vm</italic> is the mean intensity of all pixels, and SD is the standard deviation of intensity of all pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Creating weights (<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>)</p><p>For each pixel, a set of neighboring pixels was defined.

Traditionally, the size of the matrix is described as the order of the Moran’s test.

All three images were the same micrograph of vGluT2 immunostained boutons but with different level of noise (SD of noise was set 160, 80, 0, in this order). Each volunteer must have completed the delineation of all objects of the noisiest image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>) first, before receiving the less noisy and finally the noiseless image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b, c</xref>).

The method's ease of use for non-experts in AI, combined with its proven effectiveness in proof-of-concept experiments, positions it as a valuable addition to the field. While the manuscript could benefit from incorporating comparisons with more advanced segmentation methods and offering a more detailed discussion of computational requirements, it remains a robust contribution. The decision to include the Kv4.2 findings within the paper is well-justified by the authors, though these results could potentially have an even greater impact if published separately.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89361.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by David et al. describes a novel image segmentation method, implementing Local Moran's method, which determines whether the value of a datapoint or a pixel is randomly distributed among all values, in differentiating pixel clusters from the background noise.

Such a problem is essential in biology because they are commonly confronted in the analysis of microscope images of biological samples and recently have been resolved by artificial intelligence, especially by deep neural networks. However, training artificial intelligence for specific sample images is a difficult task and not every biological laboratory can handle it. Therefore, the proposed method is particularly appealing to laboratories with little computational background. The method was shown to achieve better performance than a threshold-based method for artificial and natural test images. To demonstrate the usability, the authors applied the method to high-power confocal images of the thalamus for the identification and quantification of immunostained potassium ion channel clusters formed in the proximity of large axons in the thalamic neuropil and verified the results in comparison to electron micrographs.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors claim that the proposed method has higher pixel-wise accuracy than the threshold-based method when applied to gray-scale images with substantial noises.</p><p>Since the method does not use artificial intelligence, training and testing are not necessary, which would be appealing to biologists who are not familiar with machine learning technology.</p><p>The method does not require extensive tuning of adjustable parameters (trying different values of &quot;Moran's order&quot;) given that the size of the object in question can be estimated in advance.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive assessment of our approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>It is understood that the strength of the method is that it does not depend on artificial intelligence and therefore the authors wanted to compare the performance with another non-AI method (i.e. the threshold-based method; TBM). However, the TBM used in this work seems too naive to be fairly compared to the expensive computation of &quot;Moran's I&quot; used for the proposed method. To provide convincing evidence that the proposed method advances object segmentation technology and can be used practically in various fields, it should be compared to other advanced methods, including AI-based ones, as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Protein localization studies revealed that protein distributions are frequently inhomogeneous in a cell. This is very common in neurons which are highly polarized cell types with distinct axo-somato-dendritic functions. Moreover, due to the nature of the cell-to-cell interactions among neurons (e.g. electrical and chemical synapses) the cell membrane includes highly variable microdomains with unique protein assemblies (i.e. clusters). Protein clusters are defined as membrane segments with higher protein densities compared to neighboring membrane regions. However, protein density can continuously change between “clusters” and “non-clusters”. As a consequence, differentiating proteins involved vs not involved in clusters is a challenging task. Indeed, our analysis showed that the boundaries of protein clusters varied remarkably when 23 human experts delineated them.</p><p>Despite the fact the protein clusters can only be vaguely defined numerous studies have demonstrated the functional relevance of inhomogeneous protein distribution. Thus, there is a high relevance and need for an observer independent, “operative” segmentation method that can be accomplished and compared among different conditions and specimens. The strength of the Moran’s I analysis we propose here, as pointed out by our reviewers and editors, is that it can extract the relevant signals from an image generated in different, often noisy condition using a simple algorithm that allows quantitative characterization and identification of changes in many biological and non-biological samples.</p><p>In AI based analysis the ground truth is known by an observer and using a large training set AI learns to extract the relevant information for image segmentation. As outlined above the “ground truth”, however, cannot be unequivocally defined for protein clusters. There is no doubt, that with sufficient resource investment there would be an AI based analysis of the same problem. In our view, however, in an average laboratory setting generating a training set using hundreds of images examined by many experts may not be plausible. Moreover, generalization of one training set to another set of cluster, resistance to noise or different levels of background could also not be guaranteed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This method was claimed to be better than the TBM when the noise level was high. Related to the above, TBMs can be used in association with various denoising methods as a preprocess. It is questionable whether the claim is still valid when compared to the methods with adequate complexity used together with denoising. Consider for example, Weigert et al. (2018) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0216-7">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0216-7</ext-link>; or Lehtinen et al (2018) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1803.04189">https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1803.04189</ext-link>.</p></disp-quote><p>In Weigert et al. AI was trained with high-quality images of the same object obtained with extreme photon exposure in confocal microscope. As delineated above without training AI systems cannot be used for such purposes. The Lehtinen paper is unfortunately no longer available at this doi.</p><p>We must emphasize that in our work we did not intend to compare the image segmentation method based on local Moran’s I with all other available segmentation techniques. Rather we wanted to demonstrate a straightforward method of grouping pixels with similar intensities and in spatial proximity which does not require a priori knowledge of the objects. We used TBM to benchmark the method. We agree that with more advanced TBM methods the difference between Moran’s and TBM might have been smaller. The critical component here is, however, that even with most advanced TBM an artificial threshold is needed to be defined. The optimal threshold may change from sample to sample depending on the experimental conditions which makes quantification questionable. Moran’s method overcomes this problem and allows more objective segmentation of images even if the exact conditions (background labeling, noise, intensity etc) are not identical among the samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The computational complexity of the method, determined by the convolution matrix size (Moran's order), linearly increases as the object size increases (Fig. S2b). Given that the convolution must be run separately for each pixel, the computation seems quite demanding for scale-up, e.g. when the method is applied for 3D image volumes. It will be helpful if the requirement for computer resources and time is provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Here we provide the required data concerning the hardware and the computational time:</p><p>Hardware used for performing the analysis:</p><p>Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4112 CPU @ 2.60GHz, 2594 Mhz, 4 kernel CPU, 64GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 graphic card.</p><p>MATLAB R2021b software was used for implementation.</p><p><bold>Author response table.</bold></p><table-wrap id="sa3table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Computation times.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"/><th align="left" valign="top" colspan="6">Computation time (s) of images with size of</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="6">Moran’s order</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top">64</td><td align="left" valign="top">128</td><td align="left" valign="top">256</td><td align="left" valign="top">512</td><td align="left" valign="top">1024</td><td align="left" valign="top">2048</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">1</td><td align="left" valign="top">1.82</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.3</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.7</td><td align="left" valign="top">6.18</td><td align="left" valign="top">17.79</td><td align="left" valign="top">63.91</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">2</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.21</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.22</td><td align="left" valign="top">1.91</td><td align="left" valign="top">6.1</td><td align="left" valign="top">18.08</td><td align="left" valign="top">64.84</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">4</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.04</td><td align="left" valign="top">3.01</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.65</td><td align="left" valign="top">5.41</td><td align="left" valign="top">18.9</td><td align="left" valign="top">66.53</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">8</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.15</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.39</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.67</td><td align="left" valign="top">6.58</td><td align="left" valign="top">20.06</td><td align="left" valign="top">72.54</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">16</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.06</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.24</td><td align="left" valign="top">3.18</td><td align="left" valign="top">7.68</td><td align="left" valign="top">25.57</td><td align="left" valign="top">106.71</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by David et al. describes a novel image segmentation method, implementing Local Moran's method, which determines whether the value of a datapoint or a pixel is randomly distributed among all values, in differentiating pixel clusters from the background noise.

The technique offers tangible benefits, especially for researchers dealing with biological microscopy data. However, for this method to see a broader application, it's imperative to provide clearer practical guidance and make data or code easily accessible. Additionally, while the findings regarding Kv4.2 in the thalamus are intriguing, they might achieve more impact if detailed in a dedicated paper.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The availability of data or program code was not stated in the manuscript.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) While the principles of the method are explained clearly in a step-by-step fashion in the Methods section, the practical aspects of running sequential computations over a large matrix of pixel values are not well described. It would be very useful if the authors could provide recommendations on how to set the data structure and clarify which software and programming package for Local Moran's analysis they used. In addition, providing the code for the sequential implementation described in the Methods section would facilitate the adoption of the method by other researchers, and thus, the impact of the study. Currently, there is no data or code availability statement included in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>See our response above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 4 illustrates an experiment in which transmission electron microscopy and freeze-fracture replica labeling approaches were used to demonstrate that a potassium channel marker, Kv4.2 was selective to synapses forming on larger caliber dendrites in the thalamus. As impressive as the EM approaches utilized in this figure are, the results of this experiment have a somewhat tangential bearing on the segmentation method that is the focus of this study. In fact, the experiments illustrated in Figure 5, dual immuno-EM, are more than sufficient to confirm what the dual-confocal imaging coupled with Local Moran's segmentation analysis reveals. Furthermore, the author's findings about the localization and selectivity of Kv4.2 in the thalamus are too important and exciting to bury in a paper focusing on the methodology. Those results may have a wider impact if they are presented and discussed in a separate experimental paper.</p></disp-quote><p>See our response above</p></body></sub-article></article>
