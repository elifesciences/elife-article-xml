Here, we demonstrate that the eIF2 kinase GCN2 is required for sustained growth in androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant models of PCa both in vitro and in vivo, and is active in PCa patient samples. Using RNA-seq transcriptome analysis and a CRISPR-based phenotypic screen, GCN2 was shown to regulate expression of over 60 solute-carrier (<italic>SLC</italic>) genes, including those involved in amino acid transport and loss of GCN2 function reduces amino acid import and levels. Addition of essential amino acids or expression of 4F2 (SLC3A2) partially restored growth following loss of GCN2, suggesting that GCN2 targeting of SLC transporters is required for amino acid homeostasis needed to sustain tumor growth. A small molecule inhibitor of GCN2 showed robust in vivo efficacy in androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant mouse models of PCa, supporting its therapeutic potential for the treatment of PCa.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Prostate cancer is the fourth most common cancer worldwide, affecting over a million people each year. Existing drug treatments work by blocking the effects or reducing the levels of the hormone testosterone. However, these drug regimens are not always effective, so finding alternative treatments is an important area of research. One option is to target the 'integrated stress response', a pathway that acts as a genetic switch, turning on a group of genes that counteract cellular stress and are essential for the survival of cancer cells.</p><p>The reason cancer cells are under stress is because they are hungry. They need to make a lot of proteins and other metabolic intermediates to grow and divide, which means they need plenty of amino acids, the building blocks that make up proteins and fuel metabolism. Amino acids enter cells through molecular gates called amino acid transporters, and scientists think the integrated stress response might play a role in this process. One of the integrated stress response components is a protein called General Control Nonderepressible 2, or GCN2 for short. In healthy cells, this protein helps to boost amino acid levels when supplies start to run low.</p><p>Cordova et al. examined human prostate cancer cells to find out what role GCN2 plays in this cancer. In both lab-grown cells and tissue from patients, GCN2 was active and played a critical role in prostate tumor growth by turning on the genes for amino acid transporters to increase the levels of amino acids entering the cancer cells. Deleting the gene for GCN2, or blocking its effects with an experimental drug, slowed the growth of cultured prostate cancer cells and reduced tumor growth in mice. In these early experiments, Cordova et al. did not notice any toxic side effects to healthy tissues.</p><p>If GCN2 works in the same way in humans as it does in mice, blocking it might help to control prostate cancer growth. The integrated stress response is also active in other cancer types, so the same logic might apply to different tumors. However, before GCN2 blockers can become treatments, researchers need a more complete understanding of their molecular effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ISR</kwd><kwd>GCN2</kwd><kwd>eIF2</kwd><kwd>amino acid transport</kwd><kwd>prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>4F2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM136331</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wek</surname><given-names>Ronald C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK109714</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anthony</surname><given-names>Tracy G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21CA221942</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pili</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA082709</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Staschke</surname><given-names>Kirk A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ISR kinase GCN2 is critical for maintaining tumor amino acid levels to facilitate growth, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of prostate cancer by inducing starvation for essential amino acids.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prostate cancer (PCa) accounts for 20% of all newly diagnosed cancers and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Siegel et al., 2019</xref>). Many factors contribute to PCa, including genetics, diet, age, and race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gann, 2002</xref>). The pathological grade of the PCa and whether it has disseminated into surrounding tissues is prognostic for risk and treatment efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klusa et al., 2020</xref>). Androgen receptor (AR) is considered the primary oncogenic driver for PCa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heinlein and Chang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huggins and Hodges, 1941</xref>), and therapies targeting AR activity are current standard of care, especially for those with metastatic PCa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Polotti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Virgo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Watson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crawford et al., 2019</xref>). Unfortunately, patients develop resistance with time and fail therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Watson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bubley and Balk, 2017</xref>). In addition, it remains unclear how additional pathways drive PCa through AR-dependent and AR-independent mechanisms. Therefore, the identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention are critically needed and clinically relevant.</p><p>The integrated stress response (ISR) is critical for cell adaptation and survival to environmental stresses. Central to the ISR is phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF2 (p-eIF2α), which triggers reductions in global protein synthesis to conserve energy and nutrients, and concomitantly facilitates adaptive gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baird and Wek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tian et al., 2021</xref>). Four eIF2α kinases respond to distinct stress conditions: The eIF2α kinase GCN2 (EIF2AK4) is induced by amino acid starvation and other conditions that trigger ribosomal collisions or stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Inglis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wek et al., 1995</xref>). PERK (EIF2AK3) is responsive to disruptions in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wek and Cavener, 2007</xref>). PKR (EIF2AK2) is activated by viral infection and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chukwurah et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">García et al., 2006</xref>), and HRI (EIF2AK1) is enhanced by restricted heme or iron supply, oxidative stress, and disruptions in mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fessler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suragani et al., 2012</xref>). Activation of these ISR regulators may also occur in response to oncogenic drivers, such as MYC amplification and loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor, frequently observed in prostate tumors. Therefore, both extrinsic and intrinsic cell stresses can invoke the ISR in tumors and pharmacological inhibition of translational control is reported to trigger cytotoxicity in different cancer models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Staschke and Wek, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tameire et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To reprogram gene expression toward recovery from stress damage, the ISR also induces preferential translation of specific ISR gene transcripts, such as activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in amino acid metabolism and proteostasis control, oxidative stress defenses, along with feedback control of the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Young and Wek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hinnebusch et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, p-eIF2α induces both translational and transcriptional modes of gene expression to achieve stress adaptation. Targeted inhibition of ATF4 impedes progression of MYC-driven cancers, emphasizing the important role of this ISR effector in tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Staschke and Wek, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tameire et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we dissect the role of eIF2α kinase(s) induced in PCa and the mechanisms by which the ISR serves to promote growth of this cancer. Using androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant human PCa cell lines, primary human PCa tissues, and mouse xenograft models, we show that the ISR regulator GCN2 is activated in PCa. GCN2 induces expression of key ISR effector genes involved in nutrient transport that are critical for appropriate maintenance of free amino acid pools. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of GCN2 dysregulates expression of these transporters and inhibits PCa growth. These results point to GCN2 as a potential therapeutic target for PCa.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GCN2 activity supports PCa growth</title><p>To determine the role of individual eIF2α kinases and their importance for proliferation of PCa cells in culture, androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells cultured in androgen replete media conditions were individually depleted of HRI, PKR, PERK, or GCN2 using target-specific siRNAs.

Reintroduction of GCN2 into the GCN2 KO cells rescued the slow growth phenotype, and expression of ATF4 and its target gene ASNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The small molecule GCN2iB is a selective inhibitor of GCN2 eIF2α kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakamura et al., 2018</xref>). Using the inhibitory concentration range of 500 nM to 10 µM of GCN2iB, we determined that pharmacological inhibition of GCN2 also caused significant growth inhibition of LNCaP cells, and similarly reduced the growth of C4-2B, 22Rv1, and PC-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

As expected, treatment of the LNCaP, 22Rv1, C4-2B, or PC-3 cells with GCN2iB lowered activation of GCN2 as measured by autophosphorylation of the activation loop (p-GCN2-T899), reduced p-eIF2α levels, and lowered expression of ATF4, and its target genes ASNS and TRIB3. Importantly, treatment with GCN2iB did not alter protein levels of AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). To further test the importance of the ISR in PCa, we selectively depleted ATF4 using siRNA in LNCaP, MR49F, C4-2B, and PC-3 cells and observed similar growth inhibition for each cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We cultured LNCaP cells in the presence or absence of GCN2iB and measured tRNA charging genome-wide using CHARGE-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pavlova et al., 2020</xref>). There was a reduction of aminoacylated tRNA<sup>His</sup> upon GCN2iB treatment that was restored when additional EAA were supplemented to the growth medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These results were further supported by measurements of tRNA<sup>His</sup> charging levels by qRT-PCR. Addition of EAA to cultured LNCaP cells significantly increased tRNA<sup>His</sup> charging levels while treatment with GCN2iB dramatically reduced tRNA<sup>His</sup> charging levels which was reversed by the addition of EAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). These results support the premise that histidine depletion and the accompanying accumulation of uncharged tRNA<sup>His</sup> can lead to activation of GCN2. Upon treatment with GCN2iB, which lowered p-eIF2α and blocked appropriate induction of the ISR, there was severe depletion of histidine accompanied by accumulation of uncharged tRNA<sup>His</sup>, culminating in a slow growth phenotype.</p><p>To further address the role of histidine availability in the slow growth phenotype associated with GCN2 inhibition, we cultured GCN2iB-treated LNCaP cells in medium with added supplements of individual amino acids. In alignment with our charged tRNA<sup>His</sup> measurements, only the addition of histidine to the culture medium reversed the growth inhibition triggered by GCN2iB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Removal of histidine from the growth medium increased G1 accumulation similar to GCN2iB treatment, while supplementation of additional histidine to the medium alleviated the cell cycle arrest triggered by GCN2iB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Finally, supplementation with the full complement of EAA or histidine alone significantly lowered p-GCN2, p-eIF2α, and ATF4 expression, although it is noted that histidine supplementation rendered only partial suppression of the ISR compared to addition of EAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Accompanying this reduction in activation of GCN2, supplementation with histidine sharply increased aminoacylation of tRNA<sup>His</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and there was a trend toward enhanced global protein synthesis as measured by puromycin incorporation. It is curious that there was a trend toward decreased bulk translation upon GCN2iB treatment that was restored with the addition of histidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). As noted above, GCN2 inhibition for 48 hr adversely affected the cell cycle and amino acid levels, which together are suggested to reduce bulk translation upon GCN2iB treatment despite lowered p-eIF2α levels.</p><p>We next determined whether EAA supplementation in other PCa cell lines also suppressed the slow growth phenotype triggered by loss of GCN2 activity. Addition of EAA or histidine alone also suppressed the slow growth phenotype of MR49F cells treated with GCN2iB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>).

These growth supplementation studies suggest that while GCN2 is indispensable for maintaining EAA in PCa cells, the precise processes by which GCN2 carries out these functions can vary among PCa cell lines presumably due to differences in their unique genetic features and cell-line-specific buffering mechanisms accompanying specific gene expression and metabolic programs.

Treatment of LNCaP cells with the GCN2iB for 6 or 24 hr resulted in a reduction in GCN2 activation, as shown by p-GCN2, and lowered ATF4 mRNA and protein.

Consistent with our findings that histidine limitation in part drives GCN2 activation in LNCaP cells, addition of histidine to the growth media of LNCaP cells in culture reduced GCN2 activation and lowered expression of ATF4 and 4F2 (SLC3A2) protein and mRNA, while removing histidine from the media further increased GCN2 activation and expression of ATF4 and 4F2 (SLC3A2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

First, knockdown of 4F2 (SLC3A2) expression using siRNA significantly reduced growth in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells and led to activation of GCN2 and increased ATF4 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F, G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

As was shown earlier, loss of GCN2 function using siRNA or GCN2iB treatment in cultured LNCaP cells reduced growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, D</xref>). This growth defect was rescued by overexpression of 4F2 (SLC3A2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Importantly, overexpression of 4F2 (SLC3A2) reduced GCN2 activity, which lowered p-GCN2 and p-eIF2α levels, along with ATF4 protein expression, and provided a growth advantage in both wild-type LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>).

While loss of GCN2 led to dramatically reduced tumor growth, deletion of ATF4 only delayed tumor growth relative to the wild-type parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Furthermore, deletion of GCN2 led to a further decrease in 4F2 (SLC3A2), ASCT2 (SLC1A5), and CAT1 (SLC7A1) protein levels as compared to loss of ATF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). It is noted that loss of GCN2 did not reduce p-eIF2α levels in these end stage tumors, suggesting activation of a secondary eIF2 kinase or reduced phosphatase-directed dephosphorylation of eIF2α, which has been reported earlier in cells during extended nutrient limitation or other stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, deletion of ATF4 resulted in increased activation of GCN2, increased levels of p-eIF2α, and in some cases increased amino acids relative to GCN2 KO tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), indicating that loss of ATF4 can exacerbate cell stress facilitating further activation of GCN2. Consistent with these in vivo findings, knockdown of GCN2 expression in LNCaP cells in culture reduced amino acid levels to a greater degree as compared to knockdown of ATF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Another key feature of our GCN2/SLC transporter model is that this ISR regulator functions to ensure appropriate uptake of select EAA. To more directly test this model in vivo, we again utilized the xenograft model featuring 22Rv1 GCN2 KO cells. In this experiment, we provided additional EAA in the drinking water for the tumor bearing mice. While 22Rv1 cells with functional GCN2 showed tumor growth within 20 days of injection, loss of GCN2 reduced tumor growth even over the course of 40 days. However, consumption of EAA-supplemented water by GCN2 KO-tumor bearing mice provided for increased tumor growth approaching that of wild-type GCN2 tumors, albeit there was a time delay of 20 days for 22Rv1 with wild-type GCN2 to about 40 days with EAA-supplemented GCN2 KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Supplementation of the EAA did not affect tumor growth of parental 22Rv1 with functional GCN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Similar to previous reports, supplementation of EAA in the drinking water resulted in a slight decrease in body weight of mice bearing either parental or GCN2 KO tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corsetti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Measurements of free amino acids in tumors indicated that loss of GCN2 reduced intracellular arginine and lysine concentrations, with histidine and the branched-chain amino acids trending lower. Dietary supplementation of EAA partially restored these amino acid levels, although only histidine achieved statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Immunoblot measurements showed that loss of GCN2 lowered key ISR markers, including the key SLC transporters independent of the supplementation of EAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>). We also tested the impact of overexpression of 4F2 (SLC3A2) on growth of 22Rv1 tumors. Similar to supplementation with EAA, overexpression of 4F2 (SLC3A2) in GCN2 KO tumors partially rescued growth and restored tumor amino acid levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>). These results further support the notion that GCN2 has a primary function in maintaining EAA and highlight a key role for GCN2 in the regulation of 4F2 (SLC3A2) expression. In keeping with the cultured PCa cell line experiments, GCN2 played a vital role supporting amino acid homeostasis in these tumor models.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Pharmacological inhibition of GCN2 reduces tumor growth in xenograft models</title><p>We next tested the impact of pharmacological inhibition of GCN2 function in cancer cell-derived and patient-derived xenograft models.

These results further support the idea that pharmacological inhibition of GCN2 may serve as a potent strategy for the treatment of androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant PCa by limiting the expression of amino acid transporters including 4F2 (SLC3A2).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Tumor cells often demonstrate high demand for amino acids to sustain their increased metabolism, protein synthesis, and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lieu et al., 2020</xref>), and frequently overexpress amino acid transporters to meet this increased demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bröer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhutia et al., 2015</xref>). Altered or increased transport of EAA and NEAA has been suggested to be a point of vulnerability in several cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pathria and Ronai, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we show that the adaptive ISR pathway driven by GCN2 is active in PCa tissue and can be genetically and pharmacologically targeted in human models of androgen-sensitive and castration-resistance disease. Loss of GCN2 function by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition sharply reduced PCa growth in vitro and reduces tumor growth in xenograft models. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, GCN2 directs the expression of a large number of SLC transporter genes, many of which are critical for PCa growth. Among these GCN2-targeted genes are 4F2 (SLC3A2), a type II integral membrane protein which is known to form dimers with SLC7 family members including SLC7A5 (LAT1) and SLC7A11 (xCT), each contributing to uptake of specific amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pizzagalli et al., 2021</xref>). Loss of GCN2 in PCa reduced free amino acids both in vitro and in tumors derived from xenograft models. Addition of EAAs to the medium of cultured cells rescued the growth defect associated with GCN2 inhibition; furthermore, supplementation of EAAs in the drinking water of mice injected subcutaneously with GCN2 KO PCa cells substantially enhanced tumor growth in vivo. While several strategies to deprive cancer cells of nutrients have been contemplated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pathria and Ronai, 2021</xref>), our results suggest that inhibition of GCN2 represents a unique treatment paradigm to starve prostate tumors of EAAs. Further supporting the utility of GCN2 as a therapeutic target for PCa, a small molecule inhibitor of GCN2 significantly slowed tumor growth in both CDX and PDX models of androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant disease irrespective of AR status.</p><p>GCN2 is activated by uncharged tRNAs that accumulates during amino acid starvation or by ribosome collisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wek et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zaborske et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wek et al., 1989</xref>). As indicated by p-GCN2, this eIF2α kinase is induced in a variety of different proliferating PCa cell lines and in malignant prostate tissue. While our results suggest that amino acid limitations and accompanying uncharged tRNA contribute to GCN2 activation in PCa, it is noted that other mechanisms can contribute to regulation of GCN2. For example, a mitochondrial Rho GTPase 2 (MIRO2) overexpressed in PCa was recently shown to bind to GCN1, a critical activator of GCN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furnish et al., 2022</xref>), and certain mitochondrial defects were reported to contribute to activation of GCN2 and the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mick et al., 2020</xref>). Given that these different PCa models represent those that are androgen-sensitive, castration-resistant, resistant to enzalutamide, or lack AR expression altogether, our study suggests that GCN2 functions to control PCa growth independent of AR function. Supplementation of EAAs reduces p-GCN2 and partially rescued the growth deficiency of GCN2 KO cells, suggesting that deficiency of at least some of these critical amino acids are limiting in proliferating PCa cells. This nutrient limitation would trigger GCN2 induction of the ISR which features induced expression of SLC transporters, including the central 4F2 (SLC3A2), and these events are required to sustain tumor growth. It is noteworthy that 4F2 (SLC3A2) has recently been shown to be overexpressed in PCa and correlated with reduced progression-free survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maimaiti et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Experiments involving supplementation of individual amino acids to cultured LNCaP cells knocked down for GCN2 suggest that this eIF2α kinase is critical for maintenance of histidine homeostasis. Histidine is an EAA whose transport is not clearly understood; although, LAT1 (SLC7A5) has been suggested to facilitate its uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scalise et al., 2018</xref>). Beyond its critical role in protein synthesis, histidine also functions as an important antioxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Son et al., 2005</xref>) and its catabolism has been linked to nucleotide synthesis in some cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanarek et al., 2018</xref>). Additional studies will be required to delineate how histidine contributes to PCa metabolism and growth. Whereas histidine also rescued the growth defect of GCN2 inhibition in the related MR49F cells, only lysine alleviated the slow growth of cultured 22Rv1 GCN2 KO cells. These in vitro experiments suggest a more complex picture where the limiting amino acid is cell-type specific or influenced by specific genetic alterations which might influence the threshold or mechanism of GCN2 activation. It is acknowledged that amino acids included in the media used in the in vitro experiments are typically present at high physiological levels so the importance of any given EAA may be masked by the abundance of these nutrients in the culture medium. Consistent with this notion, the analysis of 22Rv1 GCN2 KO tumors showed multiple EAAs were reduced.</p><p>Activation of GCN2 triggers the ISR by the induction of ATF4, a key transcriptional activator. ATF4 contributes to PCa growth induced by GCN2, as depletion of ATF4 in multiple PCa cell lines led to growth inhibition in culture. Previous studies have suggested that ATF4 is important for growth in multiple cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tameire et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wortel et al., 2017</xref>) including PCa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pällmann et al., 2019</xref>). However, under our experimental conditions, whereas loss of GCN2 led to a sharp reduction in tumor growth in the 22Rv1 xenograft model, deletion of ATF4 only delayed tumor growth. These results suggest that while ATF4-directed transcriptional activation is important for PCa proliferation, GCN2 functions by additional mechanisms, including preferential translation of multiple ISR-target genes.</p><p>As noted above activated GCN2 induces a program of genes that are important for maintenance of amino acid homeostasis. It should also be noted that another major nutrient sensing pathway is regulated by mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>) and mTORC1 activity is transiently reduced in GCN2iB-treated cells (data not shown). We focused on the critical role of GCN2 in controlling expression of 4F2 (SLC3A2), albeit a collection of <italic>SLC</italic> genes are required GCN2 for full expression. While 4F2 (SLC3A2) is an important contributor to amino acid homeostasis, deletion of 4F2 (SLC3A2) in LNCaP cells led to depletion of only a portion of the free amino acids that were disrupted by loss of GCN2, consistent with its requirement with a subset of amino acid transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pizzagalli et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of 4F2 (SLC3A2) only partially restored growth of 22Rv1 GCN2 KO tumors in vivo and did not affect the progression of parental 22Rv1 tumors. These results indicate that the central role of GCN2 for ensuring appropriate amino acid homeostasis and enabling PCa proliferation involves induction of multiple SLC transporters. In addition, the reduction in ATF4 expression that accompanies loss of GCN2 function reduces expression of several amino acid biosynthetic genes which would exacerbate the observed effects on uptake of NEAAs. Taken together, these observations suggest that inhibition of GCN2 may be a more effective therapeutic strategy for starving PCa of amino acids as compared to therapies that target individual SLC transporters. In summary, our results indicate that GCN2 may represent a novel therapeutic target for PCa. The therapeutic landscape for PCa patients is rapidly evolving but AR still remains the focus. Unfortunately, resistance to androgen deprivation therapies continue to be a major challenge. The development of new therapeutic strategies that work independently from inhibition of the AR axis is highly clinically relevant and based on our findings, inhibitors of GCN2 should be considered further as part of a strategy for treatment of androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant PCa.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p>LNCaP clone FGC (Cat. #CRL-1740, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_1379">CVCL_1379</ext-link>), C4-2B (Cat. #CRL-3315, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_4784">CVCL_4784</ext-link>), CW22Rv1 (referred to as 22Rv1, Cat. #CRL-2505, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_1045">CVCL_1045</ext-link>), PC-3 (Cat. #CRL-1435, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0035">CVCL_0035</ext-link>), and HEK-293T (Cat. #CRL-3216, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link>) cells were purchased from the American Tissue Type Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA).

The CHARGE-seq method relies on the simultaneous sequencing of both a charged and uncharged tRNA library. LNCaP cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO), GCN2iB, or GCN2iB in media supplemented with EAA for 8 hr. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Cat. #15596018) and a portion (2 µg) of total RNA for each sample was left untreated or oxidized by treatement with 12.5 mM NaIO<sub>4</sub> in sodium acetate solution (pH 4.5) in the dark at room temperature for 20 min followed by quenching with 0.3 M glucose. All mature tRNAs end with 3′-CCA and NaIO<sub>4</sub> will only oxidize the 3′-A residue of uncharged tRNAs since the 3′-ends of charged tRNAs are protected by linked amino acids. The resulting total RNA was desalted by passing through MicroSpin G-50 column (GE Healthcare, Cat. #27533001) and the tRNA was deacylated through β-elimination in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 9.0) at 37°C for 45 min followed by quenching with a solution containing 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) and 100 mM NaCl. Total RNA was then recovered by overnight EtOH precipitation at −20°C. Following deacylation, libraries for NGS sequencing were prepared as follows, RNA samples were treated with polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs, Cat. #M0201) to remove the 3′-phosphate group from the uncharged tRNA followed by ligation to 5′-adenylated uniquely barcoded adapters using RNA ligase 2 truncated KQ (New England BioLabs, Cat. #M0351L). The resulting tRNAs were then ligated to a 5′-adaptor, annealed to an RT primer, and converted to cDNA using a using a SuperScript IV RT kit (Invitrogen, Cat. #18090050). The tRNA library was PCR amplified for 10 cycles using Illumina multiplex and barcode PCR primers and Platinum SuperFi II DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. #12369002). All oligonucleotide primers and adapters utilized in the procedure are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>. The resulting PCR products were electrophoresed on an 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide TBE gel (Invitrogen, Cat. #EC6215) and ~210 bp bands were excised, purified, and subjected to Illumina HiSeq paired-end sequencing. Fastq files from the pooled samples were demultiplexed according to the five-nucleotide sample barcode contained within the ligated adapter using a custom python script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlson, 2022</xref>), and read pairs without an identifiable barcode were discarded. Illumina sequencing adapters and ligated sample barcode adapters were trimmed using cutadapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martin, 2011</xref>) in paired read mode and reads with less &lt;20 nucleotides remaining after trimming, corresponding to empty adapters, were removed.</p><p>A custom reference file for human tRNA was constructed from the gtRNAdb GRCh38 high confidence tRNA gene set by removing duplicate sequences and appending ‘CCA’ to the 3′ end of each unique tRNA gene sequence. Trimmed reads were then aligned to the custom tRNA reference file using bowtie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) short read aligner with options ‘--dovetail -D 20R 3N 1L 20 -i S,1,0.50’. The charging status of the aligned tRNA was determined from the 3′ end of the aligned portion of each read pair, where reads ending in ‘CCA’ were determined to be charged and reads ending in ‘CC’ were determined to be uncharged. This method was able to determine the charging status of ~86% of all mapped reads. Counts of charged and uncharged tRNA for each tRNA gene in each sample were then imported to R for further analysis. Differences in read counts between samples were accounted for by multiplying the read counts in each sample by a normalization coefficient equal to the average number of reads across all samples divided by the read count in that sample. The fraction charged for each tRNA isodecoder within each sample was determined by summing the normalized counts for charged and uncharged reads for each gene corresponding to that isodecoder, and the mean was then averaged for each of the four replicates for each treatment. The mean fraction charged ± standard deviation for each isodecoder was visualized using GraphPad Prism. Statistical significance in difference of the mean fraction charged was determined using a Welch’s unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test with Benjamini–Hochberg fdr correction to account for repeated measures.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and David Ron as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew C Hsieh (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please address the analysis and role of p-eIF2 and other eIF2 kinases as commented on by Reviewer #1.</p><p>2) Please address the role of GCN2 inhibition in non-cancer prostate models, as commented by Reviewer #2.</p><p>3) There are a few issues related to presentation, formatting, and discussion raised by all reviewers. Please address these.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Cordova and colleagues provide very strong evidence for a tumorigenic role of GCN2 in prostate cancer via the upregulation of genes encoding for amino acid transporters like SLC3A2. Overall, this is a very interesting study with carefully performed experiments and high-quality results. An interesting question is whether GCN2 indeed exerts its effect via the induction of an ISR response, namely, upregulation of p-eIF2 and downstream effectors like ATF4. The data are devoid of analysis of p-eIF2 in the pancreatic cell lines in which GCN2, and other eIF2 kinases, are depleted by genetic means. It is of interest that p-eIF2 is marginally affected by the loss of GNC2 in tumors excised from nude mice (e.g. Figure S15). The authors need to explain this matter in the manuscript better (Discussion section).</p><p>Another issue is what activates GCN2 in prostate tumors. This is not explained very well in the manuscript. The authors need to provide some mechanistic explanation for the activation of GNC2 from their data.</p><p>An issue of potential concern is the specificity of GCN2i. Data in Figure 1D should be supplemented by the analysis of the proliferation of GCN2 KO tumor cells (CRISPR) in the presence of GCN2i.</p><p>The study would largely benefit from data showing ATF4 levels along p-GCN2 in human and/or mouse tumors from the xenograft assays by IHC.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I commend the authors for an excellent piece of work. It was a great read. My comments here are just to make the paper easier to read and provide more clarity on the specificity of the GCN2 axis in prostate cells.</p><p>Recommend conducting GCN2i or KD experiments in normal prostate epithelial cells to determine if their findings in prostate cancer are unique to cancer. Can use BPH1 or RWPE-1 cell lines for example.</p><p>The authors should combine their statistics (Supplementary File 1) into the figure legends or figures. Would highlight the most cogent statistics. It is unwieldy to read a paper and need to refer to another set of tables to confirm significance. This will greatly enhance the flow of the paper.</p><p>Line 166 – Sup Figure 10A is the wrong figure reference.</p><p>Given that there are a number of amino acids that are decreased upon GCN2 inhibition (Figure 3A), why do you think only His charging is affected in Figure 3D? Is it because there is only 1 isodecoder? The authors should discuss this potential specificity in the text. Figure 3D and Supplementary file 3 do not include any statistics.

Overall, this is a very interesting study with carefully performed experiments and high-quality results. An interesting question is whether GCN2 indeed exerts its effect via the induction of an ISR response, namely, upregulation of p-eIF2 and downstream effectors like ATF4. The data are devoid of analysis of p-eIF2 in the pancreatic cell lines in which GCN2, and other eIF2 kinases, are depleted by genetic means. It is of interest that p-eIF2 is marginally affected by the loss of GNC2 in tumors excised from nude mice (e.g. Figure S15). The authors need to explain this matter in the manuscript better (Discussion section).</p></disp-quote><p>This concern involves the addition of p-eIF2α and total eIF2α measurements in our analysis of cultured parental (LNCaP, 22Rv1, and PC-3) and GCN2 KO (22Rv1 and PC-3) PCa cells that are featured in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1A and Figure 1 —figure supplement 2A. We carried out these additional immunoblot experiments and now show that loss of GCN2 reduces p-eIF2α and ATF4 levels using two independent siRNAs (Figure 1B) or following CRISPR KO (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2A). The p-eIF2α and ATF4 levels were not reduced with the knock-down of the other eIF2α kinases (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1A).</p><p>Additionally, there was concern about the observation that p-eIF2α levels were not appreciably reduced in the GCN2 KO-derived tumors prepared from xenografted mice. We do note that downstream targets of GCN2 and p-eIF2α, such as 4F2, LAT1, xCT, ASCT1, ASCT2, and CAT1 proteins, were sharply lowered with genetic loss of GCN2 (Figure 6B and D, Figure 6 —figure supplement 2A, and Figure 6 —figure supplement 3C).</p><p>These are end-stage tumor preparations in which tumors were isolated after 42 days of growth. In our in vitro studies, we have observed induction of p-eIF2α in the absence of GCN2 at later times during nutrient limiting conditions. However, this p-eIF2α is not accompanied by the downstream induction of the ISR. It appears that either a secondary eIF2α kinase is activated, or there is a reduction of phosphatase-directed dephosphorylation of eIF2α, which could account for observed p-eIF2α in the absence of GCN2. The p-eIF2α occurs late in the timing of the ISR induction and is viewed as a consequence of secondary stresses or regulatory events imposed by the primary stress. The onset of p-eIF2α in the absence of the primary eIF2α kinase at later times of stress has been reported earlier (e.g. PMID: 12215525 and 14729979). Therefore, with these late-stage preparations, we view the downstream ISR effectors as being the best measure of GCN2-directed response. We have briefly added these points to the Results section on page 14, lines 307-310.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue is what activates GCN2 in prostate tumors. This is not explained very well in the manuscript. The authors need to provide some mechanistic explanation for the activation of GNC2 from their data.</p></disp-quote><p>Our results show that in vitro PCa cells are limited for essential amino acids. In the case of LNCaP cells, histidine is limiting, and there are measureable increases in unchaged tRNA<sup>His</sup>. The addition of essential amino acids to the culture media reduced GCN2 activation and the ISR, consistent with the idea that limiting amino acids is an activator of GCN2 in PCa cells cultured in standard growth medium. In tumors, we know that there is also a reduction in many free amino acids, and the addition of essential amino acids to the drinking water partially rescued growth of the GCN2 KO PCa tumors, but had no effect on PCa with functional GCN2. Therefore, our in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that PCa profileration induces sufficient amino acid limitation to activate GCN2, and this activation is required to sustain growth. We cover these points on page 18, lines 403– 410 of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An issue of potential concern is the specificity of GCN2i. Data in Figure 1D should be supplemented by the analysis of the proliferation of GCN2 KO tumor cells (CRISPR) in the presence of GCN2i.</p></disp-quote><p>To further address the specificity of Gcn2iB, we treated parental or GCN2 KO 22Rv1 cells with 2 – 10 µM GCN2iB for up to 6 days. Consistent with our previous results shown in Figure 1 - Figure Supplement 3A, GCN2iB inhibited the growth of parental 22Rv1 cells. However, GCN2iB had no significant effect on the growth of GCN2 KO cells. These results demonstrate the selective inhibition of GCN2-dependent growth by GCN2iB at the concentrations used in our PCa studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study would largely benefit from data showing ATF4 levels along p-GCN2 in human and/or mouse tumors from the xenograft assays by IHC.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added IHC staining for p-GCN2 in parental tumors, GCN2 KO tumors, and for tumors from mice treated with GCN2iB. We now show enhanced staining for p-GCN2 in parental tumors as compared to GCN2 KO tumors (22Rv1 and PC-3) or in tumors from GCN2iB treated mice (LNCaP, 22Rv1, TM00298, and LuCaP-35CR), and these results have been added to Figure 6 – Figure Supplement 1A (22Rv1 GCN2 KO tumors), Figure 6 —figure supplement 1C (PC-3 GCN2 KO tumors), and Figure 7 —figure supplement 1A (GCN2iB-treated mice bearing LNCaP, 22Rv1, TM00298, or LuCaP-35CR tumors). These new results are consistent with our previous immunoblot experiments showing that loss of GCN2 results in reduced expression of the GCN2-dependent target gene 4F2 (SLC3A2) in vivo (Figure 6B, Figure 6D, and Figure 6 – Figure Supplement 2A). In addition, we now show reduced IHC staining for 4F2 (SLC3A2) in GCN2 KO tumors as compared to parental controls (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1A and 1C).</p><p>We carried out IHC studies for ATF4 using two different commercial antibodies and our custom antibody for ATF4, and unfortunately did not measure specific staining as judged by staining of parental versus ATF4 KO tumors. ATF4 is expressed at low concentrations, as are many transcription factors, and this may be a contributor to the difficulties we encountered in these experiments. As noted above, other downstream target of GCN2, such as 4F2 and other amino acid transporters were reduced as judged by Western blotting in the GCN2 KO tumors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, I commend the authors for an excellent piece of work. It was a great read.

In addition, we show that knock-down of GCN2, ATF4, or 4F2 (SLC3A2), or treatment with GCN2iB has no effect on the growth of non-tumorigenic prostate cells. These new results were added as Figure 1 —figure supplement 5 and the statistical analysis added to Supplementary File 1_StatisticalAnalysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should combine their statistics (Supplementary File 1) into the figure legends or figures.

These should be included for each isoacceptor and isodecorder.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly points out that only one of the two isodecoders for histidine was detected in our charge-seq analysis in LNCaP cells, and we have shown that these cells are limited for histidine. The second isodecoder was measureable, but expressed at low levels. At this time, we do not know whether this is due to differential expression of the two histine tRNA isocoders or is a consequence of the tRNA charge-seq method, which involves reverse transcription and PCR amplification for each of the tRNAs. While we are confident of the ratio of the tRNA charging measurements using the tRNA charge-seq method, we are cautious about determining concentration differences between tRNA isodecoders. We have observed reductions in HIS-GTG tRNA charging using both the bulk library charge-seq method (Figure 3D and E) and dedicated qRT-PCR methods (Figure 3 —figure supplement 4). We have added statistical analysis of the charge-seq data to Supplementary File 3_ChargeseqData.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 177-179 – This sentence is not accurate at this point of the paper.

In Figure 3B and Figure 3 —figure supplements 1 and 2, we show that addition of essential amino acids (including histidine) reverses the proliferation defect induced by GCN2iB treatment and restores amino acid pool levels.
