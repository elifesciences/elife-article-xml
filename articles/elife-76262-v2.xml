To investigate the mechanisms, we have developed live-cell subcellular imaging methods using the mouse organotypic pancreatic slice. We demonstrate that the organotypic pancreatic slice, when compared with isolated islets, preserves intact β-cell structure, and enhances glucose-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and insulin secretion. Using the slice technique, we have discovered the essential role of local activation of integrins and the downstream component, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), in regulating β cells. Integrins and FAK are exclusively activated at the β-cell capillary interface and using in situ and in vitro models we show their activation both positions presynaptic scaffold proteins, like ELKS and liprin, and regulates glucose-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and insulin secretion. We conclude that FAK orchestrates the final steps of glucose-dependent insulin secretion within the restricted domain where β-cell contact the islet capillaries.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>secretion</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1128273</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thorn</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004365</institution-id><institution>Sydney Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SREI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thorn</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Bilek</surname><given-names>Marcela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008713</institution-id><institution>Diabetes Australia Research Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thorn</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FL190100216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bilek</surname><given-names>Marcela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The essential role of focal adhesion kinase in locally regulating insulin secretion and calcium responses in pancreatic beta cells is identified through the use of the pancreatic slice technique.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The intrinsic stimulus secretion coupling cascade in pancreatic β cells is well understood through extensive in vitro experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rorsman and Ashcroft, 2018</xref>). However, within the native islets of Langerhans numerous external factors intersect with this signal cascade to further control secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lammert and Thorn, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meda, 2013</xref>). The impact of some factors, such as gap junctions between endocrine cells, is well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benninger et al., 2011</xref>). Less well understood is the impact of the islet microenvironment on β-cell structural organisation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lammert and Thorn, 2020</xref>) and how this intersects with the known stimulus secretion pathways.</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that the region where β-cell contact the islet capillaries is specialised for secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Low et al., 2014</xref>). β cells, within intact islets, make a discrete point of contact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) that surrounds the capillaries. This point of contact is the target for insulin granule fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Low et al., 2014</xref>) and is enriched in presynaptic scaffold proteins, like liprin and ELKS and therefore has characteristics analogous to a neuronal presynaptic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng and Thorn, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lammert and Thorn, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Low et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohara-Imaizumi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohara-Imaizumi et al., 2005</xref>). Recapitulating this domain by culture of β cells on ECM-coated dishes shows that local activation of integrins is the target for insulin granule fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gan et al., 2018</xref>) and local control of microtubules regulates these secretory hot spots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trogden et al., 2021</xref>). Although the mechanisms are not known this work suggests that presynaptic scaffold proteins, and perhaps microtubules, control granule targeting to this capillary interface.</p><p>Just like neurotransmitter release, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is the dominant regulator of insulin secretion principally by Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through voltage-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schulla et al., 2003</xref>). We know from other systems that the location of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels relative to sites of granule fusion is critical to stimulus secretion coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nanou and Catterall, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stanley, 1997</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are typically regulated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations leading to positive and negative feedback to control channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zühlke et al., 1999</xref>). These actions control the amplitude and temporal kinetics of local subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations which in turn regulate exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nanou and Catterall, 2018</xref>). In neurones, a presynaptic scaffold protein complex tethers synaptic vesicles and collocates Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to the presynaptic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Südhof, 2012</xref>); whether similar mechanisms exist at the capillary interface of β cells is unknown.</p><p>In β cells there is functional, in vitro, evidence for close association of Cav1.2, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and insulin granule exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bokvist et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gandasi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pertusa et al., 1999</xref>) and structural evidence for protein links between the Cav1.2 channels and syntaxin 1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wiser et al., 1999</xref>); a SNARE protein required for granule fusion. This evidence is based on single, isolated β cells where capillary contacts are not present and the normal environmental cues of the islets are lost. Immunostaining β cells in the more intact environment of pancreatic slices shows that syntaxin 1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Low et al., 2014</xref>) has an even distribution across the β-cell plasma membrane and no enrichment at the capillary interface. This evidence therefore discounts a simple model where insulin secretion is regulated by colocalisation of syntaxin 1A and Cav1.2 at the capillary interface. Instead, there is recent evidence that the scaffold protein ELKS interacts with the β subunit of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohara-Imaizumi et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, although the work was carried out in isolated islets, which lack capillaries, there was evidence that the coupling between ELKS and the β subunit enhanced the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response at residual capillary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohara-Imaizumi et al., 2019</xref>), consistent with the idea that localised synaptic-like regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and exocytosis might exist in β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng and Thorn, 2022</xref>). However, the mechanisms that organise and control the positioning of these presynaptic scaffold proteins is unknown.</p><p>The emerging picture therefore is that spatial compartmentalisation is a key attribute of stimulus–secretion coupling in pancreatic β cells. The capillary interface of β cells is a region enriched in presynaptic scaffold proteins, is the target for insulin granule fusion and might be a region where Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are regulated. However, progress in this area is hampered by the difficulties in imaging single β cells within the islet environment.</p><p>To this end, the pancreatic slice is an important advance with a closer preservation to native islet structure than isolated islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meneghel-Rozzo et al., 2004</xref>). Analogous to organotypic brain slices, pancreatic slices maintain complex cell-to-cell arrangements that are likely to be important for overall islet control such as an intact islet capillary bed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohrs et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gan et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the local microenvironment around each endocrine cell is maintained, with each cell contacting the capillary and other endocrine cells. This promotes a distinct subcellular polarisation in β cells that is likely to impact on cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gan et al., 2017</xref>) with recent evidence the same organisation is present in rodent and human islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cottle et al., 2021</xref>). To date the pancreatic slice has been used in fixed-cell studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gan et al., 2017</xref>) and functional studies, for example looking at coordination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in β cells across the islet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stožer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stožer et al., 2021</xref>). In principle, the slice is the ideal platform for live-cell subcellular studies of the effects of β-cell organisation on glucose-dependent responses. However, preservation of function in slices has proved difficult and to date single-cell, live-cell work has relied on isolated islets (eg: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Low et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohara-Imaizumi et al., 2019</xref>) where capillaries are damaged and fragmented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Irving-Rodgers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lukinius et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have developed the pancreatic slice preparation for live-cell subcellular imaging of β-cell responses to glucose. Compared to isolated islets we show: slices demonstrate local activation of integrins and focal adhesions at the capillary interface of β cells, preserve enrichment of presynaptic scaffold proteins and have highly targeted insulin granule fusion to the capillary interface, fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes at low glucose concentrations and fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> kinetics in response to glucose elevation with very fast intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves that originate at the capillary interface.</p><p>We test for a role of contact with the capillary ECM using a range of interventions to block integrins and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) all of which consistently inhibit glucose-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and insulin secretion and disrupt the positioning of the presynaptic scaffold proteins ELKS and liprin. Importantly, we show high potassium-induced secretion and Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses are not affected by these interventions demonstrating the integrin/FAK pathway is a key and selective mediator of glucose control.</p><p>Together our data demonstrate that FAK is a master regulator of glucose-induced insulin secretion that controls the positioning of presynaptic scaffold proteins and shapes the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A striking characteristic of islets within slices is the preservation of the rich capillary bed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gan et al., 2017</xref>) which contrasts with the loss of endothelial cells and capillaries in the more usual method of enzymatic islet isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lukinius et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Using an immunostaining approach the distribution of ECM was markedly different between pancreatic slices and isolated islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This is as expected, because endothelial cells are the only source of intra-islet ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nikolova et al., 2006</xref>). In the isolated islets laminin was not associated with any specific structure but instead was dotted throughout the islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In pancreatic slices the ECM, identified by laminin, was strongly enriched around the islet capillaries and in the islet capsule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistent with this disruption we observed a reduction in laminin area and a reduction in CD31 (endothelial cell marker) immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pancreatic slices have an intact capillary bed.</title><p>Integrin-β1, phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and liprin are enriched at the β-cell capillary interface.

These data show that the disruption in ECM in the isolated islets does affect the function of β cells, in this case, reducing focal adhesion activity, as measured by phosphorylation. Also disrupted was the positioning of liprin. In isolated islets, liprin was dispersed and located all around the β-cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). In our analysis, we arbitrarily assigned the strongest laminin staining to region 1 (because, unlike the slice, we cannot readily identify the location of the capillaries).

We show that presynaptic scaffold proteins, insulin granule fusion and the control of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels all occur locally where the β-cell contact ECM. Furthermore, activation of the integrin/FAK pathway is critical for each one of these factors, either in positioning of granule fusion as we have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gan et al., 2018</xref>) or, as we now show in the positioning of the scaffold proteins and regulation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response.</p><p>In terms of spatial constraints, liprin, ELKS, and other presynaptic scaffold proteins are all enriched at the capillary interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Low et al., 2014</xref>) and when this complex is preserved, as we now show in slices, there is a very tight focus of insulin granule fusion to this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This is consistent with a synaptic-like mechanism. The various roles of liprin in neurones are still being uncovered but through protein–protein interactions it nucleates the formation of the presynaptic complex including proteins such as RIM which in turn tether granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Südhof, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wei et al., 2011</xref>).

Our data show that the maximal global rate of rise of the GCaMP measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> response is similar between the slices and isolated islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). This suggests that the number of active Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the β cells in both preparations is similar and is therefore consistent with the long-standing observations of robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in isolated islets. What is different in the slices is that we observe rapid local increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> and waves at the capillary interface, which must reflect local clustering of active channels – a central characteristic of neuronal synapses.</p><p>How do we explain the enhanced sensitivity to glucose of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in slices? Specifically, we might expect mechanisms that act on the voltage sensitivity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, so they respond at more negative membrane potentials, or that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels open longer and increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Our data provide evidence for two possible factors that are shaping the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in slices. Firstly, the clustering of active Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the capillary interface will affect Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel behaviour. The mouse has a diversity of CaV channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang and Berggren, 2005</xref>) but evidence shows that Cav1.2 plays a major role in the control of secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schulla et al., 2003</xref>) and is positively and negatively regulated by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zühlke et al., 1999</xref>). As has been shown in many other systems, the entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through each channel influences its own activity and the activity of immediately surrounding channels which makes channel clustering a critical factor in controlling channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stanley, 1997</xref>). Secondly, the localised activation of focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) may target the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. We show that culture of cells on BSA, inhibition of FAK and integrin-β1 blockade all reduce the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to glucose. This is the first report of a link between integrins and Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in β cells, which could be mediated through signal cascades elicited by focal adhesion activation, as has been shown in smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 1998</xref>) or it could be secondary to an integrin/FAK-mediated positioning of synaptic scaffold proteins. For the latter, we have shown integrin activation positions liprin and ELKS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and in turn ELKS may position the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohara-Imaizumi et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>How might the presynaptic-like complex be positioned at the capillary interface in β cells?</title><p>One point of distinction in the β cell compared to neurones is that there is no equivalent to a post-synaptic domain. In neurones, the pre- and post-synaptic domains are aligned by transmembrane proteins that span the synaptic cleft, such as neurexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Südhof, 2008</xref>). Indeed, neurexins do exist in β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mosedale et al., 2012</xref>) but our work now suggests that the integrin/focal adhesion pathway is a more likely candidate controlling the positioning of the presynaptic complex and we directly show it controls the positioning of both ELKS and liprin.</p><p>The question arises as to how this occurs and although there is evidence that liprins do interact with focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Astro et al., 2016</xref>) this has not been explored in β cells. Emerging new data is pointing towards a role for cortical complexes that contain ELKS and liprin and regionally locate microtubule plus ends to the subplasmalemmal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grimaldi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lansbergen et al., 2006</xref>). What is interesting is that these cortical complexes are now shown to link with focal adhesions through KANK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouchet et al., 2016</xref>) and many components of these complexes have recently been identified in β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Noordstra et al., 2022</xref>). Clearly further work is needed to understand how this system might function and control insulin secretion, but it is an attractive, and testable model that localises microtubules and presynaptic scaffold proteins with cortical complexes and focal adhesions all to the capillary interface of β cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Enhanced sensitivity to glucose in slices</title><p>Our finding of enhanced sensitivity to glucose in the pancreatic slices is a significant advance in the field. We observe repetitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes at 2.8 mM glucose that are lost when glucose is lowered to 1 mM and are not seen in isolated islets. In parallel, insulin secretion is observed from slices at 2.8 mM and decreases when glucose is lowered. This enhanced glucose sensitivity is likely to be driven by the intrinsic factors within the β cells we have identified. These factors include the identification of fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves that originate at the capillary interface, the short latency to peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and the close coupling between the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and sites of insulin granule exocytosis. We cannot rule out that other factors, present in pancreatic slices, may influence glucose sensitivity. One possible factor is the gap junction coupling of the cells, where, at low glucose concentrations, a majority of non-responsive cells are thought to supress the activity of individual particularly excitable cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benninger et al., 2011</xref>). However, this does not seem a likely explanation for our findings because we observe strong coordination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses, indicative of cell-to-cell coupling, in both slices and isolated islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Another obvious factor, that might differ in the preparations, is α cells where glucagon secretion can stimulate insulin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moede et al., 2020</xref>). However, this seems unlikely because lowering glucose from 2.8 to 1 mM would stimulate glucagon secretion and in the β cells we observe the opposite; a reduced insulin secretion and a reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response.</p><p>In a broader physiological context, it might seem unlikely that the responses we observe to low glucose concentrations are real. The ‘set point’ for mouse blood glucose is ~7 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2018</xref>) and the consensus from other studies, mostly using isolated islets, is that insulin secretion has an EC<sub>50</sub> for glucose of ~8 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hedeskov, 1980</xref>). Furthermore, the K<sub>m</sub> for the GLUT 2 transporter is 11 mM and the EC<sub>50</sub> for mouse glucokinase is 8 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rorsman and Ashcroft, 2018</xref>). The EC<sub>50</sub> we observe in slices is 8.6 mM and so is consistent with this past work and with physiological relevance, but the key distinction in our findings is the much greater sensitivity to lower glucose concentrations. There is however precedent that β cells can respond to much lower glucose concentrations. Using in vitro approaches Henquin’s lab showed a dose dependence of the amplifying pathway from 1 to 6 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gembal et al., 1992</xref>) and extensive early work identified subpopulations of isolated β cells that are very sensitive to glucose and released maximal insulin at 8.3 mM glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Van Schravendijk et al., 1992</xref>), similar to our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). More recently, using a perfused pancreas preparation, a significant increase in insulin secretion was observed at 6 mM glucose compared to 1 mM glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kellard et al., 2020</xref>). Given the excellent preservation of cell structure within the slice, our results likely reflect optimal behaviour of β cells and this could underpin their responsiveness to low glucose.</p><p>In vivo the control of glucose is dependent on a balance of hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2018</xref>) with evidence, in primates and humans that even in a fasting state, insulin, glucagon, and blood glucose concentrations synchronously oscillate indicating that hormone secretion is never zero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodner et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2000</xref>). It is interesting that insulin secretion at these low glucose concentrations is pulsatile since this is consistent with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes we observe. We conclude that our observations of insulin secretion in slices are interesting and likely to be a reflection of the better preservation of β-cell architecture and altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other factors in the slices are involved and more work will be required to determine how our findings relate to native regulation of β-cell function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Broader significance</title><p>Our work has important implications for understanding and treating diabetes. We have recently shown that the fundamental relationships between β cells and capillaries are similar between mouse and human islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cottle et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that the integrin/FAK pathway may play a similar role in human β cells. For type 2 diabetes, past work has indicated an impact of lipotoxicity on Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoppa et al., 2009</xref>) and the disease on Ca<sup>2+</sup> clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gandasi et al., 2017</xref>) which, in the new context given by our work, would take place at the capillary interface. We also know that both the capillary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brissova et al., 2015</xref>) and the ECM composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayden et al., 2005</xref>) are altered in disease. Furthermore, it is shown that β-cell function is compromised, as type 2 diabetes develops, prior to loss of β-cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohrs et al., 2020</xref>). In the light of our work, it is possible that these functional changes to β-cell responses might result from disruption of the capillaries and effects on the integrin/FAK pathway we describe. Given that sulfonylureas can improve insulin secretion in T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rorsman and Ashcroft, 2018</xref>) we already know that enhancement of glucose-dependent triggering is beneficial. Our new work suggests that widening the scope of our interest to include each element of the triggering pathway would be fruitful and that specifically intervening with the primary mechanisms that spatially organise the β cells could be disease modifying.</p><p>For type 1 diabetes, exciting advances are leading to the development of stem cell-based β-cell replacements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Melton, 2021</xref>). Most approaches generate spheroids of cells that we have recently shown do not contain organised ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singh et al., 2021</xref>) and, as a result, the β-like cells within the spheroids are not polarised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singh et al., 2021</xref>). Our work now suggests that amplification will be the dominant pathway underpinning glucose-dependent insulin secretion in these spheroids and that these cells will lack a drive from the integrin/FAK pathway. Because the triggering and amplification pathways are distinct our work indicates that a selective focus on enhancement of triggering may be broadly beneficial. This could include imposing polarity to the β-like cells, which we have shown does enhance secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singh et al., 2021</xref>), but it could also include genetic manipulation to upregulate components of the triggering pathway or the use of drugs, like sulfonylureas, to increase the sensitivity of this pathway.</p><p>In summary, our work exploits the pancreatic slice technique to highlight the importance of β-cell architecture and the islet environment in controlling glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Ongoing work is needed to determine the role of synaptic-like control of insulin secretion in healthy and diseased β cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal husbandry</title><p>Male C57BL/6 and GCAMP-InsCre mice were produced from mouse <italic>Ins1Cre</italic> (The Jackson Laboratory, strain #: 026801 B6(Cg)-Ins1<sup>tm1.1(cre)Thor</sup>/J) mice crossed with GCaMP6s mice (The Jackson Laboratory, strain #: 024106 B6;129S6-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm96(CAG-GCaMP6s)Hze/J) housed at the Charles Perkins Centre facility in a specific pathogen-free environment, at 22°C with 12-hr light cycles.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Reinhard Jahn as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>As you can see from the enclosed comments, the reviewers differed in their opinion about the manuscript. They have discussed the relevant issues and have agreed on revisions that they consider as essential, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers realize that these revisions may require substantial additional work, but considering that all methods are established in your laboratory they are considered as doable during revision. Please note that also the individual comments of the reviewers should be addressed in your response</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors should perform comparative experiments on freshly isolated islets in order to exclude that the reduced response of the islets is not due to the extended culture of the isolated islets.</p><p>2. The authors should check whether islets are less sensitive than slices to KATP-channel blockers as reduced responsiveness may be causally involved in the lower glucose sensitivity.</p><p>3. It would strengthen the work considerably if experiments using the approach shown in Figure 2 (measurements of exocytosis using sulforhodamine B) were included in which the response of isolated islets and slices is compared in the presence or absence of the FAK.</p><p>4. The authors should be more balanced in their discussion of their main findings, particularly with respect to their own previous publications in which the authors showed polarized insulin secretion in cultured islets being associated with local clusters of active zone proteins. Also, the summary should be revised to highlight the conceptual advance with respect to the role of the extracellular matrix in organizing exocytotic sites.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The labelling of the figures is not optimal, partially sloppy, and lacking important details. For instance, in all figures comparing isolated islets with slices it should be clearly indicated which panels refer to which system instead of forcing the reader to decipher the subpanels from the partially confusing legends (particularly important in Figures 1, 3 and 4).</p><p>Additional points:</p><p>Figure 1 Labelling of Figure 1C and D is confusing (top: black box slice and grey box isolated islet probably refers to C only?). Also, details are missing as to how exactly the fluorescence signals were normalized and quantified. The heatmaps are completely unintelligible: What is meant with &quot;total surface area&quot;? Or with the term &quot;focussed enrichment&quot; (at the capillary interface?)? Heatmaps: How were these maps obtained (from a 3D projection or from single confocal images?), and was there any averaging of images? Are the black bars supposed to be scale bars (length?) of 2D-images?</p><p>Figure 2 A: Is this staining for lamin by which the capillary interfaces were identified? This is neither mentioned in the text nor in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The hypersensitivity to glucose – not seen by other groups and which is NOT a sign of a more physiological preparation (on the contrary!) – has to be clarified. Independent functional assays should be performed as to the status of the preparations (e.g., lactate levels, other peptide hormone secretions, ATP levels, apoptosis assays etc) to find valid explanations.</p><p>Statistics are erroneous or insufficient in several instances. Student's t-test should not be used in Figure 2F, 6E, 8D (multiple comparisons conditions, one should not just pick that one wishes to compare and disregard the others). It is often not clear what &quot;n&quot; means, different slices from same animals or from different animals? Often the numbers of replica are limit especially in view of the well-known islet β-cell heterogeneity. It would also be interesting to provide some information on islet sizes, whether images were taken (at centre or periphery, where heterologous cell contacts differ and β-cells are known to have distinct behaviours).</p><p>Kinetics of stimuli arrival has only been determined for islets (Suppl Figure 4), but not for the slices, which is far more crucial.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I liked this paper. The difference between insulin secretion/exocytosis in isolated islets and the slices is quite remarkable.</p><p>1) Line 162 – How quickly do the changes between isolated islets and the slices develop? The methods suggest that the isolated islets were maintained in tissue culture (line 597--) but I could no information on the duration of the culture. This should be rectified. It seems unlikely that the redistribution occurs immediately upon isolation and whilst most laboratories use islets after tissue culture, some laboratories use acutely isolated islets. Such information would guide experimental work and may explain some contradictory data in the literature!</p><p>2) Line 344. How selective is Y15? If the authors are correct then it would seem that Y15 should NOT be effective in isolated cultured islets – Is this the case? This simple experiment would go a long way to establishing the specificity of the inhibitor!</p><p>3) Line 435: 'an action of F-actin'. Actin is mentioned here but not commented on subsequently. There is an interesting and potentially highly relevant effect of F-actin on KATP channel activity (PMID: 19213846). One possible explanation for the left-shift in the glucose dependence is that KATP channel activity is reduced. This possibility should be discussed. Indeed, it would be very interesting to compare the effects of cytochalasin D on insulin secretion in isolated islets and the slices (expected to have a particularly strong effect at low glucose in slices and possibly even restoring the amplifying effect of glucose in this preparation).</p><p>4) Are there any data suggesting that the observations the authors describe here can be extended to the human pancreas? Considering the work of Solimena and colleagues might be illuminating in this context (PMID: 32268101).</p><p>5) Broader significance. The first part (line 547-) is relevant and interesting. The part discussing tyupe-1 diabetes (line 561 onwards) a bit construed. Cut?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled <bold>&quot;</bold>Local activation of focal adhesion kinase orchestrates the positioning of presynaptic scaffold proteins and ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling to control glucose dependent insulin secretion<bold>&quot;</bold> for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been seen again by the referees.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but two of the reviewers have made further suggestions that we would like you to consider when preparing the final version for publication.

Ironically the manuscript already contains one piece of data that strongly suggests that KATP channel activity is reduced in slices: viz. on ll. 274-, the authors mention the different effects of glibenclamide in slices and intact islets and that the KATP channel inhibitor only stimulates insulin secretion at 8 mM glucose in isolated islets (whereas stimulation is observed at 2.8 mM glucose in both preparations).

The authors should perform comparative experiments on freshly isolated islets in order to exclude that the reduced response of the islets is not due to the extended culture of the isolated islets.</p></disp-quote><p>In response we have directly compared freshly isolated islets with islets cultured overnight. In isolated islets we observed no statistical differences in insulin secretion measured immediately compared to overnight culture either at 2.8 mM glucose (Student t test, p=0.57, n=3 mice) or at 16.7 mM glucose (Student t test, p=0.46, n=3 mice). We note that overnight culture of islets is normal practice and would not be considered in the field as “extended” culture. As explained below, in all our experiments, both isolated islets and slices, we use the same overnight culture protocol. It would be difficult to time-match measurements on fresh slices with isolated islets since preparing each individual slice is time consuming. Placing both preparations in culture under exactly the same conditions overnight, we believe, is therefore the best approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors should check whether islets are less sensitive than slices to KATP-channel blockers as reduced responsiveness may be causally involved in the lower glucose sensitivity.</p></disp-quote><p>In response we have used the KATP channel blocker glibenclamide on isolated islets and on slices. At low glucose (2.8 mM) pretreatment with glibenclamide significantly (Student t test p&lt;0.01) increased insulin secretion in both islets and slices (new Supplemental Figure 2C), indicating that both preparations are responsive to KATP channel blockade and, by inference, that β cells are functional in both preparations.</p><p>As an additional experiment we also pretreated with glibenclamide and then applied a suprathreshold glucose concentration of 8 mM. In the isolated islets this further, significantly (Student t test p&lt;0.01) increased insulin secretion, where-as in slices there was no further increase. This result is consistent with our findings with diazoxide, a KATP channel opener (Figure 2), and supports the idea that glucose-dependent triggering, which is dependent on closure of the KATP channel is more robust in slices compared to islets. This data is now included in the Results section (new Supplemental Figure 2C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It would strengthen the work considerably if experiments using the approach shown in Figure 2 (measurements of exocytosis using sulforhodamine B) were included in which the response of isolated islets and slices is compared in the presence or absence of the FAK.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have now conducted these experiments. As expected from our observed reduction in glucose dependent ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and secretion (new Figure 6 F,G,H,I), the inhibition of FAK reduces the overall number of granule fusion events. But, consistent with a role of integrin/FAK in localising granule fusion events our analysis shows the remaining events are not targeted to the capillary interface.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors should be more balanced in their discussion of their main findings, particularly with respect to their own previous publications in which the authors showed polarized insulin secretion in cultured islets being associated with local clusters of active zone proteins. Also, the summary should be revised to highlight the conceptual advance with respect to the role of the extracellular matrix in organizing exocytotic sites.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten the discussion to include a direct assessment of our own previous data and underscore the advance in this new paper. Live-cell imaging of slices has been challenging and the high-resolution, subcellular imaging by us (eg Low et al., 2014) and others (eg Ohara-Imaizumi et al., 2019) has therefore previously been performed using isolated islets. However, fixed slices have been a valuable tool for 3D immunostaining and are the basis for our detailed localisation of active zone proteins (Low et al., 2014) and integrins (Gan et al., 2018) at the capillary interface. Thus the direct comparison of data from both live and fixed-cell work in islets and slices, has not been possible before and is a key advance in our new paper (Figure 1 and 2).</p><p>To address the second point, we now speculate more broadly on the potential mechanisms that link integrin/FAK to active zone proteins and the local organisation of exocytosis. Our new data suggests either liprin and/or ELKS are physically coupled to integrins at the capillary interface. We now discuss precedent, in other systems, particularly cortical microtubule stabilising complexes, for mechanisms that co-locate these proteins to focal adhesions in non-secretory cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The labelling of the figures is not optimal, partially sloppy, and lacking important details. For instance, in all figures comparing isolated islets with slices it should be clearly indicated which panels refer to which system instead of forcing the reader to decipher the subpanels from the partially confusing legends (particularly important in Figures 1, 3 and 4).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added detail to the figure labelling to identify the details of the conditions in the panels/subpanels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional points:</p><p>Figure 1 Labelling of Figure 1C and D is confusing (top: black box slice and grey box isolated islet probably refers to C only?). Also, details are missing as to how exactly the fluorescence signals were normalized and quantified. The heatmaps are completely unintelligible: What is meant with &quot;total surface area&quot;? Or with the term &quot;focussed enrichment&quot; (at the capillary interface?)? Heatmaps: How were these maps obtained (from a 3D projection or from single confocal images?), and was there any averaging of images? Are the black bars supposed to be scale bars (length?) of 2D-images?</p></disp-quote><p>Labelling of 1C and D changed. Details of quantification added to methods. We have previously published on the use of heat maps to give a 2D representation of the 3D surface area of an individual β cell within slices (Gan et al., 2018). For clarity, this methodology is now outlined in the figure legend and included in the methods of the revised manuscript. The black bars are scale bars of 5 µm length.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 A: Is this staining for lamin by which the capillary interfaces were identified? This is neither mentioned in the text nor in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>The staining is the fluorescent signal from SRB. When SRB is added to the extracellular media surrounding the slices/islets it enters and highlights the capillaries and the narrow spaces between the cells (as shown in Figure 2A and B). We have previously tested the validity of this method for identification of capillaries by counterstaining with isolectin B4 (Low et al., 2014) and now explain this in the figure legends of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The hypersensitivity to glucose – not seen by other groups and which is NOT a sign of a more physiological preparation (on the contrary!) – has to be clarified. Independent functional assays should be performed as to the status of the preparations (e.g., lactate levels, other peptide hormone secretions, ATP levels, apoptosis assays etc) to find valid explanations.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the referee’s reservations and indeed we were also surprised when initially presented with the first results. What we can say is:</p><p>– The data has been reproduced over the last 2 years in the lab by multiple personnel.</p><p>– It is difficult to compare our data with other work on slices. It is only our detailed doseresponse to glucose that demonstrates a shift in the sensitivity to glucose: a simple low-high glucose assay will not show any change.</p><p>– Along the same lines, increased secretory output in slices is evident in our study (Figure 2) but would not be apparent in any stand-alone study of slices. Our data directly compares slices and islets under the same conditions – this has not been done before</p><p>– Our use of diazoxide, the KATP channel opener, is a selective manipulation of β cells and shows a significant difference in responses between islets and slices. This proves that β cells are central to the different responses in slices vs islets. We have used this as evidence for the enhanced preservation of structure and function of β cells in slices. If the referee was correct then the “defective” response in the slices must be due to damage to the β cells.</p><p>– We used Hoechst and propidium iodide staining to identify compromised cells in both preparations. In isolated islets we identified 11% of a total of 329 cells as stained with propidium iodide. These cells were peripheral to the islets and likely arise due to the isolation process. In slices we identified 2% of 249 cells as positive for propidium iodide. This demonstrates that cells within the slice preparation are healthy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Statistics are erroneous or insufficient in several instances. Student's t-test should not be used in Figure 2F, 6E, 8D (multiple comparisons conditions, one should not just pick that one wishes to compare and disregard the others). It is often not clear what &quot;n&quot; means, different slices from same animals or from different animals? Often the numbers of replica are limit especially in view of the well-known islet β-cell heterogeneity. It would also be interesting to provide some information on islet sizes, whether images were taken (at centre or periphery, where heterologous cell contacts differ and β-cells are known to have distinct behaviours).</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the analysis to include ANOVA (and Tukey tests) where relevant and clarified the meaning of the numbers in terms of replicates, islets and animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Kinetics of stimuli arrival has only been determined for islets (Suppl Figure 4), but not for the slices, which is far more crucial.</p></disp-quote><p>We measured the kinetics in exactly the same way using a dye tracer for both islets and slices. The Suppl Figure 4 shows an exemplar trace in islets, but the method was used in all the experiments. We note, our measures of latency, using a dye tracker, are much more accurate than most other methods. We applied this method to both islets and slices and therefore we have a direct “internal” comparison. The figure legend has been modified to make this point clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I liked this paper. The difference between insulin secretion/exocytosis in isolated islets and the slices is quite remarkable.</p><p>1) Line 162 – How quickly do the changes between isolated islets and the slices develop? The methods suggest that the isolated islets were maintained in tissue culture (line 597--) but I could no information on the duration of the culture. This should be rectified. It seems unlikely that the redistribution occurs immediately upon isolation and whilst most laboratories use islets after tissue culture, some laboratories use acutely isolated islets. Such information would guide experimental work and may explain some contradictory data in the literature!</p></disp-quote><p>We use both slices and islets after overnight culture – this is now clarified in the text. As a point of interest we have some pilot data that show islet isolation leads to a collapse of β cell structure within hours. However, this can only be qualitatively assessed because enzyme digestion has variable effects from mouse-to-mouse, big vs small islets etc. So, although all islets are damaged and capillaries are lost after isolation, the extent of this is variable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Line 344. How selective is Y15? If the authors are correct then it would seem that Y15 should NOT be effective in isolated cultured islets – Is this the case? This simple experiment would go a long way to establishing the specificity of the inhibitor!</p></disp-quote><p>Y15 is a selective blocker of FAK Y397 phosphorylation and, while we cannot rule out side effects, the consistency of our observed responses to Y15, and to integrin blockade and to culture of cells on BSA all point to an integrin/FAK pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Line 435: 'an action of F-actin'. Actin is mentioned here but not commented on subsequently. There is an interesting and potentially highly relevant effect of F-actin on KATP channel activity (PMID: 19213846). One possible explanation for the left-shift in the glucose dependence is that KATP channel activity is reduced. This possibility should be discussed. Indeed, itwould be very interesting to compare the effects of cytochalasin D on insulin secretion in isolated islets and the slices (expected to have a particularly strong effect at low glucose in slices and possibly even restoring the amplifying effect of glucose in this preparation).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point, the KATP channel might be enriched at the capillary interface (because it is linked with SNARES – Leung et al., 2007) and this might be better preserved in the slices. However, we think that this would justify a separate study since F-actin plays multiple roles in the β cell, (for example, we have recently published on the local action of F-actin in controlling insulin granule dynamics during fusion (Wei et al., 2020)) and therefore interpretation of findings of inhibitors would be difficult.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Are there any data suggesting that the observations the authors describe here can be extended to the human pancreas? Considering the work of Solimena and colleagues might be illuminating in this context (PMID: 32268101).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included reference to Solimena’s work also reference to our own work on human pancreas which shows human β cells possess these active zone proteins and they are enriched at the capillary interface (Cottle et al., 2021). Importantly, our paper shows that despite some gross morphological differences between mouse and human islets each individual β cell in the human islet still makes contact with an islet capillary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Broader significance. The first part (line 547-) is relevant and interesting. The part discussing tyupe-1 diabetes (line 561 onwards) a bit construed. Cut?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to leave the discussion of the relevance to cell-based approaches to treating type 1 diabetes. In that field there is a view that β cell function is defined by pathways intrinsic to the cell and that external factors might enhance insulin secretion but are not fundamentally important. What our work suggests is that external factors might be much more important than previously thought and we think that a short discussion of this point is relevant.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have provided additional experiments which were suggested, corrected statistical errors, and down-tuned some parts.

Data from humans and animals does show insulin secretion even at low glucose concentrations and we have now added discussion around this point. It is interesting that insulin secretion at low (fasting levels) of glucose is consistently observed as oscillatory since this could be driven by the spikes of ca<sup>2+</sup> we observe at low glucose concentrations. However, we are not aware of any in vivo data showing insulin secretion at lower than normal endogenous glucose concentrations. To do this would be difficult and require deliberate and careful experimentation and would be complicated by the triggering of glucagon secretion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also noteworthy that data on islet β-cell activity have been published with a maximal effect at glucose of 9 mM (as here in slices), thus the maximal and EC50 observed in slices are quite comparable to a number of islet studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this sentiment and have added a sentence in the discussion to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some improvement here may be of interest for the authors as the manuscript may become a quite often cited article.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The revised version of the manuscript is improved over the original but some weaknesses remain.</p><p>1) I accept that it may seem beyond the scope of the paper to explore the interaction between KATP channels and the actin network (but I hope the authors intend to carry out these measurements and that it is not just lip service to placate the reviewer!).
