pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25012.001</object-id><p>The coordinated control of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is essential for development in eukaryotes. Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGC) family members mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from cellular stores in plants (Charpentier et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2016; Frietsch et al., 2007; Urquhart et al., 2007). Here, we report the unusual genetic behavior of a quantitative gain-of-function <italic>CNGC</italic> mutation (<italic>brush</italic>) in <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> resulting in a leaky tetrameric channel. <italic>brush</italic> resides in a cluster of redundant <italic>CNGCs</italic> encoding subunits which resemble metazoan voltage-gated potassium (Kv1-Kv4) channels in assembly and gating properties. The recessive mongenic <italic>brush</italic> mutation impaired root development and infection by nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. The <italic>brush</italic> allele exhibited quantitative behavior since overexpression of the cluster subunits was required to suppress the <italic>brush</italic> phenotype. The results reveal a mechanism by which quantitative competition between channel subunits for tetramer assembly can impact the phenotype of the mutation carrier.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25012.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants constantly monitor and respond to changes in their environment. Central to this surveillance system is the movement of calcium ions into and out of cells. Calcium ions are normally kept at very low levels inside of cells and subtle changes in these levels relay information about the external environment. In the case of plant roots, changes in the concentration of calcium ions herald essential information about soil conditions and the presence of microorganisms, and in turn trigger appropriate responses.</p><p>Calcium ion signals are essential for peas, beans and other members of the legume family to form close relationships (known as symbioses) with soil bacteria called rhizobia. As such, many studies of calcium signalling have focused on root symbioses, particularly in a model legume called <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic>. Previous studies have identified one mutant version of this plant, called <italic>brush</italic>, which develops abnormal roots with brush-like arrays of root hairs near the tip. The <italic>brush</italic> mutant was also unable to form a symbiosis with rhizobia, and structures that allow the bacteria to enter the plant stopped developing before they were complete. However, the gene responsible had not been identified.</p><p>Chiasson, Haage et al. set out to identify the responsible mutation. At first the <italic>brush</italic> mutation escaped identification because a key experiment gave an unexpected result. The introduction of a normal, or wild type, copy of the proposed gene – referred to as <italic>BRUSH</italic> – into the <italic>brush</italic> mutant did not correct the problems with its roots. Further analysis revealed that it was actually the ratio between <italic>BRUSH</italic> and <italic>brush</italic> expression levels that was critical for determining how the plant’s roots developed.</p><p>The mutation in <italic>brush</italic> causes a small change in a protein belonging to the CNGC family. These proteins act as channels and allow ions to move across cell membranes. Further experiments found that the channel formed by the mutated CNGC protein is leaky and allows calcium ions to enter the cell in the absence of any cue from the environment. The leaky entry of calcium ions likely confuses the plant’s surveillance system, which disturbs the normal development of the root. It is also likely that the <italic>brush</italic> mutation’s effects on calcium signaling also interfere with the entry of rhizobia into the roots. These findings provide important insights into the function of CNGCs and reveal how a small change in a channel protein can have far reaching effects on an organism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Lotus japonicus</italic></kwd><kwd>cell development</kwd><kwd>Ion channel</kwd><kwd>root development</kwd><kwd>genetics</kwd><kwd>tetrameric complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR964 (Calcium)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haage</surname><given-names>Kristina</given-names></name><name><surname>Dietrich</surname><given-names>Petra</given-names></name><name><surname>Parniske</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011199</institution-id><institution>FP7 Ideas: European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>340904 (EvolvingNodules)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parniske</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chiasson</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mutant allele encoding a deregulated subunit of an ion channel tetramer revealed a mechanistic connection between protein heteromerization and quantitative genetic behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The legume-rhizobium symbiosis offers an excellent model system to study the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in eukaryotic cell development. Rhizobia produce lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs) which stimulate signal transduction processes involving not only oscillations of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the nucleus and perinuclear region but also rapid influx of calcium ions into the cytoplasm of legume root hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Felle et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardenas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ehrhardt et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miwa et al., 2006</xref>), preceeding rhizobial entry and organ development. The <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> mutant <italic>brush</italic> was previously isolated in a screen of an ethyl-methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenised population for plants defective in symbiotic cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maekawa-Yoshikawa et al., 2009</xref>). At 26°C, <italic>brush</italic> roots are stunted and root hair infection threads do not progress into the root cortex, resulting in the formation of non-infected (‘empty’) nodules. The evidence suggested that the recessive mutation was negatively interfering with infection thread progression and cell expansion in the root apical meristem. The <italic>brush</italic> mutation was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 2 at 8.8 cM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maekawa-Yoshikawa et al., 2009</xref>), linked to the marker TM0312. Subsequently, a large-scale recombinant screen for fine-mapping was undertaken. In total, 20 of 1148 tested F2 individuals showed recombination events between the flanking markers TM2432 and TM0348 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). F2 genotyping and subsequent F3 phenotyping refined the target region to 37 kb. One EMS-induced mutation was detected in the first exon of <italic>BRUSH</italic>, a predicted <italic>CNGC</italic> of unknown function. Because the <italic>brush</italic> mutant phenotype could not be complemented with the genomic region containing <italic>BRUSH</italic> including its native promoter (see below), we searched for additional possible missed mutations. The genome of <italic>brush</italic> was sequenced and aligned with the reference genome. Within the already delineated target interval the mutation in <italic>BRUSH</italic> was confirmed and no additional polymorphisms relative to the Gifu wild-type were detected.</p><p>The predicted genomic sequence of <italic>BRUSH</italic> carried a guanine to adenine (G401A) transition in the first exon in <italic>brush</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Amplification of <italic>brush</italic> cDNA revealed an open-reading frame encoding a protein containing 773 amino acids with an amino acid exchange from glycine to glutamic acid (G134E). The genome of the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> contains 20 predicted <italic>CNGC</italic> genes, which can be classified into four distinct groups (I, II, III, IV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mäser et al., 2001</xref>). Phylogenetic and synteny analysis revealed that BRUSH (CNGC.IVA1) is orthologous to the Group IVA members AtCNGC19 and AtCNGC20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similar to other Group IVA CNGCs, BRUSH contains a relatively long N-terminal extension followed by six predicted transmembrane domains and a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The <italic>brush</italic> mutation is located in a conserved region previously identified as a putative sorting signal in Group IVA CNGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yuen and Christopher, 2013</xref>). Sequencing coupled with gene prediction of the <italic>brush</italic> target region revealed that <italic>BRUSH</italic> resides in a cluster containing five <italic>CNGC</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Analysis of syntenic genomic regions in legumes and non-legumes revealed that the <italic>CNGC.IVA</italic> cluster expansion occurred early in the legume lineage and was retained. Transcripts for three of the loci could be amplified (<italic>CNGC.IVA3</italic>, <italic>CNGC.IVA4</italic>, <italic>CNGC.IVA5</italic>) and encode proteins which are closely related to BRUSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

These results suggested that expression level of <italic>brush</italic> is critical for phenotype manifestation.

Collectively, these results suggest that the expression level of <italic>brush</italic> is critical for the observed phenotypes and that the phenotypic penetrance of the allele appears to be dosage-dependent.

The overlapping expression pattern of the Group IVA <italic>CNGC</italic>s together with their ability to dampen the <italic>brush</italic> phenotype indicate that these genes are redundant.</p><p>Given that plant CNGCs are anticipated to form both homomeric and heteromeric tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma and Berkowitz, 2011</xref>), an interaction between BRUSH and redundant CNGCs is conceivable. We initially utilized the yeast split-ubiquitin interaction assay to determine the location of the BRUSH termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xing et al., 2016</xref>). The assay utilizes the N-terminal (Nub) and C-terminal (Cub) fragments of yeast ubiquitin (Ubi4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stagljar et al., 1998</xref>). Reconstitution of ubiquitin in the cytoplasm leads to proteolytic release of Cub (fused to LexA-VP16) and activation of genetic reporters. We observed that BRUSH-Cub interacted with both NubI-BRUSH and BRUSH-NubI fusions demonstrating that both BRUSH termini are located in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since voltage-gated ion channel subunits interact via their soluble domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barros et al., 2012</xref>), we focused on the CNGC.IVA soluble termini for yeast two-hybrid interaction assays. We observed a self-interaction for the BRUSH N-terminus (NT) as well as interaction with the NTs of brush, CNGC.IVA3, CNGC.IVA4, CNGC.IVA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) along with AtCNGC19 and AtCNGC20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>).

We pinpointed the CNGC tetrameric complex in combination with the expanded gene family as the causative factors for the unusual genetics.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Christian Hardtke (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript provides new insight into CNGC channels in plants through analysis of an unusual hypomorphic allele of BRUSH, a CNGC channel from <italic>L. japonicus</italic> that is required for nodulation. The strength of the work is the elegant resolution of the genetic riddle of this hypermorphic allele and the identification of a missense mutation in a conserved N-terminal region of the protein which appears to result in a constitutively-open channel. The data are explained by a model involving a tetrameric complex of Brush monomers and suggests assembly and gating properties more similar to those of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels rather than the classical animal CNGC channels.</p><p>There is still much that is unknown about CNGC channels in plants and the reviewers agree that the discovery of a residue that results in constitutive activation represents a significant advance towards understanding their regulation. However, they feel that two aspects of the data need to be further substantiated.</p><p>Protein:Protein interaction data:</p><p>The protein interaction data need to be strengthened. As noted below, the yeast 2 hybrid experiments are missing some controls and furthermore, the interactions are based only on the yeast 2 hybrid data. The yeast 2 hybrid data need to be improved and the subunit interactions need to be confirmed in a second system. For example, can BRUSH and brush interactions be observed in oocytes (by FRET or other protein-protein interaction approaches). Does Brush run as a multimeric complex on gels?</p><p>Specific concerns about the yeast 2 hybrid data.</p><p>The current yeast 2 hybrid data are missing some negative and positive controls. The empty vector control indicates that there is no self-activation but there are no controls with proteins that do not bind (something is needed to demonstrate specificity of binding i.e. another negative control protein that does not bind to the CNGCs). Additionally, does brush interact with itself? This is not shown in the current data and needs to be demonstrated as it is essential for the model.</p><p>Calcium measurements to support the model:</p><p>It is proposed that a deregulated calcium influx impairing infection is suggested to explain the brush nodulation phenotype. There are robust calcium sensors that could be used to document this effect directly. Comparative measurements of calcium influx in root hairs of brush mutants and wild type root hairs are needed to provide in planta evidence to support the proposed model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25012.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is still much that is unknown about CNGC channels in plants and the reviewers agree that the discovery of a residue that results in constitutive activation represents a significant advance towards understanding their regulation.

This data has been added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>. We also attempted purification assays in plants and yeast (both full-length and isolated N-terminus) but encountered complications due to aggregation after overexpression. We were unable to purify sufficient quantities for analysis by gel electrophoresis or co-IPs. We therefore chose to use oocytes as the expression system yielded sufficient amounts of protein to observe the BiFC interaction. The following text was added regarding the BiFC experiment:</p><p>“To further substantiate the yeast interaction, we co-injected full-length subunits into <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes for bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. Expression of BRUSH-BRUSH, BRUSH-brush, and brush-brush combinations resulted in successful complementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific concerns about the yeast 2 hybrid data.</p><p>The current yeast 2 hybrid data are missing some negative and positive controls.

CCaMK and CYCLOPS interacted in the yeast two-hybrid system while neither protein interacted with the N-terminal domain of the tested CNGCs. The results have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. Yes, the N-terminus of the brush mutant does maintain the self-interaction and this result has also been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Calcium measurements to support the model:</p><p>It is proposed that a deregulated calcium influx impairing infection is suggested to explain the brush nodulation phenotype.

We have generated a proposed model to explain our observations regarding the allele, however the root hair is not currently featured in the model. The original manuscript describing the <italic>brush</italic> mutant phenotype (Maekawa-Yoshikawa et al., 2009) demonstrated that root hair calcium spiking is normal in response to applied Nod factor. Since we have only observed <italic>BRUSH<sub>promoter</sub>:GUS</italic> activity in isolated root hairs after the rhizobial infection process has been initiated, <italic>brush</italic> likely acts downstream of the initial signaling events. Further, as <italic>brush</italic> is not constitutively expressed we don’t believe the activity of mutant channel can be properly assessed in root hairs. We have modified the original text to read:</p><p>“Given that <italic>brush</italic> is expressed in root hairs and nodule primordia after inoculation with rhizobia and that Ca<sup>2+</sup> spiking in <italic>brush</italic> is intact<italic><sup>10</sup></italic>, the deregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx activity may impair rhizobial infection progression by interfering with downstream signaling events.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
