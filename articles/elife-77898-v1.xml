regions (DMRs) known as imprinting control regions. Direct nanopore sequencing of DNA provides a means to detect allelic methylation and to overcome the drawbacks of methylation array and short-read technologies. Here, we used publicly available nanopore sequencing data for 12 standard B-lymphocyte cell lines to acquire the genome-wide mapping of imprinted intervals in humans. Using the sequencing data, we were able to phase 95% of the human methylome and detect 94% of the previously well-characterized, imprinted DMRs. In addition, we found 42 novel imprinted DMRs (16 germline and 26 somatic), which were confirmed using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data. Analysis of WGBS data in mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), rhesus monkey (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>), and chimpanzee (<italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>) suggested that 17 of these imprinted DMRs are conserved. Some of the novel imprinted intervals are within or close to imprinted genes without a known DMR. We also detected subtle parental methylation bias, spanning several kilobases at seven known imprinted clusters. At these blocks, hypermethylation occurs at the gene body of expressed allele(s) with mutually exclusive H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 allelic histone marks. These results expand upon our current knowledge of imprinting and the potential of nanopore sequencing to identify imprinting regions using only parent-offspring trios, as opposed to the large multi-generational pedigrees that have previously been required.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>imprinting</kwd><kwd>nanopore sequencing</kwd><kwd>allele-specific methylation</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>H3K36me3</kwd><kwd>H3K27me3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000187</institution-id><institution>The University of British Columbia, 4-Year Doctoral Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akbari</surname><given-names>Vahid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marra</surname><given-names>Marco A</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Steven JM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A genome-wide map of human allele-specific methylation using long-read sequencing detects novel imprinted DNA methylation events and reveals large blocks of subtle parent-of-origin bias in DNA methylation with mutual exclusive allelic H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 histone modifications.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The addition of a methyl group to the fifth carbon of cytidine is the most prevalent and stable epigenetic modification of human DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laurent et al., 2010</xref>). DNA methylation is involved in gene regulation and influences a vast array of biological mechanisms, including embryonic development and cell fate, genome imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and transposon silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith and Meissner, 2013</xref>). In mammals, there are two copies or alleles of a gene, one inherited from each parent. Most gene transcripts are expressed from both alleles. However, a subset of genes are only expressed from a single allele; this allele can be selected either randomly, as seen in X-chromosome inactivation in females, or based upon the parent-of-origin (PofO), referred to as imprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chess, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Khamlichi and Feil, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In imprinting, mono-allelic expression of a gene or cluster of genes is controlled by a cis-acting imprinting control region (ICR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartolomei and Ferguson-Smith, 2011</xref>). The main mechanism by which this occurs is PofO-defined differential methylation at ICRs, also known as imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartolomei and Ferguson-Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maupetit-Méhouas et al., 2016</xref>). Imprinted DMRs are classified as germline (primary) or somatic (secondary), hereinafter referred to as gDMR and sDMR. gDMRs are established during the first wave of methylation reprogramming in germ cell development and escape the second methylation reprogramming after fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zink et al., 2018</xref>). sDMRs are established de novo after fertilization during somatic development<italic>,</italic> usually under the control of a nearby gDMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zink et al., 2018</xref>). Imprinted clusters of genes may span up to ~4 Mb, by acting through a CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)-binding site or by allelic expression of a long non-coding RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartolomei and Ferguson-Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">da Rocha and Gendrel, 2019</xref>). By contrast, individually imprinted genes are typically regulated by PofO-derived differential methylation at the gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartolomei and Ferguson-Smith, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Imprinting is implicated in various genetic disorders, either from aberrations in imprinted methylation or from deleterious variants affecting the ICR and imprinted genes. Aberrant imprinted methylation is also detected in several human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goovaerts et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jelinic and Shaw, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tomizawa and Sasaki, 2012</xref>). Thus, accurate mapping and characterization of imprinting in humans is key to the treatment and actionability of genetic disorders, and to personalized oncogenomonics.</p><p>To detect imprinted methylation, accurate assignment of methylation data to paternal and maternal alleles is required. Achieving this with traditional bisulfite sequencing or arrays is challenging. Several studies have used samples with large karyotypic abnormalities, such as uniparental disomies, teratomas, and hydatidiform moles, to infer regions of imprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Court et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hernandez Mora et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>). This approach relies not only on rare structural variants, but also on the assumption that both normal methylation and the imprinted state remain intact in spite of substantial genomic aberrations. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zink et al., 2018</xref>, leveraged a genotyped, multi-generation pedigree spanning nearly half the population of Iceland (n=150,000), in combination with whole-genome oxidative bisulfite sequencing, to phase methylation and infer PofO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zink et al., 2018</xref>). However, despite being able to phase nearly every SNP in that cohort, they were only able to phase 84% of the human autosomal methylome in over 200 samples due to the short length of reads. Furthermore, the study was based on a single, genetically isolated population, which may not be representative of the wider human population. A comprehensive mapping of imprinted methylation using a technology more suited to phasing reads, based on individuals more representative of the human population, could greatly advance our understanding of imprinting, with direct benefits for human health.</p><p>Previously, we have shown that nanopore sequencing can detect allelic methylation in a single sample and accurately determine PofO using only trio data. We also previously developed the software NanoMethPhase for this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akbari et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we applied NanoMethPhase to public nanopore data from a diverse set of 12 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) and Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) to investigate genome-wide allele-specific methylation (ASM) and detect novel imprinted DMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Coster et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shafin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zook et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zook et al., 2019</xref>). Using trio data from GIAB and 1KGP for these cell lines, we phased nanopore long reads to their PofO and inferred allelic methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akbari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zook et al., 2019</xref>). We were able to detect haplotype and methylation status for 26.5 million autosomal CpGs comprising 95% of the human autosomal methylome (GRCh38 main chromosomes). We further used public whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data to confirm the presence of the detected DMRs in other tissues and to classify the novel DMRs as germline or somatic. We captured 94% of the well-characterized DMRs and detected 42 novel DMRs (16 gDMRs and 26 sDMRs). Of these novel DMRs, 40.5% show evidence of conservation. We also detected seven blocks of PofO methylation bias at seven imprinted clusters with mutual exclusive allelic H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 histone marks. Collectively, our results extend the set of known imprinted intervals in humans and demonstrate a major contribution in our ability to characterize imprinting by ASM, brought about by the capabilities of long-read nanopore sequencing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Detection of allelic methylation using nanopore sequencing.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Flowchart of the study representing all the analysis steps.

We observed high correlation across cell lines (r=0.75–0.93), as expected as they were the same cell type. NA12878 nanopore-called methylation also showed the highest correlation (r=0.89) with NA12878 WGBS, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To assess the use of nanopore long reads in detecting known DMRs, we identified previously reported DMRs, including 383 imprinted intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Court et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hernandez Mora et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zink et al., 2018</xref>). Of these 383, we classified 68 as ‘well-characterized’ as they were reported by at least two genome-wide mapping studies or were previously known to be imprinted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Subsequently, we haplotyped the methylome in each cell line, and performed differential methylation analysis (DMA) between alleles across cell lines; 95% (26.5M) of the human autosomal CpGs could be assigned to a haplotype. We detected 200 allelic DMRs (p-value &lt;0.001, |methylation difference|&gt;0.20, and detected in at least four cell lines in each haplotype) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Out of the 200 detected DMRs, 101 overlapped with 103 previously reported DMRs with consistent PofO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), while the remaining 99 were novel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Of the well-characterized DMRs, 64/68 (94%) were detected in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, we assessed methylation haplotyping and detection of imprinted DMRs within a single sample.

Among the well-characterized DMRs, ~73% (M ± SD = 49.5 ± 4.5) could be detected in a single cell line. An additional 33 DMRs (SD = 9.6) reported by only one previous study were detected in each cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Confirmation of novel imprinted DMRs</title><p>We detected 99 imprinted DMRs that did not overlap with previously reported imprinted DMRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Court et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hernandez Mora et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zink et al., 2018</xref>). In order to confirm these DMRs in human tissues and detect potential novel imprinted regions, we investigated WGBS datasets for partial methylation at nanopore-detected DMRs (Materials and methods). We used 60 WGBS datasets from 29 tissue types and 119 blood samples from 87 individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernstein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stunnenberg et al., 2016</xref>). We first examined the 68 well-characterized DMRs, 91% of them demonstrated partial methylation (more than 60% of the CpGs at the DMR having between 0.35 and 0.65 methylation) in at least one tissue and individual blood samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). As controls, we used 100 randomly selected 1, 2, 3 kb bins, and CpG islands (CGIs) in 100 resampling iterations. Of these, 0.65%, 0.74%, 2.28%, and 4.83% of the randomly selected 3, 2, 1 kb, and CGIs, respectively, demonstrated partial methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Applying this approach to the 99 previously unreported DMRs, the WGBS data supported 42 of the novel DMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In agreement with previous studies reporting a higher number of maternally methylated intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Court et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hernandez Mora et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>), 74% of the novel DMRs were maternally methylated. Overall, we detected 143 imprinted DMRs of which 101 were found to overlap with previously reported DMRs while 42 were novel DMRs detected by nanopore and confirmed using WGBS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Confirmation of nanopore-detected differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) and (<bold>b</bold>) Violin plots representing the average methylation of each DMR in WGBS tissue and blood samples.

regarded as consistent between individuals and resistant to environmental factors, there are examples of polymorphic imprinting where imprinted methylation is not consistently observed across individuals. In order to assess the inter-individual variation of the novel imprinted DMRs, we examined partial methylation in the 119 blood samples from 87 individuals. Some imprinted DMRs such as <italic>VTRNA2-1, IGF2</italic>, <italic>RB1</italic>, <italic>PARD6G</italic>, <italic>CHRNE</italic>, and <italic>IGF2R</italic> are known to be polymorphic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zink et al., 2018</xref>). The detected DMRs that mapped to these imprinted regions displayed partial methylation in 2–65% of the individuals in our analysis (M ± SD = 40% ± 22%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). <italic>ZNF331</italic> DMR is known to be consistently imprinted across individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zink et al., 2018</xref>). In our analysis, the DMR that mapped to <italic>ZNF331</italic> reported interval displayed partial methylation in 99% of the individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). We then examined inter-individual variation across the 42 novel DMRs. Imprinted methylation at all the novel DMRs demonstrated variation ranging from 1.2% to 73.5% of the individuals (M ± SD = 23.6% ± 19.2%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Among the novel DMRs, maternal sDMR near <italic>BTBD7P1</italic> is the most consistent with partial methylation in 73.5% of the individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). On the other hand, the novel paternal sDMRs within <italic>AC092296.3</italic> and <italic>UBAC2</italic> are the most variable with partial methylation in 1.2% of the individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Among the individuals, four displayed hypermethylation at several of the well-characterized and novel DMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), in line with a previous study that identified rare individuals with consistent hyper- or hypomethylation at dozens of imprinted loci, indicative of a generalized imprinting disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, a considerable number of imprinted DMRs detected in different studies are not overlapping between studies. Different studies used different samples and individuals, therefore, we examined inter-individual variation at DMRs detected in two or more studies (including the current work) and those that detected in one study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). The DMRs that detected in at least two studies demonstrated more consistency across individuals (M ± SD = 41.2% ± 33%) while DMRs detected in a single study showed more variability (M ± SD = 10.6% ± 15.4%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). These results suggest that polymorphic imprinting can explain this non-overlapping DMRs across studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Determination of germline versus somatic status of novel imprinted DMRs</title><p>We investigated the methylation status of the detected novel DMRs in sperm and oocyte to determine if they are germline or somatic imprinted intervals. Maternally methylated gDMRs must display high methylation in oocyte and very low or no methylation in sperm with partial methylated after fertilization. Paternally methylated gDMRs must show high methylation in sperm and very low or no methylation in oocyte with partial methylated after fertilization. For the novel DMRs, 16 were detected as germline (more than 70% methylation in oocyte and less than 20% in sperm and vice versa) from which 15 were maternally methylated and one was paternally methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Moreover, novel candidate gDMRs showed partial methylation in the blastocyst and fetal samples, indicating the gDMRs escaped de-methylation after fertilization. Meanwhile, sDMRs displayed partial methylation in fetal tissues, indicating their establishment during somatic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Overall, 16 of the novel DMRs were found to be germline while 26 were sDMRs.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Detection of novel germline and somatic differentially methylated regions (DMRs).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Heatmap displaying average methylation of the 42 nanopore-detected DMRs confirmed by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS).

Of these gDMRs, 89% had a <italic>ZFP57</italic> peak and 45% had a <italic>ZNF445</italic> peak. This highlights the importance of <italic>ZFP57</italic> as an important factor for the maintenance of imprinted methylation at gDMRs. 5′-TGC(5mC)GC-3′ is the canonical binding motif for <italic>ZFP57</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Quenneville et al., 2011</xref>). Eighty-eight percent of the gDMRs with a <italic>ZFP57</italic> peak had at least one 5′-TGCCGC-3′ motif, while 40% of the gDMRs without <italic>ZFP57</italic> peak had at least one 5′-TGCCGC-3′ motif in the human genome (GRCh38; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Moreover, at gDMRs the number of 5′-TGCCGC-3′ motifs demonstrated a significant positive correlation with the number of individuals demonstrating partial methylation (Pearson = 0.54, p-value = 3.6e−07; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). This suggests that a greater number of motifs provide more functional binding opportunities for <italic>ZFP57</italic> and also less likelihood that all <italic>ZFP57</italic> motifs could be perturbed through polymorphism or DNA sequence variation resulting in the imprinted methylation being less polymorphic.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Allelic H3K4me3 histone mark at detected DMRs</title><p>The H3K4me3 histone mark is protective against DNA methylation.

We used H3K4me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data for six LCLs and their heterozygous single-nucleotide variant (SNV) calls from 1KGP. Fifty of the DMRs mapped to reported intervals and 19 of the novel DMRs could be examined.

Therefore, at these intervals aggregated methylation from both alleles demonstrate partial methylation (~50% methylation) in WGBS data. However, in the subtle PofO bias blocks both alleles are methylated with a subtle hypomethylation on one of the alleles. Therefore, in contrast to imprinted intervals, aggregated methylation at these blocks usually do not show partial methylation in WGBS data. The weaker or subtle differential methylation can therefore explain why several novel DMRs detected in the nanopore data did not show partial methylation in the WGBS data and demonstrates the utility of nanopore sequencing in detecting subtle ASM differences.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Enriched allelic H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 histone marks at contiguous blocks</title><p>RNA polymerase II recruits SETD2 during elongation which results in the deposition of the H3K36me3 mark in the gene body.

Leveraging long reads and parental SNVs allowed us to phase methylation for ~26.5 million autosomal CpGs representing 95% of the CpGs in the human autosomal genome (GRCh38) across 12 LCLs. This effort achieves a much higher resolution than previous studies aimed at capturing allelic methylation using bisulfite sequencing or methylation arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Court et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hernandez Mora et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zink et al., 2018</xref>). Fourteen of our novel DMRs did not have any phased CpG from previous WGBS or array studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), illustrating the utility of longer reads for imprinted methylation calling. DMRs that are detected in only a single study displayed higher variations across individuals compared to those detected by at least two studies. Therefore, lack of phasing at some novel DMRs in previous studies and higher variation in imprinted methylation at novel DMRs could explain the reason they were not detected previously. We also demonstrated that germline DMRs with a greater number of <italic>ZFP57</italic> motif tend to be more consistently imprinted across individuals suggesting motifs redundancy increases <italic>ZFP57</italic> recruitment and tolerance to any DNA sequence variation. However, due to the availability of DNA sequence in a limited number of samples, we were not able to examine sequence variation at the DMRs and the <italic>ZFP57</italic>-binding motifs for any possible association with polymorphic imprinted methylation which will require further study.</p><p>Even though we detected methylation for all the CpGs in the human genome (GRCh38), we were not able to phase 5% of the human methylome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kent et al., 2002</xref>). We used SNVs detected from short-reads data in the 1KGP and GIAB databases for phasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zook et al., 2019</xref>). Seventy-five percent of the unphased CpGs mapped to the ENCODE blacklist, regions with low mappability, indicative of lack of SNVs to phase reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amemiya et al., 2019</xref>). Improvement in base calling and variant calling from nanopore reads could enable the phasing of a complete genome-wide methylome using nanopore-detected SNVs.</p><p>We detected 16 novel gDMRs and 26 novel sDMRs. These novel DMRs were supported by several lines of evidence in our analyses. (1) They displayed significant PofO methylation bias in nanopore-sequenced cell line samples. (2) They were partially methylated in WGBS data. (3) gDMRs demonstrated establishment of methylation in sperm or oocyte and escape from the second de-methylation step. (4) Eighty-four percent of those for which H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data could be phased and examined showed significant allelic H3K4me3. (5) Forty percent showed evidence of conservation. (6) Eighty-three percent mapped to at least one regulatory region including CGI, CTCF-binding site, and enhancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). These novel DMRs represent a substantial and well-confirmed expansion of known regions of imprinting, which may aid future research and diagnosis in the fields of genetic medicine and oncology.</p><p>We detected seven blocks of allelic methylation bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">6</xref>). All of the blocks represented several common features. (1) They were detected in imprinted genes that appeared in a cluster. (2) There was at least one well-characterized and conserved gDMR in each block (except <italic>ZNF597/NAA60</italic> block with a conserved sDMR). (3) The well-characterized DMRs in these blocks displayed significant allelic H3K4me3 (except the DMR in the <italic>L3MBTL1</italic> block, which could not be examined due to the lack of an SNV). (4) The well-characterized DMRs in these blocks overlapped with the promoters of genes with subtle PofO methylation bias at the gene body and DMR itself displayed opposite PofO methylation (except for <italic>GPR1-AS/ZDBF2</italic> block where DMR did not map to the promoter and had the same PofO with the gene body). (5) All the blocks were accompanied by a strong allelic expression and H3K36me3 histone mark on the subtle hypermethylated allele and H3K27me3 on the hypomethylated allele. This represents a novel facet of imprinting biology and suggests a link between allelic expression and histone modifications with biased PofO methylation at these blocks. However, the mechanism regulating such blocks and the rule of these PofO-biased methylation remain to be determined. One possible explanation could be that the subtle parental methylation bias is used by cells to express important genes (genes that can regulate other genes in the cluster or have regulatory roles) in an imprinted cluster with higher fidelity through its gene body methylation on the active allele. For example, at the <italic>KCNQ1OT1</italic> and <italic>GNAS/GNAS-AS1</italic> clusters, the methylation blocks overlap with <italic>KCNQ1OT1</italic> and <italic>GNAS-AS1</italic> gene bodies, both of which encode antisense RNA transcripts that regulate other genes in the imprinted cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiesa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Turan and Bastepe, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Orthologous regions of ~40% of the detected DMRs demonstrated partial methylation in one or more of the three mammals including chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, and mouse, suggesting their conservation.

Thus, these imprinted DMRs could be of potential clinical value.</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned novel DMRs, two of the reported DMRs in <italic>PTCHD3</italic> and <italic>FANCC</italic> are also interesting. Paternal expression of <italic>PTCHD3</italic> and maternal expression for <italic>FANCC</italic> were previously detected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zink et al., 2018</xref>, though they could not detect any associated DMR due to the lack of phased CpG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zink et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hernandez Mora et al., 2018</xref>, detected three maternally methylated probes at the promoter of <italic>PTCHD3</italic> and one maternally methylated probe in intron 1 of <italic>FANCC</italic>, but were unable to examine the parental expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hernandez Mora et al., 2018</xref>). We also detected two maternally methylated gDMRs overlapping with the promoter of <italic>PCTHD3</italic> and intron 1 of <italic>FANCC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig2">Appendix 3—figure 2</xref>). Therefore, these gDMRs could be the ICRs for these genes. The maternal gDMR at the <italic>PTCHD3</italic> promoter can directly suppress the maternal allele and results in paternal expression. <italic>FANCC</italic> gDMR overlaps with a CGI and CTCF-binding site. CTCF is a methylation-sensitive DNA-binding protein and CpG methylation can inhibit CTCF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hashimoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Renda et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, CTCF binding to the first intron of major immediate early (MIE) gene of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in HCMV-infected cells resulted in repression of this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Puerta et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the maternally methylated DMR in intron 1 of maternally expressed <italic>FANCC</italic> suggests a mechanism through which the paternal allele is suppressed by CTCF binding at DMR while DNA methylation inhibits CTCF binding at the maternal allele.</p><p>Overall, our study demonstrates a near-complete genome-wide map of human ASM by leveraging long-read nanopore technology. The use of nanopore technology allowed us to expand the set of known imprinted DMRs using 12 LCLs with parental SNPs. Moreover, we detected seven large PofO bias methylation blocks with enriched allelic expression and histone modifications.

To avoid the confounding effects of X-chromosome inactivation, and because previous studies demonstrated no evidence of imprinting at sex chromosomes, we only examined autosomal chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Court et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zink et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>WGBS data and detection of novel DMRs</title><p>To confirm allelic methylation in other tissues and also detect potential novel imprinted DMRs, we used 60 public WGBS data records for 29 tissue type samples from the Epigenomics Roadmap and ENCODE projects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>) and 119 blood WGBS datasets for 87 individuals from the Blueprint project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernstein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stunnenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>). CpGs with at least five mapped reads were used for further analysis. At imprinted DMRs, only one allele is methylated and we expect to observe partial methylation (~50%) at such regions. Therefore, we investigated the partial methylation of nanopore-detected DMRs in WGBS data (code is available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/vahidAK/NanoMethPhase/tree/master/scripts">https://github.com/vahidAK/NanoMethPhase/tree/master/scripts</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akbari, 2022</xref>): PartialMethylation_AtDMR.sh).

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Genome-Wide Detection of Imprinted Differentially Methylated Regions Using Nanopore Sequencing&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor, with a fair bit of internal discussion among all reviewing parties. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gavin Kelsey (Reviewer #1).</p><p>We appreciate that you have put a lot of effort into an important long-standing question and of specific interest here is the application of a newer technology, nanopore sequencing, to that problem. The reviewers agree that your study provides a new perspective with good quality data (exceptions where noted). However, while the report confirms the power of long-read sequencing technology, there is also a general sense that the current manuscript is lacking in biological novelty and the new DMRs would benefit from further investigation. One reviewer suggested examining the DMRs in relation to the possibility of polymorphic imprinting. Alternatively, if the technical advantage including costs / ease of use could be strengthened per comment of another reviewer. As the manuscript stands currently, neither of these two potential selling points are fully utilized. Thus, we cannot offer to publish your manuscript as it stands. We hope that you and your colleagues will benefit from the excellent comments of the reviewers appended to this letter for resubmission elsewhere, or if substantial progress can be made with new experiments, we could potentially reconsider your manuscript with the above comments in mind.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The study builds upon a recent report from the authors on the application of long-read nanopore sequencing to the detection of parent-of-origin (PofO) allelic methylation in the human genome (Akbari et al. 2021), with the potential for identification of potentially novel imprinted genes. Nanopore sequencing has previously been shown to be effective in imprinted DMR identification in hybrid mouse crosses (e.g., Gigante et al. 2019). Long-read sequencing has the potential to provide for methylation calls at CpGs to be phased over extended distances with genetic haplotypes and PofO if parent-offspring trios or pedigrees are available. Here, the authors use as discovery datasets 12 LCLs from the 1K Genomes Project and other projects. Candidate PofO DMRs are then parsed through various filters, including methylation level in conventional short-read whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) datasets from human gametes, preimplantation embryos as well as somatic tissues, in accordance with the predicted properties of germline DMRs and somatic (or secondary) DMRs. In addition, DMR predictions are compared with well-characterised germline or somatic DMRs (as a test of sensitivity), as well as predictions from a number of other studies that have deployed WGBS or array-based assays of various informative samples (Court et al. 2014, Joshi et al. 2016, Hernandez Mora et al. 2018; Zink et al. 2018). Finally, the authors seek conservation of DMR status in chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, and mouse. This experimental design and implementation look well thought-out and robust.</p><p>There have, of course, been numerous attempts to derive a comprehensive list of imprinted loci in the human genome over the last couple of decades. The recent large-scale WGoxBS study of the Icelandic population (Zink et al. 2018) also applied nanopore sequencing, but only in a limited capacity to validate DMRs identified from WGoxBS rather than as a discovery tool as in the current study. As well as demonstrating the power of nanopore sequencing, I think it is important that the current study shows something new, either in relation to undiscovered imprinted loci with potential importance in human development, physiology or disease, or new concepts in imprinting regulation. With some limited further analysis, this level of novelty could be achieved.</p><p>The authors report the detection of 76 allelic DMRs not overlapping with previously reported DMRs, of which 28 were determined to be high confidence novel DMRs based on methylation status in the WGBS datasets interrogated. They were able to assign 12 as gDMRs, all but one maternally methylated consistent with the predominance of oocyte methylation of gDMRs. One of the criteria for gDMR status is that the DMR should have &quot;more than 40% methylation in oocyte and less than 20% in sperm and vice versa with methylation difference &gt; 0.25 (lines 188-189)&quot;. A threshold of only 40% methylation in one gamete looks rather low for gDMR status. What does 40% methylation mean in molecular terms: that in a population of oocytes there are fully methylated and fully unmethylated alleles; or is there mosaic methylation across the gDMR? From inspection of the heatmap in Figure 3, it seems that very few novel 'gDMRs' have such low methylation in oocytes, so it would be valid to increase the minimum level of methylation required in oocytes to &gt;70%, which would better meet with accepted norms within the imprinting community.</p><p>A key determinant of a gDMR is binding of ZFP57 and/or ZNF455 (e.g., Takahashi et al. Genes Dev. 2019 PMID: 30602440), which ensure methylation maintenance especially during methylation reprogramming in preimplantation embryos. The binding motif for ZFP57 at least is known, so the authors should be able to determine whether this motif is present within their candidate gDMRs.</p><p>What is striking from the screenshots of many of the novel DMRs (Figure 5 and Suppl. Figures S2, S4, S5, S12, S13, S14, S16) is that they appear to be 'polymorphic', i.e., PofO differential methylation is present in some but not all of the 12 LCLs. I think this needs to be explored in some greater depth. Polymorphic imprinting has been discussed almost since the discovery of imprinting (as in the WT1 locus), but still remains poorly characterised and understood. Recent examples include VTRNA2 (Zink et al. 2018, as well as Silver et al. Genome Biol. 2015 PMID: 26062908). Does the inter-individual variation reflect variation in sequences required for gametic methylation maintenance? For example, is there variation within sequence motifs for ZFP57 binding (if present within the DMR)? This information should be available to the authors. An alternative possibility is that it could reflect variation in establishment of the methylation state in one or other gamete; this cannot be directly addressed but might be a useful speculation to add.</p><p>The identification of extended regions of PofO methylation bias in some known imprinted domains (the authors observe this at seven loci) is important and interesting, and extends findings of Zink et al. on the chromosome 15 PWS/AS domain. The authors point to cases in which there is maternal methylation of a promoter-associated gDMR and paternal methylation bias over the expressed gene body. It is possible to offer mechanistic explanation for this, which the authors attempt, speculating that (lines 315-318): &quot;the subtle parental methylation bias is used by cells to express important genes (genes which can regulate other genes in the cluster or have regulatory roles) in an imprinted cluster with higher fidelity through its gene body methylation on active allele.&quot; But the authors should consider other explanations for which precedents exist. Thus, the effect may relate to the presence of allelic histone modification bias over the gene body, given that some histone modifications will tend to occupy mutually exclusive locations to DNA methylation; e.g., the transcribed allele is likely to be enriched in H3K36me3 (which attracts de novo DNA methylation), while the non-expressed allele may be enriched in the mutually exclusive modification H3K27me3. For example, at the Kcnq1ot1 and Airn/Igf2r imprinted domains in mouse placental trophoblast, allelic H3K27me3 can span several Megabases (Schertzer et al. Mol Cell 2019 PMID: 31256989; Hanna et al. Genome Biol. 2019 PMID: 31665063; Andergassen et al. PLoS Genet. 2019 PMID: 31329595). There may be ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets that could be informative here.

It also provides new evolutionary insight into the conservation of DMRs, as it compares data between different mammalian species. As the study discriminates between germline as well as somatic imprints, it therefore provides useful data for the imprinting community to study questions between primary and secondary imprinting marks within imprinted gene clusters. Overall, the study is a comprehensive imprinting resource and Nanopore technical paper, even if it does not seem to provide major conceptual advances over previous studies. The study appears generally well performed and the conclusions are backed up by the data, except in the Discussion section (see below), which could be streamlined and shortened to focus on the main conclusions from this paper.

Their analysis replicates a large number of imprinted genes and DMRs (96/172) identified by short-read sequencing of bisulfite-converted genomic DNA, but also identifies 76 of novel DMRs and genes in LCLs missed in prior studies. Conversely, a large number (283) of imprinted DMRs missed some of statistical cutoffs in the nanopore sequencing data, although &gt;90% of well-characterized loci do meet these cutoffs. The authors then distinguish somatic from germline imprints found in published gametic and blastocyst DNA methylation datasets, and query corresponding non-human primate and rodent datasets to assess the evolutionary conservation of their novel imprints. Finally, they demonstrate concordant allelic representation of H3K4me3 and mRNA-seq reads of their imprinted genes.</p><p>Among the strengths of this study are the comparative analyses to imprinting catalogues from other datasets, and the integration of allelic chromatin marks and gene expression with their DNA methylation analysis.</p><p>One drawback of the study in its present form is that it does not address why a relatively large number of imprinted DMRs were not replicated across studies. Cursory analysis of supplementary tables suggests that many of the prior DMRs missed in the nanopore data do demonstrate expected parent-of-origin bias in DNA methylation, but were not picked up in multiple samples likely due to the chosen cutoffs (-/+ 25% methylation difference in at least 4 samples and p &lt; 0.001). As there is no explanation for the chosen nanopore vs. oxBS-seq cutoffs, the reader is left with the impression that the concordance with prior studies is lower than it really is. Conversely, many of the novel DMRs fall near known imprinted DMRs. Among the possible explanations for the large fraction (44%) novel DMRs and missed known DMRs, the authors focus on technical differences, but only briefly mention that some DMRs are cell-type-specific, which may explain why DMRs identified in LCLs may not match DMRs identified in peripheral blood monocytes better, or miss arbitrary statistical cutoffs. One way to address this issue would be to use more sophisticated methods to combine p-values across studies to quantify concordance of imprinted DMRs without applying arbitrary &quot;hard&quot; cutoffs (that don't match between nanopore and oxBS-seq anyway). This is a relatively major point, because while truly novel imprinted DMRs that can only be identified by nanopore are relatively rare, the take-home message of this study could be that while there is very good concordance across methods and most novel (possibly cell-type specific) DMRs fall near known DMRs, there are additional benefits to DNA methylation profiling by nanopore-sequencing.</p><p>A second limitation is that the study attributes these differences to long vs. short read technologies without assessing concordance between nanopore and another long-read technology. Because many of the HPRC samples include Pacbio data, one possible way to address this would be to include imprinted DMR analysis in the corresponding Pacbio samples in HPRC.</p><p>Overall, the study clearly demonstrates that nanopore-sequencing performs well in profiling DNA methylation, and can identify novel yet conserved imprints, but doesn't highlight its strengths (long-range, single-molecule phased DNA methylation patterns) or its possible weaknesses (single-nucleotide resolution).</p><p>I think the authors should consider not applying hard cutoffs in their analysis and instead combine p-values or use rank-based metrics to assess concordance/novelty as suggested above. The concordance appears better than described by the authors, and in general, I feel the authors don't need to draw as many distinctions to the prior work to &quot;sell&quot; the reader on nanopore sequencing.</p><p>There are other benefits they could use to draw these points of distinction however, for example by looking at concordance of methylation patterns across single nanopore molecules, or including Pacbio reads and presenting a more informative cost/benefit analysis to guide readers in choosing DNA methylation profiling approaches (oxBS-seq, nanopore, Pacbio). See: &quot;a cheap and easy way to call ICRs&quot;.</p><p>Apart from the important cutoff-agnostic analysis, and possibly including Pacbio samples, the manuscript could be improved mainly in tone and attention to detail. I noticed some sentence structure errors, but more importantly felt some sentences served to unnecessarily &quot;sell&quot; this study, either by sounding too critical with prior studies or or providing little support, e.g. &quot;cheap and easy&quot; above, or &quot;individuals more representative of the human population&quot; (with only 12 samples). The authors could also re-assess the first sentence of their discussion, and should maybe cite: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33230324/</p><p>I think these could be improved without taking anything away from what is an interesting and informative study in its own right. <italic>eLife</italic> would be a good fit for this study, which could be accepted with relatively minor revisions and only limited added analysis.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Genome-Wide Detection of Imprinted Differentially Methylated Regions Using Nanopore Sequencing&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Inclusion of processed data tracks is obligatory for GEO submissions, and recreating these data tracks from the raw data places an undue burden on labs wishing to query these data for their loci of interest.

Therefore, rephrase to something like: &quot;Although imprinted methylation is generally regarded is consistent between individuals and resistant to environmental factors, there are examples of polymorphic imprinting…….&quot;</p><p>&quot;Determination of Germline versus Somatic Status of Novel Imprinted DMRs&quot;</p><p>This section now includes the analysis of ZFP57/ZNF445 binding data – published ChIP-seq datasets from hESCs and HEK293 cells. Interestingly, 44% of the novel gDMRs have binding for one or both of these proteins in these cells, compared with 49% of characterised gDMRs. A difference in binding by these factors does not therefore appear to relate to the high incidence of polymorphic imprinting amongst novel DMRs, but the possibility that there is sequence variation in the ZFP57 binding sites between the sequenced samples has not been addressed.</p><p>It is also welcomed that the authors apply the more stringent thresholds for gDMR classification in this section.</p><p>&quot;Enriched Allelic H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 Histone Marks at Contiguous Blocks&quot;</p><p>It is interesting to see the differential allelic enrichment for these two histone modifications across the seven extended domains that display biased parent-of-origin DNA methylation.

Nanopore sequencing has previously been shown to be effective in imprinted DMR identification in hybrid mouse crosses (e.g., Gigante et al. 2019). Long-read sequencing has the potential to provide for methylation calls at CpGs to be phased over extended distances with genetic haplotypes and PofO if parent-offspring trios or pedigrees are available. Here, the authors use as discovery datasets 12 LCLs from the 1K Genomes Project and other projects. Candidate PofO DMRs are then parsed through various filters, including methylation level in conventional short-read whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) datasets from human gametes, preimplantation embryos as well as somatic tissues, in accordance with the predicted properties of germline DMRs and somatic (or secondary) DMRs. In addition, DMR predictions are compared with well-characterised germline or somatic DMRs (as a test of sensitivity), as well as predictions from a number of other studies that have deployed WGBS or array-based assays of various informative samples (Court et al. 2014, Joshi et al. 2016, Hernandez Mora et al. 2018; Zink et al. 2018). Finally, the authors seek conservation of DMR status in chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, and mouse.

It also provides new evolutionary insight into the conservation of DMRs, as it compares data between different mammalian species. As the study discriminates between germline as well as somatic imprints, it therefore provides useful data for the imprinting community to study questions between primary and secondary imprinting marks within imprinted gene clusters. Overall, the study is a comprehensive imprinting resource and Nanopore technical paper, even if it does not seem to provide major conceptual advances over previous studies. The study appears generally well performed and the conclusions are backed up by the data, except in the Discussion section (see below), which could be streamlined and shortened to focus on the main conclusions from this paper.

Their analysis replicates a large number of imprinted genes and DMRs (96/172) identified by short-read sequencing of bisulfite-converted genomic DNA, but also identifies 76 of novel DMRs and genes in LCLs missed in prior studies. Conversely, a large number (283) of imprinted DMRs missed some of statistical cutoffs in the nanopore sequencing data, although &gt;90% of well-characterized loci do meet these cutoffs. The authors then distinguish somatic from germline imprints found in published gametic and blastocyst DNA methylation datasets, and query corresponding non-human primate and rodent datasets to assess the evolutionary conservation of their novel imprints. Finally, they demonstrate concordant allelic representation of H3K4me3 and mRNA-seq reads of their imprinted genes.</p><p>Among the strengths of this study are the comparative analyses to imprinting catalogues from other datasets, and the integration of allelic chromatin marks and gene expression with their DNA methylation analysis.</p><p>One drawback of the study in its present form is that it does not address why a relatively large number of imprinted DMRs were not replicated across studies. Cursory analysis of supplementary tables suggests that many of the prior DMRs missed in the nanopore data do demonstrate expected parent-of-origin bias in DNA methylation, but were not picked up in multiple samples likely due to the chosen cutoffs (-/+ 25% methylation difference in at least 4 samples and p &lt; 0.001). As there is no explanation for the chosen nanopore vs. oxBS-seq cutoffs, the reader is left with the impression that the concordance with prior studies is lower than it really is. Conversely, many of the novel DMRs fall near known imprinted DMRs. Among the possible explanations for the large fraction (44%) novel DMRs and missed known DMRs, the authors focus on technical differences, but only briefly mention that some DMRs are cell-type-specific, which may explain why DMRs identified in LCLs may not match DMRs identified in peripheral blood monocytes better, or miss arbitrary statistical cutoffs. One way to address this issue would be to use more sophisticated methods to combine p-values across studies to quantify concordance of imprinted DMRs without applying arbitrary &quot;hard&quot; cutoffs (that don't match between nanopore and oxBS-seq anyway). This is a relatively major point, because while truly novel imprinted DMRs that can only be identified by nanopore are relatively rare, the take-home message of this study could be that while there is very good concordance across methods and most novel (possibly cell-type specific) DMRs fall near known DMRs, there are additional benefits to DNA methylation profiling by nanopore-sequencing.</p><p>A second limitation is that the study attributes these differences to long vs. short read technologies without assessing concordance between nanopore and another long-read technology. Because many of the HPRC samples include Pacbio data, one possible way to address this would be to include imprinted DMR analysis in the corresponding Pacbio samples in HPRC.</p><p>Overall, the study clearly demonstrates that nanopore-sequencing performs well in profiling DNA methylation, and can identify novel yet conserved imprints, but doesn't highlight its strengths (long-range, single-molecule phased DNA methylation patterns) or its possible weaknesses (single-nucleotide resolution).</p><p>I think the authors should consider not applying hard cutoffs in their analysis and instead combine p-values or use rank-based metrics to assess concordance/novelty as suggested above. The concordance appears better than described by the authors, and in general, I feel the authors don't need to draw as many distinctions to the prior work to &quot;sell&quot; the reader on nanopore sequencing.</p><p>There are other benefits they could use to draw these points of distinction however, for example by looking at concordance of methylation patterns across single nanopore molecules, or including Pacbio reads and presenting a more informative cost/benefit analysis to guide readers in choosing DNA methylation profiling approaches (oxBS-seq, nanopore, Pacbio). See: &quot;a cheap and easy way to call ICRs&quot;.</p><p>Apart from the important cutoff-agnostic analysis, and possibly including Pacbio samples, the manuscript could be improved mainly in tone and attention to detail. I noticed some sentence structure errors, but more importantly felt some sentences served to unnecessarily &quot;sell&quot; this study, either by sounding too critical with prior studies or or providing little support, e.g. &quot;cheap and easy&quot; above, or &quot;individuals more representative of the human population&quot; (with only 12 samples). The authors could also re-assess the first sentence of their discussion, and should maybe cite: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33230324/</p></disp-quote><p>We have used more relaxed cut-off for the detection of the DMRs (0.20 as methylation difference cut-off instead of 0.25). This resulted in including 27 more DMRs of which 4 mapped to reported intervals. Because imprinted methylation is variable across individuals and also tissues, DMRs which reported by multiple studies are more likely to be consistent across individuals while other DMRs are likely to be more variable. We have included 119 WGBS datasets from 87 individuals and assessed polymorphic imprinting. As demonstrated in figure 1C, considerable number of imprinted DMRs detected in different studies are not overlapping between studies. Our analysis suggest polymorphic imprinting can explain this non-overlapping DMRs. The DMRs that detected by at least two studies demonstrated more consistency across individuals with average DMR frequency of 41.2% (SD = 33%) while DMRs detected in a single study showed more variability (M ± SD = 10.6% ± 15.4%) (Supplementary Table 5).</p><p>In the white paper published by PacBio technology, a 250x coverage per-strand is needed for PacBio to detect methylation reliably <sup>3</sup>. Therefore, in a mammalian size genome this technology is prohibitively expensive. Moreover, in the current study our goal is to detect imprinted methylation genome-wide using nanopore long-reads that we and others previously showed could detect allelic methylation at even shallow coverage <sup>4,5</sup>. We do not necessarily want to promote nanopore sequencing but our results indicate that nanopore sequencing represents a modality suitable for this task. We have tried to present a comparison with previous studies that we think can be useful for the readers and the community. However, we have modified sentences that might imply we are trying to overly promote nanopore sequencing.</p><p>Regarding the “randomly selected regions” We have modified the analysis and also included 100 random resampling. This has improved the confirmation of DMRs and the accuracy of the approach. The detailed analysis is provided in the “Confirmation of Novel Imprinted DMRs” section in the manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the &quot;cheap and easy&quot;, Nanopore can phase significantly higher number of CpGs in a single sample compare to short-read. Therefore, in cases where we need large cohort of samples to achieve higher resolution of phased CpGs using short-reads, by using nanopore we can achieve this with mush smaller cohort size. By &quot;cheap and easy&quot; we meant that it will help to reduce the cost by reducing the sample size. However, we have modified the respective sentences in the last paragraph of the Discussion section to not be misleading.</p><p>“We also showed that nanopore sequencing has the ability to achieve a higher resolution of phased CpGs using a small sample size and allows for the calling of imprinted methylation in a single sample, potentially reducing the cost by reducing the sample size.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think these could be improved without taking anything away from what is an interesting and informative study in its own right. eLife would be a good fit for this study, which could be accepted with relatively minor revisions and only limited added analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this endorsement.</p><p>References</p><p>Joshi, R.

Comment on the high incidence of polymorphic imprinting in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revisited these results and also the new results from <italic>ZFP57</italic> motif analysis (See the next comment/point) and commented in the first paragraph of the Discussion section:</p><p>“DMRs that are detected in only a single study displayed higher variations across individuals compared to those detected by at least two studies. Therefore, lack of phasing at some novel DMRs in previous studies and higher variation in imprinted methylation at novel DMRs could explain the reason they were not detected previously. We also demonstrated that germline DMRs with a greater number of <italic>ZFP57</italic> motif tend to be more consistently imprinted across individuals suggesting motifs redundancy increases <italic>ZFP57</italic> recruitment and tolerance to any DNA sequence variation. However, due to the availability of DNA sequence in a limited number of samples, we were not able to examine sequence variation at the DMRs and the <italic>ZFP57</italic> binding motifs for any possible association with polymorphic imprinted methylation which will require further study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Test for sequence variation in ZFP57 binding sites in polymorphically methylated gDMRs if sequence information is available for the LCLs and other informative samples for which DNA methylation data exist.</p></disp-quote><p>We analysed DMRs for presence of the <italic>ZFP57</italic> binding motif (TGCCGC) and observed a significant correlation between number of binding motifs and number of individuals with partial methylation in their whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data at germline DMRs. However, as sequence variation information was only available for the 12 cell lines and very few DMRs had DNA sequence variation in these cell lines at a <italic>ZFP57</italic> motif, we were not able to derive any association between gDMR sequence variation and polymorphic imprinted methylation:</p><p>“Using <italic>ZFP57</italic> and <italic>ZNF445</italic> ChIP-seq peak calling information from human embryonic stem cells and the HEK 293T cell line (Imbeault et al., 2017; Takahashi et al., 2019), 44% of the novel gDMRs and 49% of the reported gDMRs were bound by <italic>ZFP57</italic> and/or <italic>ZNF445</italic> (Figure 3C; Supplementary File 4). Of these gDMRs, 89% had a <italic>ZFP57</italic> peak and 45% had a <italic>ZNF445</italic> peak. This highlights the importance of <italic>ZFP57</italic> as an important factor for the maintenance of imprinted methylation at gDMRs. 5′-TGC(5mC)GC-3′ is the canonical binding motif for <italic>ZFP57</italic> (Quenneville et al., 2011). 88% of the gDMRs with a <italic>ZFP57</italic> peak had at least one 5′-TGCCGC3′ motif, while 40% of the gDMRs without <italic>ZFP57</italic> peak had at least one 5′-TGCCGC-3′ motif in the human genome (GRCh38; Supplementary File 4). Moreover, at gDMRs the number of 5′TGCCGC-3′ motifs demonstrated a significant positive correlation with the number of individuals demonstrating partial methylation (Pearson = 0.54, p-value = 3.6e−07; Appendix 1 – figure 1). This suggests that a greater number of motifs provides more functional binding opportunities for <italic>ZFP57</italic> and also less likelihood that all <italic>ZFP57</italic> motifs could be perturbed through polymorphism or DNA sequence variation resulting in the imprinted methylation being less polymorphic.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. More rigor is required in the analysis of allelic enrichment of H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 at domains of extended PofO DNA methylation bias compared with those imprinted regions that do not, and compute the allelic read scores and provide an appropriate summary plot.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed a binning-based binomial analysis of the allelic histone read counts to detect bins with significant allelic histone modifications at detected PofO methylated biased blocks and test blocks. We also included an appropriate plot to represent histone marks and the relation between H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 marks:</p><p>“To analyze allelic histone modifications and detect blocks of allelic histone marks at large blocks of PofO bias, we binned the genome into 10Kb intervals and performed a binomial test with Fisher’s combined p-value test to determine the significance of allelic read counts at 10Kb intervals with &gt;3 informative heterozygous SNVs (Having at least 5 mapped reads) within each block in each sample. A 10Kb bin considered as significant for allelic histone mark if it had an adjusted P value &lt;0.001 and if at least 70% of the SNVs within the 10Kb bin having ≥80% of the reads mapped to one allele. In total, 174 bins for H3K36me3 and 132 bins for H3K27me3 could be examined. Of these, 147 bins for H3K36me3 and 51 bins for H3K27me3 were significant. Thirty-eight bins were significant for both histone marks in the same sample.

H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 demonstrated mutual exclusive pattern and H3K36me3 appeared on the hypermethylated allele while H3K27me3 on the hypomethylated allele (Figure 8; Figure 8—figure supplement 1-6; Figure 9; Supplementary File 8).</p><p>To determine if allelic histone marks are unique to the PofO methylation-biased blocks, we examined allelic histone marks on several other imprinted clusters with strong ASE which did not display PofO bias methylation.

Eighty-three bins for H3K36me3 and 138 bins for H3K27me3 could be examined at the seven test blocks. Of these, only 5 bins for H3K36me3 and 7 bins for H3K27me3 were significant and none of the bins were significant for both histone marks (Figure 9—figure supplement 1-8; Supplementary File 9). These results suggest that the blocks of PofO methylation bias in the gene body of active alleles are mediated by transcription and histone marks at their gene bodies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More details on these points are given below, as well as minor points that need to be addressed also.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors addressed some (not all) of the concerns raised in the first round of review, often differently than suggested (which is acceptable).</p><p>The data availability however, is not acceptable in my view; given that the bioinformatic approach to DNA methylation phasing is computationally sophisticated and was published elsewhere already (Akbari, et al., 2021), it should be expected that the processed nanometh tracks (shown in Figure 3c, 6-8 and the extensive supplement) are made available via a data repository (e.g. GEO or Mendeley data). Inclusion of processed data tracks is obligatory for GEO submissions, and recreating these data tracks from the raw data places an undue burden on labs wishing to query these data for their loci of interest.

Some of the novel DMRs exhibited partial methylation consistent with imprinted status in as few as 1-2% of individuals, which could explain why they had not been detected in previous studies. The relevant analysis is performed well.</p><p>On the other hand, it is an omission that the authors do not comment on this high incidence of polymorphic imprinting in the discussion.

Although at this point, they are not able to provide much speculation for why these loci exhibit inter-individual variation, there are multiple implications of the finding.</p><p>Regarding the opening line of this section, &quot;Imprinted methylation can display variation across individuals due to environmental and genetic factors&quot;, I think this statement could be modified, as generally speaking imprinting (i.e., well-characterised imprints) is consistent between individuals and resistant to environmental factors (with procedures associated with assisted reproduction techniques possibly the most likely 'environment' to lead to instability of methylation at gDMRs). Therefore, rephrase to something like: &quot;Although imprinted methylation is generally regarded is consistent between individuals and resistant to environmental factors, there are examples of polymorphic imprinting…….&quot;</p><p>&quot;Determination of Germline versus Somatic Status of Novel Imprinted DMRs&quot;</p><p>This section now includes the analysis of ZFP57/ZNF445 binding data – published ChIP-seq datasets from hESCs and HEK293 cells. Interestingly, 44% of the novel gDMRs have binding for one or both of these proteins in these cells, compared with 49% of characterised gDMRs. A difference in binding by these factors does not therefore appear to relate to the high incidence of polymorphic imprinting amongst novel DMRs, but the possibility that there is sequence variation in the ZFP57 binding sites between the sequenced samples has not been addressed.</p><p>It is also welcomed that the authors apply the more stringent thresholds for gDMR classification in this section.</p><p>&quot;Enriched Allelic H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 Histone Marks at Contiguous Blocks&quot;</p><p>It is interesting to see the differential allelic enrichment for these two histone modifications across the seven extended domains that display biased parent-of-origin DNA methylation.
