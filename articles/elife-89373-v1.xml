germline-specific transcription factors and by testis-specific versions of core transcriptional machinery. This program includes the activation of genes on the heterochromatic <italic>Y</italic> chromosome, and reduced transcription from the <italic>X</italic> chromosome, but how expression from these sex chromosomes is regulated has not been defined. To resolve this, we profiled active chromatin features in the testes from wildtype and meiotic arrest mutants and integrate this with single-cell gene expression data from the Fly Cell Atlas. These data assign the timing of promoter activation for genes with germline-enriched expression throughout spermatogenesis, and general alterations of promoter regulation in germline cells. By profiling both active RNA polymerase II and histone modifications in isolated spermatocytes, we detail widespread patterns associated with regulation of the sex chromosomes. Our results demonstrate that the <italic>X</italic> chromosome is not enriched for silencing histone modifications, implying that sex chromosome inactivation does not occur in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline. Instead, a lack of dosage compensation in spermatocytes accounts for the reduced expression from this chromosome. Finally, profiling uncovers dramatic ubiquitinylation of histone H2A and lysine-16 acetylation of histone H4 across the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome in spermatocytes that may contribute to the activation of this heterochromatic chromosome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>germline development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HG010492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henikoff</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Henikoff</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henikoff</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chromatin profiling of <italic>Drosophila</italic> testes reveals activation of the transcriptional program of the germline, widespread changes in RNA polymerase progression, and the absence of chromosomal regulation across the <italic>X</italic> chromosome.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The germline in animals is responsible for producing the specialized gametes that transmit genetic information to the next generation, and gene expression in these cells is tightly controlled to ensure proper cell differentiation and genome stability. In many cases gene regulation is distinctive from that in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freiman, 2009</xref>). A dramatic example of this is the deployment of testis-specific variants of core transcriptional machinery in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline that are used to activate and regulate gene promoters during sperm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hiller et al., 2004</xref>). These variants enable the activation of testis-specific promoters, but the effects they have on transcription and chromatin are less characterized.</p><p>Gene regulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatogenesis also involves widespread changes on entire chromosomes. The sex chromosomes each have distinct chromosomal features which uniquely impact their expression in the germline: the single <italic>X</italic> chromosome of males is thought to be up-regulated in early germline cells, but then suffers a broad reduction in expression during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Witt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mahadevaraju et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome is largely heterochromatic and silenced in somatic cells but becomes highly active in spermatocytes, extruding long, diffuse loops of actively transcribing genes within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fingerhut et al., 2019</xref>). How these chromosome-wide changes are orchestrated remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we apply CUT&amp;Tag chromatin profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaya-Okur et al., 2019</xref>) on the adult testis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to characterize the chromatin features of the spermatogenic transcription program. By integrating chromatin profiles with published single-cell transcriptional data for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis, we track active chromatin features of germline-specific gene promoters, detailing their timing of activation. Further, we describe the enrichment of RNA polymerase II and select histone modifications across the sex chromosomes in isolated spermatocytes. These profiles show that the <italic>X</italic> chromosome does not accumulate repressive chromatin marks, supporting a model where reduced expression of this chromosome is due to a lack of chromosomal dosage compensation in this cell type. Surprisingly, we find that high levels of mono-ubiquitinylated histone H2A accumulate across the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome in spermatocytes, implicating this otherwise repressive histone modification in the modulation of heterochromatic regions in the male germline.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Profiling active promoters in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testes</title><p>To profile chromatin features of gene activity during spermatogenesis, we performed CUT&amp;Tag profiling for histone H3 lysine-4 dimethylation (H3K4me2), which marks active promoters and enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>). The adult testis contains all developmental stages of spermatogenesis, as cells in the germline continually proliferate and differentiate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">White-Cooper and Bausek, 2010</xref>). Germline stem cells at the apical tip of the testis asymmetrically divide to birth a gonialblast; these undergo four mitotic divisions and then complete one final S phase before entering an extended G2 phase as primary spermatocytes before meiosis and differentiation into sperm. The transcriptional program of pre-meiotic and post-meiotic stages has been detailed most extensively by single-cell RNA-seq profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Witt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Witt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mahadevaraju et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raz et al., 2023</xref>). To assess the developmental timing of active chromatin features, we profiled the H3K4me2 modification in wildtype adult testes and in two stage-arrest mutants. The germline of <italic>bag-of-marbles</italic> (<italic>bam</italic>) mutant males arrests in the spermatogonial stage, so their testes are full of early germline cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). The germline of <italic>always early</italic> (<italic>aly</italic>) mutants arrests in the early primary spermatocyte stage, thus enriching for this cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laktionov et al., 2018</xref>). Between these three genotypes, only wildtype testes contain late spermatocytes and post-meiotic stages. Thus, profiles of testes from these flies distinguishes when in development active chromatin features appear. We dissected testes from 1-day-old adult wildtype, <italic>bam</italic>, and <italic>aly</italic> males, sequenced three replicate libraries for each genotype, and mapped reads to a repeat-masked version of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> dm6 genome assembly (see Methods). To aid distinguishing germline from somatic cell-type chromatin features, we also profiled wing imaginal discs from larvae. Sequencing from replicates was pooled, providing 4.4–19.2M reads/genotype, and publicly available coverage tracks are posted <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/jamesanderson12358/analysis230508___UCSC_session_germline_MS">here</ext-link>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Profiling of the histone H3K4me2 modification in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of male germline stages in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

For example, the promoter for the germline stem cell marker <italic>nanos</italic> (<italic>nos</italic>) is marked with the H3K4me2 modification in <italic>bam</italic> testes, with less signal in <italic>aly</italic> or in wildtype testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, the promoter of the spermatocyte-expressed gene <italic>loopin-1</italic> lacks the H3K4me2 modification in <italic>bam</italic> testes but is heavily marked in <italic>aly</italic> and in wildtype testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similarly, the promoter of the meiotically expressed genes <italic>Mst36Fa</italic> and <italic>Mst36Fb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Cara et al., 2006</xref>) are marked with the H3K4me2 modification in wildtype testes where the later stages of spermatogenesis are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, no signal is present at the <italic>nos</italic>, <italic>loopin-1</italic>, <italic>Mst36Fa,</italic> or <italic>Mst36Fb</italic> genes in wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Finally, profiles for all three testes samples show the H3K4me2 mark at the promoters of the homeotic genes <italic>abdominal-A</italic> and <italic>Abdominal-B</italic> that are expressed in the somatic cells of the testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), since somatic cells are present in all three samples.</p><p>To visualize chromatin features across active promoters during spermatogenesis, we categorized genes by their timing and level of mRNA expression in the male germline in single-nucleus RNA-seq profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raz et al., 2023</xref>). We focused on five categories of genes with germline-enriched expression in germline stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b and c</xref>), including 845 genes that are predominantly expressed in spermatogonia, 1510 expressed in early spermatocytes, 1524 expressed in mid-spermatocytes, 2052 expressed in late spermatocytes, and 475 genes expressed in spermatids. We then displayed the summed H3K4me2 signal spanning –200 to +500 bp around each of the promoters for these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the whole testis, germline stages compose a small proportion of all cells, and so genes specifically expressed in these stages have low signal for both mRNA and the H3K4me2 modification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Nevertheless, the overall tendency is that promoters of genes expressed in spermatogonia are marked with the H3K4me2 modification in <italic>bam</italic> mutant testes, which are enriched for early stages compared to <italic>aly</italic> mutant and wildtype testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For example, the promoters of early germline markers <italic>nos</italic>, <italic>vasa</italic> (<italic>vas</italic>), and <italic>zero population growth</italic> (<italic>zpg</italic>) are each heavily marked with H3K4me2 in <italic>bam</italic> mutant samples, reflecting their activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Similarly, the promoters for many genes primarily expressed in early spermatocytes and mid-stage spermatocytes are often most heavily marked with H3K4me2 in bam mutant testes, implying that these genes first become active in spermatogonia and accumulate mRNA in spermatocyte stages. Finally, gene promoters for mRNA that accumulate in late spermatocytes and in differentiating spermatids are predominantly marked with the H3K4me2 modification in wildtype testes, as this is the only sample that contains these stages of spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This includes the activation of promoters for the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome-linked fertility factor genes (<italic>kl-2</italic>, <italic>kl-3</italic>, and <italic>kl-5</italic>) which are primarily expressed in late spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). However, the activation timing of these genes appears to differ, as the promoters of <italic>kl-2</italic> and <italic>kl-3</italic> accumulate the H3K4me2 modification earlier than does the <italic>kl-5</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The most dramatic instance of precocious activation of a <italic>Y</italic>-linked promoter is the <italic>FDY</italic> gene which becomes active in early spermatocytes, matching its early production of mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Changes in the histone H3K4me2 modification in germline-expressed genes.</title><p>H3K4me2 signal around gene promoters (–200 to +500 bp) with transcripts enriched in specific germline cell types.

First, active promoters with very low levels of H3K4me2 are most heavily marked in wildtype testes, regardless of when the genes are expressed. These might be active genes where the histone modification accumulates during the extended growth phase of spermatocytes. Additional examples are the <italic>kumgang</italic> (<italic>kmg</italic>) and <italic>cookie monster</italic> (<italic>comr</italic>) gene promoters which produce mRNA in mid-stage spermatocytes, but are most heavily marked with the H3K4me2 modification in wildtype testes. Second, some promoters acquire the H3K4me2 modification well before mRNA accumulates. A small number of genes are expressed in the post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis, including the ‘cup’ genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barreau et al., 2008</xref>). Many of these promoters are most heavily marked with the H3K4me2 modification in wildtype testes, but the promoter for <italic>ryder cup</italic> (<italic>r-cup</italic>) is already marked in <italic>aly</italic> mutant testes, implying that it is already active in pre-meiotic stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Third, as the arrest mutations used here delete most of this gene (<italic>bam</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bopp et al., 1993</xref>) or inactivate it (<italic>aly</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 1996</xref>), we cannot measure H3K4me2 modification at these promoters in their arrest genotypes. We note that as these stage-arrest mutations have pleiotropic effects on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barreau et al., 2008</xref>), some discrepancies between promoter marking in mutants and transcript accumulation in wildtype testes may be due to aberrant transcriptional regulation. Additionally, detection of some changes may be limited since we compare profiles of tissues with diverse cell types.</p><p>Notably, the importance of the H3K4me2 modification appears to diminish as spermatogenesis proceeds, as the average signal of this mark around promoters for germline-enriched genes in wildtype testes drops in the later stages of spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). While the promoters of early germline-expressed genes and somatically expressed genes have comparable levels of the H3K4me2 modification centered around their TSS, the promoters of late spermatocyte and spermatid genes display very little marking, and this low level extends into gene bodies. This suggests that the activities of H3K4-modifying enzymes are reduced in these later stages.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Profiling FACS-isolated primary spermatocytes</title><p>Germline cells undergo massive nuclear expansion and extensive transcriptional activation between mitotic spermatogonia and meiotic division, in part directed by germline-specific variants of general transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lim et al., 2012</xref>). To specifically profile chromatin features in spermatocytes, we used a spermatocyte-enriched GFP marker to isolate these cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The <italic>hephaestus</italic> (<italic>heph</italic>) gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that is broadly expressed, but in spermatocytes Heph binds the abundant nuclear transcripts from the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome fertility genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fingerhut et al., 2019</xref>). We performed FACS on 40 dissociated testes from males carrying a <italic>heph-GFP</italic> transgene, recording the forward scatter (FSC) and GFP signal of each event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). FACS profiles from <italic>heph-GFP</italic> samples display a large proportion of events with high GFP signal, which are absent in profiles of wildtype testes. These GFP-labeled spermatocytes have distinct sizes, consistent with the progressive growth of spermatocytes as they approach meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">White-Cooper et al., 2010</xref>): in a typical FACS experiment, ~5–10% of GFP-positive events have moderate GFP signal and moderate size (Gate 1), ~50% of events have very high GFP signal and moderate size (Gate 2), and ~5–10% have high GFP signal and large size (Gate 3).

However, the chromatin features of gene regulation in spermatogenesis have been less thoroughly characterized, in part because of the complexity of the tissue and limiting numbers of germline cells. We have addressed this by performing efficient CUT&amp;Tag chromatin profiling for both active and repressive chromatin marks in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis and in isolated spermatocytes. These profiles reveal several notable features of the epigenome in the differentiating germline. First, integration of chromatin marks with published gene expression data details a general correspondence between gene promoter activation and mRNA production as expected, but for a fraction of genes their promoters activate earlier than expected. Second, genes that are activated late in spermatogenesis tend to have very reduced active chromatin marks at their promoters. Third, while many active genes in somatic cells accumulate RNAPII near their gene starts, such accumulation is absent in spermatocytes. Fourth, integration of chromatin profiling for multiple chromatin marks and profiling of RNAPII demonstrate that the single <italic>X</italic> chromosome is neither dosage compensated nor globally inactivated in spermatocytes. Finally, histone H2A mono-ubiquitinylation appears to have a specialized role in modulating expression from the heterochromatic <italic>Y</italic> chromosome.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Quirks of gene expression in the male germline</title><p>The uniform distribution of RNAPII throughout active genes in male germline cells is strikingly different from the typical accumulation of RNAPII near promoters in somatic cells.

Thus, the uniformity of RNAPII across expressed genes in spermatocytes suggests that pausing does not occur, necessitating gene regulation solely by transcription factor and RNAPII recruitment. This may allow for a simpler promoter architecture, and indeed spermatogenic gene promoters are distinctively small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">White-Cooper et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively, RNAPII progression through gene bodies may be slow, altering the steady-state distribution of elongating polymerase. Further, either of these changes in RNAPII behavior would affect chromatin features of active genes. RNAPII binds enzymes that progressively methylate the lysine-4 residue of histone H3, and so active promoters in somatic cells are typically marked with both H3K4-dimethylation and -trimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>). A consequence of changing the rate of polymerase progression in spermatocytes would be reduced methylation of active promoters (which we observe is most severe in late spermatocyte and post-meiotic stages), and thereby reduced reliance of these marks for promoting transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The <italic>X</italic> chromosome is neither dosage-compensated nor inactivated in spermatocytes</title><p>While protein and lncRNA components of the somatic dosage compensation machinery are not produced in the male germline, transcriptional profiling described up-regulation of the single <italic>X</italic> chromosome in early germline stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mahadevaraju et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Witt et al., 2021</xref>).

The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes a homolog of this protein family, as well as many other ubiquitin ligases, some of which target the H2A histone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tasaki et al., 2005</xref>). We do not know which enzyme is responsible for the uH2A modification in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline, although some candidates have male sterile phenotypes when mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rathke et al., 2007</xref>). While it is surprising to find a histone modification conventionally associated with silencing enriched on an activated chromosome (and indeed the reason we profiled it was as a putative MSCI marker), the roles of uH2A in gene regulation are diverse even in somatic cells. The uH2A modification is associated with both silenced and some active genes in developing eye tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loubiere et al., 2020</xref>), and counters chromatin compaction in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonnet et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome, a number of heterochromatic transposons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline are also activated and accumulate the uH2A modification. Thus, it is conceivable that this modification – perhaps in combination with other marks – works generally to modulate transcription of extremely heterochromatic regions in spermatocytes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-H3-K4-dimethyl<break/>(rabbit monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Epicypher</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat.

Their main approaches include (1) Using two different genetic mutants that arrest male germ cell differentiation at distinct stages, bam and aly mutant, they performed CUT&amp;TAG using H3K4me2, a histone modification for active promoters and enhancers; (2) Using FACS sorted pure spermatocytes, they performed CUT&amp;TAG using antibodies against RNA PolII phosphorylated Ser 2, H4K16ac, H3K9me2, H3K27me3, and ubH2AK118. They also compare these chromatin profiling results with the published single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq data. Their analyses are across the genome but the major conclusions are about the chromatin features of the sex chromosomes. For example, the X chromosome is lack of dosage compensation as well as inactivation in spermatocytes, while Y chromosome is activated but enriched with ubH2A in spermatocytes. Overall, this work provides high quality epigenome data in testes and in purified germ cells.

The experiments and analyses were well done, by a combination of the latest and appropriate methods. They include appropriate numbers of replicates. Results were parsed by comparing them among wildtype and two mutant with different arrest stages in spermatogenesis, as well as in FACS-sorted spermatocytes. The authors profiled larval wing discs as reference-somatic cells, allowing focus on features associated with germ cells; comparisons to testis somatic cells provided further specificity. Results were further refined by categorizing genes of interest based on available single nucleus RNA seq expression profiles.

Their main approaches include (1) Using two different genetic mutants that arrest male germ cell differentiation at distinct stages, bam and aly mutant, they performed CUT&amp;TAG using H3K4me2, a histone modification for active promoters and enhancers; (2) Using FACS sorted pure spermatocytes, they performed CUT&amp;TAG using antibodies against RNA PolII phosphorylated Ser 2, H4K16ac, H3K9me2, H3K27me3, and ubH2AK118. They also compare these chromatin profiling results with the published single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq data. Their analyses are across the genome but the major conclusions are about the chromatin features of the sex chromosomes. For example, the X chromosome is lack of dosage compensation as well as inactivation in spermatocytes, while Y chromosome is activated but enriched with ubH2A in spermatocytes. Overall, this work provides high-quality epigenome data in testes and in purified germ cells. The analyses are very informative to understand and appreciate the dramatic chromatin structure change during spermatogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Some new analyses and a few new experiments are suggested here, which hopefully further take advantage of these data sets and make some results more conclusive.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. The step-wise accumulation of H3K4me2 in bam, aly and wt testes are interesting. Is it possible to analyse the cis-acting sequences of different groups of genes with distinct H3K4me2 features, in order to examine whether there is any shared motif(s), suggesting common trans-factors that potentially set up the chromatin state for activating gene expression in a sequential manner?</p></disp-quote><p>While the histone H3K4me2 mark is low and more widespread at genes active in late spermatocytes and in spermatids (shown in Figure 2C and some examples in Figure 1C-D), we suggest that this may be due to a general decrease in the importance of this modification in late spermatogenesis rather than a specific feature of those genes. We point this out in lines 146-152. This idea is supported by the widespread change in RNAPII distribution in all genes in the germline, shown in Figure 3F and supplementary Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Pg. 4, line 141-142: &quot;we cannot measure H3K4me2 modification at the bam promoter in bam mutant testes or at the aly promoter in aly mutant testes&quot;, what are the allelic features of the bam mutant and aly mutant? Are the molecular features of these mutations preventing the detection of H3K4me2 at the endogenous genes' promoters? Also, the references cited (Chen et al., 2011) and (Laktionov et al., 2018) are not the original research papers where these two mutants were characterized.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected these citations to the original papers. We clarified in the text that the bamΔ86 allele is a deletion of almost all of the coding sequence (reported in Bopp, D., Horabin, J.I., Lersch, R.A., Cline, T.W., Schedl, P. (1993). Expression of the Sex-lethal gene is controlled at multiple levels during <italic>Drosophila oogenesis</italic>. Development 118(3): 797--812.). The aly1 allele is also a P element-induced mutation; it is not molecularly characterized (it was first described here: Lin, T.Y., Viswanathan, S., Wood, C., Wilson, P.G., Wolf, N., Fuller, M.T. (1996). Coordinate developmental control of the meiotic cell cycle and spermatid differentiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> males. Development 122(4): 1331--1341.) We noticed a lack of reads for various histone modifications in aly mutants in part of the gene, suggesting that the deletion is limited to the promoter and the first exon. Signal for the H3K4me2 modification is at background levels for the distal portion of aly, suggesting that the deletion inactivates the gene.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The original paper that reported the Pc-GFP line and its localization is: Chromosoma 108, 83 (1999).</p></disp-quote><p>We now cite the first published description of this marker in the male germline and a more detailed one (lines 291-293).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Pc-GFP is ubiquitously expressed and almost present in all cell types. In Figure 6B, there is no Pc-GFP signals in bam and aly mutant cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize, our labeling of the figure was easily overlooked - the bam and aly genotypes do not carry the PcGFP marker, since we didn’t need it for staging the germline nuclei. We have clarified this in the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>According to the Method &quot;one testis was dissected&quot;, does it mean that only one testis was prepared for immunostaining and imaging? If so, definitely more samples should be used for a more confident conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected the text to make it clear that all cytological examinations were repeated at least 10 times (lines 438-439).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, why use 3rd instar larval testes instead of adult testes?</p></disp-quote><p>Generally, we find that immunostaining of the larval testes is cleaner, and we now mention this in the Methods (lines 439-440). We have immunostained both larval and adult testes for these markers with consistent results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, it is better to compare fixed tissue and live tissue, as the Pc-GFP signal could be lost during fixation and washing steps. Please refer to the above paper [Chromosoma 108, 83 (1999)] for Pc-GFP in spermatogonial cells and Development 138, 2441-2450 (2011) for Pc-GFP localization in aly mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We are using PcGFP staining for staging with antibody detection of other chromatin features, which requires fixed material, although we have compared PcGFP signal in both live and fixed tissue. We have added the 1999 reference for nuclear staging in the male germline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Ubiquitinylation of histone H2A is typically associated with gene silencing, here it has been hypothesized that ubH2A contributes to the activation of Y chromosome. This conclusion is strenuous, as it entirely depends on correlative results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a correlation. We cite in the text examples where uH2A is associated with gene activation. We have added a comment to clarify that this is a correlation (lines 318-320), and now present an alternative that uH2A on the Y chromosome may be moderating expression from these highly active genes (lines 405-407).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, the lack of co-localization of ubH2A immunostaining and Pc-GFP are not convincing evidence that ubH2A is not resulting from PRC1 dRing activity. It would be a lot stronger conclusion by using genetic tools to show this. For example, if dRing is knocked down (using RNAi driven by a late-stage germline driver such as bam-Gal4) or mutated in spermatocytes (using mitotic clonal analysis), would they detect changes of ubH2A levels?</p></disp-quote><p>We have tested multiple constructs to knockdown dRING using the bam-GAL4 driver although we have not reported it in the manuscript. These knockdowns have no effect on uH2A staining in the testis, on motile sperm production, or on male fertility, although these RNAi constructs do produce Polycomb phenotypes when expressed in somatic cells from an en-GAL4 driver. This is the reason why we point out in the text that there are multiple alternative candidates for an H2A ubiquitin ligase in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome and that in other species RING1 is not responsible for sex body uH2A in the male germline (lines 394-396).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Regarding &quot;X chromosome of males is thought to be upregulated in early germline cells&quot;, it has been shown that male-biased genes are deprived on the X chromosome [Science 299:697-700 (2003); Genome Biol 5:R40 (2004); Nature 450:238-241 (2007)], so are the differentiation genes of spermatogenesis [Cell Research 20:763-783 (2010)]. It would be informative to discuss the X chromatin features identified in this work with these previous findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We now mention that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> X chromosome is moderately depleted of male germline-expressed genes (lines 362-363).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, the lack of RNAPII on X chromosome in spermatocytes could be due to a few differentiation genes expressed in spermatocytes located on the X chromosome.</p></disp-quote><p>We show in Figure 3B that there is a minor non-significant reduction in RNAPII on the X chromosome in spermatocytes. This small reduction might be due to the moderate paucity of male germline-expressed genes on this chromosome, but since it is non-significant we have not discussed it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Anderson et al profiled chromatin features, including active chromatin marks, RNA polymerase II distribution, and histone modifications in the sex chromosomes of spermatogenic cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The results are new and the experiments and analyses look well done, including with appropriate numbers of replicates. Results were parsed by comparing them among two arrest mutants and wildtype, as well as in FACS-sorted spermatocytes. The authors also profiled larval wing discs to serve as reference-somatic cells, which allowed them to focus only on features in their testis data that were associated with germ cells. Their results were further refined by categorizing the genes of interest based on available single nucleus RNA seq expression profiles. The authors document interesting phenomena, such as differences in the distribution of RNAPIIS2p on some genes in germ cells vs somatic cells, the presence of a uH2A body beginning in early spermatocytes, and high levels of uH2A on the Y chromosome and little or none on the X. The former is intriguing because this modification is usually associated with silencing, yet the Y chromosome is active in spermatogenic cells. The authors interpret some of their data as implying a lack of dosage compensation of the X chromosome in spermatocytes.</p><p>The data are believable and new, but it is not fully clear how to interpret them. The paper's interpretations rely on subtractive logic to parse results from mixtures of cells down to cell type, extracting spermatogonia, spermatocyte, etc. features by comparing bam mutants (only spermatogonia) to aly mutants (spermatogonia and early spermatocytes but no later stages) to wildtype (all spermatogenic stages), and extracting testis germline data by comparison to wing disc soma; their FACS sorted spermatocytes also have heterogeneity. I recognize that the present paper was a lot of work and am not suggesting that the authors redo their study using methods that give more purity and precision of stage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aal3096">https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aal3096</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.335331.119">https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.335331.119</ext-link>), but they should be aware of them and of their results.</p></disp-quote><p>The pulse-release system that the reviewer points to is an interesting system, but more limited in material and in useable markers than the systems we used here. We have added to our discussion of the the limitations of subtractive comparisons between arrest genotypes, both in regards to using mutants that may alter gene expression programs, and to how subtractive comparisons may limit our detection of differences between cell types (lines 143-147).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conclusions about dosage compensation are indirect, but are consistent with the current model documented in the studies cited by the authors, as well as earlier studies (doi: 10.1186/jbiol30).</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree; our data directly speaks to the molecular mechanisms at play. Our profiling of the H4K16 acetylation mark and RNAPII in isolated spermatocytes (Figure 4) demonstrates that current models are correct, and so are useful for settling this point in the literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Throughout the manuscript, it is better to cite the original research papers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added citations for the original characterizations of bam and aly alleles used, for the descriptions of PCGFP in spermatocytes, and for issues raised by reviewer comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Pg.2, line 70-71: &quot;Germline stem cells at the apical tip of the testis asymmetrically divide to birth spermatogonia&quot;, should be gonialblast.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed (line 71).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Pg.2, line 71: &quot;four rapid mitotic divisions&quot;, the spermatogonial cell cycle lasts several hours-- &quot;rapid&quot; is subjective and relative, better to leave this word out.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed (line 71).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Other than the major issue raised in the public review this paper only needs a few minor modifications, listed by line number below. The first one would be considered essential by this reviewer.</p><p>27: In the sentence that ends on this line, please add the word testis after <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed (line 27).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>119: It must be known from the Fly Cell Atlas data whether these genes do begin to express in spermatogonia.</p></disp-quote><p>Collated expression values from the FCA are provided in Supplementary Table 2.

The increased signal we see in gene bodies could be due to slower RNAPII elongation, but we don’t see a way that changes in termination would produce this pattern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>369: This part of the paper seems overly speculative, given the many molecular differences between dosage compensation mechanisms of <italic>Drosophila</italic> vs mammals, and studies that indicate that MSCI does occur in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (DOI: 10.3390/genes12111796).</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree, and this is a central point in our manuscript. The paper referred to here does not directly assess MSCI in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, instead they argue that MSCI could be the force driving the evolutionary depletion of male-germline-expressed genes they describe. These and many studies in the literature have conflated the effects of a lack of X dosage compensation and of MSCI in the male germline. Our direct measurements of RNAPII in spermatocytes demonstrates that there is no dosage compensation nor is there MSCI. Further, profiling of histone modifications associated with Drosophila somatic dosage compensation (H4K16ac) or with mammalian MSCI (uH2A, H3K9me2) show that the molecular mechanisms found in these other settings are not in play in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline. As we have established these biological differences between mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it is appropriate to now speculate on why these differences may be, which we do on lines 374-384.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(several lines): Can the authors justify their assumption that chromatin features of larval wing disc cells will match those of somatic cells of adult testes?</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t only compare germline features to somatic cells of the wing disc, but also to genes with somatic expression in the testes annotated by FCA expression data (H3K4me2 in Figure 2C, RNAPII in Figure 3F). Note in Supplementary Figure 2 the distribution of RNAPII in whole testes (which includes somatic cells) is similar to that of larval wing discs, confirming that the differences we describe are specific to germline cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
