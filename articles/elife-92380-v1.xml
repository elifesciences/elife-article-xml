Extant methods, such as Flyception, are highly invasive. Whole-brain calcium imaging in head-fixed, walking flies is feasible but the animals cannot perform the consummatory phases of social behaviors like aggression or mating under these conditions. This has left open the fundamental question of whether neurons identified as functionally important for such behaviors using loss- or gain-of-function screens are actually active during the natural performance of such behaviors, and if so during which phase(s). Here, we perform brain-wide mapping of active cells expressing the Immediate Early Gene <italic>hr38</italic> using a high-sensitivity/low background fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) amplification method called HCR-3.0. Using double-labeling for hr38 mRNA and for GFP, we describe the activity of several classes of aggression-promoting neurons during courtship and aggression, including P1<sup>a</sup> cells, an intensively studied population of male-specific interneurons. Using HI-FISH in combination with optogenetic activation of aggression-promoting neurons (opto-HI-FISH), we identify candidate downstream functional targets of these cells in a brain-wide, unbiased manner. Finally, we compare the activity of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons during sequential performance of courtship and aggression, using intronic vs. exonic <italic>hr38</italic> probes to differentiate newly synthesized nuclear transcripts from cytoplasmic transcripts synthesized at an earlier time. These data provide evidence suggesting that different subsets of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons may be active during courtship vs. aggression. HI-FISH and associated methods may help to fill an important lacuna in the armamentarium of tools for neural circuit analysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>immediate early gene</kwd><kwd>Hr38</kwd><kwd>activity-dependent mapping</kwd><kwd>social behavior</kwd><kwd>hybridization chain reaction</kwd><kwd>HCR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA031389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>While monitoring neuronal activity in freely moving Drosophila is challenging, HI-FISH enables brain-wide mapping of active neurons and reveals behavior-specific neural activity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Monitoring neuronal activity during specific actions or activities is critical to understanding how the brain controls behavior. Measurements within a local brain region of neural activity in non-transparent awake, behaving animals such as mice or fruit flies can be achieved with electrophysiological and calcium imaging techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzsáki, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grewe and Helmchen, 2009</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, two-photon calcium imaging (TPI) has been widely used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seelig et al., 2010</xref>) because single-unit electrical recording in the fly central brain remains exceedingly difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Turner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>). But TPI in <italic>Drosophila</italic> requires head-fixation, which limits the repertoire of behaviors that flies can perform under these conditions. For example, it is difficult to use TPI to image neuronal activity during the consummatory phases of complex social behaviors, such as male–male aggression or male–female courtship (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clowney et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, a new method called Flyception2 was introduced for brain imaging in freely walking flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grover et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grover et al., 2016</xref>). However, the spatial resolution of this method is limited, it is invasive, and monitoring the activity of single neurons in freely moving animals is still challenging.</p><p>In mice, immediate early genes (IEGs) such as c-fos, Arc, or Egr1 have been used to map the activity of neurons by visualizing their expression histologically using immunohistochemistry (IHC) or in situ hybridization (ISH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morgan and Curran, 1991</xref>). More recently, this method has been combined with tissue-clearing and light-sheet microscopy to perform systematic and unbiased whole-brain mapping of neurons activated during different behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Renier et al., 2016</xref>). An extension of this approach, called <underline>c</underline>ellular compartment <underline>a</underline>nalysis of <underline>t</underline>emporal activity by <underline>f</underline>luorescence <underline>i</underline>n <underline>s</underline>itu <underline>h</underline>ybridization (catFISH), enables within-animal comparisons of neuronal populations activated during two different sequential behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guzowski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, by contrast, the application of IEGs to map whole-brain neuronal activation patterns has been limited. In part, this is because c-<italic>fos</italic> is not a particularly good activity marker in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). More recently, several studies using fly IEGs such as <italic>Hr38</italic> and <italic>stripe/Egr1</italic> have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takayanagi-Kiya et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Takayanagi-Kiya and Kiya, 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, this technique has been relatively under-utilitized in flies. This may be the case, at least in part, because application of FISH to the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain has been technically challenging, due to limited probe penetration and high background caused by traditional amplification methods such as Tyramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raap et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>To circumvent these problems, we have applied in this study an ISH amplification technique called the hybridization chain reaction (HCR), v.3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2018</xref>) to visualize the expression of <italic>Hr38</italic>, an IEG expressed by active neurons in the adult male fly brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujita et al., 2013</xref>). The design of HCR, which requires conjoint hybridization to target sequences of adjacent pairs of ‘half-probes’ to achieve amplification, affords both greater sensitivity and specificity, allowing detection of low-abundance transcripts with minimal background noise and off-target hybridization. We call this approach <underline>H</underline>CR3.0-amplified <underline>I</underline>EG <underline>F</underline>luorescent <underline>I</underline>n <underline>S</underline>itu <underline>H</underline>ybridization, or ‘HI-FISH’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

First, we have asked whether specific neuronal populations discovered in functional screens for aggression-promoting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Watanabe et al., 2017</xref>) are indeed active during natural aggressive behavior, courtship, or both. We have further investigated whether such activity is only observed during the contact-mediated consummatory phase of these behaviors, or can also be detected in freely moving flies in the absence of fighting or mating. Second, we have performed unbiased, whole-brain functional mapping of the downstream targets activated by optogenetic stimulation of a neuronal population of interest, a variant method we call ‘opto-HI-FISH’. We have applied this method to P1<sup>a</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clowney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>) a subset of the male-specific P1 class of interneurons originally identified based on their ability to trigger male courtship behavior when stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, we have developed a variant of the catFISH technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guzowski et al., 1999</xref>), using dual-color FISH combining intronic and exonic <italic>Hr38</italic> probes, to compare neuronal populations activated during two different sequential behaviors, a method we call ‘HI-catFISH’. Since experimental activation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons can promote both aggression and courtship in pairs of male flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>), we have used HI-catFISH to investigate whether separate or overlapping subpopulations of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons are active during natural occurrences of these two social behaviors. Together, the results of these studies illustrate the utility of HI-FISH, opto-HI-FISH, and HI-catFISH to detect the activation of both known and previously unidentified neurons during naturalistic social behaviors that are not amenable to head-fixation. The results have also yielded new biological insights into the neural circuit-level control of aggression and courtship.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Brain-wide expression of <italic>Hr38</italic> detected by HI-FISH</title><p>The HCR3.0 method provides greater sensitivity, specificity, and lower background than traditional FISH using Tyramide signal amplification. Application of older FISH methods in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult whole brain has been limited, due to low sensitivity and high background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilkie and Davis, 1998</xref>). For example, the detection by FISH of low-abundance transcripts such as those encoding G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been virtually impossible in adult flies up to now. Application of the HCR-FISH method, by contrast, was able to detect mRNA encoding an octopamine receptor Oct-TyrR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arakawa et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saudou et al., 1990</xref>), as well as Dh44, a high-abundance neuropeptide-encoding transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2018</xref>). Background in controls lacking the HCR initiator probes was essentially undetectable.</p><p>Next, we investigated the ability of HCR to detect brain-wide expression of <italic>Hr38</italic> following artificial (optogenetic) activation of fruitless-GAL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stockinger et al., 2005</xref>) neurons expressing the red-shifted opsin Chrimson::tdT. Fru-GAL4 labels ~2000 neurons in the adult male brain, providing a large number of potentially activatable cells. Following photostimulation, <italic>Hr38</italic> signals were detected in virtually all Chrimson::tdT<sup>+</sup> neurons as well as in other tdT<sup>−</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The latter may be indirectly activated via synaptic inputs from Fru-GAL4<sup>+</sup> neurons. Control flies of the same genotype but without photostimulation, or photostimulated flies with an ‘empty’ GAL4 driver (BDPG4uw; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</xref>) displayed much lower levels of <italic>Hr38</italic> expression.</p><p>While performing these experiments, we observed that simply transferring flies to a new arena induced a significant level of <italic>Hr38</italic> expression throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>), likely reflecting the stress caused by the manipulation and new environment. Based on this observation, we conducted subsequent experiments after flies were habituated to the testing arena before starting the assays (see Methods). This minor modification proved essential to distinguishing behavior-specific HI-FISH signals from the widespread <italic>Hr38</italic> induction caused by transfer of the flies from their home vial to an experimental apparatus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mapping of neurons activated by social behaviors</title><p>As an initial proof-of-concept application of HI-FISH, we asked whether neuronal subsets initially identified in functional screens for aggression-promoting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Watanabe et al., 2017</xref>) were actually active during natural aggressive behavior. These included P1<sup>a</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>), Tachykinin-FruM<sup>+</sup> (Tk<sup>FruM</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>), and aSP2 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Watanabe et al., 2017</xref>). Despite the fact that activity in these neuron subsets was shown to be essential for normal aggression, it was formally possible that the behavioral phenotypes caused by their artificial stimulation were due to their supra-physiological activation. Therefore, we performed HI-FISH on fly lines carrying a myr::GFP reporter in the cell populations of interest in males paired with different types of target flies under different conditions. Thirty to 45 min after a 20-min interaction with the target fly, we fixed the brains and performed double-label HI-FISH together with fluorescent antibody staining of myr::GFP-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; see Methods).</p><p>In the control condition, where the experimental flies were kept alone during the observation period, there was little or no detectable <italic>Hr38</italic> expression in P1<sup>a</sup>, Tk, or aSP2 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>, ‘Control’). In contrast, we observed clear <italic>Hr38</italic> signals in GFP<sup>+</sup> P1<sup>a</sup>, Tk, and aSP2 neurons after a male–male interaction that included fighting behavior (Aggression: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also observed P1<sup>a</sup>-negative Hr38<sup>+</sup> neurons neighboring P1<sup>a</sup> neurons during aggression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, P1<sup>a</sup> Hr38). These cells may correspond to other subpopulations of P1 neurons, or to Dsx-expressing pC1 neurons that have also been implicated in aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koganezawa et al., 2016</xref>). Note that images are single confocal sections provided for qualitative, illustrative purposes only and should not be interpreted quantitatively. Our conclusions are based on statistically analyzed quantitative data presented in bar and box plots. In the case of courtship with a female, comparably strong <italic>Hr38</italic> induction was observed in P1<sup>a</sup> and aSP2 neurons, while there was no <italic>Hr38</italic> expression in Tk neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; Courtship). These data are consistent with prior observations indicating that the functional manipulation of P1<sup>a</sup> or aSP2 neurons in the male flies affects both male–male aggression and male–female courtship behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Takayanagi-Kiya and Kiya, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Watanabe et al., 2017</xref>), while the manipulation of Tk neurons affects only aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Investigation of neurons activated by social behavior with Hr38 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hr38 expression in the neurons labeled with P1<sup>a</sup>-split GAL4, Tk-GAL4, and aSP2-GAL4 drivers. magenta: myr::GFP, yellow: Hr38 hybridization chain reaction (HCR) signals.

While electrophysiological recording or calcium imaging can identify neuronal activation that is time-locked to specific behavioral actions, the detection of <italic>Hr38</italic> (or any IEG) induction may reflect activation at any or all of these sequential phases due to the long-lived, accumulated expression of the IEG mRNA. To identify the phase(s) of social behavior wherein <italic>Hr38</italic> induction occurred, we separated the signals or interactions characteristic of these sequential phases in space rather than time. First, we asked whether the activation of these neurons during a male–male social interaction requires actual fighting behavior, or simply close contact with the target male. Initially, we paired the experimental male fly with a dead male, as a source of chemosensory cues. Because some male-derived cues (e.g., visual motion) may require a live conspecific, we also placed the experimental and tester males in an arena with an agarose substrate. Under these conditions, physical contact but not fighting occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lim et al., 2014</xref>). In both ‘touching but no fighting’ conditions, the fraction of Hr38<sup>+</sup> cells among P1<sup>a</sup>, Tk, and aSP2 neurons was slightly lower but not statistically significantly different from that measured during actual aggression, while the intensity of <italic>Hr38</italic> mRNA expression in positive cells was slightly lower in the No Food condition (Dead Male and No Food: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus the activation of P1<sup>a</sup>, Tk, or aSP2 neurons does not require consummatory aggressive actions such as lunging, tussling, or boxing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Interacting male flies can, in principle, exchange visual, auditory, mechanosensory, or chemosensory cues. In the case of chemosensory signals, inter-male aggression has been shown to require both detection of volatile cues by the olfactory system, and of non-volatile cues by the gustatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernández and Kravitz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang and Anderson, 2010</xref>). While both types of cues are present when an experimental fly is exposed to an intact or a dead male fly, the detection of non-volatile cues requires contact chemosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</xref>). We therefore exposed the experimental males to a target fly separated by a mesh filter which prevented physical contact between the freely moving flies. Interestingly, <italic>Hr38</italic> induction in all three cell populations under this condition was significantly weaker than that measured during free interaction with a male on agarose, where contact but no fighting occurred (Mesh: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together with the relatively strong <italic>Hr38</italic> induction observed following contact with a dead male (which presumably provides a source of both olfactory and gustatory pheromones), these data suggest that strong activation of P1<sup>a</sup>, Tk, and aSP2 neurons requires the integration of both volatile and non-volatile male-derived chemosensory cues. However, the results do not exclude the possibility that these neurons exhibit additional activity during contact-mediated aggression, but which is not statistically detectable by this method in comparison to ‘no fighting’ controls.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Detection of <italic>Hr38</italic><sup>+</sup> cells induced by optogenetic stimulation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons in the male brain</title><p>Optogenetic and thermogenetic stimulation experiments have shown that P1<sup>a</sup> interneurons can promote both male-directed aggression and male- or female-directed courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>).

In this report, we applied the HCR3.0 RNA-FISH technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2018</xref>) to visualize the expression of a fly IEG, <italic>Hr38</italic> in the entire adult male brain following different manipulations (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shao et al., 2019</xref>). We present data providing proof-of-concept that HI-FISH can be used to detect the activation by naturalistic stimuli of neurons previously identified in thermogenetic behavioral activation screens, as well as to identify candidate downstream targets of these neurons following their optogenetic activation (opto-HI-FISH). We also compared neuronal subsets within a small identified population (P1<sup>a</sup> neurons) that is activated during two different social behaviors, using HI-catFISH.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Monitoring neuronal activities during social behaviors</title><p>Previous studies reported that male-specific P1<sup>a</sup>, Tk, and aSP2 neurons promote male–male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Watanabe et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, P1<sup>a</sup> and aSP2 neurons promote male–female courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Takayanagi-Kiya and Kiya, 2019</xref>). Artificial manipulation of the activity of these neurons affected social behaviors and demonstrated their causal roles in these behaviors. However, there was no direct evidence showing that these neurons are normally activated during the specific behaviors they can promote.</p><p>Our HI-FISH data demonstrated that P1<sup>a</sup> and aSP2 neurons are active during male–male aggression and male–female courtship, consistent with the behavioral effects of activating these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Watanabe et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, Tk<sup>FruM</sup> neurons were only active during male–male aggression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), consistent with their lack of a functional role in courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, we show that P1<sup>a</sup>, Tk, and aSP2 neurons can apparently be activated by chemosensory cues from an opponent male fly in the absence of attack behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These data suggest that P1<sup>a</sup>, Tk, and aSP2 neurons may serve to process and integrate sensory cues from the opponent and relay that information to the downstream neurons that encode the consummatory phase of aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiu et al., 2021</xref>). However, they do not exclude that these neurons may play a role during overt attack.</p><p>Although the time resolution of IEG-based activity monitoring falls far short of that of calcium imaging, our data show that one can nevertheless use HI-FISH to separate activation that occurs during the appetitive vs. consummatory phases of male–male aggression, by judicious manipulation of experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Identification of downstream target neurons of genetically labeled neurons by opto-HI-FISH</title><p>Artificial activation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons induces male–female courtship and an internal state that promotes male–male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bath et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, artificial activation of male-specific P1 neurons mimics courtship-induced place preference as well as supporting appetitive olfactory conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shen et al., 2023</xref>). It is critical to identify neurons that are functionally downstream of P1<sup>a</sup> cells to understand how these neurons can promote this state. In this study, using opto-HI-FISH, we identified pCd neurons, KCs and PAM neurons as downstream targets of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons. These results were confirmed by TPI analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, recent studies have reached the same conclusions regarding neuronal populations using different approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shen et al., 2023</xref>). These findings provide additional support for our methodology. The heat map illustrates the presence of additional potential P1<sup>a</sup> -follower populations beyond the three interrogated here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Further analysis will unveil the detailed characteristics of these potential downstream neurons of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons. An important caveat is that not all active <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons may express <italic>Hr38</italic>. Act-seq data from mice indicate that different neuron subsets activated during social behaviors express different IEGs to different extents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional heterogeneity of P1<sup>a</sup> populations during social behaviors</title><p>In addition to identifying functional downstream targets of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons, characterizing cellular diversity among P1<sup>a</sup> neurons and how this functional heterogeneity maps onto their connectivity with different downstream targets is critical to understanding how these cells can induce both courtship and aggressive behavior. Optogenetic activation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons at a low frequency promotes aggression toward males, while high-frequency stimulation promotes male-directed courtship during stimulation, followed by aggression in the inter-stimulation intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>). P1<sup>a</sup> neurons may control these two behaviors according to their activity level and/or the subtype of neuron activated in the population. Alternatively, P1<sup>a</sup> neurons may indirectly promote fighting by inhibiting aggression-promoting neurons during courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koganezawa et al., 2016</xref>); post-inhibitory rebound in such neurons following the offset of P1<sup>a</sup> optogenetic stimulation may trigger aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our preliminary <italic>Hr38</italic> catFISH results suggest the presence of male- or female-responsive subsets within the P1<sup>a</sup> population, which consists of 8–10 neurons/hemibrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that P1<sup>a</sup> neurons are activated during male–male social interactions. Previous studies using calcium imaging of head-fixed flies suggested that P1<sup>a</sup> neurons were inhibited by the male-specific pheromone, 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clowney et al., 2015</xref>). The reason for this apparent discrepancy is not yet clear. The molecular identity of the male- vs. female-responsive P1<sup>a</sup> subsets remains to be determined. It has been suggested that FruM<sup>+</sup> P1 neurons exclusively control courtship, while Dsx<sup>+</sup> P1 neurons (also called pC1 neurons; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koganezawa et al., 2016</xref>) control aggression. However, triple-intersection experiments have demonstrated that thermogenetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>) or optogenetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Watanabe et al., 2017</xref>) activation of FruM<sup>+</sup> P1<sup>a</sup> neurons, which comprise only 1–4 neurons/hemibrain, can also promote aggression. Therefore, while our results support the idea that different P1 subsets control aggression vs. courtship, they do not support the view that FruM<sup>+</sup> P1 neurons only control the latter and not the former social behavior.</p><p>While this paper was in the final stages of preparation, a manuscript by Takayanagi-Kiya et al. appeared that described a method for labeling neurons activated during innate behaviors using a different IEG, <italic>stripe/egr-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takayanagi-Kiya et al., 2023</xref>). To analyze neuronal activities in different behavioral contexts, that study utilized a GAL4 driver for the <italic>stripe/egr-1</italic> gene to label neurons activated by the first behavior and immunostaining for stripe protein to label the second behavior. The flies were exposed to the first target for 24hr, followed by exposure to the second target for 2hr. In contrast, our approach for HI-catFISH is based purely on detecting the expression of the IEG mRNA using a state-of-the-art amplification method, HCR v3.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2018</xref>). This enables us to monitor neuronal activity during two different behaviors with much higher temporal resolution than the analogous method of Takayanagi-Kiya. Furthermore, by combining our HI-catFISH with their protein expression-based method, it is theoretically possible to monitor neurons activated by four different behavioral contexts. Thus, the two methods complement each other.</p><p>In mice, distinct subpopulations of estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1)-expressing neurons in the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) are activated during male-directed aggression vs. female-directed mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karigo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Remedios et al., 2017</xref>). Our observation that apparently distinct subpopulations of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons are activated during aggression vs. courtship in <italic>Drosophila</italic> strengthens the analogy between these two control nodes for social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson, 2016</xref>). Application to P1<sup>a</sup> neurons of Act-Seq, a method that uses scRNAseq to identify transcriptomic cell types that are active during different behaviors as determined by IEG expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), may help to identify transcriptomic and functional diversity within the P1<sup>a</sup> population. Such correlative studies may be extended to functional perturbations by using transcriptomic data to identify more specific intersectional GAL4 drivers for distinct P1<sup>a</sup> subsets. Together, our studies illustrate how HI-FISH can provide a systematic, unbiased, and brain-wide approach to identifying entry points to circuits controlling specific social behaviors, which can be integrated eventually with imaging, connectomic, transcriptomic, and functional approaches to circuit analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Detailed fly genotypes used for each figure are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>R15A01-iLexA (improved LexA) was generated for this study.

One of this reviewer’s (and reviewer #2’s) main concerns was that the confocal images provided in some cases did not appear to reflect the quantitative data in the bar graphs. These images were provided only for illustrative purposes, to give the reader a sense of what the primary data look like. The reviewer may not have appreciated that the quantitative data reflect counts of RNA smFISH signals (dots) in hundreds of cells collected through z-stacks comprising multiple optical sections in multiple flies for each condition For example, in P1a control condition (in Figure 2A), we have analyzed 135 neurons from 8 individuals. There, the number of z-planes ranged from 3 to 8 per hemisphere. It is generally not possible to find a single confocal section that encompasses quantitatively the statistics that are presented in the graphs. Presenting the data as an MIP (Maximum Intensity Projection, i.e., collapsed z-stack) in a single panel would generate an image that is too cluttered to see any detail. We have now included, for the reader’s benefit, additional example confocal sections in both a z-stack and from the opposite hemisphere, in Supplemental Figure S4D. We have also inserted clarifying statements in the text on p. 7 (lines 154-156).</p><p>Another suggestion from Reviewer #1 is that &quot;it would be more informative to separate in the quantification between the GAL4-expressing neurons and the non-expressing ones&quot; based on the presented pictures where more non-P1a neurons (that the reviewer speculates may be pC1-type neurons) are activated by a male-male encounter than by a male-female encounter, while the P1a-positive neurons seem to be more responsive during courtship behavior. In this paper, we were not looking at pC1 neurons and did not try to answer which neuronal population(s) outside of the P1a population is/are responsible for aggression and/or courtship. Rather, we focused on P1a neurons and addressed whether P1a neurons that induce both aggression and courtship behavior when they are artificially activated (Hoopfer et al. 2015) are also naturally activated during spontaneous performance of these two social behaviors. However, this result did not exclude the possibility that P1a neurons were inactive during naturalistic courtship or aggression. Our data in the current manuscript provide further experimental evidence in support of the idea that P1a neurons as a population play a role in both of these behaviors. Moreover, we provided data identifying P1a neurons activated only during aggression or during courtship (or both). However this does not exclude that pC1 or other neighboring populations are activated during aggression as well (See also the response to 'Recommendations For The Authors' and text lines 151-154).</p><p>In Figure 3, we used opto-HI-FISH to identify candidate downstream targets (direct or indirect) of P1a neurons. We used 50 Hz Chrimson stimulation to activate P1a neurons to induce expression of Hr38 and identified Kenyon cells in the mushroom body (MB) and PAM neurons (as well as pCd neurons) as potential downstream targets of P1a cells. In Figure 3 – supplement we performed calcium imaging of KCs and PAM neurons in response to P1a optogenetic stimulation to confirm independently our results from the Hr38 labeling experiments. That control was the purpose of that supplemental experiment.</p><p>Based on those imaging data, the reviewer asked the further question of which [natural] behavioral context induces Hr38 expression in these populations (i.e., mating or aggression). This question is reasonable because our calcium imaging data (Figure 3-supplement) showed that both Kenyon cells and PAM neurons are active only during photo-stimulation of P1a neurons. Our previous behavioral studies (Inagaki et al., 2014; Hoopfer et al., 2015) showed that 50 Hz photo-stimulation of P1a neurons in freely moving flies induced unilateral wing extension during stimulation, while aggression was observed only after the offset of the stimulation (Hoopfer et.al., 2015). Based on the comparison of those behavioral data to the imaging results in this paper, the reviewer suggested that Kenyon cells and PAM neurons are activated during courtship rather than during aggression. This is certainly a possible interpretation. However it is difficult to extrapolate from behavioral experiments in freely moving animals to calcium imaging results in head-fixed flies, particularly with response to neural dynamics. Furthermore, Hr38 expression, like that of other IEGs (e.g., c-fos), may reflect persistently activated 2nd messenger pathways (e.g., cAMP, IP3) in Kenyon cells and PAM neurons that are not detected by calcium imaging, but that nevertheless play a role in mediating its behavioral effects. We still do not understand the mechanisms of how optogenetic stimulation of P1a neurons in freely behaving flies induces aggression vs. courtship behavior. Although 50 Hz stimulation of P1a neurons does not induce aggressive behavior during photo-stimulation, it is possible that this manipulation activates both aggression and courtship circuits, but that the courtship circuit might inhibit aggressive behavior at a site downstream of the MB (e.g., in the VNC). Once stimulation is terminated and courtship stops the fly would show aggressive behavior, due to release of that downstream inhibition (see Models in Anderson (2016) Fig 2d, e). In that case, there would be no apparent inconsistency between the imaging data and behavioral data. We agree that the reviewer's question is interesting and important but we feel that answering this question with decisive experiments is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>Finally, Reviewer #1 suggested a method to evaluate the Hr38 signals in the catFISH experiment of Figure 4. We appreciate their suggestions, but the way that we evaluated the Hr38 signals was basically the same as the way the reviewer suggested. We apologize for the confusion caused by the lack of detailed descriptions in the original manuscript. We have now revised the methods section to explain more clearly how we define the cells as positive based on Hr38EXN and Hr38INT signals.</p><p>Response to Recommendations for the authors:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“To strengthen the author's argumentation, I would distinguish in their quantification between gal4+ from the other [classes of neighboring neurons]” (Fig. 2 and 4).”</p></disp-quote><p>Our focus in this paper was to ask simply whether P1a neurons are active or not active during natural occurrences of the social behaviors they can evoke when artificially activated. We did not claim that they are the only cells in the region that control the behaviors. It is not possible to compare their activation to that of 'other' cells neighboring P1a neurons without a separate marker to identify those cells driven by a different reporter system (e.g., LexA). This in turn would require repeating all of the experiments in Figs 2 and 4 from scratch with new genotypes permitting dual-labeling of the two populations by different XFPs, and quantifying the data using 4-color labeling. We respectfully submit that such curiosity-driven experiments, while in principle interesting, are beyond the scope of the present manuscript. However, we have inserted text to acknowledge the possibility that the aggression-activated Hr38 signals in P1a- cells neighboring P1a+ cells may correspond to other classes of P1 neurons (of which there are 70 in total) or to pC1 cells.

I would measure the intensity of the hr38EXN. A high Hr38EXN level associated with the presence of hr38INT would indicate that the cell has been activated during both encounters, while a lower hr38EXN with no hr38INT would suggest only an activation during the 1st behavioural context. Finally, a lower hr38EXN associated with the presence of hr38INT would suggest the opposite, an activation only during the 2nd behaviour.”</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there are some tiny dot signals with hr38 INT probe that are more likely the background signals. We only counted the INT probe signals as positive when the cells had a clearly visible dot and also co-localize with the exonic probe's signal, as primary (un-spliced) Hr38 transcripts in the nucleus should be positive for both EXN and INT probes. Regarding the reviewer’s latter comments, we agree with their interpretation of the catFISH results and that is how we interpreted them originally. We measured the intensity of hr38EXN expression and defined hr38EXN-labeled cells as “positive” when the relative intensity was 3σ &gt;average, a stringent criterion. In the revised manuscript, we added more detailed information in the methods section regarding our criteria for defining cell types as positive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Knowing that the P1a neurons (using the split-gal4) can trigger only wing extension when activated by optogenetic 50Hz, I would test to which behavioral context the MB neurons and the PAM neurons positively respond to.”</p></disp-quote><p>As we answered in 'Response to Public Review,' our opto-HI-FISH experiments identified Kenyon cells in the mushroom body (MB) and PAM neurons (as well as pCd neurons) as potential downstream targets of P1a cells, using Hr38 labeling. The purpose of the calcium imaging experiment in Figure 3 – supplement was to confirm the P1a-dependent activation of KCs and PAM neurons using an independent method. In that respect this control experiment was successful in that methodological confirmation. The reviser raised an interesting question about how our calcium imaging experiments relate to our behavioral experiments, in terms of the dynamics of KC and PAM activation. A recent publication (Shen et al., 2023) revealed that courtship behavior has a positive valence and that activation of P1 neurons mimics a courtship-reward state via activation of PAM dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that PAM neurons (and Kenyon cells as downstream of PAM neurons) are activated during female exposure. However those data do not exclude the possibility that inter-male aggression is also rewarding in <italic>Drosophila</italic> males, as it has shown to be in mice. This is an interesting curiosity-driven question that has yet to be resolved. Therefore, as mentioned in the 'Response to Public Review,' we feel that the additional experiment the reviewer suggests is beyond the scope of our manuscript.</p><p>Changes: None.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>“Please provide different pictures from main fig2 and sup2 for the three common conditions (control, aggression, and courtship).”</p></disp-quote><p>The data set for Figure 2 and Figure 2 supplement are from the same experiment.

We have addressed most of them in our revised manuscript. The main concern of Reviewer #2 was the temporal resolution of the HI-catFISH experiment shown in Figure 4 and Figure 4-Supplement. Our original manuscript illustrated temporal patterns of Hr38EXN and Hr38ITN signals concomitant with different behavioral paradigms (Figure 4B). The reviewer pointed out that the illustrated experimental design does not reflect the actual data shown in Figure 4-Supplement A-C. We believe this issue was raised because we drew the temporal pattern of Hr38EXN signals in Figure 4B based on the intensity of Hr38EXN signals (Figure 4-Supplement B) rather than based on the % number of positive cells (Figure 4-Supplement C). We have now revised the schematic time course of Hr38EXN signals in Figure 4B using the % of positive cells. We believe this change will be helpful for readers to understand better the experimental design since we used the % of positive cells to identify patterns of P1a neuron activation during male-male vs. male-female social interactions in Figure 4D. Another suggestion from Reviewer #2 was to add additional controls, such as the quantification of the intronic and exonic Hr38 probes after either only the first or second social context exposure. In response, we have now added the data from only the first social context (Figure 4C, and 4D, right column). These new data provides evidence that there are essentially no detectable Hr38INT signals 60 minutes later without a second behavioral context, while Hr38EXN signals are still present at the time of the analysis. Unfortunately, we are not able to provide the converse dataset with the second behavioral context only to show that Hr38 INT signals are detected. On this point, we call the reviewer’s attention to Figure 4-supplement-S4A-C, which show that the INT probe signals are detectable at 15 and 30 minutes following stimulation, but not at 60 minutes. In the experiment of Fig. 4B, flies are fixed and labeled for Hr38 30 minutes after the beginning of the second behavior, conditions under which we should obtain robust INT signals (as observed). EXN signals are also expected at 30 minutes because the primary (non-spliced) RNA transcript detected by the INT probe also contains exonic sequences.</p><p>Response to Recommendations for the authors:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that the development of in situ HCR for the adult fly brain is so central to the present manuscript, I think that the methods section describing the HCR protocol can be significantly improved. In particular, the authors should fully describe the in situ HCR protocol including the 'minor modifications' they refer to, and define how they calculate the 'relative intensity to the background'.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. We have now revised the methods section to describe the procedure in more detail. Also, we will submit a separate document describing the HI-FISH protocol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Note: The authors refer to a recently published paper by Takayanagi-Kiya et al (2023) describing activity-based neuronal labeling using a different immediate early gene, stripe/egr-1. The authors state the following: 'That study used a GAL4 driver for the stripe/egr-1 gene to label and functionally manipulate activated neurons. In contrast, our approach is based purely on detecting expression of the IEG mRNA using..'. Takayanagi-Kiya et al. (2023) also use in situ mRNA detection of the IEG stripe/egr-1 and not only a GAL4 driver system. This claim should be modified and the paper should be cited in the introduction of the present paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now cited the paper in the Introduction and have modified and moved the description originally in 'Note' section to Discussion (text lines: 392-404) as the reviewer requested. We have emphasized the difference between the two approaches for comparing neuronal activities during two different behaviors within the same animal. Takayanagi-Kiya used GAL4/UAS and stripe protein expression with immunohistochemistry to analyze neuronal activities during two different behaviors, while we exclusively analyzed Hr38 mRNA expression for this purpose, using intronic and exonic Hr38 probes. This approach made it possible to perform catFISH with higher temporal resolution and also allows extension of our approach to other IEGs for which antibodies are not available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please specify the nature of the iron fillings in the methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a detailed description in the methods section, including the catalog number.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1B, the authors may add a dashed outline to the regions magnified in 1C so that readers can more easily follow the figures.

The images in Figure Supplement 2A should be either changed or it should be explained as to why the images are the same yet the numbers in the legend are different.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. Figure 2 and Figure 2-Supplement are from the same experiment. To avoid clutter we illustrated three key conditions ('Control,' 'Aggression,' and 'Courtship') in the main figure. The reason why the numbers in the legend are different is that the purpose of presenting Figure 2-Supplement B-D was to determine whether there were differences in the intensity of Hr38 FISH signals in the neurons considered as 'positive' in different conditions. Therefore, the numbers described in Figure 2-Supplement legend are derived only from those neurons that were considered Hr38-positive, while the numbers in Figure 2 include all neurons analyzed. We have now added notes to explain this in the Figure 2 – supplement legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The panels of the quantification of the Hr38 relative intensity in Figure 2B/C/D are very difficult to read, ideally, they should be plotted as in Figure Supplement 2B/C/D.</p></disp-quote><p>The graphs in Figure 2B-D (upper) show data from all GFP-labeled cells scored, including cells defined as 'negative' or 'borderline.' In contrast, the graphs in Figure 2-supplement show the relative Hr38 signal intensity in those GFP neurons defined as positive based on the analysis in Fig. 2B. If we were to plot the data in Fig. 2B (upper) as box plots (like that in Figure-2-supplement), we would see either a skewed (only negative cells) or a bimodal distribution (one around the negative population and the other around the positive population); the shapes of these distributions would likely be hidden in the box-whisker plots format. Therefore, we prefer to plot all of the data points as we did in the original manuscript. However, we agree that the data points in the original manuscript were hard to read. We therefore changed the format of the datapoints from blurry dots to open circles with clear solid lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2B/C/D, please specify in the figure legend what 'grouped in categories according to character' means.</p></disp-quote><p>We used letters to mark statistically significant differences (or lack thereof) between conditions. Bars sharing at least one common letter are not significantly different. If they do not share any letter, they are significantly different. For example, Aggression: bc vs. Dead: bc, means no difference. Aggression: bc vs. No Food: b, or Aggression: bc vs. Courtship: c also means no difference between Aggression and each of the two other conditions. However, 'No Food: b' and 'Courtship: c' have no common letter, meaning they are different. This is a standard method for showing statistically comparisons among multiple bars without lots of asterisks and horizontal bars cluttering the figure, and we have revised the legend to clarify what each letter means. We have also removed the color shading in Figure 2 B-D as it may have been confusing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A quantification of the number of Hr38-positive neurons and Hr38 relative intensity during the entire time course would be informative in Figure 3D.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the data set for this figure is different from that for Figure 4-Supplement A-C, the main claim is the same. Therefore, Figure 4 - Supplement essentially provides the information that the reviewer suggested. However, we also reanalyzed the data set used for the original Figure 3D and evaluated % positive cells at the 30-minute time point and have now added that number in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the legend of Figure 3D, it says '..The expression level reaches its peak at 30-60min', yet I don't see timepoints beyond 60min.

We have rephrased the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure Supplement 3A/D: please add an outline or a schematic figure to better understand where the imaging is performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We added illustrated schemas next to the title of each experiment (P1-&gt;PAM neurons (bundle) and P1 -&gt; Kenyon cells (bundle)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure Supplement 3C/F: please add information about the statistical test to the corresponding figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a phrase to describe the test used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure Supplement 3G/H/I/J: motion artifacts can potentially strongly affect the performed analysis given that cell bodies are very small and highly subjected to motion.
