Once retroviruses establish viral reservoirs, it is difficult to eliminate infection as retroviral genomes are permanently integrated into host DNA. Despite the clinical relevance of early processes by which incoming retroviruses establish infection by navigating complex host tissue architecture <italic>en route</italic> to their first targets, little is known about these events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haase, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haase, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haase, 2014</xref>). Retroviruses like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) can enter through the vaginal and rectal mucosa during sexual transmission, orally via milk during mother-to-child transmission, and subcutaneously and intravenously through needle stick injections during drug use and blood transfusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haase, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedland and Klein, 1987</xref>). Most murine leukemia virus (MLV) transmission in mice occurs vertically from dam-to-pup via ingestion of virus-containing milk through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. MLV transmission can also occur parenterally between male mice during infighting and via the venereal route between infected male and female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Portis et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buffett et al., 1969a</xref>). Entry via different routes requires retroviruses to navigate diverse host tissue architecture and overcome barriers for successful infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Uchil et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pfeiffer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fackler et al., 2014</xref>). Whether retroviruses exploit common host factors across these transmission routes remain to be clarified.</p><p>We have previously used MLV as a model retrovirus to understand how retroviruses establish infection in mice through the lymph or blood following subcutaneous and intravenous delivery, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uchil et al., 2019b</xref>). We found that sentinel macrophages lining blood/lymph-tissue interfaces such as the subcapsular sinus in lymph nodes or the marginal zones in the spleen function to filter out incoming retroviruses from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uchil et al., 2019b</xref>. The ‘fly-paper’-like activity of sentinel macrophages has been observed for various incoming viruses and pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kastenmüller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iannacone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Junt et al., 2007</xref>). The frontline position of sentinel macrophages allows them to orchestrate downstream innate, cell-mediated, and humoral immune responses to incoming pathogens in the lymph and blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Uchil et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uchil et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Honke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez-Pomares and Gordon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perez et al., 2017</xref>). These macrophages naturally express the I-type lectin Siglec-1/CD169, which specifically interacts with sialosides present on retroviral membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Izquierdo-Useros et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Puryear et al., 2013</xref>). CD169 expression allows sentinel macrophages to capture retroviruses and limits their dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uchil et al., 2019b</xref>). However, retroviruses like MLV and HIV-1 exploit their CD169 to promote infection of target lymphocytes that sample antigens captured by sentinel macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uchil et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pi et al., 2019</xref>). Whether the observed roles for CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages following subcutaneous and intravenous delivery are of any relevance for natural mother-to-offspring transmission when viruses enter via the GI tract has remained unknown.</p><p>Identifying portals of entry such as Peyer’s patches (PP) in underdeveloped intestines can be very challenging, given the complexity, functional diversity, and length of the GI tract, which can measure &gt;7 cm even in neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Torow et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we developed a whole-body bioluminescence imaging (BLI)-based approach to illuminate areas where MLV concentrates to traverse into the gut tissue from the lumen. We implemented BLI by developing a series of MLV-based reporter viruses to enable observation of specific stages of the retrovirus life cycle in vivo, including viral particle flow, entry into the cytoplasm, first infection events, and spread. We first validated this system by testing its ability to uncover new insights into previously studied subcutaneous and intravenous transmission routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uchil et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pi et al., 2019</xref>). Second, BLI permitted temporal tracking of various steps of virus infection for orally administered retroviruses along the GI tract as they traversed the lumen through the PP to reach the draining mesenteric sac (mSac). Finally, we show that capture and acquisition of lymph-, blood-, and milk-borne retroviruses spanning three routes was promoted by a common host factor, CD169, expressed on sentinel macrophages. Our results highlight how retroviruses co-opt the immune surveillance function of tissue-resident sentinel macrophages for establishing infection. Understanding these events will inform design of improved prophylactic strategies that target prevention of virus acquisition and establishment of infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of reporter viruses to enable visualization of individual stages of retrovirus infection in vivo</title><p>We established a BLI-directed approach for studying individual stages of retroviral infection in vivo by strategically inserting reporters into unique sites in the MLV genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To track virus particle flow, we generated bioluminescent virus particles by introducing nanoluciferase (Nluc) into the proline-rich region (PRR) of the MLV envelope (Env). Nluc-Env-tagged virus particles produced using a tripartite plasmid system (encoding Nluc-tagged MLV Env, MLV Gag-Pol, and MLV-LTR) exhibited 200 times more luciferase activity per virus particle (0.2 RLU/virion) compared to viruses generated using the full-length MLV genome (0.001 RLU/virion) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To monitor virus entry into the cytoplasm of cells, we fused firefly luciferase (Fluc) to the C-terminus of MLV Gag (MLV Gag-Fluc Env<sub>WT</sub>) and exploited the ATP-dependence of Fluc activity, which is restricted to the host cell cytoplasm in vivo. This strategy ensured that Fluc activity was exhibited when both detergent (Triton X-100) and ATP were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A Gag-Fluc-labeled virus in which MLV envelope was replaced by the fusion-defective SFFV gp55 envelope (MLV Gag-Fluc Env<sub>FD</sub>) served as a negative control. To monitor single-round virus transduction, we utilized a replication-defective virus generated by co-transfecting a dual BLI and GFP reporter (pMIG-Nluc-IRES-GFP) in conjunction with MLV Gag-Pol and Env (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ventura et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, we generated red-shifted reporter viruses encoding Antares, which is a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) reporter that enables superior deep-tissue sensitivity over Nluc in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, to permit longitudinal monitoring of progressing infection, we generated replication-competent MLV reporter viruses by introducing a shortened internal ribosome entry site (IRES), 6ATRi, to drive Nluc expression downstream of viral Env (MLV 6ATRi-Nluc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ventura et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Logg et al., 2001</xref>). This strategy enabled bi-cistronic expression of Env and Nluc in infected cells. Infectivity measurements revealed that MLV 6ATRi-Nluc was ~60% as infectious as wild-type MLV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Construction and characterization of reporter viruses for visualizing individual stages of the retrovirus life cycle in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A scheme denoting the location of inserted reporters into unique sites in the Friend murine leukemia virus (FrMLV) genome.

We previously showed that r.o.-delivered MLV is first captured by CD169<sup>+</sup> metallophilic marginal zone macrophages before infecting follicular, marginal zone, and transitional B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uchil et al., 2019b</xref>). We revisited this route at the whole-body level by applying these new reporter viruses. We challenged mice r.o. with MLV Env-Nluc reporter viruses. BLI-driven virus tracking immediately after challenge showed that MLV rapidly reached both liver and spleen within 30 s after administration and accumulated predominantly at the spleen after passing through the liver (2–3 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). This was consistent with the spleen being the main blood-filtering organ in mice. Interestingly, the decaying luminescence over time (&gt;30 min) in the spleen was revived when Nluc substrate (furimazine) was readministered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicated that viruses remain captured at the spleen, and the exhaustion of substrate contributed to the decay in the signal. We next investigated virus entry into the host cell cytoplasm by utilizing MLV Gag-Fluc-tagged viruses with wild-type (Env<sub>WT</sub>) or fusion-defective Env (Env<sub>FD</sub>). Inocula were equalized by measuring the luciferase activity (relative light units [RLU]) in detergent-lysed viral preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

In vivo infectivity of MLV 6ATRi-Nluc virus was reduced in comparison to WT FrMLV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This was not unexpected based on the reduced released infectivity of MLV 6ATRi-Nluc in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and the known effect of genomic reporter insertions on retrovirus fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Logg et al., 2001</xref>). To visualize the first round of infected cells and virus spread at the whole animal level, we challenged mice with single-round MLV reporter virus (pMIG-Antares) as well as replication-competent reporter MLV and monitored replication dynamics using BLI every 2–3 days over the course of 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In contrast to the decline of luminescent signal observed with single-round Antares-encoding MLV, luminescent signal in organs infected by MLV 6ATRi-Nluc increased over time, indicative of fresh rounds of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G, H</xref>). We observed infection in auricular and inguinal LN in addition to the spleen and liver. As time progressed, there was gradual decline of luminescent signal in mice infected with MLV 6ATRi-Nluc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G, H</xref>). This decline was not due to loss of the Nluc reporter as RT<sup>2</sup>-qPCR analyses of viral RNA isolated from blood and spleen indicated that the ratio of Gag to Nluc did not significantly change during the observed course (3–14 dpi) of infection in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). The Gag:Nluc ratio was similar to that seen from RNA isolated from DFJ8-infected cells (30 hpi). These data suggested that Nluc reporter was retained within the viral genome throughout the observed course of infection. Therefore, the decline in the signal is consistent with the immune control of MLV infection in C57BL/6J (B6) mice, observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uchil et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sewald et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nowinski, 1976</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate the utility of our bioluminescent reporter viruses in monitoring particle flow, capture, cytoplasmic entry, transduction, and subsequent virus spread following intravenous infection of mice.

The draining lymph node for i.f.p. infection is the popliteal lymph node (pLN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iannacone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Junt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gonzalez et al., 2010</xref>). Previous studies using multi-photon intravital microscopy indicated that incoming lymph-borne viruses were captured by CD169<sup>+</sup> sentinel macrophages, resulting in accumulation at the subcapsular sinus of the pLN within a few minutes following viral challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iannacone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Junt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murooka et al., 2012</xref>). CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages did not get infected but rather promoted <italic>trans</italic>-infection of susceptible lymphocytes such as innate-like B1-a cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during the first round of infection. B-1a cells then spread the virus to naïve B-2 cells via virological synapse during the expansion phase of the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>). To gain further insight into behaviors of incoming virus particles in this well-studied route, we performed BLI imaging of incoming virus particle flow from the administration site to the target organ by infecting mice i.f.p. with MLV Env-Nluc. Incoming viruses accumulated rapidly at the pLN, with detectable signal occurring within 1 min 30 s pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). This was indicative of lymph flow-mediated dissemination of MLV to pLN and was consistent with previous multiphoton microscopy studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>). However, we observed that most of the incoming virus particles localized to the injection site at the footpad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Quantification of virus particle accumulation in the footpad and pLN, displayed as photon flux (photons/s), revealed that virus accumulation in the footpad was over 200-fold higher than that in the pLN. This observation remained constant for the entire imaging window. Even when virus eventually accumulated in the pLN, plateauing at ~9 min pi, the level of virus in the footpad remained ~150-fold above that of the pLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Thus, our imaging analyses showed that only a small fraction of incoming viruses surpass tissue barriers including collagen fibrils, muscle tissue, and antigen-capturing cells at the footpad to reach the draining site.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Real-time visualization of individual steps of retrovirus infection in vivo during subcutaneous challenge.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A scheme showing the path of murine leukemia virus (MLV) Env-Nluc from footpad to draining popliteal lymph node (pLN) after subcutaneous (intrafootpad [i.f.p.]) challenge in mice.

In contrast, luciferase activity in footpads challenged with MLV Gag-Fluc Env<sub>WT</sub> significantly increased over time, indicating progressive virus access to cell cytoplasm in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>).

WT MLV exhibited an expected infection profile in vivo, peaking at 5 dpi and subsequently decreasing due to immune control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, G</xref>). As in r.o. infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>), MLV 6ATRi-Nluc replicated with slower infection kinetics compared to those of WT MLV and peaked at 7–8 dpi instead of 5 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, G</xref>).

Visualizing virus particles (MLV Gag-GFP) at the single-cell level by immunostaining of tissue sections was challenging after particles had traveled for days in the GI tract before arriving in the PP follicle. We therefore resorted to performing retrovirus challenge in adult mice by surgically ligating a region in the small intestine that contained PP. The ligated loop allowed us to increase the local particle concentration of MLV Gag-GFP under live settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jia and Edelblum, 2019</xref>). After allowing the virus to be taken up for 1 hr, PP region of the ligated intestine was processed for immunostaining and microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In addition to particles that were free or adhered to the epithelial cells, we observed particles invading the epithelial barrier presumably through M cells and dispersed in the PP follicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages were not previously reported in the PP. Surprisingly, we observed CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages located in the serosal side of the PP that had captured MLV Gag-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). These data suggested a possible role for CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages in capturing and promoting retrovirus infection in intestinal PPs. We explored this possibility further in neonatal mice. In contrast to their serosal location in adult PPs, CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages were more dispersed within developing neonatal PPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). We next asked whether CD169 plays a functional role in promoting retrovirus acquisition during oral transmission from mother to offspring. We first orally inoculated B6 and CD169<sup>-/-</sup> mice with MLV Env-Nluc to monitor virus particle transit through the intestine. BLI at 48 hpi revealed a significantly reduced distribution of virus particles throughout the intestines and within PP (approximately fivefold reduction; p&lt;0.0001) as well as mSacs (approximately threefold reduction; p=0.0082) in CD169<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–D</xref>).

We engineered a series of reporter viruses to monitor individual steps of virus infection including virus particle flow, entry into cytoplasm, infection of cells, replication, and spread in the context of living animals. We first validated this system by successfully demonstrating its ability to uncover new insights into well-studied subcutaneous and intravenous transmission routes. Importantly, BLI permitted temporal tracking of orally administered retroviruses along the GI tract as they traversed the lumen through PP to reach the draining mSac. We have also shown that a common host factor expressed on sentinel macrophages, CD169, promotes retrovirus capture and acquisition throughout three routes. Our results highlighted how retroviruses co-opt the immune surveillance function of tissue-resident sentinel macrophages to establish infection. Our visual approach to virus infection in vivo revealed several novel facets of host-virus interplay that we discuss below.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Route-specific tissue barriers</title><p>Each route of entry comprises a unique set of tissue-specific barriers that viruses must overcome for successful infection of the host. Our particle flow analyses for the retroorbital route revealed that most viruses reach the spleen, where they establish infection after briefly passing through the heart and liver. In contrast, the i.f.p. route presented a much more challenging barrier for viruses to reach their target organ, the pLN. Virus accumulation in the footpad was 150–200-fold higher than that in the pLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We frequently observed clusters of incoming virus particles trapped within the dense, tightly packed matrix of footpad muscle and collagen fibrils. In addition, virus particles were taken up by macrophages and DCs that presumably trap them in a non-productive pathway in contrast to B and T cells that when infected serve as amplifying hosts for MLV. In addition, virus-associated sentinel macrophages and DCs are known to collaborate and initiate immune responses, as has been shown for other viruses (Influenza, VSV) and viral antigens during i.f.p. challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iannacone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Junt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chatziandreou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gonzalez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heesters et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moseman et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the high levels of particle capture and infection seen near the injection site at the footpad, our previous studies showed that the establishment of infection at the draining pLN is independent of cells migrating from the footpad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uchil et al., 2019b</xref>). During oral transmission, enveloped retroviruses must withstand harsh conditions such as low pH in the stomach, digestive enzymes, and bile salts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pfeiffer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pirtle and Beran, 1991</xref>) that can solubilize viral membranes. While retroviruses can be destroyed at pH as high as 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ye et al., 2003</xref>), MLV is stable until pH 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wallin et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, mice are most susceptible to MLV infection at day 3 post-partum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buffett et al., 1969b</xref>) when stomach acid production is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deren, 1971</xref>). Moreover, milk may also shield retroviruses from acid secreted in the neonatal stomach. Our analyses comparing the flux of input MLV Env-Nluc viruses (~1 × 10<sup>7</sup> p/s) with that of signal seen at 48 hr in PP and mSac (~1–2 × 10<sup>5</sup> p/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) suggest that ~50–100-fold fewer viruses are able to surmount the oral and GI barriers. This barrier is expected to increase significantly with age due to the upsurge in production of virus-inactivating factors like bile salts and acid, thus rendering adult mice resistant to oral MLV transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deren, 1971</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Differential kinetics of virus particle arrival and cytoplasmic entry</title><p>Following i.v. infection, viruses accumulated in the spleen within 3 min and entered the cytoplasm of host target cells by 60 min post-challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>). In footpads, cytoplasmic entry corresponded with virus particle arrival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). In pLNs, however, viruses took longer (more than 40 min) to enter the host cell cytoplasm after arrival, with pLN luminescence first observed at 6 hr post-challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, E</xref>). Similarly, we saw a weak but delayed cytoplasmic entry of viruses in the mSac compared to PP despite near simultaneous arrival of virus in both the organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, D, E</xref>). The delayed cytoplasmic entry in the pLN and mSacs is likely explained by the mode of infection. We have previously documented that in the spleen and pLN, CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages capture incoming viruses and promote infection of target lymphocytes by a process called <italic>trans</italic>-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uchil et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pi et al., 2019</xref>). Sentinel macrophages are resistant to MLV infection at early time points as viruses are held at a distance of ~41 nm from the cell surface, corresponding to the length of the CD169 ectodomain, a distance too far for the MLV Env to engage the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>). Following capture, viruses must transit through surface-associated membrane invaginations of CD169<sup>+</sup> sentinel macrophages before presentation to target cells for <italic>trans-</italic>infection, delaying cytoplasmic entry. In contrast, in footpads, incoming virus may directly interact with DCs in addition to the hand-off from virus-capturing macrophages, as observed by our immunohistochemistry and electron tomography studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>). Consistent with our observations of rapid virus entry at the footpad, virus-capturing DCs may internalize virus and become infected to perform their natural role of antigen presentation unlike CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages, which cross-present viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uchil et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Dinther et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, a large proportion of infected cells in the footpads were CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs. This likewise may occur within PPs, where viruses, after transiting through M cells, have direct access to target cells in the underlying follicle in addition to availing CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophage-promoted infection. In contrast, free viruses entering mesenteric LN undergo sentinel macrophage-mediated <italic>trans</italic>-infection, delaying cytoplasmic access like those seen in the pLN.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Differential capture of retroviruses by CD169 in spleen and liver</title><p>We observed that retroorbitally administered viruses briefly passed through the liver before accumulating in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). The vastly reduced virus retention in the liver, despite the presence of sinusoidal CD169<sup>+</sup> Kupffer cells, was surprising. However, these results could be explained by several fold lower levels of CD169 expression in Kupffer cells compared to CD169<sup>+</sup> SCS macrophages in the LN or marginal zone metallophilic macrophages in the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saunderson et al., 2014</xref>). A similar predominant capture of intravenously delivered exosomes in spleen compared to liver was also observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saunderson et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, specific tissue environments may govern the capacity of lectins to bind incoming viruses as the binding capacity of Siglecs is often regulated by endogenous ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Varki and Gagneux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crocker and Varki, 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Novel facets of oral retroviral transmission</title><p>While requiring necropsy to increase resolution and sensitivity, BLI assisted the study of long organs such as the GI tract as it can illuminate areas of interest to guide directed investigations and shed light on the sequential course of infection events. Particle flow analyses with replication-defective reporter viruses demonstrated that it takes 24–48 hr for viruses to reach portals of entry (PP) and accumulate in the draining mSac. Interestingly, prior replication in PP was not required for transiting to the draining LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). Incoming particles were able to access the lymph flow for transit to the mSac. This contrasts with vaginal infection of SIV, in which local replication was critical for further virus dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haase, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haase, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2009</xref>). The use of Fluc-tagged viruses revealed that entry into the cytoplasm occurs at ~24 hpi in the PP and begins at ~48 hpi in the mSac, which houses mesenteric LNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This was followed by infection at 96 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F, G</xref>). Interestingly, in addition to B and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that together constituted 40–50% of infected cells in neonatal mSacs, CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs were the predominant infected cell population (~50%). DCs are known to migrate from periphery to draining LN after antigenic stimulus. It is likely that most of the infected DCs originated from PP and migrated to mSacs, as has been proposed for other retrovirus infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dudley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beutner et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Held et al., 1993</xref>). As with other infection routes we tested, CD169 expression on sentinel macrophages was crucial for promoting oral transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Particle retention and subsequent infection at PP and mSacs were significantly reduced in the absence of CD169. These data were reminiscent of our previous study, where we observed a CD169 requirement to promote MLV infection at both pLN and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uchil et al., 2019b</xref>). Thus, our studies revealed the existence of CD169-mediated capture and infection promotion as a second crucial step downstream of likely entry through M cells that augments oral retroviral transmission.</p><p>Overall, our BLI-guided analyses have highlighted how retroviruses, during a million years of co-evolution, have co-opted CD169, primarily used for immune surveillance by tissue-resident sentinel macrophages, as a common host factor for promoting host colonization via various naturally occurring infection routes.

Animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in the Yale Animal Resources Center (YARC) in the same room of the vivarium. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) and the Institutional Biosafety Committee of Yale University approved all experiments. 6–8-week-old male and female mice were used for all experiments involving adult mice. Breeder mice acting as foster mothers for litter transfer experiments were 3–6 months of age. Oral inoculation experiments in neonatal mice were performed on 3-day-old mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Generation of viral vector plasmids</title><p>Virus-encoding plasmids were generated using Gibson Assembly (NEB Gibson Assembly Kit, NEB, Ipswich, MA). Insert amplicons containing 25 bp overlaps to target regions were generated using Kapa HiFi Hotstart high-fidelity polymerase (Kapa Biosystems/Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) using a touchdown PCR protocol. MLV Env-Nluc: For generating full-length MLV Env-Nluc construct, MLV pLRB303 Env-PRR-GFP plasmid encoding a full-length MLV genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lehmann et al., 2005</xref>) was digested with Nhe I to release the GFP cloned into the PRR of MLV envelope. Nluc was amplified from the pNL1.1 plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) with primers to ensure in-frame Nluc expression as well as containing 25 bp overlap to the insertion site to allow cloning by Gibson Assembly. A similar strategy was used to generate MLV envelope expressor plasmid for insertion of Nluc in-frame into PPR region. MLV Gag-GFP: MLV Gag-GFP in the full-length viral context was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>). MLV Gag-Fluc Env<sub>WT</sub>: GFP was released from MLV Gag-GFP using EcoRI and HindIII digestion. Fluc was amplified from pGL4.32[luc2P NF-kB-RE] plasmid (Promega) and inserted into the vector backbone using Gibson Assembly. For MLV Gag-Fluc Env<sub>FD</sub> generation, MLV envelope was replaced with SFFV envelope using restriction digestion and ligation. SFFV envelope was amplified from pBR322-SFFV LS, a gift from Leonard Evans and Frank Malik (NIH). Full-length MLV 6ATRi-Nluc:gBlocks encoding 6ATRi-Nluc along with flanking region were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA).

These details and references have now been added. We had however not characterized infected cells in the footpad during s.c challenge and in the mesenteric sacs during oral challenge. We have now included a profile of infected cells in both footpad and mSac as per reviewer request. Specifically, we found that DCs (CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> and CD11c<sup>+</sup>) are infected in footpads (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). In mSacs, DCs, B cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are targeted by MLV for establishment of infection (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Lines 134-6.

Do the authors think that macrophage capture of virus is occurring within 3 min?</p></disp-quote><p>The signal near the footpad injection site is a combination of virus capture by resident tissue architecture like collagen fibrils, muscle, and cell types like macrophages and DCs. In our previous study, we have shown by intravital imaging that lymph-borne retroviruses arriving at the draining pLN are captured instantaneously by SCS CD169 macrophages [7].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 3C – Why does capture by CD169+ macrophages require a fusion-competent envelope?</p></disp-quote><p>CD169 capture does not require fusion competent envelope. Viruses will be captured by CD169 macrophages even if the virus lacks envelope protein as capture is dependent on gangliosides present on viral membranes. It is fusion into target cells and detection of cytoplasmic Fluc activity that requires a fusion competent envelope.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The difference in virus levels at different time points, particularly 6 hr, is not very convincing.

Why do EnvFD virus levels decrease with time?</p></disp-quote><p>Ideally the EnvFD virus should not produce any Fluc signal as Fluc is enclosed within virion membranes. The resident signal that we see is due to presence of lysed virions that arise during the process of virus purification or during virus administration.</p><p>As the previous data was not statistically robust, we have repeated this experiment to increase the number of mice (n = 8- 10) and lengthened the time span of the experiment to 72 h.

However, we find that the FrMLV infection in individual mammary gland peak at different time points based on initial level of infection. These data are now presented in Figure 5A as well as figure supplement 1 for Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 5A.

Was this a single experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed this experiment several times and is reproducible. We now include data documenting the increase in signal indicating that the virus is indeed replicating in mammary glands (see previous comment). To demonstrate that this is reproducible we have included data from 3 mice (Figure 5A and figure supplement 1 for Figure 5). Interestingly as noted in previous comment, the progression of infection in mammary glands are not synchronous. This may be due to different levels of cell division in mammary glands during lactation. We also provide immunofluorescence data in Figure 5 that show FrMLV-infected epithelial cells in mammary glands identified by bioluminescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Same question as for 3C – why is a fusion-competent virus required if its CD169+ macrophage capture of virus?</p></disp-quote><p>CD169 capture does not require fusion competent envelope. Viruses will be captured by CD169 macrophages even if the virus lacks envelope protein, as capture is dependent on gangliosides present on viral membranes. It is fusion into target cells that require fusion competent envelope. CD169 macrophages do not get infected. Rather they promote infection of susceptible lymphocytes by a process called trans-infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 8.

How are the authors sure that this was specific capture?</p></disp-quote><p>Fusion-competent viruses are not required to reach the Peyer patch and even mSacs. Labeled virus particles alone arrive at Peyer’s patches and mSac. In addition, virus enter into Peyer's patch even in CD169<sup>-/-</sup> mice, accounting for the virus particles observed in this image. With respect to specific capture by CD169, our data using KO mice demonstrate that CD169 contributes to virus acquisition in neonatal mice that were challenged orally.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) The design of the various reporter viruses is instrumental for this study but to make the results obtained with these viruses comparable, additional side-by-side characterization (e.g. relative infectivity, labelling efficacies) would be helpful.

In vitro stability for a construct like ours were reported previously [9].

Sensitivity also depends on the depth of the tissue. Hence in many of our experiments where signal is not detected non-invasively, we have resorted to imaging the organs after necropsy to improve sensitivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Immune responses are mentioned several times in the manuscript but were not analyzed.
