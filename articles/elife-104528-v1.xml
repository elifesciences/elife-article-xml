Recent work suggested that such a mechanism is hijacked by cancer cells to increase both their phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity and, in turn, their fitness. To quantify fluctuations in the partitioning of cellular elements, imaging-based approaches are used, whose accuracy is limited by the difficulty of detecting cell divisions. Our work addresses this gap, proposing a general method based on high-throughput flow cytometry measurements coupled with a theoretical framework. We applied our method to a panel of both normal and cancerous human colon cells, showing that different kinds of colon adenocarcinoma cells display very distinct extents of fluctuations in their cytoplasm partition, explained by an asymmetric division of their size. To test the accuracy of our population-level protocol, we directly measure the inherited fractions of cellular elements from extensive time lapses of live-cell laser scanning microscopy, finding excellent agreement across the cell types. Ultimately, our flow cytometry-based method promises to be accurate and easily applicable to a wide range of biological systems where the quantification of partition fluctuations would help account for the observed phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>division noise</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>Caco2</kwd><kwd>HTC-116</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0472cxd90</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>855923</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruocco</surname><given-names>Giancarlo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05cx8cy07</institution-id><institution>European Innovation Council and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Executive Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101098989</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruocco</surname><given-names>Giancarlo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Italian Ministry of University and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>B53C24009530001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miotto</surname><given-names>Mattia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Center for Gene Therapy and Drugs based on RNA Technology financed by EU PNRR MUR</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>J33C22001130001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruocco</surname><given-names>Giancarlo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combining statistical modeling with flow cytometry enables reliable, high-throughput quantification of division asymmetry in live cells, revealing how partitioning noise may shape tumor cell heterogeneity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Asymmetric cell division refers to the mechanism by which a mother cell splits into two daughter cells with distinct cellular fates. As first shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conklin, 1905</xref>, this process is usually achieved by asymmetric inheritance of intrinsic determinants of cell fate, such as specific proteins or RNA, and plays a crucial role during the development of organisms, favoring cell differentiation and self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knoblich, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sunchu and Cabernard, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Increasing evidence is vouching for a more ubiquitous presence of fluctuations in the partitioning of cellular elements. In fact, asymmetric segregation has been observed in non-differentiating cell populations as different as bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mushnikov et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2015</xref>), and tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buss et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2024</xref>). In bacterial populations, differential segregation of cellular components has been linked to antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lindner et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katajisto et al., 2015</xref>, studying mitochondrial partition in stem-like mammalian epithelial cells, found that asymmetric segregation of older mitochondria enables cells to protect themselves from aging by preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins. In addition, asymmetric centrosome partition has been observed in stem cells from human neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer, controlled by polarity factors and influenced by the segregation of subcellular vesicles during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Izumi and Kaneko, 2012</xref>). To quantify the strength of fluctuations at division, the common route goes through fluorescence microscopy measurements of either fixed or live cells, where fluorescent dyes are used as a proxy for the cellular element of interest. The partition statistics are then estimated by looking at the fraction of fluorescence intensity inherited by the two daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dey-Guha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dey-Guha et al., 2015</xref>). This approach is, in principle, very informative and a lot of work has been done in recent years to write theoretical models of stochastic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beentjes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jia and Grima, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dessalles et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thomas, 2019</xref>) that can account for the coupling of noise sources and can even be extended to time-lapse microscopy data of single cell’s growing dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jia and Grima, 2021</xref>; however, relying on microscopy data implies the need for the (often manual) identification of hundreds of division events and in some cases even complex experimental setups and techniques where cells (usually bacteria) have to be followed for a great number of generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jia and Grima, 2021</xref>). These are highly time-consuming procedures that dampen the possibility of a wide characterization of the partition statistics of different cell types.</p><p>To cope with these limitations, we propose using high-throughput flow cytometry measurements to quantify fluctuations in the partitioning of cellular components in adherent cells. In particular, flow cytometry has already been applied to study asymmetric division in specific cellular systems: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2015</xref> sorted budding yeast cells to analyze the differential segregation of proteins between daughter cells, while Peruzzi and coworkers first applied multi-color flow cytometry to show that leukemia cells divide mitochondria and membrane proteins asymmetrically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peruzzi et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we generalized the protocol to adherent cell types and probed its accuracy by comparing the measured fluctuations to those observed with extensive time-lapse microscopy experiments on a panel of normal and cancerous epithelial cells.</p><p>Our work shows that (1) there is an exact analytical expression linking the inherited cellular component distribution dynamic to the specifics of the partition process. Based on this result, we (2) proposed an experimental protocol to tag with fluorescent dyes cellular components and measure the dynamics of fluorescent distribution, whose analysis allows accurate estimates of the degree of asymmetry in the partition process. Applying our method to a panel of normal and cancerous human colon cells, we found that (3) different lines of colon adenocarcinoma display very distinct extents of fluctuations in cytoplasm partition, reflecting in (4) different degrees of asymmetric division of their size.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Modeling cell population dynamics in the presence of partitioning noise</title><p>In this section, we propose a theoretical framework that is able to describe the evolution of the fluorescence intensity of a cell population stained with a live fluorescent marker, by uncovering its dependence on the underlying partitioning process to which single cells are subjected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a-c</xref>). The rationale is that, if cells follow a common division rule, knowing the shape of the mother distribution, it should be able to determine the daughters’ one. By iterating this computation, one can trace the whole proliferation. The specificity of our approach lies in its specific design for live fluorescent markers. The selected component is tagged through a staining procedure with fluorophores that persist in the cell and its daughter cells, as long as the targeted protein is not degraded.</p><p>Monitoring the time evolution of the abundance of specific cellular elements over multiple divisions in single-cell experiments, it is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soltani et al., 2016</xref>) that the counts of a component have a qualitatively similar dynamic to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>. Indeed, variations in the number of components are determined by (1) the production and degradation processes along the duration of the cell growth phase; and (2) non-identical apportioning of the components between the two daughter cells. Here, we will assume that the number of components varies only due to partition events and look for a quantitative description of the evolution of the element distribution. By neglecting variability in division times and the intercurrent production and degradation of components, we are reducing the dynamics to a progressive dilution. The stability of our model with respect to these assumptions will be studied in the following section and more in detail in the Appendix. Note that it is possible to model the complete growth and division process (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miotto et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scalise et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jia and Grima, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thomas, 2018</xref>), but it is more difficult to separate the different sources of noise.

The next section will be devoted to demonstrating how this condition can be exploited in experiments to measure the partition noise component and to evaluate the stability of our assumptions with respect to the concurrence of the other noise sources (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Measuring fluctuations via flow cytometry</title><p>As shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peruzzi et al., 2021</xref> for leukemia cells growing in suspension, it is possible to use flow cytometry to follow the evolution of properly marked cellular elements in time. Here, we generalized the protocol considering a panel of colon cell lines, that is, Caco2, a human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line; HCT116, a human colorectal carcinoma cell line; and CCD18Co, a normal human colon fibroblast cell line. To measure the degree of asymmetric division, we marked cells’ cytoplasm via a fluorescent dye and followed its dilution through successive generations. As explained in detail in Materials and methods, the experimental procedure we used is based on the following main steps: staining of the selected compound, sorting of the initial population, plating, and acquisition of the distinct populations in the following days. The sorting allows us to obtain an initial population with a narrow peak at a specific fluorescence intensity, and it plays a dual role (an extended discussion can be found in the Appendix): it indirectly induces cell synchronization and enables a clearer reconstruction of the coexisting generations.</p><p>To achieve this, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate a specific cell population based on cell morphology and fluorescence intensity. The sorted population is divided into distinct wells, one per acquisition, in equal numbers and kept under identical growth conditions to mitigate inoculum-dependent variability among samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enrico Bena et al., 2021</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> shows an example of the time course dynamics obtained with HCT116 cells (see Methods for details). Each distribution represents a different acquisition of a whole well at increasing times from plating (0–84 hr from the bottom to the top). It is possible to neatly observe the succession of peaks associated with different generations that succeed one another and the average decrease of the fluorescence intensity. Note that different generations can coexist at the same time point. One can spot the flow of cells toward higher generations and the behavior of the peak heights, which grow over time, reach dominance, and then decay. The shift on the <italic>y</italic>-axis allows us to follow the evolutionary dynamics while being able to see the overlapping of the same generation at different time points.

The outcomes of the fitting procedure on the time course dynamic for all the replicas of the three studied cell lines are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>. To evaluate the degree of asymmetry, we have defined the <italic>division asymmetry</italic> as the percentage of the coefficient of variation of the obtained partition distribution (CV: <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf75"><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:math><tex-math id="inft75">\begin{document}$\frac{\sigma}{\mu}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>). In particular, Caco2 and CCD18Co cells show a higher level of asymmetry with respect to HCT116. As already stated in the description of the theoretical model, we consider only partitioning noise and neglect other potential sources: (1) production and degradation processes, and (2) variability in cell cycle length. Since we use non-endogenous live fluorescent dyes, production processes are excluded by definition, while degradation results in a negligible time-dependent decrease in mean fluorescence intensity as the used dyes are optimized to maintain stable fluorescence levels for the duration of the experiment. Indeed, by looking at the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, the values of the measured <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf76"><mml:msub><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="inft76">\begin{document}$\mu_{g}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> seem to only fluctuate around the theoretical line, but with the same slope, indicating that degradation can be neglected without major consequences. The effects of correlations between the inherited fractions of cellular components and the fluctuations in the duration of the cell cycle are, in principle, more difficult to disentangle. In this respect, it is widely known that cells adjust their growth/division strategy to mitigate size fluctuations at division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thomas, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miotto et al., 2024</xref>). According to the ‘sizer’ model, they divide upon reaching a certain size so that smaller cells, that is, those that inherit a smaller fraction of their mother’s volume, will have longer division times and vice versa. This results in fluctuations in the cell division times that may be coupled with partitioning noise.</p><p>To assess the robustness of our model under such conditions, we performed simulations assuming that cells follow a sizer-like division strategy, while the marked component partition perfectly matches the cell size partition (see Appendix for more details). This scenario maximizes the coupling between the two noise sources.

Specifically, we aimed to follow a growing cell colony over time, detect divisions, evaluate the fluorescence intensity of mother and daughter cells, and calculate the inherited fraction. The detailed experimental procedure is described in the Materials and methods. Briefly, cells are stained for the cytoplasm and are plated at low density (approximately 10<sup>3</sup> cells/well) on IBIDI cell imaging chambers (μ-Slide 4 and 8 wells). After 24 hr (sufficient time for complete cell adhesion to the slide), the wells are washed, the media is renewed, and live imaging acquisition time-lapse is started. Multiple fields are followed in each well, and for each field, we acquire a z-stack brightfield and fluorescence image (a single plane is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) at constant intervals (20 min) for 3 days. The fields are manually selected at the beginning of the acquisition based on cell density and fluorescence intensity. The recorded time lapses have been manually analyzed to identify divisions. A sample outcome of the analysis procedure is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>. The total fluorescence of the cells is displayed as a function of time, before and after the division. The mother cell fluorescence decays exponentially over time, and at division, it halves due to components partitioning between the two daughters. In this specific case, we can observe that the fraction of cytoplasm inherited by the two cells is not equal, indicating an asymmetrical division.

Moreover, (2) we removed all dynamics that showed an absolute Pearson correlation value between luminosity and pixel size higher than 0.9 as a function of time (see Appendix). In fact, single cell’s pixel size, which corresponds to the cell size projection on the focal plane, is found to shrink before mitosis and to enlarge after division. Fluorescent intensity is instead proportional to the number of stained cytoplasmic proteins, which are expected to remain constant (except for a constant decay of the fluorescence).

The model makes no assumptions about the shape of the partitioning distribution and, in its general form, accounts only for the effect of distribution variance in shaping the population dynamics. Indeed, we cannot yet distinguish between divisions which are biased, defined by a partitioning distribution with peak values different from 1/2 (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> for Caco2 and CCD18Co cells) or symmetric ones (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> for HCT-116 cells) which though have higher fluctuations. Also, apart from measuring it, we want to propose a qualitative interpretation of the obtained level of asymmetry. We start by recalling that our experimental protocol uses dyes that bind a-specifically to cytoplasmic amines. Thus, (1) it is expected to be uniformly distributed in the cellular cytoplasmic space and (2) the number of labeled cytoplasmic components can be considered large. With this hypothesis, the least complex model one can assume is a binomial one with parameter <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf96"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft96">\begin{document}$p$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>, measuring the bias in the process.

In this respect, gene expression noise has been extensively characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>), incorporating cell cycle effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thomas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Swain et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2004</xref>), as well as the different strategies that cells evolved to regulate the extent of the noise in these channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miotto, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Besides such noise sources, proliferating cells are subject to the fluctuations originating from the partition of cellular elements at division. Analysis of this partition noise highlighted that under some circumstances, its contribution exceeds the others in creating heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huh and Paulsson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soltani et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, asymmetrically dividing cells can produce daughters that differ in size, cellular components, and, in turn, fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chhabra and Booth, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In this framework, the origin of such asymmetry may be ascribed to the basal stochasticity of molecular processes taking place at different levels during the division and/or to specific, evolutionarily conserved mechanisms used by cells to control cell fate and generate diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sunchu and Cabernard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miotto and Monacelli, 2020</xref>). In fact, asymmetric partitioning of components alters the initial counts of molecules in the following cell cycle, which can lead the system to a different phenotypic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moris et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miotto et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we show that an accurate determination of partition fluctuations can be obtained via standard flow cytometry measurements of properly marked cell populations. Our approach is easier and faster with respect to the use of microscopy imaging, which requires the acquisition and analysis of extensive recordings of the cells, ultimately limiting the reachable statistics. In addition, it is specifically designed to isolate partitioning noise from other sources via the usage of non-endogenous dyes to target cell components.</p><p>Although the need to use live fluorescent dyes to track proliferation surely limits the extent of applicability of our method to markable components, we anticipate that there are numerous contexts in which our approach could give a determining insight. For instance, organelles such as mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, peroxisomes, and centrosomes can be easily marked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peruzzi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miotto et al., 2025</xref>) and their unequal distribution between daughter cells has been observed to provoke functional differences that influence their fate. In this respect, asymmetric division of mitochondria in stem cells is associated with the retention of stemness traits in one daughter cell and differentiation in the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katajisto et al., 2015</xref>) and, although the functional consequences are not yet fully determined, with therapeutic resistance in cancer stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hitomi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">García-Heredia and Carnero, 2020</xref>). Asymmetric inheritance of lysosomes, together with mitochondria, appears to play a crucial role in determining the fate of human blood stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loeffler et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, our approach could be extended to investigate cell growth dynamics and the origins of cell size homeostasis in adherent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miotto et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miotto et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kussell and Leibler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McGranahan and Swanton, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Martino et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we measured the segregation statistics of the cytoplasm of different colon cell types, finding that they are neatly distinct. Caco2 cells exhibit the highest degree of cytoplasmic partition fluctuations, while HCT116 division is the one with the lowest asymmetry. It is interesting to note that normal colon fibroblasts sit in between, suggesting that the cancer-associated deregulation of the normal cell activities leads to the reactivation of asymmetric cell division in a cancer-specific manner. Indeed, Caco2 cells are known to display a markedly heterogeneous distribution of phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lea, 2015</xref>). Notably, comparing the degree of asymmetry in the division of the cytoplasm in the three different analyzed cell types, we found that microscopy-derived fluctuations are systematically higher than those measured by flow cytometry. While this could be linked to the different protocols used, it seems more probable that the difference is due to a systematic overestimation of the fluctuations measured by microscopy. Indeed, we identified at least two possible origins of such bias: fluctuations in the fluorescence intensity measures and errors in the segmentation protocol. Regarding the first one, we demonstrated its effect through simple simulations that mimicked the microscopy analysis. While for the second, relying on manual segmentation not only reduces the data but might also introduce biased cell identification errors. Both these effects become important when data filtering is only partially allowed due to the low available statistics. A discussion on this topic is proposed in the Appendix.</p><p>We have assessed the stability of our model with respect to perturbations arising from the co-occurrence of multiple noise sources. In particular, we explored the case where fluctuations at division and variability in cell cycle length are dependent. In particular, we investigated a strongly coupled scenario in which division is triggered upon reaching a specific size (sizer strategy) and partitioning fluctuations correspond to size inheritance. We observed that—even under this extreme condition—our approach yields reliable parameter estimates that remain consistent with the experimental error. Moreover, we observed coupling-dependent increase in <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf141"><mml:msub><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="inft141">\begin{document}$\mu_{g}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> for newer generations. This observation opens new questions and potential applications for our method.</p><p>Finally, to get insights into the possible mechanisms behind the observed asymmetries, we looked for a specific shape of the partition distribution. Following a maximum entropy approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bialek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miotto and Monacelli, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miotto and Monacelli, 2021</xref>), we started by considering the distribution that employs the fewest assumptions about the system, that is, we consider independent segregation, which directly maps into binomial partitioning. Indeed, this is a common assumption in segregation models that traces back to the pioneering works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berg, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rigney, 1979</xref>. Notably, our results indicated biased segregations with colon cancer cells displaying different levels of biases. To explain their origin, we looked at the relative sizes of the daughter cells right after division. The found correlation between daughter sizes and the fractions of inherited fluorescence vouches size as the origin of the observed biased segregation.</p><p>In conclusion, by combining experimental data with statistical modeling, we show how it is possible to use flow cytometry data to extract reliable estimates of the strength of fluctuations during cell division. Our approach has the potential to be applied to different cell types, where a quantification of the level of division asymmetries that daughter cells can experience may provide new insights into the mechanisms of asymmetric cell division and its role in cancer heterogeneity and plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Cell lines were purchased from ATCC and were routinely checked for mycoplasma contamination.

Model’s stability to concurrence of noise sources</title><p>In the General model formulation (Section A), we have made the strong assumption of neglecting all the noise sources affecting component’s count, but for the partitioning noise. In this section, we want to clarify the reasons for this assumption and evaluate the stability of our method in the presence and co-occurrence of other noises.</p><p>A cell proliferation cycle is affected by different sources of variability: (1) production and degradation processes of molecules; (2) variability in length of the cell cycle; and (3) partitioning noise, which identifies asymmetric inheritance of components between the two daughter cells. However, the experimental approach and the model have been formulated so as to specifically address the effects of partitioning noise. Indeed, since we are dealing with components tagged via live fluorescent markers, production of new fluorophores is impossible and can therefore be discarded. Instead, the degradation process is a global effect that influences the behavior of the mean of the distribution in a time-dependent manner. However, by looking at the experimental data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of the main text, no significant depletion of fluorescence is observed, or at least it is hidden by the experimental fluctuations of the measure. Instead, a more careful evaluation has to be done for what concerns fluctuation in cell cycle length. We reasoned that in the assumption of independence between the noise sources, variability in cell cycle length would affect the timing of population emergence but not the intrinsic properties of those populations (e.g., Gaussian variance). To test this hypothesis, we conducted two sets of simulations. In the first, we assumed the aforementioned independence between fluctuations in cell cycle length and partitioning noise. We modeled the cells’ proliferation with an event-driven algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gillespie, 1977</xref>). To each cell is associated a division time drawn from an Erlang distribution (mean = 18 hr, <italic>k</italic> = 4) and a number that corresponds to the stained component at time 0, which is extracted from a Gaussian distribution (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf164"><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi class="MJX-tex-caligraphic" mathvariant="script">N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:math><tex-math id="inft164">\begin{document}$\mathcal{N}(\mu_{0},\sigma_{0})$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>).

Under the assumption of independence between these different noise sources, no significant effects were observed, and we are able to perfectly reconstruct the dynamic with our theoretical model. The second set of simulations considered a situation in which the cell’s components and division time are coupled. Indeed, cells may adopt different growth and division strategies, which can be grouped into three categories based on what triggers division:</p><list list-type="bullet" id="list1"><list-item><p>Sizer-like cells divide upon reaching a certain size.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Timer-like cells divide after a fixed time (corresponding to the previously treated case with independent noise).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Adder-like cells divide once their volume has increased by a finite amount.</p></list-item></list><p>A detailed discussion of these strategies, including their mathematical formulation, can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miotto et al., 2024</xref>, to which we refer the reader for further information.

As can be observed, higher levels of division asymmetry increase the fluctuations of the system relative to the analytically expected behavior, particularly in later generations. As previously noted, the distribution of components for a given generation is both populated and depleted from the top, which affects both the variance and the mean. This explains the greater discrepancy between expected and observed measurements in higher generations. Indeed, the population has not had sufficient time to fully proliferate, resulting in an incomplete sampling and thus a biased estimate of the distribution’s properties.</p><p>Therefore, we assessed the accuracy of the method in reconstructing the strength of fluctuations (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf182"><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="inft182">\begin{document}$\sigma_{f}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) by fitting the simulation results with the analytical expression in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ41">Equation 31</xref> and comparing them with the true values. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. As expected, the error in reconstructing the variance of the partitioning distribution increases with the level of asymmetry, reaching up to 20% for the most asymmetric case. This indicates that noise coupling has a significant effect on the uncertainty of our methodology. However, even under the extreme assumption of maximum coupling between partitioning noise and division time, the resulting uncertainty remains within the range of experimental noise (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> in the main text). Moreover, due to the direction of the bias introduced by the coupling, the method can only underestimate the true asymmetry, making our estimate a conservative lower bound. In conclusion, while noise coupling does impact the measurement, its effect remains well within the error margins already accounted for.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>C. Modeling partition as a binomial process</title><p>The model we have developed enables a robust characterization of partitioning noise, as confirmed by two independent sets of experiments. By exploiting the high-throughput capabilities of flow cytometry, we can reliably measure the variance of the partitioning distribution by tracking the proliferation dynamics of an entire cell population. However, the general framework does not allow for a complete reconstruction of the partitioning distribution. A degeneracy remains in identifying the source of asymmetry. Indeed, by measuring only the variance, we gain no information about whether the process is biased. The distribution could be broad and symmetric, or narrow and asymmetric. HCT-116 and Caco2 may represent respective examples of these scenarios. In this section, we aim to resolve this degeneracy by introducing an additional assumption about the shape of the partitioning distribution.</p><p>We begin by recalling that the dyes used bind non-specifically to cytoplasmic amines. As a result, (1) the fluorescence is expected to be uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasmic space, and (2) the number of labeled cytoplasmic components can be considered large.

Gating strategy</title><p>The gating strategy plays a fundamental role in our model. Indeed, the ability to distinguish different cell generations based on the fluorescence intensity distribution at a given time point in the time course strongly depends on the degree of overlap between these distributions. The greater the overlap, the less accurately the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) can separate them. This overlap is influenced by the coefficients of variation (CV) of both the partitioning distribution and the initial component distribution. Specifically, the fluorescence intensity distribution at time <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf215"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft215">\begin{document}$t$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> results from the convolution of the distribution at time <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf216"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:math><tex-math id="inft216">\begin{document}$t-1$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> with the partitioning distribution function. Therefore, the balance between partitioning asymmetry and the width of the initial component distribution is crucial. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, we simulated the proliferation of a cell population and plotted the distribution of cell components at a specific time point, distinguishing different generations by varying shades of blue. Increasing the CV of either distribution reduces the ability to distinguish between generations. However, the variance of the initial distribution cannot be reduced arbitrarily. While selecting a narrower distribution facilitates better reconstruction of the generations, it also limits the number of cells available for the experiment. Consequently, for components exhibiting a high level of asymmetry, further narrowing of the initial distribution becomes experimentally impractical. In such cases, an approach previously tested on liquid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peruzzi et al., 2021</xref>) involves applying the GMM in two dimensions by co-staining another cellular component with lower division asymmetry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s12"><title>E. Noise overestimation with time-lapse fluorescent microscopy</title><p>In the main document, we argue that the limited statistics available from time-lapse fluorescence microscopy may explain its tendency to overestimate fluctuations in cell division when compared to flow cytometry. In this section, we aim to provide some arguments regarding this hypothesis. We identified at least two phenomena that go in the direction of producing an overestimation and that affect microscopy and not flow cytometry measurements. The first regards the inherent fluctuations in the single-cell fluorescence intensity measures. This variability adds to the inherent stochasticity of the partitioning process, thereby increasing the overall variance of the distribution. To illustrate this effect, we simulated variability in microscopy data and consecutively evaluated the effect in the inherited fraction estimation.

Each histogram is the distribution of the obtained variances of the noisy and noise-free dynamics. By looking at the mean of the distribution, we can see how, on average, the estimated variance is greater than the true one. The magnitude of this increase depends on the properties of the added noise, but the bias is always toward larger values.</p><p>The distributions and simulations presented here are intended solely to demonstrate the direction of the bias, not to precisely account for the observed difference between flow cytometry and microscopy estimates in real data.

A major limitation of the microscopy-based approach is the need for manual image segmentation, which reduces the amount of usable data and introduces potential errors. Although several checks were applied, some issues are unavoidable. For example, when daughter cells are very close to one another, borders may not be clearly identified; cells may overlap; or speckles may be overlooked. In such cases, overestimation of fluorescence is more likely than underestimation, thereby increasing the probability of extreme events. Segmentation relies on both brightfield and fluorescence images. Hence, errors in defining cell outlines are more likely when fluorescence is low, since borders or overlaps become more difficult to distinguish if both cells are dark. This introduces an additional bias toward higher asymmetries, increasing the frequency of events in the tails of the partitioning distribution. Both sources of bias could be mitigated by increasing the available statistics. In particular, applying stricter selection criteria—such as setting limits on fluorescence intensity fluctuations—would help the measured distribution converge toward the expected one. By contrast, these issues do not arise in flow cytometry experiments. From the initial sorting procedure, which ensures a cleaner separation of peaks, to the morphological checks performed at each acquisition step, the availability of a large number of measured events reduces both measurement noise and segmentation errors.</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104528.4.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>eLife Assessment</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Brugués</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Technische Universität Dresden</institution><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="evidence-strength"><kwd>Convincing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="claim-importance"><kwd>Useful</kwd></kwd-group></front-stub><body><p>This study presents a <bold>useful</bold> method based on flow cytometry to study partitioning noise during cell division.

In the previous answer, we focused on the role of the gating strategy, highlighting how the limited statistics available with microscopy reduce the chances of a stronger selection of the events. The explanation for why the noise is biased toward increasing the estimation of division asymmetry relies on multiple aspects: First, due to the multiple sources of noise affecting fluorescence intensity, the experimental procedure, and the segmentation protocol, the measurements of the fluorescence intensity of single cells fluctuate. This variability adds to the inherent stochasticity of the partitioning process, thereby increasing the overall variance of the distribution.</p><p>To illustrate this effect, we simulated the microscopy data. We extracted a fraction f from a Gaussian distribution with mean µ = 𝑝 and standard deviation σ = σ<sub>𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒</sub> , i.e. 𝑁(𝑝, σ<sub>𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒</sub>). We then simulated different time frames by adding noise drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean µ = 0 and standard deviation σ = σ<sub>𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒</sub> , i.e., 𝑁(0, σ<sub>𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒</sub>), to f. An equal process was applied to 1 − f. The added noise was resampled so that the two measurements remained independent. Figure 6 shows a sample dynamic where the empty gray circles represent the true fractions. We then fitted the two dynamics to a linear equation with a common slope and obtained an estimate of the partitioning noise.</p><p>By repeating this process a number of times consistent with the experiment, we measured the resulting standard deviation of the new partitioning distribution. Figure 7 shows the distribution of the measured standard deviation over multiple repetitions of the simulations. Each histogram is the variance of the partitioning distribution obtained from 100 simulations of the noisy (and non noisy) fluorescence dynamic. By comparing this with the distribution of the standard deviation of the non-noisy dynamics, it is possible to observe that, on average, the added noise leads to a greater estimated variance. The magnitude of this increase depends on the variance of the added noise, but it is always biased toward larger values.</p><p>This represents only one component of the effect. The shown distributions and simulations are intended solely to demonstrate the direction of the bias, and not to account for the exact difference between the flow cytometry and microscopy estimates. In the proposed case, where noise and true variance are equal, the resulting difference in division asymmetry is 1.3.</p><p>A second contribution arises from the segmentation protocol. As we stated, a major limitation of the microscopy-based approach is the need for manual image segmentation. This reduces the amount of available data and introduces potential errors. Even though different checks were applied, some situations are difficult to avoid. For example, when daughter cells are very close to each other, the borders may not be precisely recognized; cells may overlap; or speckles may remain undetected. In all these cases, it is easier to overestimate the fluorescence than to underestimate it, thereby increasing the chance of an extremal event.</p><p>Indeed, segmentation relies on both brightfield and fluorescence images. Errors in defining the cell outline are more likely when fluorescence is low, since borders, overlaps, and speckles are more evident against a darker background. This introduces an additional bias toward higher asymmetry, increasing the number of events in the tail of the partitioning distribution.</p><p>Both aspects described above could be mitigated by increasing the available statistics. In particular, by applying stricter selection criteria, such as imposing limits on fluorescence intensity fluctuations, the distribution should approach the expected one.</p><p>A similar issue does not arise in flow cytometry experiments. From the initial sorting procedure, which ensures a cleaner separation of peaks, to the morphological checks performed at each acquisition point, the availability of a large number of measured events reduces both measurement noise and segmentation errors.</p><p>A discussion on these aspects has been added in the revised version of the Supplementary Materials and in the Main Text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
