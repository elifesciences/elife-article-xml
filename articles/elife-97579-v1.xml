Established therapies of parathyroid hormone (PTH) analogs effectively promote bone formation and reduce fractures in severe osteoporosis, but their use is limited by potential adverse effects. In the pursuit of safer osteoporosis treatments, we investigated <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, a PTH variant wherein the native arginine at position 25 is substituted by cysteine. These studies were prompted by our finding of high bone mineral density in a hypoparathyroidism patient with the R25C homozygous mutation, and we explored its effects on PTH type-1 receptor (PTH1R) signaling in cells and bone metabolism in mice. Our findings indicate that <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–84) forms dimers both intracellularly and extracellularly, and the synthetic dimeric peptide, <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34), exhibits altered activity in PTH1R-mediated cyclic AMP (cAMP) response. Upon a single injection in mice, dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) induced acute calcemic and phosphaturic responses comparable to PTH(1–34). Furthermore, repeated daily injections increased calvarial bone thickness in intact mice and improved trabecular and cortical bone parameters in ovariectomized (OVX) mice, akin to PTH(1–34). The overall results reveal a capacity of a dimeric PTH peptide ligand to activate the PTH1R in vitro and in vivo as PTH, suggesting a potential path of therapeutic PTH analog development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>parathyroid hormone</kwd><kwd>PTH type-1 receptor</kwd><kwd>bone formation</kwd><kwd>osteoporosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022R1A2C3006002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Sihoon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002631</institution-id><institution>Gachon University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRD2023-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Sihoon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022R1F1A1074610</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Hunsang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022R1A4A1025913</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Hunsang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RS-2023-00217798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Soo Young</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021R1A2C3003675</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Soo Young</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022R1A2C1006105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Je-Yong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002642</institution-id><institution>Korea University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Noh</surname><given-names>Minsoo</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Hunsang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel mutant, <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, derived from a hypoparathyroidism patient, can form a dimer that activates PTH1R and enhances bone formation in female mice similar to PTH despite altered molecular properties.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoporosis is a prevalent global bone disorder characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD), causing weakened bones leading to fragility fractures, particularly in the spine, hip, and wrist. The development of osteoporosis is influenced by factors including gender, being more prevalent in women; hormonal changes, like decreased estrogen levels during menopause; and age, with heightened susceptibility postmenopause in women contributing to bone loss. Recent meta-analysis of previous studies indicates a global osteoporosis prevalence of 23.1% among women and 11.7% among men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sözen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salari et al., 2021</xref>). Osteoporosis stands as a noteworthy risk factor over the age of 50 years that poses challenges to the preservation of autonomous mobility and overall well-being within an aging society. There is thus a pressing need for safe and efficacious therapies for osteoporosis that mitigate fractures, alleviate associated symptoms, and preserve physical functionality.</p><p>Antiresorptive agents (e.g. bisphosphonates and denosumab) and romosozumab encompass a therapeutic approach that aims to specifically counteract the declines in bone mass by tempering the balance between bone resorption and formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Papapoulos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reid et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McClung et al., 2014</xref>). It is pertinent to acknowledge, however, that the prolonged use of most of such agents is limited due to potential long-term side effects. Furthermore, antiresorptive therapies cannot stimulate new bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cosman et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, bone anabolic agents, such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and its analogs, such as teriparatide (recombinant human PTH(1–34)), increase BMD by stimulating bone formation more than bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 2021</xref>). PTH has an exceptionally short half-life in the blood of approximately 2–4 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bieglmayer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maier et al., 1998</xref>), which helps in avoiding excessive increases in blood calcium levels that can otherwise limit the utility of PTH-related medications, while yet inducing a desired anabolic effect on bone. It is also worth noting that studies in rodents reveal that long-term administration of a PTH anabolic agent can lead to bone overgrowth, osteosarcoma, as well as hypercalcemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vahle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Appelman-Dijkstra and Papapoulos, 2016</xref>). Consequently, a goal of ongoing research is to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms driving the anabolic and catabolic effects of PTH to thereby secure more effective therapeutic alternatives for osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khosla and Hofbauer, 2017</xref>).</p><p>PTH is produced and secreted by the parathyroid glands as a straight-chain monomeric polypeptide of 84 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moallem et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Silver et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Goodman, 2004</xref>). It plays a vital role in maintaining calcium and phosphate equilibrium by acting on the PTH1R, a class B G protein-coupled receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Habener et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Veldurthy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kiela and Ghishan, 2009</xref>) that is expressed primarily in cells of bone and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jüppner et al., 1991</xref>). The orchestrated downstream effects of PTH in target cells act to ensure optimal bone health and the maintenance of the ambient blood calcium and phosphate concentrations required for proper nerve conduction, muscle activity, and systemic cellular communication, whereas disturbances in this system can lead to multiple disorders.</p><p>Central to the PTH signaling cascade is the activation of intracellular G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gardella and Jüppner, 2000</xref>), most prominently Gsα, which in turn activates transmembrane adenylyl cyclases, leading to the synthesis of the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP), and the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weinstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feinstein et al., 2011</xref>). PTH can also activate other second messenger cascades, including the Gαq/phospholipase C/inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, diacylglycerol, and protein kinase C signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iida-Klein et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunlay and Hruska, 1990</xref>), highlighting the diverse biology of PTH and the PTH1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abou-Samra et al., 1992</xref>). Adding to this paradigm, the PTH1R also mediates the actions of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), a development protein that acts in the formation of bones and other tissues. PTHrP shares considerable sequence homology with PTH in the first 34 amino acids, which encompass the receptor-binding portions of the two respective ligands. The PTH1R thus has an intrinsic capacity for dual ligand recognition, which opens possibilities for exploring new modes of therapeutic development for diseases such as osteoporosis and hypoparathyroidism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jüppner et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gardella and Jüppner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bone et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rubin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Winer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Winer et al., 2018</xref>). Pharmacologically, the PTH1R can adopt at least two distinct ligand-binding conformations, RG and R<sup>0</sup>, the selectivity for which can lead to altered modes of signaling in vitro and in vivo for peptides such as PTH, PTHrP, and various hybrid analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okazaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pioszak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheloha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoare et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dean et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The current study extends our prior investigation in which we identified in a patient with chronic hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia with a mutation that changes the arginine at position 25 in the mature PTH(1–84) polypeptide to cysteine (<sup>R25C</sup>PTH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae et al., 2016</xref>). Antibody assays revealed the <sup>R25C</sup>PTH mutant protein to be present in the patient’s blood at markedly elevated levels. We now have found that this patient expressing the <sup>R25C</sup>PTH variant has higher-than-normal BMD for age and sex. We further characterize the <sup>R25C</sup>PTH protein and find that it can manifest in two distinct molecular forms: as a monomer and as a dimer, and we demonstrate that a dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) synthetic peptide retains agonistic properties on the PTH1R that are driven by a moderate selectivity for the RG versus R<sup>0</sup> receptor conformation. Finally, we demonstrate in mice that <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) can induce skeletal responses that are similar to those induced by PTH(1–34), but without triggering an excessive hypercalcemic response. Considering the proven bone anabolic capacity of several established PTH agonist ligands, and the need for safe, long-term treatments for skeletal disorders, our studies on dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) suggest alternative strategies to consider in such drug development programs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dimerization of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–84)</title><p>In our previous studies, we showed that synthetic monomeric peptide, <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34), as compared to PTH(1–34), exhibits a moderately diminished PTH1R-binding affinity and decreased cAMP signaling potency in vitro, and that with long-term infusion in mice, <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) leads to only minimal calcemic and phosphaturic effects, which corroborates the hypocalcemia seen in the original patient, despite the significantly elevated levels of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH in the plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). In subsequent analysis of this patient, we found a particularly high BMD for age and sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which prompted us to further characterize the functional properties of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, as described herein. We produced recombinant PTH(1–84) with or without the R25C mutation by expression of the corresponding cDNA in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

This dimerization was surprisingly compatible with receptor-binding affinity and led to relatively minor deviations in functional behavior as assessed in our cell-based assays and compared to the standard monomeric control PTH peptide. The homozygous <sup>R25C</sup>PTH mutation was identified in patients who presented with hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, despite elevated PTH levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2022</xref>), and the mutation was found to impact the bioactive region of PTH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parkinson and Thakker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sunthornthepvarakul et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ertl et al., 2012</xref>). Our initial research on this <sup>R25C</sup>PTH mutant focused on the monomeric state of the peptide, and these studies revealed relatively moderate decreases in PTH1R-binding affinity and cAMP-stimulating potency in vitro and moderately impaired calcemic effects upon infusion in mice. Additional clinical observations, however, revealed the patients to have a higher BMD than anticipated for age-matched averages. This elevated bone mass, coupled with the elevated serum PTH levels, prompted our further investigations into the properties of the mutant PTH, as described herein.</p><p>Our investigations brought to light the capacity of the cysteine-25 mutation to induce dimer formation in the otherwise monomeric PTH polypeptide as produced in transfected cells. This result was established by comparing western blots of transfected cell lysates analyzed under reducing versus non-reducing conditions of gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, we employed synthetic peptides to further explore the functional properties of dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34). The results of our current studies show some divergence from our previous findings obtained using the monomeric counterpart, <sup>R25C</sup>PTH (1–34). Compared to the monomer, dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) exhibited a more preferential binding affinity for the RG versus R<sup>0</sup> PTH1R conformation, despite a diminished affinity for either conformation. We also observed that the potency of cAMP production in cells was lower for dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH as compared to the monomeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, in accordance with a lower PTH1R-binding affinity. Previous reports indicated that a mutation at the 25th position of PTH results in the loss of calcium ion allosteric effects on monomeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, leading to faster ligand dissociation, rapid receptor recycling, and a shorter cAMP time course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">White, 2019</xref>). Correspondingly, the weaker receptor affinity and reduced cAMP production observed in dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH suggest a possibility that the formation of a disulfide bond at the 25th position significantly alters the function of PTH as a PTH1R ligand. While these structural effects are not yet fully understood and need to be investigated further.</p><p>We further pursued in vivo applications in mice. We assessed the calcemic and phosphatemic responses to a single injection of synthetic peptides of either PTH(1–34) or dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) in intact mice. We found the dimer could induce increases in plasma calcium levels that were at least as robust and as sustained as those induced by PTH(1–34) and were similarly phosphaturic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Activation of the canonical Gαs-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway is generally thought to underlie most of the biological responses induced by PTH1R activation, and our studies in SGS-72 cells confirm that dimeric PTH can activate this pathway, albeit not as efficiently as a monomeric PTH peptide. Arg25 resides in the 20–34 (C-terminal region) of PTH(1–34), which plays a significant role in the binding of the ligand to the extracellular domain (ECD) of the PTH1R. In concert with the binding of the 20–24 region of PTH to the ECD, the N-terminal portion of PTH engages the transmembrane domain of the PTH1R, inducing the conformational changes involved in G protein coupling and cAMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dean et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhai et al., 2022</xref>). The precise binding mode used by dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH to the PTH1R is unknown, but it may be anticipated that it differs to some extent from that used by the monomeric peptide, due, for example, to the changes in bulk molecular size and display of accessible functional groups. Consequently, the receptor conformational changes and the modes of coupling to downstream effectors may differ for the monomeric versus dimeric ligands, which could potentially lead to altered signaling and biological responses in vivo. Whether such changes account for the increased bone density observed in the patient with the homozygous <sup>R25C</sup>PTH mutation remains unknown, but cannot be presently ruled out.</p><p>The results of practical assessments of dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) for effects on calvarial bone after short-term (6 days) injection into normal mice, and for effects on bone mass after long-term (4 weeks) daily injection in osteoporotic OVX mice demonstrate the dimer can mediate significant influences on bone metabolism alike to wild-type PTH. In OVX mice, PTH and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH significantly increased bone formation markers P1NP and ALP. However, wild-type PTH, but not dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, decreased bone resorption markers such as TRAP staining and CTX-1 levels, suggesting different effects of wild-type monomeric PTH and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH. In this study, the increase of bone resorption markers of dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH compared to PTH may be one reason for low bone strength. In addition, the data showed an increase in cortical bone area (Ct.Ar) in the PTH treatment group but not in the PTH dimer treatment group. However, both dimeric and monomeric PTH treatments reduced total tissue area (Tt.Ar), suggesting potential effects on bone growth in the width of mice or humans. While further investigation is necessary, the current experimental data, along with patient symptoms showing no bone resorption despite lifelong exposure to high levels of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, imply that the dimeric form of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH can provide a new insight into PTH and PTH analogs with distinct functionalities compared to the wild-type PTH.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, it is urgently necessary to determine whether dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH is present in human patient serum. Second, TRAP staining showed an inhibitory effect of PTH treatment on the primary spongiosa area. However, the secondary spongiosa, which more accurately reflects bone remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jilka, 2007</xref>), was not examined due to the barely detectable bone in this area in OVX-induced osteoporosis mouse models. Third, it is unclear whether similar bone phenotypes exist in patients versus in mice treated with dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, particularly regarding low bone strength. Although the dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH-treated group showed higher cortical BMD compared to WT-Sham or PTH groups, there was no difference in bone strength compared to the osteoporotic mouse model. Fourth, our study demonstrated that PTH or <sup>R25C</sup>PTH treatment decreased circumferential length, which could affect bone growth in width. However, whether this phenotype is also observed in patients treated with PTH or <sup>R25C</sup>PTH remains uncertain. Finally, we did not analyze the <sup>R25C</sup>PTH mutant mouse model, which would allow us to compare phenotypes that most closely resemble those of human patients.</p><p>Interestingly, the recent identification of a young patient in Denmark displaying homozygous <sup>R25C</sup>PTH has opened avenues for observing the direct impacts of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH within the human biological system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2022</xref>). The continual monitoring and observation of patients will contribute to a more profound comprehension of the long-term consequences associated with <sup>R25C</sup>PTH exposure. This extensive observation is crucial in delineating the extended effects of this compound on individuals. Consequently, by conducting thorough investigations to confirm the potential bone anabolic effect of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, we hope to develop a novel bone anabolic agent with a targeted focus on the PTH1R.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The coding sequences (CDS) of pre-pro-PTH and the mutated form, <sup>R56C</sup>pre-pro-PTH[<sup>R25C</sup>PTH], were amplified using primers containing the attB site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Subsequently, we embedded the dehydrated femurs or vertebrates in methyl methacrylate (Sigma) to prepare resin blocks. The resin blocks were sectioned at 6 μm thick by using a Leica SP1600 microtome (Leica Microsystems, Germany). The fluorescence signals of calcein (green) and Alizarin Red S (red) from ROIs were captured using a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). For vertebral bone analysis, bone mineralization was evaluated by von Kossa staining. The sections were placed in 2-methoxyethyl acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min, followed by rehydration with serial ethanol solutions (100%, 90%, 80%, 70%, and 50%) and distilled water for 2 min each. The sections were subsequently dipped in a 1% AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min under ultraviolet light photons, washed in distilled water for 5 min, and dipped in 5% sodium thiosulfate solution for 5 min to remove nonspecific binding. Finally, we covered the sections with mounting solution and captured images by using a Leica microscope. The parameters of dynamic bone histomorphometry were analyzed using the Bioquant Osteo 2019ME program (Bioquant Osteo, Nashville, TN, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 10.1.2.

The phrase “data only for reviewers” was intended to indicate that the content was included in the revision based on reviewers’ comments, not in the main text (article). However, we acknowledge that this phrasing may be inappropriate. We are agree to make the figure included in the previous author response of the public reviews. Accordingly, we propose to revise the previous author response as follows:</p><p>- Remove &quot;(data only for reviewers)&quot;.</p><p>- Correct the typo from &quot;perosteal&quot; to &quot;periosteal&quot;.</p><p>- “Thank you for your comment. First, we ensured that the bones sampled during the experiment showed no defects, and we carefully separated the femur bones from the mice to preserve their integrity. In the 3-point bending test, PTH treatment significantly increased the maximum load of the femur bone compared to the OVX-control group. Additionally, the maximum load in the PTH treatment group was significantly greater than that observed in the PTH dimer group. Furthermore, structural factors influencing bone strength, such as the periosteal perimeter and the endocortical bone perimeter, were also increased in the PTH treatment group compared to the PTH dimer group.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Do you mean to always have R<sup>0</sup> (have a superscript) and RG (never have a superscript) or should they be shown in the same way throughout your paper?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thorough review. Based on previous studies that addressed the conformation of PTH1R, R<sup>0</sup> is typically shown with a superscript, while RG is not (Hoare et al., 2001; Dean et al., 2006; Okazaki et al., 2008).
