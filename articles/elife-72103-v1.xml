(SLE) and other interferon (IFN)-linked rheumatic diseases. The AIM-like receptors (ALRs) are IFN-inducible innate sensors that form supramolecular assemblies along double-stranded (ds)DNA of various origins. Here, we investigate the ALR absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) as a novel autoantigen in SLE, with similar properties to the established ALR autoantigen interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16). We examined neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) as DNA scaffolds on which these antigens might interact in a pro-immune context.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>AIM2 autoantibodies were measured by immunoprecipitation in SLE and control subjects.

The cause is unknown, but people with the illness make antibodies that stick to proteins that are normally found inside the cell nucleus, where DNA is stored. To make these antibodies, the immune system must first âseeâ these proteins and mistakenly recognise them as a threat. But how does the immune system recognise proteins that are normally hidden inside cells?</p><p>During infection, a type of immune cell called a neutrophil releases DNA from its nucleus to form structures called neutrophil extracellular traps, or NETs for short. The role of these NETs is to capture and kill pathogens, but they also expose the neutrophilâs DNA and the proteins attached to it to other immune cells. It is therefore possible that other immune cells interacting with NETs during infection may contribute to the development of lupus. Two proteins of interest are AIM2 and IFI16. These proteins form large, shield-like structures around strands of DNA, and previous work has shown that some people with lupus make antibodies against IFI16.</p><p>Antiochos et al. wondered whether IFI16 and AIM2 might stick to NETs, exposing themselves to the immune system. Examining the blood of people with lupus revealed that one in three of them made antibodies that could stick to AIM2. Those people were also more likely to have antibodies that could stick to IFI16 and to strands of DNA. Using microscopy, Antiochos et al. also found AIM2 and IFI16 on NETs in the kidneys of some people with lupus. Further investigation showed that the presence of AIM2 and IFI16 prevents NETs from breaking down.</p><p>If proteins like AIM2 and IFI16 can stop NETs from breaking down, they could allow the immune system more time to develop antibodies against them. Further investigation could reveal whether this is one of the causes of lupus. A clearer understanding of the antibodies could also boost research into diagnosis and treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autoimmunity</kwd><kwd>autoantibodies</kwd><kwd>neutrophil extracellular traps</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08AR077100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antiochos</surname><given-names>Brendan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K23AR075898</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mecoli</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jerome L.

Autoantibodies inform the identification of specific disease phenotypes and also provide insight into the mechanisms operative in rheumatic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rosen and Casciola-Rosen, 2016</xref>). Many SLE autoantigens are nucleic acid binding proteins, and nucleic acid containing immune complexes are implicated in aspects of pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mahajan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The AIM2-like receptors (ALRs) are a group of IFN-induced innate sensors of double-stranded (ds) DNA. AIM2 and IFI16 are the most studied members of the ALR family, which also includes IFIX and MNDA. The ALRs bind to dsDNA in a sequence-independent manner via electrostatic interactions with the dsDNA backbone and form an oligomerized filament along areas of accessible dsDNA of any origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morrone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morrone et al., 2015</xref>). These innate sensors equip the cell with a means of identifying harmful stimuli, including viral genomes, mislocalized mitochondrial DNA, and chromosomal DNA from tumor cells. Once activated, the ALRs activate downstream innate immune signaling by type I IFN and inflammasome (IL-1/IL-18) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hornung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Unterholzner et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Anti-IFI16 antibodies occur in both SLE and Sjogrenâs Syndrome (SS), but we have previously reported that the targeted epitopes differ in these diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antiochos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baer et al., 2016</xref>). IFI16 oligomers appear to be recognized by SS sera, suggesting that dsDNA binding may enhance its antigenicity. While AIM2 assembles similar filamentous structures on dsDNA, its status as an autoantigen has not been reported. Here, we identify AIM2 as an autoantigen in SLE (targeted in 31.3% of patients), with antibodies against AIM2, IFI16, and dsDNA being highly associated with one another. To understand why anti-ALR and anti-dsDNA antibodies might be closely co-targeted in SLE, we considered the possibility that ALRs bind to neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the extracellular space. NETs are microbicidal structures consisting of protein-laden chromatin fibers generated by neutrophils in response to various stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brinkmann et al., 2004</xref>). The NET dsDNA scaffold is a structure on which a variety of molecules interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gugliesi et al., 2013</xref>), representing a platform for antigenic materials (including SLE autoantigens) to be presented to the adaptive immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mistry and Kaplan, 2017</xref>). We find that both AIM2 and IFI16 bind NETs in vitro and in tissues, with their binding yielding polymeric structures that confer resistance to DNase I. Together, our findings demonstrate that AIM2 and IFI16 are NET-bound autoantigens in SLE.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>Plasma from 131 SLE patients (defined by the SLICC criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Petri et al., 2012</xref>) in the Hopkins Lupus Cohort was studied for autoantibodies.

A multivariable analysis correcting for SLEDAI, anti-dsDNA, and C4 results demonstrated that anti-AIM2 antibodies were significantly associated with anti-IFI16 antibodies with an OR of 3.7 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007, 95% CI 1.44â9.7). A subset of SLE patients (n = 9) demonstrated particularly high levels of anti-AIM2 antibodies with normalized OD &gt;20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We therefore analyzed SS sera for the presence of anti-AIM2 antibodiesand found that 46/133 (34.6%) of SS sera were positive. In contrast to SLE, anti-IFI16 was not enriched in patients with anti-AIM2 antibodies in SS (35% anti-AIM2-positive and anti-IFI16-positive versus 28% anti-AIM2-negative and anti-IFI16-positive in SS, <italic>P</italic> = 0.4324), showing that the association between anti-IFI16 and anti-AIM2 antibodies is specific to SLE, where these immune responses are also associated with anti-dsDNA antibodies.</p><p>Because AIM2 binds dsDNA of any sort, we considered whether the IP reaction observed here might identify interactions between AIM2 and dsDNA bound in circulating SLE immune complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Means et al., 2005</xref>), rather than a direct antibody-AIM2 interaction. To address this, we pre-treated anti-AIM2 +SLE sera and the AIM2 IVTT product with DNase prior to combining them in the IP reaction, and found that SLE sera retained the ability to bind AIM2 following DNase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâD</xref>). To further confirm this, we also performed immunoprecipitation of AIM2 PYRIN domain (PYD) that lacks the DNA-binding HIN domain, finding that 8/10 anti-AIM2 +SLE sera immunoprecipitated the isolated AIM2 PYD in this assay. Thus, DNA was not required for AIM2 binding in the samples assessed in these assays, confirming that this is a bona fide antibody specificity. It remains possible that the presence of dsDNA in SLE immune complexes could theoretically enhance AIM2 binding in vivo, with important consequences for epitope spreading and amplification of inflammation in tissues (see below).</p><p>The identification of anti-AIM2 autoantibodies raises the question of whether additional ALR proteins might be SLE autoantigens. To address this point, we developed an ELISA against MNDA â a third member of the ALR dsDNA sensor family. Despite the fact that antibodies against peptides derived from MNDA had been reported in some patients with SLE and other rheumatic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van Beers et al., 2013</xref>), we did not identify any difference in anti-MNDA reactivity between healthy control and SLE sera (median AU HC = 1.279, median AU SLE = 1.228, <italic>P</italic> = 0.9319) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>AIM2 and IFI16 bind to neutrophil extracellular traps and inhibit their degradation by DNase I</title><p>The close relationship between anti-AIM2, anti-IFI16, and anti-dsDNA antibodies in the SLE cohort led us to consider scenarios in which ALR-DNA complexes could be generated and promote the development of autoantibodies against these three antigens. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been implicated as important sources of extracellular DNA in SLE and are linked to the IFN signature as well as autoantibody generation in this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gupta and Kaplan, 2016</xref>). ALRs are IFN-induced, bind to dsDNA of many origins in a sequence-independent manner, and AIM2 has been identified as a protein constituent of SLE NETs in a proteomics analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruschi et al., 2019</xref>). IFI16 is released from epithelial cells undergoing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antiochos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa et al., 2011</xref>), and extracellular IFI16 is quantifiable in the sera of SLE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gugliesi et al., 2013</xref>). Considering these observations, we reasoned that when ALRs are generated in the setting of IFN exposure and subsequently released from cells, they might encounter and bind to extracellular NETs, accumulating on this extracellular platform and creating a hub for amplification similar to that observed in the complement and coagulation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Bont et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we used NETs as a DNA substrate for ALR binding: neutrophils were stimulated to undergo NETosis with PMA, and then incubated with fluorescently labeled IFI16 and AIM2 proteins. We found that both ALRs bind readily to NETs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâB</xref>). Co-localization of AIM2 and IFI16 along NET chromatin fibers was visible by confocal microscopy in this analysis, suggesting that both ALRs assemble into filaments on NET DNA.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>IFI16 and AIM2 bind NETs and prevent NET degradation by DNase I.</title><p>NETs were induced in neutrophils using PMA 100 nM for 3 hr, then left untreated (<bold>A</bold>) or incubated with fluorescently labeled AIM2 (pink) and IFI16 (red) at 200 nM at RT for 1 hr (<bold>B</bold>).

We therefore hypothesized that ALRs might represent one group of proteins with the ability to mediate NET resistance to nucleases, potentially enhancing antigenicity. We used DNase I to explore this question, as DNase I is the nuclease responsible for effective clearance of NETs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hakkim et al., 2010</xref>), and DNase I deficiency has been associated with SLE in both human subjects and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">MartÃ­nez Valle et al., 2008</xref>). After exposure to 20 U/ml DNase I for 1 hr at RT, both myeloperoxidase (MPO) and DNA signals were completely degraded, leaving no observable fluorescence in any channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). When NETs were first incubated with ALRs, however, we observed incomplete ALR-NET degradation by DNase I â in some areas, IFI16 and AIM2 remained present and co-localized with MPO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, there was observable DNA remaining in these areas of persistent ALR structures, implying that the ALRs had partially shielded NET DNA from degradation. This finding suggested that both the protein and DNA components of the ALR-NET structure are resistant to DNase-mediated clearance. To better quantify this, we employed a plate-based Sytox Green assay to measure the dsDNA content of NETs following exposure to DNase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This assay confirmed that ALR-bound NETs are resistant to DNase I, leaving more DNA present following nuclease treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Together these experiments demonstrate that ALRs bind to NETs, generating a protein-DNA structure with enhanced resistance to DNase-mediated clearance.</p><p>To test the specificity of this observation, we utilized a fluorescence anisotropy assay to compare IFI16 against the catalytic domain of cGAS (cGAS-CD), to determine whether the property of DNA binding alone confers proteins with the ability to shield bound dsDNA from DNAse I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In this second assay, we again observed that IFI16 blocked dsDNA degradation, while cGAS-CD did not. Thus, the ability to shield dsDNA from nuclease does not appear to be a universal property of all DNA-binding proteins, and other factors (such as the ability to oligomerize) may be required for this behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>IFI16-NETs are present in lupus nephritis</title><p>Prior studies have presented evidence of in vivo NET formation within the renal tissues of SLE patients, supporting the notion that dysregulated neutrophil function contributes to immune pathology in this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Villanueva et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore sought to determine whether ALR-NET interactions could be identified among NETs present in lupus nephritis biopsies. Considering that patients with diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis are known to harbor netting neutrophils in renal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Villanueva et al., 2011</xref>), we identified patients with diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis, then selected 5 samples whose biopsies demonstrated neutrophilic infiltrates or karyorrhectic debris (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). We found that AIM2 was highly expressed in MPO-positive infiltrating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), while IFI16 was expressed more broadly throughout renal cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We detected NETs containing both AIM2 and IFI16 in glomerular and interstitial infiltrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). High magnification, z-stack imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>) confirmed that these structures represented extracellular DNA that co-stained for MPO and AIM2 or IFI16, consistent with ALR-bound NETs, rather than adjacent or overlapping cell nuclei.

Here, we identify the dsDNA sensor AIM2 as a novel autoantigen in SLE and demonstrate that anti-AIM2 antibodies are associated with SLE disease activity markers. Furthermore, we find that NETs provide a scaffold for ALR oligomerization, which in turn confers resistance to nuclease degradation.</p><p>NETosis is a process whereby dsDNA is expelled into the extracellular space at sites of tissue damage and is of mechanistic relevance in SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gupta and Kaplan, 2016</xref>). The NET dsDNA scaffold is a structure on which a variety of molecules can interact, and is a source of antigenic proteins in SLE and other inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mistry and Kaplan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). While the ALRs have been most extensively studied for their intracellular functions, there are reasons to theorize that they may perform extracellular activities as well. Our previous work demonstrated that IFI16 is released from epithelial cells injured by the NK cell granule killing pathway and that IFI16 retains its ability to interact with dsDNA in the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antiochos et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings are consistent with the observations that (i) IFI16 is released from irradiated epithelial cells, and (ii) extracellular IFI16 is quantifiable in the sera of SLE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gugliesi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iannucci et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, the release of AIM2 from pyroptotic cells into extracellular vesicles in the context of pyroptosis has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">So et al., 2018</xref>) and extracellular signaling activities of the related oligomerizing inflammasome adaptor protein ASC have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Franklin et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore reasoned that ALRs released from injured epithelial, endothelial, or other immune cells, generated in the setting of SLE end-organ tissue damage, might encounter and bind to extracellular NETs. We found that both IFI16 and AIM2 readily assemble into filaments along the length of NET dsDNA. Unexpectedly, we found this ALR-NET structure resists DNase-mediated degradation â a property that was not demonstrated by cGAS-CD. NETs promote IFN signaling at sites of their generation when engulfed by immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia-Romo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apel et al., 2021</xref>), and may have additional disease-amplifying functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Salazar-Gonzalez et al., 2019</xref>). By prolonging the stability of interferogenic NETs, extracellular ALRs may enhance IFN signaling at sites of neutrophil activation, which could be further amplified by IFN-induced expression of the ALRs themselves.</p><p>Impairment of NET removal has been specifically linked to the presence of lupus nephritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hakkim et al., 2010</xref>) - a manifestation of SLE with significant associated morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gasparotto et al., 2020</xref>). Neutrophilic infiltration of the kidney is a feature of more severe forms of glomerulonephritis, and NET formation in this organ may contribute to renal damage through the propagation of IFN signaling, immune cell activation, and thrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Salazar-Gonzalez et al., 2019</xref>). Confocal microscopy has been utilized to demonstrate the presence of NET structures in renal lesions of patients with SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Villanueva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frangou et al., 2019</xref>) and also ANCA associated vasculitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kessenbrock et al., 2009</xref>), supporting the notion that NETs play a pathogenic role in the immune dysregulation and tissue damage that occur in glomerulonephritis.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the DNA sensors AIM2 and IFI16 bind to NETs in vivo, through imaging studies of proliferative lupus nephritis specimens. Our data include z-stack images at high magnification, clearly demonstrating the presence of extracellular DNA-MPO-ALR complexes in this site. This finding supports previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gugliesi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iannucci et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bawadekar et al., 2015</xref>) suggesting that the ALRs may have important functions not just intracellularly, but also in the extracellular environment. The large chromatin fibers generated through NETosis represent sizeable dsDNA templates upon which IFI16 and AIM2 monomers oligomerize in the extracellular space and are expected to result in durable immunostimulatory structures at sites of IFN-induced protein expression. ALR-bound NETs may therefore promote not only local immune activation but the targeting of ALRs (and DNA) by antibodies in SLE. NET-bound ALRs may potentiate autoimmunity by activating B cells through either endosomal TLR9-NET DNA interactions, or activation of the B cell receptor, in a manner analogous to that reported for the NET-binding peptide LL37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gestermann et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, the initial presence of anti-DNA antibodies containing Ig-bound DNA (derived from NETs or other sources) could lead to immune complexes consisting of Ig-DNA-ALR interactions in the periphery, thereby promoting the subsequent development of anti-ALR antibodies through epitope spreading.</p><p>Our data indicate that AIM2 is targeted not only in SLE but also in SS â a condition in which NETosis has not been linked to disease pathology. In contrast to the relationship seen in SLE, we found no association between AIM2 and IFI16 antibodies in SS, and anti-dsDNA antibodies are absent in SS. This difference highlights the important role of disease-specific tissue processes in the development of unique autoantibody profiles against shared antigens. In the setting of lupus nephritis, we observed ALR expression by both neutrophils and resident renal cells and suspect that these antigens may be released by a variety of cell types in the kidney, leading to the observed extracellular interaction with NET DNA. Contrastingly, neutrophil infiltration in target salivary tissues is not a common feature of SS, and the absence of the NET DNA scaffold may explain the differing autoantibody profile observed in that condition.</p><p>In summary, we have identified the ALRs AIM2 and IFI16 as NET-binding autoantigens in SLE. The ALR-NET interaction may increase NET longevity and perpetuate NET-mediated inflammatory signaling in lupus nephritis and other sites of NET generation and IFN expression. This work supports a role for the ALRs in extracellular immune processes as NET-binding antigens in SLE.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Informed consent was obtained from all human subjects enrolled in the SLE, Sjogren's and healthy control cohorts.

as targets of self-reactive autoantibodies during an autoimmune disease called systemic lupus erythematosus (commonly referred to as lupus). Importantly, the authors provide evidence that these proteins bind and protect extracellular DNA from destruction, and propose that this property may enhance the autoimmune response to the DNA and associated proteins. The work may therefore provide an important underlying mechanism for a prevalent and important human autoimmune disease.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72103.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Russell E</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01an7q238</institution-id><institution>University of California</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Berkeley</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Fitzgerald Ph D</surname><given-names>Kate</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.08.19.456941">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.19.456941v1.full">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

To address this important point, we developed an ELISA against MNDA â another ALR protein with DNA-binding function. We utilized this assay to compare SLE and control sera, and did not identify a difference in antibody response against MNDA in these two groups (Added as Supplemental Figure 1), indicating that MNDA is not a SLE-associated autoantigen. We conclude that autoantigen status is not a universal feature of the ALRs, but still think it plausible that additional dsDNA sensors may be identified as novel autoantigens. (Please see: Methods (Lines 108112); Results (Lines 177-182); Figure 1âfigure supplement 1).</p><p>Dr. Fitzgerald also points out that the ability to shield dsDNA from DNase may not be a unique property of these ALRs, in that other DNA-binding proteins could share this ability to interfere with nucleasemediated degradation. To address this, we utilized fluorescence anisotropy to compare IFI16 with the cGAS catalytic domain (added as Figure 2 F) with respect to DNase shielding ability. While IFI16 again showed the ability to resist DNase in this assay, DNA bound to cGAS-CD was readily degraded following the addition of DNase I to the reaction. This additional data demonstrates that the ability to interfere with DNase activity is not necessarily a property of any protein â rather, that the formation of higher order oligomers along dsDNA (a property of ALRs) might be unique in this capacity to resist DNase I.</p><p>(Please see: Methods (Lines 127-131); Results (Lines 220-225); Figure 2 F).</p><p>In her review, Dr. Fitzgerald also suggests additional discussion of the concept of ALR activity in the extracellular environment. We have added several references to the discussion that further supports this concept: (i) our own work that showed IFI16 release from epithelial cells exposed to cytotoxic granules, (ii) work by Gugliesi et al., and Iannucci et al., that demonstrated IFI16 release from irradiated cell lines, and also quantified extracellular IFI16 in sera of SLE patients (and other rheumatic diseases), (iii) the observation by So et al., that AIM2 is transported extracellularly (in exosomes) from cells undergoing pyroptosis, (iv) work by Franklin et al., demonstrating that the oligomerizing inflammasome adaptor ASC is also released into the extracellular space by activated cells, where is retains signaling function. This addition to the discussion appears in lines 251-261.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors of Antiochos et al., present important observations of the behavior of AIM2 in association with NET DNA and in lupus kidney biopsies.

This is indeed an important point and to address it we used a subset of SLE sera (both anti-DNA positive and negative) in an immunoprecipitation (IP) reaction that was preceded by DNase treatment. We incubated both the patient serum and the AIM2 protein with DNase separately to minimize any accessible DNA from either source, prior to combining them in the IP reaction (added as Figure 1 C-D). We used a DNase pre-treatment that was adequate to remove a large quantity of dsDNA â at least one microgram, as shown in Figure 1 D. This did not affect the ability of AIM2 autoantibodies to IP AIM2. Reviewer 2 also points out that DNA-bound proteins (like the very ALRs we report on) could potentially shield Ig-bound DNA from DNase in this reaction. While this could potentially occur, DNA that is effectively shielded from DNase due to binding by another protein seems unlikely to be accessible to AIM2, given the length-dependency of AIM2-DNA binding. AIM2 shows minimal affinity for 10 bp DNA templates (representing a binding site of one AIM2 monomer), and requires longer stretches of dsDNA to form stable oligomers (1). It therefore seems unlikely that DNA held in an Ig-protein-DNA complex could be simultaneously protected from DNase I yet accessible to AIM2 in this IVTT assay. In addition, the DNase was not removed prior to the IP reaction, but rather remained in solution after sera and AIM2 were combined. If any Ig-bound DNA that survived DNase treatment were later released, it would likely be accessible to nuclease digestion during the assay. Nonetheless, to further probe this issue, and as suggested by the Editor, we examined the ability of anti-AIM2+ SLE sera to immunoprecipitate the AIM2 pyrin domain (PYD) alone, in a construct lacking the DNA-binding HIN domain. We expressed the AIM2-PYD using an eGFP expression plasmid in 293T cells, and performed IP using 10 SLE anti-AIM2+ sera, finding that 8 of the 10 sera immunoprecipitated the PYD alone in this assay (Figure 1E). We note that it is possible that human sera may target epitopes in select sites of the molecule, and a negative result for a minority of sera in this assay may simply indicate that a given serum binds epitopes in the HIN domain. Together, these additional data address the critique regarding a possible indirect Ig-DNA-AIM2 interaction being primarily detected by this IVTT IP assay. Importantly though, we do consider it plausible that such an interaction between DNA in immune complexes and ALRs (or other high affinity dsDNA binding proteins) might occur in vivo, and we wonder whether this mechanism might in fact contribute to the generation of anti-AIM2 antibodies in some cases through intermolecular epitope spreading facilitated by extracellular dsDNA. (Please see Methods (Lines 102-108); Results (Lines 166-176); Figure 1 C,D, E). Taken together, we believe that these revisions answer a key criticism of the prior review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Potential explanations for the immunogenicity of NET-bound proteins should be addressed.

In the discussion, we have added reference to the observation that the NET-binding peptide LL37 has shown the ability to promote TLR9-mediated signaling and also B cell receptor activation, and we theorize that other DNA-binding autoantigens such as the ALRs could demonstrate similar behavior.
