Loss of 5mC at these sequences is common in cancer and is a hallmark of Immunodeficiency, Centromere and Facial abnormalities (ICF) syndrome. While the general importance of 5mC is well-established, the specific functions of 5mC at pericentromeres are less clear. To address this deficiency, we generated a viable animal model of pericentromeric hypomethylation through mutation of the ICF-gene <italic>ZBTB24</italic>. Deletion of zebrafish <italic>zbtb24</italic> caused a progressive loss of 5mC at pericentromeres and ICF-like phenotypes. Hypomethylation of these repeats triggered derepression of pericentromeric transcripts and activation of an interferon-based innate immune response. Injection of pericentromeric RNA is sufficient to elicit this response in wild-type embryos, and mutation of the MDA5-MAVS dsRNA-sensing machinery blocks the response in mutants. These findings identify activation of the innate immune system as an early consequence of pericentromeric hypomethylation, implicating derepression of pericentromeric transcripts as a trigger of autoimmunity.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

When cells divide, each chromosome duplicates, and a structure called a centromere initially holds the copies together. The sequences of DNA on either side of the centromeres are often highly repetitive. In backboned animals, this DNA normally also has extra chemical modifications called methyl groups attached to it. The role that these methyl groups play in this region is not known, although in other DNA regions they often stop the DNA being ‘transcribed’ into molecules of RNA.</p><p>The cells of people who have a rare human genetic disorder called ICF syndrome, lack the methyl groups near the centromere. The methyl groups may also be lost in old and cancerous cells.</p><p>Researchers often use ‘model’ animals to investigate the effects of DNA modifications. But, until now, there were no animal models that lose methyl groups from the DNA around centromeres in the same way as seen in ICF syndrome.</p><p>Rajshekar et al. have developed a new zebrafish model for ICF syndrome that loses the methyl groups around its centromeres over time. Studying the cells of these zebrafish showed that when the methyl groups are missing, the cell starts to transcribe the DNA sequences around the centromeres. The resulting RNA molecules appear to be mistaken by the cell for viral RNA. They activate immune sensors that normally detect RNA viruses, which triggers an immune response.</p><p>The new zebrafish model can now be used in further studies to help researchers to understand the key features of ICF syndrome. Future work could also investigate whether the loss of methyl groups around the centromeres plays a role in other diseases where the immune system attacks healthy tissues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>pericentromeres</kwd><kwd>ICF Syndrome</kwd><kwd>interferon response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM110092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goll</surname><given-names>Mary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Derepression of transcripts from hypomethylated pericentromeric repeats triggers an innate immune response in an animal model of Immunodeficency, Centromere and Facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In vertebrate genomes, the majority of cytosine residues within CpG dinucleotides are methylated at the 5 position of the cytosine ring (5-methylcytosine, 5mC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suzuki and Bird, 2008</xref>). 5mC is established by the de novo DNA methyltransferases of the Dnmt3 family, and is propagated by the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goll and Bestor, 2005</xref>). In mice, frogs and zebrafish, mutation or morpholino-mediated depletion of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> results in extensive genome-wide methylation loss and embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lei et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stancheva and Meehan, 2000</xref>). In these species, global methylation deficiencies are linked to a variety of adverse outcomes including deregulation of gene expression, derepression of transposons, elevated levels of DNA damage and increased genome instability during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith and Meissner, 2013</xref>). Recent studies have further linked global hypomethylation to activation of antiviral signaling pathways in zebrafish mutated for <italic>dnmt1</italic> and in cancer cells treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chernyavskaya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiappinelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roulois et al., 2015</xref>). While these studies reinforce the general importance of DNA methylation in vertebrate development and tissue homeostasis, the extensive genome-wide loss of methylation in these models makes it difficult to assign significance to methylation deficiencies at any particular subclass of sequence.</p><p>The pericentromeric satellite sequences that juxtapose chromosome centromeres represent an essential structural component of chromosomes and a significant source of 5mC in vertebrate genomes. These highly repetitive sequences appear particularly susceptible to methylation loss in cancer and senescent cells, although the consequences of this hypomethylation are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Enukashvily et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fanelli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakagawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Narayan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Suzuki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsuda et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast to global hypomethylation, loss of 5mC at pericentromeric repeats is compatible with human development. Individuals with the rare, autosomal recessive disorder Immunodeficiency, Centromere and Facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome show extensive hypomethylation of pericentromeric repeats, while methylation across the rest of the genome is relatively intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tuck-Muller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Velasco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weisenberger et al., 2005</xref>). Affected individuals usually die in late childhood or early adulthood, and exhibit variable symptoms including immunoglobulin deficiency, facial dysmorphism, growth retardation and a generalized failure to thrive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehrlich et al., 2008</xref>). Chromosome anomalies including whole-arm deletions and multiradial chromosomes have also been reported in mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes from ICF-patients. However, similar chromosome anomalies are not observed in primary tissues from affected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ehrlich, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing have separately implicated four genes in ICF syndrome: DNA Methyltransferase 3B (<italic>DNMT3B,</italic> ICF type-1), Zinc-finger and BTB domain containing 24 (<italic>ZBTB24,</italic> ICF type-2), Cell division cycle associated 7 (<italic>CDCA7,</italic> ICF type-3) and Helicase, lymphoid-specific (<italic>HELLS,</italic> ICF type-4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Greef et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thijssen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 1999</xref>). Most of the described mutations in <italic>DNMT3B</italic> cause amino acid substitutions within the C-terminal catalytic domain, suggesting they may be hypomorphic. In contrast, the majority of mutations in <italic>ZBTB24</italic>, <italic>CDCA7</italic> and <italic>HELLS</italic> are predicted to cause loss of function. Mechanistically, ZBTB24, CDCA7 and HELLS are thought to converge in a singular pathway that facilitates DNMT3B access to pericentromeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To date, most studies of pericentromeric 5mC loss have been performed using transformed B-cell lines derived from ICF patients carrying mutations in <italic>DNMT3B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehrlich et al., 2008</xref>). Attempts to generate viable mouse models of pericentromeric hypomethylation through mutation of ICF genes have had limited success. Mice harboring ICF-like mutations in <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> exhibit some characteristics of ICF syndrome including small size and facial anomalies. However, most mice die within 24 hr of birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ueda et al., 2006</xref>). Global methylation profiles were not assessed in these mutants; but significant hypomethylation was reported at both pericentromeric repeats and retroviral sequences. Similar perinatal lethality was observed following deletion of the mouse <italic>HELLS</italic> orthologue. In this case, mutations were accompanied by roughly 50% reductions in 5mC, and methylation loss was noted at pericentromeres, retroviruses and some single copy sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tao et al., 2011</xref>). Deletion of the mouse <italic>Zbtb24</italic> gene was reported to cause embryonic lethality; but methylation changes in these mutants have not been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe a viable model of pericentromeric methylation loss, generated through mutation of the zebrafish <italic>zbtb24</italic> gene. Homozygous mutant adults exhibited key phenotypic hallmarks of ICF syndrome including hypomethylation of pericentromeric satellite repeats. Hypomethylation of these repeats was first detected in mutants at 2 weeks post fertilization (wpf) and became more severe as animals matured. This progressive methylation loss allowed us to investigate the primary consequences of pericentromeric hypomethylation in the context of a vertebrate animal. Using this model, we link derepression of transcripts from hypomethylated pericentromeres to activation of an interferon-based innate immune response, and we demonstrate that this response is mediated through the MDA5-MAVS RNA sensing machinery. Our findings provide insights into the earliest consequences of pericentromeric hypomethylation, demonstrating an unappreciated function for methylation of pericentromeric repeats in protecting against autoimmunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutation of zebrafish <italic>zbtb24</italic> causes ICF syndrome-like phenotypes</title><p>The zebrafish genome encodes a single, well-conserved orthologue of ZBTB24, which we mutated using TAL effector nucleases (TALENs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>).

The RLR family of PRRs consists of two RNA helicases that signal through Mavs: Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5 (Mda5) and Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (Rig-I). Rig-I binds 5’ triphosphorylated RNA molecules, whereas Mda5 has been implicated in the recognition of long double-stranded RNAs in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crowl et al., 2017</xref>).

Given that previous attempts to model ICF syndrome have resulted in perinatal or embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geiman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ueda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), this zebrafish model provides an important new resource for understanding ICF disease etiology during juvenile and adult life stages. In particular, <italic>zbtb24</italic> mutant zebrafish will be useful for understanding phenotypes such as immunoglobulin deficiency, which have not been observed in mouse models and are difficult to study in cell culture systems.</p><p>As in ICF syndrome, <italic>zbtb24</italic> mutant adult zebrafish exhibited extensive loss of methylation at pericentromeric sequences. For highly repetitive sequences, methylation sensitive restriction digest followed by Southern blot remains the most effective way to assess methylation levels. By this approach, we observed increases in HpyCH4IV digestion that are consistent with up to 95% reductions in methylation at Sat1 pericentromeric repeats in <italic>zbtb24</italic> mutants. While similar hypomethylation was observed in all adult somatic tissues that we examined, we unexpectedly observed that methylation levels in sperm from <italic>zbtb24</italic> mutants and wildtype animals appeared comparable. This finding raises the possibility that different pathways act to control pericentromeric methylation in germ and somatic cells.</p><p>Methylation levels at pericentromeric Sat1 sequences could not be quantified by ERRBS, as this technique relies on MspI restriction digest to enrich for CpG containing sequences, and zebrafish Sat1 repeats are lacking in this restriction site. Nonetheless, ERRBS analysis suggested that the general methylation landscape in human ICF syndrome and in <italic>zbtb24</italic> mutant zebrafish is similar. Methylome analysis of primary blood from ICF patients identified methylation changes of greater than 20% at roughly 3% of examined CpG dinucleotides. Significant changes in methylation of retroviruses and other dispersed repeats were not observed in these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Velasco et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with these findings, our ERRBS analysis revealed methylation changes of greater than 20% at roughly 1.3% of assayed CpG dinucleotides and found methylation of dispersed repeats to be similar between wildtype and in <italic>zbtb24</italic> mutant zebrafish. The low-level methylation changes outside of the pericentromeres observed in ICF syndrome and our mutants raise the possibility that <italic>zbtb24</italic> may have additional modest roles in maintaining methylation at non pericentromeric sequences. One important caveat of ERRBS analysis is that CpG poor sequences can be under represented, leaving open the possibility that additional DMRs in CpG poor regions of the genome were overlooked by our approach.</p><p>The progressive loss of 5mC we observe in somatic tissues between larval and adult stages implicates Zbtb24 in regulating the long-term maintenance of methylation at pericentromeric repeats. We are unaware of any developmental or methylation milestones that can account for the onset of hypomethylation around 2 wpf. Rather, we speculate that the onset of methylation loss at this stage partly reflects the need to deplete maternally loaded <italic>zbtb24</italic> prior to unmasking of the <italic>zbtb24</italic> mutant phenotype and partly reflects the culmination of minor methylation losses due to lower fidelity maintenance over many rounds of cell division. We note that the onset of ICF-like growth defects in <italic>zbtb24</italic> mutant zebrafish emerged in the weeks following Sat1 methylation loss. In at least one case of ICF syndrome type 2, growth reductions and immunodeficiency were also reported to develop with age, raising the possibility that similar progressive methylation loss may impact ICF etiology in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">von Bernuth et al., 2014</xref>). It is also possible that Zbtb24 functions in both maintenance and establishment of pericentromeric methylation, but that requirements for establishment are masked by maternally deposited RNA in <italic>zbtb24</italic> mutant zebrafish lines. Unfortunately, <italic>zbtb24</italic> homozygous mutant zebrafish are sterile, preventing the generation of the maternal-zygotic mutants required to address this question.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that ZBTB24 is a transcription factor that may act to regulate DNA methylation through transcriptional control of the ICF gene CDCA7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this model, we observe near complete loss of cdca7 expression in <italic>zbtb24</italic> mutants in our RNA-seq data set and by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). A more recent study in cultured human cells proposed that ZBTB24 binding might be directly involved in recruiting DNMT3B to promote gene body methylation through recognition of AGGTCCTGGCAG motifs in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>). Analysis using Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grant et al., 2011</xref>), did not reveal this motif in the promoter or gene body of zebrafish <italic>cdca7</italic> or at Sat1 sequences.</p><p>In the current study, we take advantage of the progressive Sat1 methylation loss in <italic>zbtb24</italic> mutants to identify activation of interferon signaling as one of the earliest in vivo consequences of pericentromeric hypomethylation. This phenotype cannot be attributed to defects in adaptive immunity, as the zebrafish adaptive immune system is not functional until roughly 4 wpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trede et al., 2004</xref>). Induction of an interferon response has been reported in the context of global hypomethylation in cancer cell lines treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine and in zebrafish mutated for the maintenance DNA methyltransferase machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chernyavskaya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiappinelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roulois et al., 2015</xref>). In each of these cases induction of the interferon response was attributed to massive derepression of endogenous retroviral elements.</p><p>Our results are distinguished from these earlier studies in that we identify hypomethylation of pericentromeric sequences and subsequent derepression of associated satellite transcripts as a previously unappreciated trigger of innate immunity. Immunostimulatory motifs have been noted in pericentromeric RNAs derived from mouse and humans, and transcripts derived from these repeats have been observed in <italic>p53</italic> null mouse fibroblasts following global methylation loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leonova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanne et al., 2015</xref>). However, while these studies suggest the potential for pericentromeric hypomethylation to drive an interferon response in diverse vertebrate species, experimental evidence in support of this model has been lacking. Here we demonstrate a causative link between derepression of pericentromeric RNAs and the interferon response, and identify a requirement for Mda5/Mavs in mediating the response. Our findings suggest that aberrant Sat1 transcripts derived from pericentromeric repeats trigger this response, and that these transcripts may mimic features of double stranded RNA viruses in the cytosol. This finding raises the possibility that this pathway may also recognize additional endogenous RNAs that lack viral origin.</p><p>While mutation of <italic>mda5/mavs</italic> rescued the interferon response in <italic>zbtb24</italic> mutants, <italic>mda5/mavs</italic> mutation had little impact on other ICF phenotypes observed in <italic>zbtb24</italic> mutants. Therefore, we find it unlikely that the interferon response drives ICF etiology. Rather this response represents an additional consequence of pericentromeric hypomethylation. Hypomethylation of pericentromeric sequences is compatible with human viability and is observed in abnormal cell contexts including cancer and senescence. Massive increases in pericentromeric transcripts and upregulation of interferon genes have both been noted in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ting et al., 2011</xref>). Our data raise the possibility that pericentromeric hypomethylation and subsequent derepression of associated RNAs represents an important but underappreciated trigger of autoimmunity in a variety of disease states.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish husbandry</title><p>Zebrafish husbandry and care were conducted in full accordance with animal care and use guidelines with approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the University of Georgia.

Bisulphite conversion rates (calculated using non-CpG methylation conversion rates) ranged from 99.6% to 99.7% for all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Amplified libraries were sequenced on the Hiseq2500 platform using a minimum of single-read 51 cycles. ERRBS data were filtered for sequence adapters, limited to the first 29 bp of the read (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2012</xref>), and mapped to the zebrafish genome (danRer7) using BSmap (v 2.90) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xi and Li, 2009</xref>). Other than limiting to the first 29 bp all other BSmap parameters were the defaults. Methylation scores were calculated as the number of unconverted reads divided by the number of total reads at each CpG site. DMRs were called as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Park and Wu (2016)</xref>. DMRs with at least a 0.2 change in methylation were determined using DSS (delta = 0.2, p.threshold = 0.01). CallDMR function in DSS was used with default parameters except for p.threshold and delta as specified. Sat1 sequences are deficient in MspI sites, and are therefore not included in ERRBS data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNA expression analysis</title><p>For qRT-PCR, total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and precipitated with isopropanol.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Deborah Bourchis as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have also agreed to reveal their identity: Ozren Bogdanovic (Reviewer #2); Albert Jordan (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has highlighted the concerns that require revision and/or responses, and we have included the separate reviews below for your consideration. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p>Below, you will find a list of the comments from the reviewers that have not been modified because we believe that you will find it useful to consider all the points. As you will see, the three reviewers are overall positive and recognize the originality and experimental quality of the work.</p><p>Please address the comments and revise your text accordingly. Limited additional experimentation is required. Defining the separate effect of sense and antisense sat1 RNAs on the interferon response was raised by two reviewers and should be included along with ds RNA injection. We also recommend to provide more insights into the fertility and germline DNA methylation phenotypes of the <italic>Zbtb24</italic> KO animals.</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The ICF syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease associated with a constitutive DNA methylation defect at pericentromeric satellite DNA. Patients present with severe immunodeficiency and facial anomalies. Although being very rare (around 100 patients worldwide), the underlying genetic causes are variable: at least four genes have been implicated – a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3B), a zinc-finger containing factor (ZBTB24), an helicase (HELLS) and a cell cycle regulator (CDCA7). Studying this disease has a double interest: dissecting the DNA methylation pathway, and addressing the impact of defective pericentrometic heterochromatin regulation on development and immunity functions.</p><p>The authors report here the first zebrafish model of ICF, through the constitutive loss of function of <italic>Zbtb24</italic>. First, this model recapitulates the typical pericentromeric hypomethylation, immunological defects and facial anomalies of ICF syndrome. Second, the authors report a new molecular component of the <italic>Zbtb24</italic>-related immunological phenotype: hypomethylation of the pericentrometic heterochromatin results in the production of immunostimulatory sat1 repeat transcripts, which trigger an interferon response through a viral RNA recognition pathway. This provides the novel concept that the earliest consequence of pericentromeric loss is an induction of the innate immune system. These are very interesting findings, even if we cannot conclude as to whether tis response is involved in the ICF pathology.</p><p>The manuscript is clear and concise, and the conclusions well supported by the data. The genetic approaches in particular are very solid.</p><p>I have a few requests for the authors though, to improve the clarity and breadth of the findings.</p><p>1) It has been shown in mammals that <italic>Zbtb24</italic> controls the expression of <italic>Cdca7</italic>, whose mutations are also involved in the ICF syndrome. Is it also the case in zebrafish? Could the authors look in their RNA seq data from <italic>Zbtb24</italic> KO the expression pattern of this gene and comment on the result?</p><p>2) Very recently, a ZBTB24 DNA binding motif was identified in human cells (Thompson et al., 2018). Provided that this motif is the same in zebrafish, is it present in sat1 repeats ? And in <italic>Cdca7</italic>, if it happens to be also a <italic>Zbtb24</italic> target in fishes?</p><p>3) DNA methylation analyses by ERRBS: using this technique, the authors conclude that <italic>Zbtb24</italic> mostly targets pericentromeric repeats in the zebrafish genome. However, this method provides a very low coverage for regions that are not CpG-rich. ICF type 2 patients (mutated for the ZBTB24 gene) were recently shown to have DNA methylation defects outside of pericentromeric repeats, at CpG-poor regions with heterochromatic features. The authors should acknowledge the limitation of their method in capturing this type of genomic sequences.</p><p>4) DNA methylation analyses of sat1 repeats in <italic>Zbtb24</italic> KO: several somatic tissues were analyzed (brain, muscle and skin). What about germ cells? Sperm DNA methylation should be analyzed (see point 4 in this regards). Protocols have been previously published about zebrafish sperm DNA extraction.</p><p>5) Phenotype: the authors report in the Discussion that they could not address as to whether the maternal store of <italic>Zbtb24</italic> could mask requirement in DNA methylation establishment because mutant zebrafishes were sterile (I guess this concerns the 10% survivors). Both females <italic>and</italic> males? Regarding the tight link between DNA methylation and fertility in other models, more information about this sterility phenotype is required: are mature germ cells produced (ovary and testis histological sections could give an quick answer)? Of course if males lack sperm, then the analysis requested in #2 becomes invalid.</p><p>6) The ability of sat1 repeat transcripts to trigger the expression of ISG genes was assessed with a mixture of sense and antisense RNAs (Figure 5F). The authors should also inject separately sense and antisense products to assess their relative effect on the interferon response and gain mechanistic insights into the origin of this response.</p><p>7) One point I find missing from the Discussion: what do we know about the dynamics of DNA methylation during early zebrafish development? Is there something specific going on at two weeks, when <italic>Zbtb24</italic> function becomes essential? See data from the labs of B. Cairns and R. Lister.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>- Msp1 should be spelled MspI.</p><p>- Age at which the ERRBS was performed: the text says at 25 wpf (<italic>Zbtb24</italic> mutants exhibit modest reductions in 5mC at non-pericentromeric sequences), Materials and methods reports 24 wpf.</p><p>- DMR call: information is missing about the criteria: size? Sliding window?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Vertebrate genomes display high levels of DNA methylation covering repetitive elements, inactive cis-regulatory sequences, intergenic regions, and gene bodies. Numerous functional studies have demonstrated the importance of proper DNA methylation patterning for diverse developmental processes. Nevertheless, such studies frequently suffer from the inability to determine which loci in particular were causal for the phenotypes observed upon the loss of activity of proteins that deposit, read, and write DNA methylation patterns.</p><p>The study by Rajshekar et al. provides an exciting system for exploring how loss of DNA methylation from pericentromeric satellite repeats affects vertebrate development. Here the authors mutated the zebrafish <italic>zbtb24</italic> gene, which was previously implicated in Immunodeficiency, Centromere and Facial abnormalities (ICF) syndrome in humans. Importantly, mammalian models for this disorder are either embryonically lethal, or they exhibit immediate post-natal lethality. Using a combination of elegant functional and genome-wide approaches the authors demonstrate how pericentromeric hypomethylation elicits an interferon response in the affected animals. Overall, the presented work is well executed and the manuscript is clearly and concisely written. Significant efforts have been placed in the preparation of the figures, which will make the results easy to understand even for a non-specialist reader. My suggestions for improvement are relatively minor:</p><p>1) It would be useful to discuss in more detail what the proposed function of ZBTB24 is. Is it a DNA methylation reader, a chromatin remodeller (I note that it has a helicase domain)? Also, a couple of sentences describing the potential reasons for differences in the observed zebrafish and mouse phenotypes upon the loss of ZBTB24, would be welcome.</p><p>2) The ERRBS data are of high interest and will likely be reused in similar studies. I would urge the authors to include more details as to how these libraries were generated and mapped (i.e. how many PCR cycles, which BS-conversion kit, and mapping/mC calling parameters).</p><p>3) The scatter plot in Figure 2E leaves the impression as if the majority of CpGs are reduced in the mutant for some 10-20%. This is, of course, difficult to determine by just looking at the scatterplot and even more so if no legend depicting the range of densities is included in the figure. I feel that RRBS data would require some further analysis to unequivocally demonstrate the proposed small magnitude of the changes between the wt and the mutant. I would suggest representing the distributions of 5mC levels at single CpGs in wt and mutant triplicates with boxplots, and stacked bar plots (i.e.% of CpGs with low: 0-0.2, medium: 0.2-0.8, and high: &gt; 0.8 5mC levels). These, and perhaps other analysis, will be better suited for demonstrating the magnitude of changes in 5mC between the wt and the mutant. Also, could the authors comment on the proposed mechanism for this apparent genome-wide 5mC loss in the mutant?</p><p>4) Is this global 5mC loss correlated with any genomic feature in particular?</p><p>5) I would remove the non-significant P values from Figures 3, 4 and 5 and just state &quot;n.s&quot; instead. This will allow the reader to immediately focus on the significant changes. I would consider replacing all the P values with *, **, or *** – denoting increasing significance levels, and just state the P value ranges in figure legends.</p><p>Overall, this is a strong paper on a topic of high interest that sets the stage for exciting future studies. For example, it will be interesting to see how specific the <italic>mda5</italic> response is and what other types of RNA can activate these pathways.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript describes a model of ICF syndrome in zebrafish by mutating the ZBTB24 gene, previously described as an ICF-gene. This model recapitulates an ICF hallmark that is pericentromeric (SAT1) hypomethylation. Authors describe that hypomethylation does not affect other genomic regions. As a consequence SAT1 transcripts are detected, parallel to expression of ISGs (IFN response) that may be related to autoimmunity. They show that the IFN pathway dsRNA sensor MDA5-MAVS is required for those effects, sensing SAT1 transcripts.</p><p>It is not clear how ZBTB24 mutant can generate specific demethylation of pericentromeric repeats only, nor what is the relation between ISG upregulation and ICF etiology. Nonetheless, experiments are consistent and proof well the relation between hypomethylation, SAT1 expression and IFN pathway activation through the dsRNA sensors. Similar experiments have been performed elsewhere with DNA methylation inhibitor drugs in human cancer cells (or by histone H1 depletion).</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) It would be nice to test whether aza-dC causes the same effects as ZBTB24 mutation in zebrafish.</p><p>2) In the experiment of SAT1 dsRNA injection, it might be done in parallel with sense and antisense RNA separately to proof dsRNA is required.</p><p>3) It would have been nice to analyze by ChIP what changes occur in SAT1 upon ZBTB24 mutation apart from hypomethylation, for example in terms of repressive histone marks.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Figure 6A and C might be A and B (3 and 6 weeks, respectively). RNAseq on C.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39658.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The manuscript is clear and concise, and the conclusions well supported by the data.

All attempts to cross male and female mutant fish with each other or to outcross male or female mutants to wildtype have been unsuccessful. We do find that the testes in <italic>zbtb24<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> mutants are thinner compared to wildtype siblings and that the sperm count in <italic>zbtb24<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> mutants is significantly reduced when we dissect and manually grind up whole testes to extract sperm. However, histological sections reveal overtly normal male and female gonads with formation of what appear to be mature sperm and eggs. For reasons that are unclear to us, we have been unable to recover these seemingly mature germ cells using traditional methods for in vitro fertilization (which we routinely employ in the lab). We now provide this characterization as <italic>zbtb24</italic>supplementary material (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) and describe these findings in the subsection “Mutation of zebrafish causes ICF syndrome-like phenotypes”. Methods for histology and sperm counting are included in the subsections “Histology” and “Sperm count” respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The ability of sat1 repeat transcripts to trigger the expression of ISG genes was assessed with a mixture of sense and antisense RNAs (Figure 5F). The authors should also inject separately sense and antisense products to assess their relative effect on the interferon response and gain mechanistic insights into the origin of this response.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included additional experimental data for sense and antisense transcripts injected individually. In contrast to combined injection of sense and antisense RNA which reproducibly yielded significant upregulation of ISGs, we find lower level and more variable induction of only some ISGs when either sense or antisense RNA is injected alone. We include this data in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and we include potential interpretations of this result in the (subsection <bold>“</bold>Pericentromeric RNA transcripts are sufficient to trigger the interferon response in <italic>zbtb24</italic> mutants”, last paragraph and Discussion, seventh paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) One point I find missing from the Discussion: what do we know about the dynamics of DNA methylation during early zebrafish development? Is there something specific going on at two weeks, when Zbtb24 function becomes essential? See data from the labs of B. Cairns and R. Lister.</p></disp-quote><p>Dynamics of DNA methylation across early zebrafish development have been extensively characterized (Jiang et al., 2013; Potok et al., 2013, Bogdanovic, 2016). But these analyses have focused on developmental stages prior to 48 hpf. To the best of our knowledge genome-wide methylome analyses on zebrafish has not been performed at 2 weeks post fertilization or in the window surrounding this time point. As such, we are unaware of any developmental or methylation milestones that can account for the onset of hypomethylation in <italic>zbtb24</italic> mutants. Rather, we speculate that the onset of methylation loss at this stage partly reflects the need to deplete maternally loaded <italic>zbtb24</italic> prior to unmasking of the <italic>zbtb24</italic> mutant phenotype and partly reflects the culmination of minor methylation losses due to lower fidelity maintenance over many rounds of cell division. We now include text to this effect in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>- Msp1 should be spelled MspI.</p></disp-quote><p>Msp1 has been changed to MspI in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Age at which the ERRBS was performed: the text says at 25 wpf (Zbtb24 mutants exhibit modest reductions in 5mC at non-pericentromeric sequences), Materials and methods reports 24 wpf.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight on our part.

Significant efforts have been placed in the preparation of the figures, which will make the results easy to understand even for a non-specialist reader. My suggestions for improvement are relatively minor:</p><p>1) It would be useful to discuss in more detail what the proposed function of ZBTB24 is. Is it a DNA methylation reader, a chromatin remodeller (I note that it has a helicase domain)? Also, a couple of sentences describing the potential reasons for differences in the observed zebrafish and mouse phenotypes upon the loss of ZBTB24, would be welcome.</p></disp-quote><p>We now discuss the possible roles of ZBTB24 in regulating DNA methylation in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion.We really don’t understand why mouse and zebrafish <italic>zbtb24</italic> mutant phenotypes are so different and prefer not to speculate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The ERRBS data are of high interest and will likely be reused in similar studies.

This is, of course, difficult to determine by just looking at the scatterplot and even more so if no legend depicting the range of densities is included in the figure. I feel that RRBS data would require some further analysis to unequivocally demonstrate the proposed small magnitude of the changes between the wt and the mutant. I would suggest representing the distributions of 5mC levels at single CpGs in wt and mutant triplicates with boxplots, and stacked bar plots (i.e.% of CpGs with low: 0-0.2, medium: 0.2-0.8, and high: &gt; 0.8 5mC levels). These, and perhaps other analysis, will be better suited for demonstrating the magnitude of changes in 5mC between the wt and the mutant. Also, could the authors comment on the proposed mechanism for this apparent genome-wide 5mC loss in the mutant?</p></disp-quote><p>We now also present% methylation as violin plots for individual <italic>zbtb24</italic> WT and mutant samples (Figure 3F).

This will allow the reader to immediately focus on the significant changes.
