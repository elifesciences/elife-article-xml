evasion (Taubenberger and Morens, 2006; Barr et al., 2010). These mutations arise from the error-prone viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, generating highly heterogeneous viral populations within individual hosts that conform to the quasi-species model of a cloud of related genomes evolving under selection (Domingo et al., 2012). Accurate characterization of this intra-host diversity is crucial for understanding viral evolution and improving vaccine design, yet conventional RNA sequencing often fails to detect low-frequency variants because of technical errors during sample preparation and sequencing. Here, we implement a single unique molecular identifier strategy that reduces sequencing artifacts and achieves an error rate of ~10⁻⁵, enabling single-particle–level quantification of quasi-species diversity. Mutation frequencies greatly exceeding background error confirm their biological origin, while information-theoretic metrics such as Shannon entropy and Jensen–Shannon divergence reveal non-random mutation distributions under selective constraints. This framework supports detailed studies of intra-host viral evolution and may inform artificial intelligence-driven prediction of mutational trajectories and more effective influenza vaccine strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>quasispecies</kwd><kwd>single-molecule sequencing</kwd><kwd>unique molecular identifiers</kwd><kwd>UMIs</kwd><kwd>genetic heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>viral evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00097mb19</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.52926/jpmjcr22n2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tabata</surname><given-names>Kazuhito</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/004rtk039</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP223fa627001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tabata</surname><given-names>Kazuhito</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MERIT-WINGS Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamao</surname><given-names>Kenji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-accuracy single-molecule unique molecular identifier sequencing reveals non-random, biologically driven mutation heterogeneity within influenza quasi-species, enabling precise profiling of intra-host viral evolutionary potential.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza is a seasonal illness caused by the influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cox et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ampofo et al., 2012</xref>). The influenza virus has been observed to exhibit a high mutation rate and antigenic diversity, which has the potential to trigger pandemics and exert significant social and economic impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Taubenberger and Morens, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pardi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the context of influenza, vaccine development has been a prominent preventive strategy. However, the rapid mutation of the virus can lead to fluctuations in vaccine efficacy on an annual basis, thereby complicating precise prediction and comprehensive prevention of infection difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pardi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belongia et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in influenza viruses are primarily introduced by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>). The high error rate characteristic of RdRp enables the virus to undergo rapid evolution, thereby acquiring the capacity to evade existing immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Parvin et al., 1986</xref>). It has been suggested that mutant strains that evade antibody-mediated immunity while retaining infectivity tend to exhibit specific patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Visher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Skountzou et al., 2007</xref>). Further research is necessary to elucidate these predictable mutation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koel et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, bioinformatics analyses that employ artificial intelligence (AI) have played a key role in investigating viral evolution mechanisms and exploring strategies for future vaccine design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deznabi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thadani et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yan and Zhao, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shah et al., 2024</xref>). However, enhancing the precision of AI-driven mutation prediction necessitates the consolidation of extensive global data. This effort is hampered by spatial and temporal limitations, which restrict the amount of data that can be collected and act as a bottleneck for enhancing the accuracy of predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dellicour et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Currently, the genome sequences that are registered in viral genome databases represent the mean sequences of viral particle populations. However, due to the error-prone nature of viral RNA polymerase, viral populations exhibit high genetic diversity within a single host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Domingo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Peck and Lauring, 2018</xref>). This genetic diversity within viral populations can be described by the quasi-species model, which envisions a cloud of related viral genomes centered around a dominant sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sanjuán et al., 2004</xref>). Quasi-species formation plays a crucial role in viral survival strategies, allowing the population to rapidly adapt to environmental pressures such as host immunity or antiviral drugs through collective evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bull et al., 2008</xref>). The development of technology capable of accurately measuring the distribution of genome sequences within a virus population would facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of the types and frequencies of such precursor variants. It is anticipated that these data will play a significant role in the field of AI-based mutation prediction. Accordingly, the quasi-species concept serves as a fundamental framework for understanding viral evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). The accurate quantification of quasi-species diversity is pivotal in facilitating a more profound comprehension of mutation dynamics, selective pressures, and evolutionary potential within a viral population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sardanyés et al., 2024</xref>)—crucial not only for anticipating future dominant variants but also for detecting low-frequency mutations associated with drug resistance or antigenic shifts.</p><p>In current RNA sequencing technology, is plagued by the presence of errors that are introduced during reverse transcription process. The error rate has been reported to be 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻⁵ per nucleotide when using SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase, as utilized in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zucha et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Martín-Alonso et al., 2021</xref>). Accordingly, a target sequencing error rate of 10⁻⁵ was established, and the single unique molecular identifier (sUMI) method was employed. This method has been shown to minimize sample loss and streamline procedures, thereby facilitating the quantification of genomic diversity within influenza virus particle populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Westfall et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that the sUMI method can effectively reduce sequencing error rates to the 10⁻⁵ level. This method involves the ligation of UMIs directly to DNA amplified by cloning, followed by PCR and sequencing. Subsequently, an analysis of quasi-species was conducted on a population of influenza virus particles that had proliferated from a single particle and quantified the variation in their genome sequences was quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Comparison of this variation with the mutation rate of RNA synthesized by in vitro transcription showed that viral populations harbored significantly more mutations, indicating they arose during viral replication. Furthermore, we employed information-theoretic metrics, including Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Menéndez et al., 1997</xref>) and Shannon entropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shannon, 1948</xref>), to analyze the distribution of mutations. Our analysis revealed that specific positions within the viral genome demonstrate selective propagation of mutations.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of the process of obtaining genomic diversity of influenza virus in a population replicated from a single particle.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Madin–Darby Canine Kidney cells were infected with influenza virus at a concentration of 0.05 PFU/well.

A single plasmid molecule was amplified via <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cloning and subsequently linearized by restriction enzyme digestion. An oligonucleotide containing a primer-binding site and a UMI sequence at its 5' end was then ligated to the linearized plasmid. The resulting UMI-tagged linear plasmid was amplified by PCR and subjected to sequencing using the Revio system. The resulting single-molecule sequences were then subjected to analysis using the umierrorcorrect function. During the analysis, we applied GroupSize thresholds of 1, 2, and 3 were applied, and only reads that met each threshold were used to generate consensus sequences for identical UMIs. These consensus sequences were then mapped to the reference sequence. Consequently, the error rates for GroupSize thresholds of 1, 2, and 3 were 3.59×10⁻⁴, 1.35×10⁻⁴, and 3.81×10⁻⁵, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). When the threshold was set to 4, no errors were observed among 37,307 base pairs. These findings demonstrate that filtering sequences based on UMI redundancy can significantly reduce method-derived errors, improving sequencing accuracy by nearly an order of magnitude.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Error rates of unique molecular identifier (UMI)-ligated plasmid filtered by different group size.</title><p>The plasmid, replicated by cloning in <italic>E. coli</italic>, was linearized using restriction enzyme treatment.

In this study, the term ‘homopolymer region’ was defined as a sequence containing three or more identical consecutive bases, including one base on each side. Subsequently, an analysis was conducted to compare the error rates observed in homopolymer and non-homopolymer regions. In accordance with preceding reports, elevated error rates were detected in homopolymer regions. In the sequencing data of UMI-tagged linear plasmids employing a GroupSize threshold of 3, the error rate in homopolymer regions was 7.11×10⁻⁵, whereas the error rate in non-homopolymer regions was 1.66×10⁻⁵ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). As the GroupSize threshold increased from 1 to 3, a decrease in the discrepancy between homopolymer and non-homopolymer regions was observed. This finding indicates that the averaging of sequences with identical UMIs effectively mitigates sequencing errors, particularly in homopolymer regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Quantification of error rate caused by RT and comparison with virus-derived mutation</title><p>In order to ascertain the mutation distribution of viral populations derived from a single virus particle, we sequenced viral genomic RNA extracted from infected cells and subjected it to sequencing. In order to differentiate between biological mutations and technical errors, a comparison was made with in vitro transcribed RNA derived from plasmids.</p><p>Madin–Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and infected with influenza virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05 PFU/well. Following a 72-hour incubation period, wells exhibiting cytopathic effects (CPEs) were harvested. Of the 96 wells, 4 exhibited clear CPE, suggesting successful viral amplification from single particles. The supernatants from these wells were collected as independent viral populations, and total viral genomic RNA was extracted. RT-PCR analysis of the NA gene confirmed that virus replication occurred only in samples where CPE was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>For each viral RNA sample, reverse transcription (RT) was performed with the ligation of UMIs, followed by PCR amplification and sequencing. To control for errors introduced during RT-PCR and sequencing, we prepared plasmids containing sequences homologous to the PB2 and HA segments under a T7 promoter and synthesized RNA via in vitro transcription. These in vitro transcripts were subsequently processed using the same UMI-based RT-PCR and sequencing protocol. Distribution of the number of consensus sequences after filtering based on UMI group size for each gene and population is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>In order to differentiate between biological mutations and technical errors, a method was developed that involved mapping viral reads to the consensus sequence obtained from each viral population and the in vitro transcribed reads to the reference plasmid sequence that was utilized for transcription. The observed error rates in the in vitro transcripts are considered to reflect technical errors associated with RT and sequencing. Conversely, the higher error rates observed in the viral RNA are attributed to a combination of biological mutations and technical noise.</p><p>It is noteworthy that viral RNA exhibited a consistent pattern of elevated error rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). For the PB2 segment, the error rate for viral RNA was 1.19×10⁻⁴, whereas that for in vitro transcribed PB2-like RNA was 2.22×10⁻⁶. Accordingly, the probability that a detected mutation in PB2 originates from viral replication rather than experimental error was calculated as 1 – (2.22×10⁻⁶)/(1.19×10⁻⁴) ≈ 98.1%. Segment-specific error rates ranged from 1.17×10⁻⁴ to 2.19×10⁻⁴ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and thus the PB2 value is within the genome-wide range. These error rates were significantly higher than those of in vitro transcribed PB2-like RNA, indicating that detected mutations are highly likely to originate from viral replication.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Error rates obtained from virus extracted RNA and in vitro transcribed RNA.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Sequencing results of RNA extracted from a virus population propagated from a single molecule and RNA synthesized by in vitro transcription from a plasmid.

Assuming that mutations introduced by T7 RNA polymerase, reverse transcriptase, and PCR enzymes occur randomly, the sequencing errors detected in in vitro transcribed RNA are expected to approximate a Poisson distribution. Conversely, if mutations introduced during viral replication are entirely random with respect to genomic location, then the mutation distribution of viral RNA should also adhere to a Poisson distribution. Conversely, substantial deviations from a Poisson distribution may indicate the presence of selection pressures, such as differences in replication efficiency associated with viral protein function or genomic sequence features.</p><p>The quantification of the discrepancy between the experimentally observed mutation count distribution observed through experimentation and the corresponding Poisson distribution with a mean count (λ) was achieved through the implementation of JSD. The JSD is a symmetric and normalized measure of relative entropy that is both symmetric and normalized. It takes on values approaching 1, indicating greater dissimilarity between distributions. The results indicated that the entire gene set, the mutation distributions of viral RNA exhibited a statistically significant deviation from the Poisson distribution when compared with those of in vitro transcribed RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). These findings imply that the observed mutation patterns in viral populations are not simply the result of neutral, randomly introduced mutations but reflect constraints imposed by selection related to protein function or replication efficiency. However, it is noteworthy that many minor mutations are introduced in a manner that approximately follows a Poisson distribution. These results clearly demonstrate that most mutations are introduced randomly, contributing to the formation of quasi-species.</p><p>To further evaluate the phenotypic diversity within the viral population, we quantified the diversity of amino acid sequences encoded by the RNA using Shannon entropy. Shannon entropy is a measure of uncertainty based on probability distributions, with higher values indicating greater variability. For each viral gene, the distribution of protein sequences derived from all sequencing fragments (with UMI count ≥3) was constructed, and the entropy values between viral RNA and in vitro transcribed RNA were compared. The results demonstrated that, across the entire gene pool, viral RNA exhibited a higher degree of amino acid sequence diversity in comparison to in vitro transcribed RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). This increased diversity is likely indicative of the genetic variation accumulated during viral propagation and can serve as an indicator of the potential evolutionary capacity of the virus under the culture conditions utilized in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Comparison between mutations derived from viral propagation and actual evolutionary lineages</title><p>The majority of the mutations measured in this study within viral populations are likely to be neutral mutations that have been randomly introduced.

Assuming random selection of positions, the probability that a randomly introduced mutation matches both the position and the resulting amino acid of any of the 402 known substitutions is calculated as follows: the resulting percentage, 1.6%, is then calculated by dividing 402 by 4450 and then multiplying by 0.177. In this context, 0.177 represents the mean probability that two independent random point mutations on the same codon will result in the same amino acid substitution.

To validate this approach, the sequencing of UMI-tagged linearized plasmids was conducted. The analysis revealed that focusing solely on sequences with three or more reads that shared the same UMI led to an enhancement in sequence accuracy by more than tenfold. This resulted in an error rate that was on the order of 10⁻⁵ per bp per read. Assuming that PCR and sequencing introduce errors at a rate of approximately 10⁻³, the probability of two or more errors occurring at the same base position among three reads theoretically decreases to the order of 10⁻⁶. The discrepancy between this theoretical value and our measured data is likely attributable to mutation-prone regions, such as homopolymers and amplification bias, where error-containing sequences were preferentially amplified and detected as majorities.</p><p>It is widely acknowledged that PacBio sequencers frequently generate errors in homopolymer regions, and our study observed analogous trends. Specifically, when the UMI redundancy threshold was set to 3, error rates in homopolymer regions were found to be higher than those in non-homopolymer regions. However, the integration of UMIs has led to a significant reduction in this error gap, thereby validating the efficacy of UMI technology in addressing erroneous reads. This finding indicates that UMI-based methods have the potential to enhance the accuracy of PacBio, especially for genes and sequences that contain homopolymer regions. The implications of this study extend to other single-molecule sequencing platforms such as nanopore.</p><p>A subsequent analysis of RNA from virus populations derived from single virus particles exhibited elevated error rates when compared to in vitro transcribed RNA, a phenomenon that is presumably attributable to mutations introduced during viral replication. The observed mutation distribution comprised both mutations consistent with a neutral, Poisson-like accumulation and mutations that deviated substantially from a Poisson distribution. This pattern indicates the coexistence of neutral and non-neutral mutations within the viral population, forming a quasi-species structure. The deviation from Poisson expectations suggests that certain mutations were subject to selective pressures, likely influencing replication efficiency or protein function under the specific culture conditions. For instance, the mutation detection rate near the HA antigenic site (amino acids 180–200) was 1.62×10⁻⁴, approximately 1.5 times higher than the genome-wide mutation rate, highlighting a potential hotspot under positive selection. This finding corroborates prior reports of higher sequence variability in antigenic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thyagarajan and Bloom, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, the observed mutation rates among genes do not align with the findings from previous phylogenetic research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eisfeld et al., 2014</xref> on ‘highly conserved’ and ‘highly divergent’ genes, suggesting a lack of correlation between the distribution size and the evolvability of each gene. Such discrepancies may reflect differences in observation timing. Traditional phylogenetic analyses capture fixed mutations shaped by long-term selection, while our study detects earlier-stage mutations that have yet to undergo full selective filtering. Thus, the weak correlation with phylogenetic conservation likely arises because many observed mutations are still under selection. A comparison between RNA extracted from viral populations and in vitro transcribed RNA revealed greater protein sequence diversity in the former, as quantified by Shannon entropy. This greater diversity reflects the accumulation of mutations during replication and the latent evolutionary potential of viral populations.</p><p>The reference sequences employed for mapping viral genomes in this study were derived from single particles that contributed to the formation of each virus population. Nevertheless, subtle differences were observed among the consensus sequences from four virus populations, suggesting that even within the same PR8 strain, various mutations had accumulated during laboratory passaging, resulting in genetically diverse populations at the outset. This finding suggests that the experimental strain already possessed a mutation pool, and the observed mutation distribution reflects this background diversity. A comprehensive understanding of the effects of long-term passaging on viral population structure and mutation origins is imperative to obtain significant insights.</p><p>As this study did not impose specific selective pressures, we did not observe a significant increase of particular mutations previously linked to drug resistance or host adaptation was not observed within the populations. However, resistance mutations such as I38M, which have been demonstrated to confer resistance to the endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jones et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Taniguchi et al., 2024</xref>), were detected (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1 fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 1 and 2</xref> for a list of all mutations detected). Conversely, mutations fixed in PR8-related strains were already present in populations derived from single particles. These findings imply that the viral quasi-species may serve as a latent genetic reservoir, from which advantageous variants can be selected in response to environmental pressures. While genetic variation was also detected in HA and NA, we did not impose drug or immune selection pressure in this study. Therefore, we did not expect to observe mutations that are already known to confer major antigenic changes in these proteins, and we consider it difficult to speculate on their functional implications in this context. Nevertheless, the detection of resistance-associated mutations indicates that the quasi-species pool may indeed harbor functionally relevant variation, even in the absence of explicit selective pressures. Thus, the real-time observation of mutation proliferation under diverse culture conditions will yield pivotal insights into the mechanisms underlying existing mutation expansion, thereby facilitating the prediction of novel mutations.</p><p>The predominant paradigm in evolutionary biology is the neutral evolution hypothesis, which posits that most evolutionary processes can be explained by random genetic drift. Consequently, elucidating the origins of these evolutionary processes is paramount for making accurate evolutionary predictions. A comprehensive analysis of neutral mutations necessitates the quantification of minor variants. The sUMI method was employed to detect mutations present at 0.1% frequency in populations by sequencing 10,000 molecules. Furthermore, the sequencing error rate was reduced to the order of 10⁻⁵, comparable to reverse transcriptase error rates. This enabled theoretical detection of mutations at a frequency of 0.05% by analyzing over 100,000 molecules with high accuracy. It is anticipated that this approach will yield comprehensive insights into mutation occurrence rates and distributions of mutations in neutral evolution. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the applicability of this method for mutation forecasting by using logistic modeling based on mutation fitness and initial frequencies. Subsequent applications will encompass the comprehensive detection and quantitative estimation of adaptive mutations under diverse environmental conditions, including the presence of drugs and different host species.</p><p>In summary, experimental evidence has demonstrated the efficacy of UMI technology in reducing sequencing errors and accurately measuring mutation distributions within viral populations. Furthermore, evidence was presented demonstrating that sequence distributions within individual populations manifest non-random directional biases. With the continued development of methods to quantify mutation bias and latent evolutionary potential, it is anticipated that laboratory-scale prediction of drug-induced mutations and pandemic-capable strains will become a reality. The broad distribution of mutations indicates that viral populations possess diverse mutation pools, where selective pressures enhance robustness through adaptive mutation selection. This mechanism signifies the ability of viruses to adapt to environmental changes with flexibility, thereby providing critical insights for predicting long-term viral evolution and pandemic emergence. A more thorough examination of the roles of mutations in the context of adaptive viral evolution in response to drug treatment is merited.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and virus</title><p>MDCK cells, which are derived from canine renal tubular epithelial cells, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.

The authors aim to minimize sequencing artifacts and improve the detection of rare variants, proposing that this approach may inform predictive models of viral evolution. While the methodology appears robust and successfully reduces sequencing error rates, key experimental and analytical details are missing, and the biological insight is modest. The study includes only four samples, with no independent biological replicates or controls, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Claims related to rare variant detection and evolutionary selection are not fully supported by the data presented.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study addresses an important technical challenge in viral genomics by implementing a UMI-based long-read sequencing approach to reduce amplification and sequencing errors. The methodological focus is well presented, and the work contributes to improving the resolution of low-frequency variant detection in complex viral populations.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The application of UMI-based error correction to viral population sequencing has been established in previous studies (e.g., in HIV), and this manuscript does not introduce a substantial methodological or conceptual advance beyond its use in the context of influenza.</p><p>The study lacks independent biological replicates or additional viral systems that would strengthen the generalizability of the conclusions. Potential sources of technical error are not explored or explicitly controlled. Key methodological details are missing, including the number of PCR cycles, the input number of molecules, and UMI family size distributions. These are essential to support the claimed sensitivity of the method.</p><p>The assertion that variants at {greater than or equal to}0.1% frequency can be reliably detected is based on total read count rather than the number of unique input molecules. Without information on UMI diversity and family sizes, the detection limit cannot be reliably assessed.</p><p>Although genetic variation is described, the functional relevance of observed mutations in HA and NA is not addressed or discussed in the context of known antigenic or evolutionary features of influenza. The manuscript is largely focused on technical performance, with limited exploration of the biological implications or mechanistic insights into influenza virus evolution.</p><p>The experimental scale is small, with only four viral populations derived from single particles analyzed. This limited sample size restricts the ability to draw broader conclusions about quasispecies dynamics or evolutionary pressures.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The revised manuscript provides additional methodological detail and clearer presentation, which improves transparency. However, the main limitations persist: the study remains small in scale, lacks independent validation, and relies on theoretical rather than empirical support for its claimed detection sensitivity.

Even if techniques are cited, more experimental details should be included. For example, since the study focuses heavily on methodology, details such as the number of PCR cycles in RT-PCR or the rationale for choosing HA and PB2 as representative in vitro transcripts should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important suggestion. We have now expanded the Methods section to include the number of PCR cycles used in RT-PCR (line 407) and have explained the rationale for choosing HA and PB2 as representative transcripts (line 388).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Information on library preparation and sequencing metrics should be included. For example, the total number of reads, any filtering steps, and quality score distributions/cutoff for the analyzed reads.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have added detailed information on library preparation, filtering criteria, quality score thresholds, and sequencing statistics for each sample (line 422, Figure S2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In the Results section (line 115, &quot;Quantification of error rate caused by RT&quot;), the mutation rate attributed to viral replication is calculated. However, in line 138, it is unclear whether the reported value reflects PB2, HA, or both, and whether the comparison is based on the error rate of the same viral RNA or the mean of multiple values (as shown in Figure 3A). Please clarify whether this number applies universally to all influenza RNAs or provide the observed range.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point. We have clarified in the Results (line 140) that the reported value corresponds to PB2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Since the T7 polymerase introduced errors are only applied to the in vitro transcription control, how were these accounted for when comparing mutation rates between transcribed RNA and cell-culture-derived virus?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that errors introduced by T7 RNA polymerase are present only in the in vitro–transcribed RNA control. However, even when taking this into account, the error rate detected in the in vitro transcripts remained substantially lower than that observed in the viral RNA extracted from replicated virus (line 140, Fig.3a). Thus, the difference cannot be explained by T7-derived errors, and our conclusion regarding the elevated mutation rate in cell-culture–derived viral populations remains valid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 2 shows that a UMI group size of 4 has an error rate of zero, but this group size is not mentioned in the text. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Results (line 98) to describe the UMI group size of 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>(1) The application of UMI-based error correction to viral population sequencing has been established in previous studies (e.g., HIV), and this manuscript does not introduce a substantial methodological or conceptual advance beyond its use in the context of influenza.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment and agree that UMI-based error correction has been applied previously to viral population sequencing, including HIV. However, to our knowledge, relatively few studies have quantitatively evaluated both the performance of this method and the resulting within-quasi-species mutation distributions in detail. In our manuscript, we not only validate the accuracy of UMIbased error correction in the context of influenza virus sequencing, but also quantitatively characterize the features of intra-quasi-species distributions, which provides new insights into the mutational landscape and evolutionary dynamics specific to influenza. We therefore believe that our work goes beyond a simple application of an established method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The study lacks independent biological replicates or additional viral systems that would strengthen the generalizability of the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the lack of independent biological replicates and additional viral systems limits the generalizability of our findings. In this study, we intentionally focused on single-particle–derived populations of influenza virus to establish a proof-of-principle for our sequencing and analytical framework. While this design provided a clear demonstration of the method’s ability to capture mutation distributions at the single-particle level, we acknowledge that additional biological replicates and testing across diverse viral systems would be necessary to confirm the broader applicability of our observations. Importantly, even within this limited framework, our analysis enabled us to draw conclusions at the level of individual viral populations and to suggest the possibility of comparing their mutation distributions with known evolvability. This highlights the potential of our approach to bridge observations from single particles with broader patterns of viral evolution. In future work, we plan to expand the number of populations analyzed and include additional viral systems, which will allow us to more rigorously assess reproducibility and to establish systematic links between mutation accumulation at the single-particle level and evolutionary dynamics across viruses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Potential sources of technical error are not explored or explicitly controlled. Key methodological details are missing, including the number of PCR cycles, the input number of molecules, and UMI family size distributions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important suggestion. We have now expanded the Methods section to include the number of PCR cycles used in RT-PCR (line 407). In addition, we have added information on the estimated number of input molecules. Regarding the UMI family size distributions, we have added the data as Figure S2 and referred to it in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Finally, with respect to potential sources of technical error, we note that this point is already addressed in the manuscript by direct comparison with in vitro transcribed RNA controls, which encompass errors introduced throughout the entire experimental process. This comparison demonstrates that the error-correction strategy employed here effectively reduces the impact of PCR or sequencing artifacts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The assertion that variants at ≥0.1% frequency can be reliably detected is based on total read count rather than the number of unique input molecules. Without information on UMI diversity and family sizes, the detection limit cannot be reliably assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important issue. We agree that our original description was misleading, as the reliable detection limit should not be defined solely by total read count. In the revised version, we have added information on UMI distribution and family sizes (Figure S2), and we now state the detection limit in terms of consensus reads. Specifically, we define that variants can be reliably detected when ≥10,000 consensus reads are obtained with a group size of ≥3 (line 173).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Although genetic variation is described, the functional relevance of observed mutations in HA and NA is not addressed or discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. In our study, we did not apply drug or immune selection pressure; therefore, we did not expect to detect mutations that are already known to cause major antigenic changes in HA or NA, and we think it is difficult to discuss such functional implications in this context. However, as noted in discussion, we did identify drug resistance–associated mutations. This observation suggests that the quasi-species pool may provide functional variation, including resistance, even in the absence of explicit selective pressure. We have clarified this point in the text to better address the reviewer’s concern (line 330).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The experimental scale is small, with only four viral populations derived from single particles analyzed. This limited sample size restricts the ability to draw broader conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the limitation of analyzing only four viral populations derived from single particles. We fully acknowledge that the small sample size restricts the generalizability of our conclusions. Nevertheless, we would like to emphasize that even within this limited dataset, our results consistently revealed a slight but reproducible deviation of the mutation distribution from the Poisson expectation, as well as a weak correlation with inter-strain conservation. These recurring patterns highlight the robustness of our observations despite the sample size.</p><p>In future work, we plan to expand the number of viral populations analyzed and to monitor mutation distributions during serial passage under defined selective pressures. We believe that such expanded analyses will enable us to more reliably assess how mutations accumulate and to develop predictive frameworks for viral evolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Please mention Figure 1 and S2 in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Done. We now explicitly reference Figures 1 and S2 (renamed to S1 according to appearance order) in the appropriate sections (lines 74, 124).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 4A, please specify which graph corresponds to PB2 and which to PB2-like sequences.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected. Figure 4A legend now specify PB2 vs. PB2-like sequences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Consider reducing redundancy in lines 74, 149, 170, 214, and 215.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this stylistic suggestion. We have revised the text to reduce redundancy in these lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The manuscript states that &quot;with 10,000 sequencing reads per gene ...variants at ≥0.1% frequency can be reliably detected.&quot; However, this interpretation conflates raw read counts with independent input molecules.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised this statement throughout the text to clarify that sensitivity depends on the number of unique UMIs rather than raw read counts (line 173). To support this, we calculated the probability of detecting a true variant present at a frequency of 0.1% within a population. When sequencing ≥10,000 unique molecules, such a variant would be observed at least twice with a probability of approximately 99.95%. In contrast, the error rate of in vitro–transcribed RNA, reflecting errors introduced during the experimental process, was estimated to be on the order of 10⁻⁶ (line 140, Fig. 3a). Under this condition, the probability that the same artificial error would arise independently at the same position in two out of 10,000 molecules is &lt;0.5%. Therefore, variants present at ≥0.1% can be reliably distinguished from technical artifacts and are confidently detected under our sequencing conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) To support the claimed sensitivity, please provide for each gene and population: (a) UMI family size distributions, (b) number of PCR cycles and input molecule counts, and (c) recalculation of the detection limit based on unique molecules.</p><p>If possible, I encourage experimental validation of sensitivity claims, such as spike-in controls at known variant frequencies, dilution series, or technical replicates to demonstrate reproducibility at the 0.1% detection level.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added (a) histograms of UMI family size distributions for each gene and population (Figure S2), (b) detailed method RT-PCR protocol and estimated input counts (line 407), and (c) recalculated detection limits (line 173).</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and fully recognize the value of spike-in experiments. However, given the observed mutation rate of T7-derived RNA and the sufficient sequencing depth in our dataset, it is evident that variants above the 0.1% threshold can be robustly detected without additional spike-in controls.</p></body></sub-article></article>
