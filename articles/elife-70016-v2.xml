The F<sub>O</sub> torque-generating mechanism remains elusive even though the F<sub>O</sub> interface of stator subunit-a, which contains the transmembrane proton half-channels, and the c-ring is known from recent F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> structures. Here, single-molecule F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> rotation studies determined that the pKa values of the half-channels differ, show that mutations of residues in these channels change the pKa values of both half-channels, and reveal the ability of F<sub>O</sub> to undergo single c-subunit rotational stepping. These experiments provide evidence to support the hypothesis that proton translocation through F<sub>O</sub> operates via a Grotthuss mechanism involving a column of single water molecules in each half-channel linked by proton translocation-dependent c-ring rotation.

The F<sub>O</sub> motor, which is embedded in bioenergetic membranes, uses a non-equilibrium transmembrane chemiosmotic proton gradient also known as a proton-motive force (pmf) to power clockwise (CW) rotation of its ring of c-subunits relative to the subunit-a and -b stator proteins as viewed from the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> periplasm. These subunits contribute to the peripheral stalk bound to one side of the F<sub>1</sub> (αβ)<sub>3</sub>-subunit ring where each αβ-heterodimer comprises a catalytic site that synthesizes ATP from ADP and Pi. Subunit-γ, which docks to the c-ring along with subunit-ε, extends into the core of the (αβ)<sub>3</sub>-ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The rotary position of subunit-γ within the (αβ)<sub>3</sub>-ring causes the conformations of the three catalytic sites to differ such that one site contains ADP and Pi, a second site contains ATP, and the third site is empty. Pmf-powered CW rotation of subunit-γ forces conformational changes to all catalytic sites in the (αβ)<sub>3</sub>-ring, which releases ATP from one catalytic site with each 120° rotational step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kühlbrandt, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spetzler et al., 2012</xref>). In this manner, F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> converts the energy from the pmf (Δμ<sub>H</sub>+) into energy in the form of a non-equilibrium chemical gradient (Δμ<sub>ATP</sub>) where the ATP/ADP•Pi concentration ratio is far in excess of that found at equilibrium.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM structures of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> ATP synthase inhibited by ADP in three rotary states, and measurement of changes in rotational position between catalytic dwells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rotational state-1, pdb-ID 6OQU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sobti et al., 2020</xref>).

Prior to data collection at 200 kHz, a polarizer in the scattered light path was rotated to minimize intensity during one of the three catalytic dwells. Light intensity increased to a maximum upon rotation by 90° during the subsequent CCW 120° power stroke. For each molecule the angular dependence of these power strokes versus time was analyzed.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70016-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>When ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> is significantly higher than n*pmf, the F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase motor can overpower the F<sub>O</sub> motor and catalyze net ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Steigmiller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fischer et al., 2000</xref>). This results in ATPase-dependent power strokes that rotate continuously CCW for 120° at saturating ATP concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yasuda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Spetzler et al., 2006</xref>), and pump protons across the membrane to the periplasm in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spetzler et al., 2012</xref>). Power strokes are separated by catalytic dwells that last a few ms, during which ATP is hydrolyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yasuda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Spetzler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spetzler et al., 2009</xref>). At rate-limiting ATP concentrations, an ATP-binding dwell can interrupt the <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub> power stroke ~34° after the catalytic dwell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yasuda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martin et al., 2014</xref>). At this same rotary position, high ADP concentrations can compete with ATP to bind to the empty catalytic site resulting in ADP inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martin et al., 2014</xref>). All ATP synthases can catalyze ATP hydrolysis to some extent, although many have evolved regulatory mechanisms to minimize this energy wasteful process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kühlbrandt, 2019</xref>). Under some circumstances, <italic>E. coli</italic> employs F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> as an ATPase-driven H<sup>+</sup> pump to maintain a pmf as an energy source for other metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spetzler et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The means by which H<sup>+</sup> translocation from the periplasm generates CW rotational torque on the c-ring is poorly understood. Molecular motors are believed to operate by either power stroke or by a Brownian ratchet mechanism, which has been postulated for F<sub>O</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hwang and Karplus, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oster et al., 2000</xref>). Although evidence clearly supports a power stroke mechanism for F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase-dependent rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pu and Karplus, 2008</xref>), there is little direct evidence in support of either mechanism for F<sub>O</sub>-driven rotation in the ATP synthase direction. Protons enter and exit F<sub>O</sub> via half-channels in stator subunit-a. Two c-subunits in the ring contact subunit-a at a time where the leading cD61 during CW rotation (synthase direction) accepts a proton from the input channel, while the lagging cD61 donates its proton to the output channel.</p><p>The half-channels are separated by the highly conserved subunit-a arginine (aR210 in <italic>E. coli</italic>), which has long been thought to be responsible for displacing the H<sup>+</sup> from cD61 into the output channel during ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lightowlers et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cain and Simoni, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cain and Simoni, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vik et al., 1988</xref>). As the result of mutations of <italic>E. coli</italic> subunit-a residues aN214, aE219, aH245, aQ252, and aE196 to other groups including leucine that decreased ATP synthase activity, ATPase-dependent H<sup>+</sup> pumping, and altered the ATP hydrolysis activity, these residues were proposed to translocate protons directly along the half-channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lightowlers et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Howitt et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eya et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartzog and Cain, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hatch et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hahn et al., 2018</xref>). Cryo-EM F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> structures that reveal details of subunit-a confirmed that these residues are positioned along possible half-channels that are separated by aR210 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hahn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pinke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sobti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, H<sup>+</sup> translocation through F<sub>O</sub> has also been postulated to occur via a Grotthuss mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cukierman, 2006</xref>) where a column of single water molecules that are hydrogen-bonded to specific protein groups behave in a coherent manner to transfer protonic charge over long distances via rapid exchange of H<sup>+</sup> between H<sub>3</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cukierman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wraight, 2006</xref>). A recent F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> structure from bovine mitochondria was of sufficient resolution to observe density near the input channel residues consistent with Grotthuss-type water molecules in this half-channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spikes et al., 2020</xref>). A consequence of this coherent behavior of a Grotthuss water column is that the rate of H<sup>+</sup> transfer can be much faster than the rate via free diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cukierman, 2006</xref>). The possibility that F<sub>O</sub> operates via a Grotthuss mechanism was first suggested from the observation of an astounding H<sup>+</sup> translocation rate of 6240 H<sup>+</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> from a driving force of 100 mV across <italic>Rhodobacter capsulatus</italic> vesicles containing F<sub>O</sub> that lacked F<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feniouk et al., 2004</xref>). The <italic>R. capsulatus</italic> F<sub>O</sub> rates of H<sup>+</sup> transfer exceed the rate of delivery of protons by free diffusion from the bulk aqueous solution at a concentration of 10<sup>–8</sup> M (pH 8) such that the ability to supply protons to a Grotthuss water column should be rate-limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wraight, 2006</xref>). To achieve this rate of H<sup>+</sup> translocation, the existence of a H<sup>+</sup> antenna at the entrance to the F<sub>O</sub> input channel has been postulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wraight, 2006</xref>), which in <italic>R. capsulatus</italic>, was calculated to consist of a hemispherical Coulomb cage with a H<sup>+</sup> capture radius of ~40 Å surrounding the entrance to the input channel.</p><p>Single-molecule studies of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> molecules embedded in lipid bilayer nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) revealed that the 120° CCW ATPase power strokes can be interrupted by transient dwells (TDs) at ~36° intervals with a duration of ~150 μs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishmukhametov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yanagisawa and Frasch, 2017</xref>). In more than 70% of TDs, the F<sub>O</sub> motor not only halted F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase CCW rotation, but the c-ring rotated CW in synthase-direction steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yanagisawa and Frasch, 2017</xref>). Complete assembly of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> nanodisc complexes from the membrane scaffold protein (MSP), lipids, and detergent-solubilized F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> was verified by 2D electrophoresis where the first nondenaturing gel dimension contained a single band, which after the second denaturing dimension, contained bands corresponding to MSP and all F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishmukhametov et al., 2010</xref>). The ATPase activity of nanodisc preparations is DCCD-sensitive, remains unchanged after 8 hr at room temperature, and is 1.5-fold higher than the initial activity of detergent-solubilized F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>, which loses all activity in &lt;4 hr. The observation that a subunit-a insertion mutation, which disrupts the interface between subunit-a and the c-ring, retained ATPase activity but lost the ability to form TDs indicates that these dwells result from an interaction between subunit-a and successive c-subunits in the c-ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishmukhametov et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The occurrence of TDs was found to increase at pH 8 when viscous drag on the nanorod is sufficient to slow the angular velocity of the F<sub>1</sub> ATPase-driven power stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishmukhametov et al., 2010</xref>). These results showed that there is a kinetic component that affects the probability that the interaction between subunit-a and the c-ring will occur relative to the F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase power stroke. A kinetic dependence for F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-catalyzed ATP synthesis versus hydrolysis has been theorized based on energetic calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2005</xref>). Occurrence of TDs, including those with synthase-direction steps, is also known to increase inversely with pH between pH 5 and pH 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yanagisawa and Frasch, 2017</xref>). This suggests that synthase-direction steps depend on H<sup>+</sup> transfer from the protonated groups with a low pKa from the subunit-a input channel to the c-ring, and from the c-ring to unprotonated groups with a high pKa in subunit-a output channel.</p><p>Maximal ATP synthase rates in membrane vesicles where <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> is oriented with F<sub>1</sub> on the outer surface are typically achieved with inner and outer pH values of 5.0 and 8.5, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fischer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fischer et al., 1994</xref>). The pmf can be derived from non-equilibrium differences in pH (ΔpH) or membrane potential (Δψ). Although the energy from ΔpH and Δψ to drive ATP synthesis are interconvertible, the latter is the dominant energy source for <italic>E. coli</italic> in vivo.</p><p>Each of the three successive 120° F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase power strokes required for a full revolution of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> rotor is unique because the rotary positions of subunit-γ differ relative to the peripheral stalk that includes subunit-a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). These power strokes also differ because the 36° stepping of the c<sub>10</sub>-ring and the 120° power strokes can only be aligned during one of the three catalytic dwells. As a result, the three power strokes require the translocation of 4 H<sup>+</sup>, 3 H<sup>+</sup>, and 3 H<sup>+</sup> that result in net c-ring rotations of 144°, 108°, and 108°, respectively. Consequently, the c-ring and subunit-γ become misaligned by +14° and −14° during two of the catalytic dwells. The elasticities of the peripheral stalk, subunit-δ, and to some extent, subunit-γ accommodate these rotary differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sobti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murphy et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The positive and negative torsion on the c<sub>10</sub>-ring from the elastic energy needed to accommodate the +14° and −14° misalignments during rotation affects the ability to form TDs and their associated synthase-direction steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yanagisawa and Frasch, 2017</xref>), which along with their pH dependence and occurrence every 36°, indicate that they correspond to single c-subunit stepping relative to subunit-a. To determine the percentage of power strokes in which TDs were observed, data sets were collected from one of the three 120° power strokes from each single-molecule of nanodisc-embedded <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> examined. For each data set that comprised ~300 power strokes, the percent of power strokes that contained TDs was determined. For each molecule examined there was an equal chance that the c-ring and catalytic dwell was aligned, or subject to the positive or negative torsion from misalignment. The distribution of data sets collected from many molecules versus the percent of power strokes containing TDs fit to the sum of three Gaussians that corresponded to low, medium, and high probabilities of TD formation. The high and low TD percentages were consistent with the torsion from misalignment that provides additional energy to promote TD formation, or to inhibit it when torsion is in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yanagisawa and Frasch, 2017</xref>). Similar effects of the c<sub>10</sub>-ring and catalytic dwell misalignments have also been observed in other single-molecule F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sielaff et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We have now examined mutations of residues in the putative subunit-a half-channels that have been implicated to participate in H<sup>+</sup> transfer events in both the input and output channels with the goal of distinguishing whether F<sub>O</sub> rotation occurs via a Brownian ratchet versus a power stroke mechanism, and whether the half-channel residues transfer protons individually or act together to support water column that transfers protons via a Grotthuss mechanism.</p><p>The ability to form ATP synthase-direction steps as a function of pH during ATP hydrolysis-driven CCW power strokes was characterized in single-molecule studies of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> molecules embedded in lipid bilayer nanodiscs. Formation of synthase-direction steps during a TD was maximal at the pH value when unprotonated and protonated forms of the input and output channels were optimal such that synthase-direction steps required H<sup>+</sup> transfer both from the input channel to the leading c-subunit and from the lagging c-subunit to the output channel. Mutation of a residue from either the input or output channel altered both the low and high pKa values of TD formation indicating that input and output channels communicate. This is consistent with a Grotthuss mechanism where a water column in each of the two channels is connected by rotation-dependent H<sup>+</sup> transfer to and from the leading and lagging c-subunits in the c-ring, which is also supported by features from a variety of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> structures.</p><p>The extent of rotation during ATP synthase-direction steps was unexpectedly found to rotate 11° in the WT and all mutants. Cryo-EM structures of sub-states with subunit-a:c-ring differences of 11° that position the lagging c-subunit cD61 adjacent to output residues aS199 and aE196 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sobti et al., 2020</xref>) are consistent with the synthase-direction steps observed here.

The differential increases in K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub> by 0.6 and 0.75 units led to the aN214L-dependent increase in maximum TD formation at low pH because an equal shift of these values in the same direction causes the curve to shift to higher pH values without affecting the maximum occurrence of TDs formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

These single-molecule investigations also tested the hypothesis that c-rotation operates via a Brownian ratchet versus a power stroke mechanism, and the results provide the first direct evidence that synthase-direction steps can occur by both mechanisms. Finally, the results presented here show that the proton translocation-dependent synthase-direction rotation occurs in 11° steps.

Based on this asymmetry observed in ADP-inhibited F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sobti et al., 2016</xref>), high efficiency TD formation was proposed to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sielaff et al., 2019</xref>) in the rotary state comparable to that in which rotary sub-state structures PDB-IDs 6OQR and 6OQS were subsequently observed at 3.1 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sobti et al., 2020</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sobti et al., 2020</xref>, concurred that torsional strain contributed to their ability to resolve the 6OQR and 6OQS sub-state structures. However, in results presented here, catalytically active F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> in lipid bilayer nanodiscs show successive 11° ATP synthase-direction steps every 36° including at the rotary position of the ATPase power stroke where ADP inhibits rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, dashed line). Because ATP synthase-direction steps can also occur with low efficiency when torsional strain decreases the probability of forming a synthase-direction step, it is clear that torsional strain is not the primary contributing factor to the ability of F<sub>O</sub> to undergo 11° ATP synthase-direction steps.</p><p>After the 11° sub-step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), the distance of the now unprotonated lagging cD61 to the aR210-guanidinium decreased from ~11.5 to ~7.5 Å. These distances are inconsistent with the long-held belief that the role of aR210 is to displace the proton from the lagging cD61. Instead, we postulate that the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged lagging cD61 and aR210 is sufficient to induce the 25° sub-step. As the result of this sub-step, the distance between these groups decreases from 7.5 to 3.8 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). As the 11° sub-step repeats, the subsequent loss of negative charge when the lagging cD61 is protonated by aN214 and aQ252 then allows this c-subunit to rotate away from aR210 into the lipid bilayer.</p><p>The probability that a TD occurs may appear to be stochastic. However, its occurrence depends on the kinetics and the energetics of the system. Slowing the angular velocity of the F<sub>1</sub> ATPase-driven power stroke increases TD occurrence at pH 8.0 (shown here to be suboptimal) indicating that the ability to form a TD depends on the rate that an interaction can form between subunit-a and each c-subunit relative to the angular velocity of F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase-driven rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishmukhametov et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Evidence supports the hypothesis that the energy for F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase power strokes is derived from ATP binding-dependent closure of the β-subunit lever domain upon subunit-γ, which is initiated at ~36° after the catalytic dwell in <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martin et al., 2014</xref>). Based on the K<sub>D</sub> of ATP at 36° measured in <italic>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</italic> F<sub>1</sub>, the energy available for the power stroke from ATP binding is ~13.5 k<sub>B</sub>T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The results here suggest that the energy required to power the 11° synthase-direction step is close to that of the F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase power stroke including: (i) that some synthase-direction steps oscillate consistent with a Brownian ratchet, especially those steps that occur late in the F<sub>1</sub> power stroke when the affinity for ATP is the highest; and (ii) that TD formation efficiency is increased or decreased (high and low efficiencies) by the 0.4 k<sub>B</sub>T of torsional energy from the ±14° rotary mismatch between F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>O</sub> calculated from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 4</xref>, where θ is the rotational displacement in radians using the spring constant, κ, of 12.6 k<sub>B</sub>T radian<sup>–2</sup> measured for <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sielaff et al., 2008</xref>).<disp-formula id="equ4"><label>(4)</label><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">U</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Consequently, the F<sub>O</sub> motor must have at least 13.5 k<sub>B</sub>T available to cause a TD. Possible sources of energy for TDs in addition to the 0.4 k<sub>B</sub>T of torsional energy include: (i) as much as 4.4 k<sub>B</sub>T from the difference of pKa values between the input and output channels; (ii) 5.9 k<sub>B</sub>T from the exclusion of the lagging charged cD61 carboxyl from the lipid bilayer into the aqueous vestibule, based on its measured desolvation energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">White and Wimley, 1999</xref>). The energy penalty of 0.8 k<sub>B</sub>T to insert the leading protonated cD61 carboxyl into the lipid bilayer is avoided by its conversion to the closed and locked position in the c-ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pogoryelov et al., 2010</xref>); and (iii) as much as 38.1 k<sub>B</sub>T from the electrostatic attraction of aR210 to unprotonated lagging cD61 at a distance of 11.5 Å when it is exposed directly to the lipid bilayer. The energy of this attractive force, which is highly dependent on the hydrophobicity of its environment, is calculated by the modified Coulomb equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref>), where q<sub>i</sub> and q<sub>j</sub> are elementary charges, r<sub>ij</sub> is the interatomic distance (in Ångstroms), and e is the dielectric constant, which is a measure of the hydrophobicity of the environment that ranges from 2 (lipid bilayer) to 80 (aqueous solvent). Although we do not yet know how wet the vestibule is, a dielectric constant of 13 and an 11.5 Å aR210-cD61 distance results in 3.8 k<sub>B</sub>T, which when summed with the other energy sources totals 14.1 k<sub>B</sub>T without input of torsional energy. Since F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase rotation from the catalytic dwell to the point that ATP binds is powered by no more than 4 k<sub>B</sub>T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martin et al., 2018</xref>), this explains why synthase-direction rotation at these rotational positions typically has power stroke characteristics.<disp-formula id="equ5"><label>(5)</label><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>561</mml:mn><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:msub><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>After the 25° rotation step when the unprotonated cD61-aR210 distance is 3.8 Å, the electrostatic force is 11.4 k<sub>B</sub>T or 73.8 k<sub>B</sub>T when the dielectric constant is 13 or 2, respectively. Thus, the electrostatic interaction in a hydrophobic environment would be far too strong for any rotation to occur. More work is required to quantify the energetics of these sub-steps in the ATP synthesis mechanism because, when understood in combination with the steady-state pmf values and the dissociation constants of ATP, ADP, and Pi versus rotary position, these energy contributions will determine the non-equilibrium ATP/ADP•Pi concentration ratio that can be maintained by F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> at steady-state in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mutagenesis and purification of nanodisc F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub></title><p>The F<sub>O</sub> subunit-a mutant plasmids were constructed from the pNY<sub>1</sub>-Ase plasmid containing the entire <italic>unc</italic> operon with a 6-His tag on the N-terminus of subunit-β and a cysteine inserted at the second position of subunit c (c2∇Cys), described previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishmukhametov et al., 2010</xref>.

protonation/deprotonation steps produce torque between the a-subunit and the C10 ring, which is subsequently conveyed to F1 to couple to ATP synthesis. This is an important bioenergetics question and the approach yields some tantalizing clues as to which protonation steps are involved. In principle, this knowledge could lead to direct experimental or computational tests to resolve the overall mechanism. The previous issues in the manuscript were well addressed by the authors in the new revision. The reviewers found a few small additional issues, which the authors can address in the final revisions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70016.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Michigan State University</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute of Biophysics</institution><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.05.16.444358">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.16.444358v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;pH-dependent 11{degree sign} F1FO ATP synthase sub-steps reveal insight into the FO torque generating mechanism&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Kramer as Reviewing Editor and José Faraldo-Gómez as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Werner Kühlbrandt (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers found the study to be an important, exciting and &quot;elegantly conducted&quot; contribution that begins to provide the &quot;essential kinetic framework&quot; needed to understand the recent, static high-resolution cryo-EM structures of F1FO ATPases. All reviewers, though, felt that the text itself was difficult to read, even for the expert, and that the issues would be extremely challenging for a more general audience. In some cases, these issues led to confusion relevant to the interpretation of the results and restructuring the text around a more hypothesis-driven framework should make these clearer. Finally, the Discussion seems to become defocused, including hypotheses that are tangential to the main points. a simplified, more focused revision would likely help the readers to understand the strongest points that are directly supported by the experimentation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Discussion should be restructured, focusing more on the component directly supported by the data presented. Relevant suggestions were made by all reviewers, but in particular the suggestion of Reviewer #1 that the text be given a more hypothesis-driven structure should help the reader to understand the context of the results. In other words, the text should make clear what the alternatives were and how the results favored the presented model.</p><p>2) A clarification of the relevance of dwell time to the overall kinetics needs to be included so that a more general audience can understand the critical functional connections. An additional scheme may help to achieve this.</p><p>3) The issue of flexibility of coupling between FO and F1 rotations, brought up by Reviewer #3, should be directly addressed, though additional experimentation is not needed.</p><p>4) The question raised by Reviewer #2 about the physicochemical impact of the formation of a salt bridge between aR210 of subunit-a and cD61 of the c-ring rotor should be directly addressed. How can such interactions promote (rather than hinder) rotation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The text is quite dense and, in many places, difficult to read for the non-specialist, especially given the many references to specific structural details. See also the sentence beginning on line 152, and the paragraph starting on line 365. Scheme 5 is very useful in this respect and maybe it would be helpful to include a few more of such schemes. Specifically, a general scheme describing the expected impact of protonations on TD could help the reader contextualize the results.</p><p>Overall, the text could be far more impactful if it focused more tightly on the implications of the TD results themselves, testing specific sets of models, and taking more care to guide the readers through the interpretation. This could include describing the predictions of alternative hypothetical mechanisms, and how the TD results distinguish among them,</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The introduction should mention explicitly that CCW rotation is powered by ATP hydrolysis. At present, this critical information is hidden in the discussion. The term &quot;ATPase-driven&quot; used in the introduction is not unambiguous, because rotary ATPases are both driven by ATP hydrolysis and drive ATP synthesis.</p><p>Figures and legends:</p><p>Figure 1: &quot;HT&quot; and the meaning of the light green bars are not explained in the legend.</p><p>Figure 2, line 148: The meaning of &quot;each Slide2contained&quot; is not evident.</p><p>Figure 5: The difference between the green and red protons in the figure is not explained.</p><p>Figure 6 A: aE219 (pink) is mostly obscured and barely visible. It is not visible at all in Figure 6B. Since aE219 seems to be in the middle of the aqueous vestibule rather than at its apex, it is not clear how it can channel protons to cD61. A schematic drawing might help. The dashed arrow in (B) that indicates the plane of cD61 rotation is yellow in the figure, but orange in the legend.</p><p>Essential text edits:</p><p>Line 90f: The sentence &quot;These studies reveal that the CW rotation TDs occurs in pH-dependent 11{degree sign} ATP synthase sub-steps that depend… &quot; is not intelligible as written. Probably a word is missing somewhere, and perhaps it should be &quot;occur&quot; rather than &quot;occurs&quot;.</p><p>Line 410: The sentence &quot;Transfer events between the c-ring one of the half channels result in TDs that lack a synthase step&quot; does not make sense. Probably a word is missing.</p><p>Line 415 ff: The following sentence is not intelligible and needs sorting out: &quot;Although this process is reversible, the results presented here that showed that ATP synthase steps increased with aQ252L and especially aN214L, decreased the efficiency of H<sup>+</sup>-transfer in the ATPase direction relative to the ATP synthase direction.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To strengthen this work, I would suggest the authors do the following:</p><p>i) Comment on the possibility that the rotations observed do not corollate with movements of the c-ring relative to subunit-a. Could the clockwise movements be some form of &quot;spring back&quot;, with the 11 or 25 degree sub-steps showing the release of stored energy in the peripheral and/or central stalks. I cannot think of an easy way to test this hypothesis, other than completely redesigning the experiment to anchor subunit-a or changing the elastic properties of the stalks via mutagenesis. These would obviously be new studies, well beyond what is described in this manuscript.</p><p>ii) Gels confirming subunit-a is present, along with ATPase assays (with and without DCCD) in nanodiscs and proton pumping assays in liposomes should be provided for all the mutants in this study. The published literature shows similar mutants, however to my knowledge not all positions are mutated to Leucine as they are in this study.</p><p>iii) Comment on the activity of the mutants relative to wild type. Are there any differences in ATPase activity between the mutants? Could the frequency or length of transient dwells explain any changes seen in ATPase activity?</p><p>iv) Comment on the what causes the transient dwells. Is there a way to show that these are related to F1-ATPase inhibition? Could the authors add Azide or AMP-PNP to increase the likelihood of inhibition?</p><p>v) Overlay successive transient dwell power strokes from the same molecule at the same rotatory position. It would be interesting to see whether the same molecule consistently performs 11 or 25 degree movements at the same rotary position. This could be potentially used to disseminate whether the CW sub steps are caused by &quot;spring back&quot; from the peripheral stalk or synthesis sub steps.</p><p>vi) Modify the text: The introduction is quite confusing to the non-specialist reader. The discussion is longer than the results and the methods are very brief.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70016.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Discussion should be restructured, focusing more on the component directly supported by the data presented.

As requested, we added a paragraph to the Introduction that refers to previous work describing the effects of the mutants to leucine studied here regarding their effects on ATP hydrolysis activity and proton pumping rate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) Comment on the activity of the mutants relative to wild type. Are there any differences in ATPase activity between the mutants? Could the frequency or length of transient dwells explain any changes seen in ATPase activity?</p></disp-quote><p>The results of the single-molecule studies presented here do not conflict with the effects of mutations on activity reported previously.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) Comment on the what causes the transient dwells. Is there a way to show that these are related to F1-ATPase inhibition? Could the authors add Azide or AMP-PNP to increase the likelihood of inhibition?</p></disp-quote><p>We added information to the Introduction and to the Discussion to address the reviewer’s concerns. Addition of azide or AMP-PNP would not, in our opinion, provide any more information than the DCCD experiment that we already published.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>v) Overlay successive transient dwell power strokes from the same molecule at the same rotatory position. It would be interesting to see whether the same molecule consistently performs 11 or 25 degree movements at the same rotary position. This could be potentially used to disseminate whether the CW sub steps are caused by &quot;spring back&quot; from the peripheral stalk or synthesis sub steps.</p></disp-quote><p>For the present manuscript, we feel that we have provided evidence that clearly demonstrates that the CW sub steps are not an artifact caused by “spring back” from the peripheral stalk but instead represent rotation of the c-ring relative to subunit-a, and that no further experiments are required to prove this point further. In addition, we present evidence that the “spring back” from the peripheral stalk does impact the efficiency of TD formation as we reported previously and has been corroborated by other labs.</p><p>The reviewer does pose a very interesting question that additional analyses to see whether the same molecule consistently performs 11 or 25 degree movements at the same rotary position could provide additional insight into the F1Fo mechanism, but such studies are beyond the scope of the current manuscript, which already represents 4 years of work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>vi) Modify the text: The introduction is quite confusing to the non-specialist reader. The discussion is longer than the results and the methods are very brief.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a substantial amount of background information to the Introduction to address the reviewer’s concern. We also added information to the Results to help the non-specialist readers understand the purpose of the experiments and the reasons that the evidence supports the conclusions, and we added additional details to the Methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
