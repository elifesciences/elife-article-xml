evasion, evolved by the acquisition of genes from their hosts through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). However, the lack of an experimental system has prevented a mechanistic understanding of this process. We developed a model to elucidate the mechanisms of HGT into vaccinia virus, the prototypic poxvirus. All identified gene capture events showed signatures of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1)-mediated retrotransposition, including spliced-out introns, polyadenylated tails, and target site duplications. In one case, the acquired gene integrated together with a polyadenylated host U2 small nuclear RNA. Integrations occurred across the genome, in some cases knocking out essential viral genes. These essential gene knockouts were rescued through a process of complementation by the parent virus followed by nonhomologous recombination during serial passaging to generate a single, replication-competent virus. This work links multiple evolutionary mechanisms into one adaptive cascade and identifies host retrotransposons as major drivers for virus evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>horizontal gene transfer</kwd><kwd>LINE-1</kwd><kwd>retrotransposons</kwd><kwd>poxvirus</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>PKR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI146915</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rothenburg</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new experimental system of horizontal gene transfer demonstrates that host retrotransposons facilitate the transfer of host genes into poxviruses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the transmission of genetic material between different organisms. This process shapes the evolution and functional diversity of all major life forms, including viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keeling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gilbert and Cordaux, 2017</xref>). The genomes of large DNA viruses, including poxviruses and herpesviruses, contain numerous genes that likely have been acquired from their hosts by HGT. Many of these captured genes are involved in immune evasion or protection from environmental damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hughes and Friedman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bratke and McLysaght, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bratke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilson and Brooks, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Iyer et al., 2006</xref>). So far, the detection of HGT in large DNA viruses has relied on bioinformatic approaches, primarily phylogenetic and sequence composition analyses. For example, Odom et al. performed a family wide comparison of poxvirus coding genes to different taxonomic subsets, such as âall eukaryotic genesâ or âall other viral genesâ. They found that poxvirus ORFs are on average more similar to eukaryotic genes than other viruses, suggesting substantial HGT into poxviruses over evolutionary time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Odom et al., 2009</xref>). In an orthogonal approach, Monier et al. used a Bayesian methodology to identify large DNA virus genes with anomalous nucleotide composition relative to the viral genome as a whole. Using this approach, they determined that a large number of the compositionally anomalous genes in <italic>Poxviridae</italic> are associated with host immune control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Monier et al., 2007</xref>). One of the most striking examples for HGT are viral homologs of host interleukin 10 (IL-10) genes. Viral IL-10 genes, which presumably provide a selective advantage through inhibition and modulation of the antiviral response, have been independently acquired by several herpesviruses and poxviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hughes and Friedman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">SchÃ¶nrich et al., 2017</xref>). While bioinformatic methods can detect putative HGT they can do little to elucidate the frequency or mechanisms of HGT.</p><p>The two most likely mechanisms for HGT into DNA viruses are either a DNA-mediated process such as integration via recombination or the help of DNA transposons, or an RNA-mediated integration such as gene transfer via retrotransposons or retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">SchÃ¶nrich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sekiguchi and Shuman, 1997</xref>). While it is unclear how most viral orthologs of host genes were acquired, the vIL-10 gene in ovine herpesvirus 2 has retained the intron structure of the host gene, supporting a mechanism of DNA-mediated HGT in this instance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jayawardane et al., 2008</xref>). However, because most herpesvirus genes and all known poxvirus genes lack introns, it is unclear how common DNA-mediated HGT events may be. In fact, the taterapox virus genome contains a host-derived short interspersed nuclear element (SINE), which is flanked by a 16-bp target site duplication (TSD), indicating that the long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1, L1) group of retrotransposons can also facilitate the transfer of host genetic material into poxviruses through an RNA-mediated process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Piskurek and Okada, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The family <italic>Poxviridae</italic> comprise many viruses of medical and veterinary importance, including variola virus, the causative agent of human smallpox, vaccinia virus (VACV) the best-studied poxvirus, which was used as the vaccine against smallpox, and monkeypox virus, an emerging human pathogen. Poxviruses can enter a large number of mammalian cell types in a species-independent manner; therefore, productive infection largely depends on the successful subversion of the host immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haller et al., 2014</xref>). More than 40% of poxvirus gene families show evidence that they were host derived, including many genes involved in immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hughes and Friedman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bratke and McLysaght, 2008</xref>). This high proportion of host-acquired genes suggests that poxviruses may represent ideal candidates to study the process of HGT.</p><p>In order to establish an experimental model of HGT, we exploited the dependence of VACV replication on effective inhibition of PKR, which is an antiviral protein activated by double-stranded (ds) RNA formed during infection with both DNA and RNA viruses. Activated PKR phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2Î±), which inhibits cap-dependent protein synthesis, thereby preventing virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu and Kaufman, 1997</xref>). Because PKR exerts a strong antiviral effect, many viruses, including poxviruses, have evolved inhibitors that can block PKR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Langland et al., 2006</xref>). Most poxviruses that infect mammals contain two PKR inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bratke et al., 2013</xref>), which are called E3 (encoded by E3L) and K3 (encoded by K3L) in VACV. E3 is a dsRNA-binding protein, which prevents PKR homodimerization and thereby inhibits PKR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davies et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 1992</xref>). K3L, which may itself be a horizontally transferred gene, possesses homology to the PKR-binding S1 domain of eIF2Î±, and acts as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor of PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beattie et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dar and Sicheri, 2002</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we have established a model system to study HGT from the host genome into VACV. In all of the HGT events we detected, the captured genes showed multiple signatures that host LINE-1 retrotransposons were involved in the gene capture. In some cases, integration of the horizontally acquired gene occurred in essential virus genes. In those cases, complementation of both the parental virus and the virus that acquired the gene was necessary for virus replication. After only a few rounds of continued passaging, these complementing viruses recombined to generate single replication-competent viruses. Taken together, retrotransposon-mediated HGT followed by complementation and recombination describes an unexpected cascade of evolutionary processes to rapidly integrate host genes into the viral genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An experimental system to detect host gene capture by vaccinia virus</title><p>In order to detect HGT into VACV, we designed an experimental system that uses the selective pressure imposed by PKR on VACV replication. In this model, we use a VACV strain (VC-R2) that lacks both PKR antagonists and can therefore only replicate in PKR-deficient cells or in complementing cells that express viral PKR inhibitors, such as VACV E3 or K3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hand et al., 2015</xref>). We stably transfected PKR-competent RK13 cells with E3L-tagged mCherry (mCherry-E3L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), selected an individual clone that showed robust mCherry-E3 expression by fluorescence microscopy, and verified that it contained the entire expression cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The PKR-sensitive virus VC-R2 can infect these cells as efficiently as wild-type VACV, but not wild-type RK13 cells. However, if during the course of infection VC-R2-acquired mCherry-E3L from the host cell, the virus would be able to replicate in PKR-competent cells and fluoresce red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The expression cassette also contains the rabbit Î²-globin intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) enabling us to distinguish between direct DNA-mediated integration or indirect RNA-mediated integration, the two most likely mechanisms for HGT into DNA viruses. We infected the RK13-mCherry-E3L cell line with VC-R2 and titered the resulting viruses on permissive RK13 + E3 + K3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rahman et al., 2013</xref>). Then, we infected wild-type RK13 cells, which are nonpermissive for VC-R2, with these viruses and isolated plaques that expressed both mCherry and EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Overall, we identified 20 recombinant viruses with unique integration sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). In total, we screened approximately 7.5 Ã 10<sup>8</sup> virions while optimizing this system. After optimization, we screened 3.63 Ã 10<sup>8</sup> virions derived from a single 48-hr infection of RK13 cells (multiplicity of infection [MOI] = 0.01). We screened this population in RK13 cells (MOI = 0.2) and identified 16 unique HGT isolates. This indicates a detected transfer rate of mCherry-E3L into the VACV genome of approximately 1 in 22.7 million viable virions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Detection of experimental horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in vaccinia virus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) VACV lacking E3L and K3L cannot replicate in wild-type RK13 cells, but can replicate in cells stably transfected with mCherry-E3L.

One possibility could be that although these viruses were plaque purified three times, the parent virus may have persisted to complement the otherwise nonviable HGT virus. To test this hypothesis, we infected RK13 + E3 + K3 cells, which are also permissive for the parental virus, with each plaque-purified HGT isolate. In all these infections, we identified the expected EGFP/mCherry double-positive foci. Additionally, foci that were EGFP positive but mCherry negative were observed in isolates in which mCherry-E3L insertions occurred in essential genes, indicating the continued presence of parental virus. The percentage of mCherry positive to mCherry negative foci in these viruses ranged between 7% and 51% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We hypothesized that the two fluorescent phenotypes indicated mutual complementation, wherein the HGT virus supplied mCherry-E3 and VC-R2 supplied the disrupted essential gene product, thus permitting replication of both viruses in coinfected cells. To test this hypothesis, we coinfected RK13 cells with VC-R2 and the F13L-disrupted HGT13 virus, which did not contain detectable VC-R2 but formed only minute foci in either RK13 or BSC-40 cells. As predicted, in the coinfection we observed larger foci in addition to the very small foci produced by HGT13 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In an additional, PCR-based test of this hypothesis, we amplified DNA spanning the integration sites in HGT1, which acquired mCherry-E3L in an intergenic region, or HGT3, in which the essential gene H4L was disrupted. As expected, HGT1 yielded a single 2.3 kB amplicon of the expected size for mCherry-E3L integration. However, we amplified two products from HGT3: a 396-bp amplicon, consistent with wild-type H4L, and a 2.2 kb amplicon consistent with mCherry-E3L integration into H4L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>).

However, for most HGT isolates this ratio was lower, indicating that virus complementation did not necessarily result in optimal replication of both viruses. In these cases, there may be strong selective pressure to evolve a single replication-competent virus that is not reliant on a complementing virus. To test this hypothesis, we serially passaged the HGT3/parental virus population in PKR-competent RK13 cells. In three independent replicates, we observed a rapid increase in double-positive fluorescent foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>), consistent with an increase in HGT3 fitness. In order to directly test for a fitness increase, we infected RK13 and BSC-40 cells with the passaged virus populations for 48 hr and then titered the viruses on RK13 + E3 + K3 cells. Whereas in RK13 cells the passaged viruses showed only a modest increase in replication (about fivefold) in passages 9 and 17, an approximately 100-fold higher replication was observed for BSC-40 cells infected with passages 9 and 17 as compared to passage 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Fitness increase of HGT3 after serial passaging.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The percentage of mCherry-positive foci formed on RK13 + E3 + K3 cells by three serially passaged replicates of HGT3.

All HGT events showed evidence for an RNA-mediated mechanism, likely mediated by LINE-1 retrotransposons, as they contain TSD of approximately 16 bp surrounding the integration sites, as well as spliced-out introns and untemplated poly(A) tracts 3â² of the integrated genes. LINE-1s are ancient and ubiquitous retrotransposons, which are found in both plants and animals. The number of active LINE-1s varies across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ivancevic et al., 2016</xref>). Active LINE-1s encode two proteins called ORF1p and ORF2p, which possess either RNA-binding properties or endonuclease and reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dombroski et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khazina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doucet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Feng et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mathias et al., 1991</xref>). LINE-1-mediated reverse transcription is generally thought to occur in the nucleus. Because poxviruses replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm, the detected signatures of LINE-1-mediated retrotransposition after HGT reported here suggest that LINE-1 RT and integrase activities are not limited to the nucleus. The notion that LINE-1s can facilitate the transfer of host genetic material into poxviruses through an RNA-mediated process during the natural course of viral infection is further supported by the presence of a naturally occurring SINE element in taterapox virus, which is surrounded by a 16-bp TSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Piskurek and Okada, 2007</xref>). This observation shows that poxvirus evolution can be impacted by host transposable elements providing them with selective advantages and accelerating their evolution. It also defines a new function for retrotransposons, in addition to their roles in genomic and epigenetic diversification of the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Even though phylogenetically predicted HGT candidates in VACV are distributed throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hughes and Friedman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bratke and McLysaght, 2008</xref>), a common notion in the field is that uptake of new genes into poxviruses would be biased toward the ends of poxvirus genomes, because the central genome region contains more essential genes and shorter intergenic spaces and thus insertions there would be less likely to result in viable progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yao and Evans, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lefkowitz et al., 2006</xref>). Also, poxvirus lineage-specific genes tend to be more often found near the termini of poxvirus genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McLysaght et al., 2003</xref>). However, the integration sites that we discovered in this study were distributed throughout the VACV genome, which indicates that integration per se is not disfavored in the central genomic region. The concentration of insertions around the H4L locus might indicate that some regions of the genome are indeed hotspots for integration. However, the number of integration events detected in this study precludes a definitive answer, and will require further analysis of more HGT events. It is also possible that the insertion site is influenced by the cell type. Because complementation of replication-deficient viruses was more efficient in RK13 as opposed to BSC-40 cells, it appears that propagation of viruses with insertions in essential genes might be favored in the former cells. In a companion paper, Fixsen et al. used a similar strategy to detect HGT by expressing the other VACV PKR inhibitor K3 in RK13 cells, which were also used in our study, and selecting for virus replication in Syrian hamster BHK cells. They found a lower proportion of HGT integrations in the central genome region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fixsen et al., 2020</xref>). The reasons for the different integration patterns could be due to the different cells used for selection and might reflect differences in the relative importance of viral genes in these cells or different, cell line-dependent complementation efficiencies.</p><p>Our results show that HGT into essential poxvirus genes can result in viable progeny virus in a process that we call cascade evolution. This process sequentially combines HGT, virus complementation and recombination, three classic mechanisms of virus evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our experimental system relies on the complete failure for viruses to replicate in the absence of a PKR inhibitor, creating a strong selective pressure. In eight instances in this study we also identified integrations into essential genes, creating a similarly strong selective pressure against virus replication. In these cases, complementation followed by recombination was sufficient to overcome this selective pressure in vitro. The homology regions surrounding the cowpox virus GAAP gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggest a similar process can occur during natural infection as well. In instances in which the selective pressure to maintain the horizontally transferred gene is weaker or the inactivated gene is nonessential but still contributes to fitness, we hypothesize that similar molecular events might occur. This balance between the negative effects of genome disruption and improved fitness might also display some degree of cell and species specificity.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Cascade virus evolution after horizontal gene transfer into an essential gene.</title><p>After retrotransposon-mediated horizontal gene integration into an essential locus (1) the virus initially depends on a helper virus to complement the essential gene (2), which is followed by recombination and results in a single virus with increased fitness.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-63327-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our PacBio analyses identified tandem copies of the integrated gene and intact gene, in both orientations relative to each other. However, at the population level the genomic structure surrounding this locus was complex. For example, we identified loci including both intact H4L and the horizontally acquired mCherry-E3L in which multiple copies of each gene were found in cis. Furthermore, in some genomes we identified three or more copies of some genes adjacent to the integration site. In addition to the immediate impact of generating a replication-competent virus through recombination, these variant products of recombination might provide the raw material for subsequent sub- or neofunctionalization of the additional gene copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bayer et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The majority of the HGT viruses that required complementation with the parental virus formed larger plaques in RK13 cells as compared to BSC-40 cells. This difference may indicate that the complementation is more efficient in RK13 cells. In line with this explanation, we observed that the parent HGT3 population replicated poorly in BSC-40 cells, and the passaged population replicated about 100-fold more efficiently, whereas in RK13 cells, the parent HGT3 population replicated better and only gained a modest increase in replication efficiency during passaging. It is striking that for most observed cases of virus complementation, the ratio of parent to HGT virus was skewed to the parent virus, in some cases making up more than 90% of the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This observation suggests that there may be competition for cellular resources or viral gene products between the coinfecting viruses. While mCherry-E3 localizes to the cytoplasm and likely antagonizes PKR equally well for each coinfecting virus, the transcription and translation of many other viral gene products are tightly associated with viral factories derived from a single genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Katsafanas and Moss, 2007</xref>). Conceptually, this competition may occur when the complementing molecule is required to diffuse or to be transported into another viral factory to exert its effect, or if the viral gene product is not delivered until virus factories fuse late in the replication cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paszkowski et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>An interesting observation was that in one of the HGT isolates, mCherry-E3L was fused to a polyadenylated fragment of the cellular U2 snRNA. This genetic structure may have been generated by the fusion of mCherry-E3L RNA with U2 snRNA prior to integration. This observation suggests that other cellular genes could piggyback during HGT, which suggests in rare instances multiple genes may be integrated into a single genome. Of note, snRNAs encoding DNA including U1, U2, U5, and U6 can be found in host genomes fused to LINE-1 as a result of RNA ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buzdin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garcia-Perez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doucet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moldovan et al., 2019</xref>). However, it is unclear what, if any, impact the potential to integrate multiple genes would have on viral evolution.</p><p>The calculated approximate transfer rate of E3L-mCherry into VACV in this experimental setting of 1 in 23 million viable virions is probably an underestimation, as integrations in essential loci have detrimental effects on virus replication unless complementing viruses are present. It should be noted that we used a system with a strong synthetic poxvirus promoter and a strong PKR inhibitor in order to detect HGT. Retention of a transferred host gene that has not been optimized is expected to happen with a far lower frequency. However, we selectively looked for the uptake of only one of several thousand genes that are expressed by the host cells. Thus, HGT of host genes, including transposable elements such as SINEs and LINEs, into poxviruses can be expected to occur at a high frequency, but in most cases the inserted gene will not be maintained because of negative or neutral effects on virus replication.</p><p>This work, and the companion study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fixsen et al., 2020</xref>, provides the first experimental evidence of HGT into poxviruses. The experimental system described here can be extended to study the evolution of transgenes after HGT. In addition, it can be adapted to elucidate the mechanisms of HGT in other groups of viruses for which HGT is believed to play an important evolutionary role. While we only detected RNA-mediated HGT facilitated by LINE-1, it is possible that in other viruses or cell types additional RNA or DNA transposons, or recombination might be important. Similarly, other facilitators, such as endogenous or exogenous retroviruses may also promote HGT and increase virus fitness. Taken together, our work demonstrates that cascade evolution is a powerful and rapid mechanism to integrate new genetic material in poxviral genomes. It also demonstrates that HGT in poxviruses is traceable in experimental settings, and that this mechanism may be relevant to other viruses, which appropriate host genes for their own ends in the ongoing hostâvirus arms race.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>RK13 cells (ATCC CCL-37) and BSC-40 (ATCC CRL-2761) cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Bernard Moss and Dr. Adam Geballe, respectively.

Cells were infected at MOI = 0.2 to screen for fluorescence to avoid cell death observed at higher MOIs. For most isolates, plaques were identified after 3 days but some took as long as 5 days.

In order to increase throughput, screening for double-positive plaques was then performed with an automated microscope (EVOS FL Auto 2, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using comparable filters. Double-positive virus plaques were picked using a sterile pipette tip. Harvested plaques were subjected to three rounds of freezeâthaw followed by sonication (two times 30 s). These viruses were then serially diluted to infect RK13 cells for a total of three rounds of plaque purification.

Before library preparation, the quality of genomic DNA was evaluated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (Sage Science Pippin Pulse) and genomic DNA concentration was quantified using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies Q33216). Briefly, 10 Âµg of each viral genomic DNA was used for HiFi SMRTbell library preparation by using SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 (Pacific Biosciences 100-938-900). The genomic DNA was sheared to ~15â20 kb size by Megaruptor (Diagenode B06010001). The sheared DNA samples were then concentrated and purified by AMPure PB Beads (Pacific Biosciences 100-265-900) by adding 0.45Ã volume of AMPure PB magnetic beads to each sheared DNA samples and subsequent 80% ethanol precipitation and elution with 100 Âµl elution buffer. Following genomic DNA shearing and purification, each genomic DNA sample was subjected to single-strand DNA (ssDNA) overhang removal and DNA damage repair. In short, ssDNA overhangs were removed using ssDNA overhang removal reaction mix (DNA prep buffer, NAD, DNA prep additive and DNA prep enzyme) and incubated at 37Â°C for 15 min. The DNA fragments of each sample were then repaired by using a DNA damage repair mix and incubated at 37Â°C for 30 min before proceeding to End repair/A-tailing by mixing with 1Ã End prep mix and incubated at 20Â°C for 10 min followed by 30 min incubation at 65Â°C. After that, different barcoded adapters were ligated to each fragmented viral DNA sample by mixing with adapter ligation reaction mix (Overhang adapter v3, ligation mix, ligation additive, and ligation enhancer) and incubated at 20Â°C for an hour followed by incubation at 65Â°C for 10 min to inactivate the ligase. After ligation reaction, each adapter-ligated SMRTbell library was treated with exonucleases to remove damaged or unligated DNA fragments for 1 hr at 37Â°C followed by a second purification step with 0.45Ã AMPure PB Beads. After purification, the libraries were multiplexed into two library pools for size selection: 6-plex pool 1 and 10-plex pool 2. These pooled SMRTbell libraries were then purified by mixing with 0.45Ã volume of AMPure PB beads followed by 80% ethanol wash and elution with 31 Âµl EB for size selection. Size selection was done using the BluePippin Size-Selection System (Sage Science BLU0001) to remove &lt;6 kb SMRTbell templates and eluted the size selected libraries into two size fractions: 9â13 and &gt;15 kb per pooled library. The only fraction with &gt;15 kb SMRTbell libraries was purified with 0.50Ã AMPure PB Beads and used for primer annealing and polymerase binding. Sequencing Primer v2 (PN 101-847-900) was annealed to each size selected SMRTbell library fraction of &gt;15 kb length at primer: template ratio of 20:1 by denaturation step at 80Â°C for 150 min followed by slow cooling at 0.1Â°C/s to 25Â°C.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Eugene V. Koonin (Reviewer #2); Derek Walsh (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Rothenburg and colleagues report acquisition of genes from the host by vaccinia virus via a LINE-2-dependent reverse transcription mechanism. They show that the vaccinia virus-encoded PKR inhibitor E3L that is integrated into the host genome as a fusion with a reporter can be reacquired by a PKR-sensitive virus mutant with the frequency of about 1 in 20 million. Obviously, detection of such rare events is a major experimental achievement.</p><p>This novel experimental system to study host gene acquisition by poxviruses will clearly be of broad relevance and utility to other viral systems in the future. Using the system, the authors elegantly illustrate RNA-mediated gene transfer through LINE-1, demonstrating that it not only occurs relatively randomly but also occurs in essential genes. When this occurs, initial propagation of the mutant is facilitated by co-infection with a parental virus until a secondary recombination event between the parental and mutant virus drives the formation of a replication competent virus with the new host gene.</p><p>The manuscript is well written, the experimental system is solid, the experimental approach is well controlled and the results are exciting. The comments below are simply requests for further exposition.</p><p>1. One of the reviewers has an issue with the interpretation of 'cascade evolution' occurring in the results reported here. Here is the comment; 'The recipient viruses with defects in the viruses with insertions into essential genes are nonviable but they can be rescued by complementation with a virus containing the respective intact gene. Such complementation is part of a process that the authors denote 'cascade evolution' whereby complementation is followed by recombination reintroducing an intact copy of the essential gene into the virus genome containing the insert.&quot; This objection seems to rest on two necessarily artificial aspects of the experimental set-up:</p><p>1) The extremely strong selection pressure that necessitates complete complementation, and</p><p>2) the possibility that the scar left in the defective genome provides a very favorable site, complete with promoter, for homologous insertion. These arrangements were, of course, necessary to observe this process experimentally in real time.</p><p>Discussion that might prove helpful to readers might include:</p><p>1) The idea that rescue and complementation could occur naturally in both quasispecies generated within a cell and in the en bloc transmission that can occur during cell-to-cell spread;</p><p>2) complete failure to grow is clearly a very strong selective pressure that, here, can serve as a stand-in for weaker selective pressure that may not require the presence of complementing or rescuing genomes;</p><p>3) the insertion of the host gene into this 'favorable' site merely serves to increase the frequency of the event, because one can easily envisage favorable sites occurring naturally, although clearly at lower frequency.</p><p>These points are made here and there in the manuscript but perhaps could be made more explicitly in a discussion of frequency in the Discussion.</p><p>2. There was some discussion of whether the RT steps in LINE-1 processes occur in the nucleus or the cytoplasm, and that some poxviruses carry remnants of retroviral genomes can support either argument. For non-specialists, it might be helpful to discuss this a little to fully understand the process.</p><p>3. Reviewers request further introduction and citation of the literature on HGT in the Introduction â perhaps this could assist with point (2) as well.</p><p>4.

For example, Odom, et al., performed a family wide comparison of poxvirus coding genes to different taxonomic subsets, such as âall eukaryotic genesâ or âall other viral genesâ. They found that poxvirus ORFs are on average more similar to eukaryotic genes than other viruses, suggesting substantial HGT into poxviruses over evolutionary time (Odom et al., 2009). In an orthogonal approach, Monier, et al., used a Bayesian methodology to identify large DNA virus genes with anomalous nucleotide composition relative to the viral genome as a whole.</p><p>Using this approach, they determined that a large number of the compositionally anomalous genes in <italic>Poxviridae</italic> are associated with host immune control (Monier et al., 2007). From these and other studies, it has become apparent that viral homologs of host interleukin 10 (IL-10) genes are among the best supported examples of these HGT events. Viral IL-10 genes, which presumably provide a selective advantage through inhibition and modulation of the antiviral response, appear to have been independently acquired by several herpesviruses and poxviruses (Hughes and Friedman, 2005, Schonrich et al., 2017). While these methods can detect putative HGT they can do little to elucidate the frequency or mechanisms of HGT.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this manuscript, Rahman and colleagues describe an experimental system to study host gene acquisition by poxviruses, which will clearly be of broader relevance and utility to other viral systems in the future.

The notion that LINE-1s can facilitate the transfer of host genetic material into poxviruses through an RNA-mediated process during the natural course of viral infection is further supported by the presence of a naturally-occurring SINE element in taterapox virus, which is surrounded by a 16 bp target site duplication (Piskurek and Okada, 2007).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A gene transfer frequency of 1 in 23 million is mentioned.

To address this, we have added a paragraph to the discussion (Lines 321-330):</p><p>âThe calculated approximate transfer rate of E3L-mCherry into VACV in this experimental setting of 1 in 23 million viable virions, is probably an underestimation, as integrations in essential loci have detrimental effects on virus replication unless complementing viruses are present. It should be noted that we used a system with a strong synthetic poxvirus promoter and a strong VACV PKR inhibitor in order to detect HGT. Retention of a transferred host gene that has not been optimized is expected to happen with a far lower frequency. However, we selectively looked for the uptake of only one of several thousand genes that are expressed by the host cells. Thus, HGT of host genes, including transposable elements such as SINEs and LINEs, into poxviruses can be expected to occur at a high frequency, but in most cases the inserted gene will not be maintained because of negative or neutral effects on virus replication.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the different behaviors in BSC40âs relate to the fact that the original evolution occurred in RK13 cells?

Because complementation of replication-deficient viruses was more efficient in RK13 as opposed to BSC-40 cells, it appears that propagation of viruses with insertions in essential genes would be favored in the former cells. We added a paragraph to the discussion (Lines: 261-274):</p><p>âThe concentration of insertions around the H4L locus might indicate that some regions of the genome are indeed hotspots for integration. However, the number of integration events detected in this study precludes a definitive answer, and will require further analysis of more HGT events. It is also possible that the insertion site is influenced by the cell type. Because complementation of replication-deficient viruses was more efficient in RK13 as opposed to BSC-40 cells, it appears that propagation of viruses with insertions in essential genes might be favored in the former cells. In a companion paper, Fixsen et al., used a similar strategy to detect HGT by expressing the other VACV PKR inhibitor K3 in RK13 cells, which were also used in our study, and selecting for virus replication in Syrian hamster BHK cells. They found a lower proportion of HGT integrations in the central genome region (Fixsen et al., 2020). The reasons for the different integration patterns could be due to the different cells used for selection and might reflect differences in the relative importance of viral genes in these cells or different, cell line-dependent complementation efficiencies.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points raised by the editors not covered in the above response to reviewers:</p><p>Complete failure to grow is clearly a very strong selective pressure that, here, can serve as a stand-in for weaker selective pressure that may not require the presence of complementing or rescuing genomes</p></disp-quote><p>We have emphasized this point in the Discussion (Lines 277-287) stating that:</p><p>âOur experimental system relies on the complete failure for viruses to replicate in the absence of a PKR inhibitor, creating a strong selective pressure<italic>.</italic> In eight instances in this study we also identified integrations into essential genes, creating a similarly strong selective pressure against virus replication. In these cases, complementation followed by recombination was sufficient to overcome this selective pressure in vitro. The homology regions surrounding the cowpox virus GAAP gene (Figure 6) suggest a similar process can occur during natural infection as well. In instances in which the selective pressure to maintain the horizontally transferred gene is weaker or the inactivated gene is non-essential but still contributes to fitness, we hypothesize that similar molecular events might occur. This balance between the negative effects of genome disruption and improved fitness might also display some degree of cell- and species-specificity.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please indicate in the Materials and methods section of your manuscript if [your cell line] identity has been authenticated, state the authentication method (such as STR profiling), and report the mycoplasma contamination testing status.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following statements to the methods section:</p><p>Cell lines used in this study were negative for mycoplasma contamination as determined with Lookout Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit (Millipore Î£).
