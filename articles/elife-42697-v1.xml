During both modes of surface translocation, fluid uptake and transport play a key role in shaping the overall morphology and spreading dynamics. Here we develop a generalized two-phase thin-film model that couples bacterial growth, extracellular matrix swelling, fluid flow, and nutrient transport to describe the expansion of both highly motile bacterial swarms, and sessile bacterial biofilms. We show that swarm expansion corresponds to steady-state solutions in a nutrient-rich, capillarity dominated regime. In contrast, biofilm colony growth is described by transient solutions associated with a nutrient-limited, extracellular polymer stress driven limit. We apply our unified framework to explain a range of recent experimental observations of steady and unsteady expansion of microbial swarms and biofilms. Our results demonstrate how the physics of flow and transport in slender geometries serve to constrain biological organization in microbial communities.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42697.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacteria can grow and thrive in many different environments. Although we usually think of bacteria as single-celled organisms, they are not always solitary; they can also form groups containing large numbers of individuals. These aggregates work together as one super-colony, allowing the bacteria to feed and protect themselves more efficiently than they could as isolated cells.</p><p>These colonies move and grow in characteristic patterns as they respond to their environment. They can form swarms, like insects, or biofilms, which are thin, flat structures containing both cells and a film-like substance that the cells secrete. Availability of food and water influences the way colonies spread; however, since movement and growth are accompanied by mechanical forces, physical constraints are also important. These include the ability of the bacteria to change the water balance and their local mechanical environment, and the forces they create as they grow and move.</p><p>Previous research has used a variety of experimental and theoretical approaches to explain the dynamics of bacterial swarms and biofilms as separate phenomena. However, while they do differ biologically, they also share many physical characteristics.</p><p>Srinivasan et al. wanted to exploit these similarities, and use them to predict the growth and shape of biofilms and bacterial swarms under different conditions. To do this, a unified mathematical model for the growth of both swarms and biofilms was created. The model accounted for various factors, such as the transport of nutrients into the colony, the movement of water between the colony and the surface on which it grew, and mechanical changes in the environment (e.g. swelling/softening). The theoretical results were then compared with results from experimental measurements of different bacterial aggregates grown on a soft, hydrated gel. For both swarms and biofilms, the model correctly predicted how fast the colony expanded overall, as well as the shape and location of actively growing regions.</p><p>Biofilms and other bacterial aggregates can cause diseases and increase inflammation in tissues, and also hinder industrial processes by damage to submerged surfaces, such as ships and waterpipes. The results described here may open up new approaches to restrict the spreading of bacterial aggregates by focusing on their physical constraints.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>biofilms</kwd><kwd>bioswarms</kwd><kwd>collective spreading</kwd><kwd>biophysics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMR 1420570</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mahadevan</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000870</institution-id><institution>MacArthur Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mahadevan</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A multiphase hydrodynamic theory reveals that the dynamics of colony expansion in microbial swarms and biofilms are limited by the constraints of water and nutrient availability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacteria employ sophisticated surface translocation machinery to actively swarm, twitch, glide or slide over solid surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kearns, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mattick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spormann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hölscher and Kovács, 2017</xref>). Collectively, they also aggregate into multicellular communities on hydrated surfaces and exhibit large-scale coordinated movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Verstraeten et al., 2008</xref>). Surface motility in macroscopic colonies on hydrated surfaces such as gels occurs primarily via two distinct modes: either by rapid flagella-mediated swarming expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harshey, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harshey, 2003</xref>), or alternatively by slow biofilm expansion driven by extracellular polymer matrix production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004</xref>). In both cases, an interplay between mechanical constraints and biological organization sets limits on the overall colony morphology and expansion dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Persat et al., 2015</xref>). The forces driving colony expansion are generated by non-homogeneous patterns of biological activity, originating from spatial localizations in cell growth and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamouche et al., 2017</xref>), extracellular polymer matrix production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seminara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Srinivasan et al., 2018</xref>), osmolyte secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ping et al., 2014</xref>) and active stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farrell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delarue et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, the formation of localized biologically active zones is tightly coupled to the heterogeneity of the environment, including the diffusion and transport of nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), accumulation of metabolic by-products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gozzi et al., 2017</xref>) and presence of quorum sensing and signaling agents that regulate cell-differentiation and development.</p><p>Consequently, the dynamics of colony growth requires a mechanistic description that accounts for spatiotemporal inhomogeneities in biological activity, emergent forces, and flows that transport metabolic agents. In bacterial swarming, cells within the colony are actively propelled by the rotation of flagella in a thin layer of fluid extracted from the underlying soft tissue or gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kearns, 2010</xref>). In contrast, bacterial biofilms are surface aggregates of sessile bacteria embedded in a self-generated extracellular polymer matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flemming and Wingender, 2010</xref>). Despite marked differences in regulatory genetic pathways, morphology and cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Verstraeten et al., 2008</xref>), physical characteristics such as the fluidization of the substrate/tissue, gradients in nutrient availability, the low-aspect-ratio geometry and the existence of multiple phases (i.e. cells, biopolymer and fluid) are common to both bacterial film and swarm colonies. Motivated by these similarities, we present a unified multiphase framework that couples mechanics, hydrodynamics and transport to explain the dynamics of bacterial swarm and film expansion.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Experimental background</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bacterial swarms</title><p>Experiments on swarming colonies of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darnton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu and Berg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ping et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>S. enterica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harshey and Matsuyama, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalai Chelvam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2017</xref>) reveal certain reproducible features associated with this modality of collective behavior.

Given the observations of osmotic gradient-driven flow in the vicinity of the growing front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ping et al., 2014</xref>), coupled with variations in the thickness and activity of bacteria, any framework to explain these requires a consideration of a dynamic bacterial population interacting with ambient fluid, necessitating a multiphase description.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42697.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental features of microbial swarms and biofilms.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Snapshot of a <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> swarm expanding on a 0.5 wt% LB/agar gel.

In the deceleration regime, diffusive transport of nutrients from a region external to the colony continues to sustain EPS production at the biofilm periphery, analogous to Stefan-like problems in solidification. Our generalized multiphase model is thus able to quantitatively rationalize the expansion curves, transition time and localized biological activity observed experimentally, and demonstrates that nutrient availability and diffusive transport governs the dynamics of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> macrocolonies grown on agar.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Analysis of collective microbial expansion in thin film geometries often prioritizes biological mechanisms, such as genetic regulation, developmental programs and cellular signaling/competition, over the role of the heterogeneous physical micro-environments. Here we have presented a multi-phase theory that quantitatively describes the expansion dynamics of microbial swarms and biofilms and considers variations in the colony thickness, an aspect of colony expansion that has often been overlooked in many theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Korolev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghosh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). The resulting unified description of both steady-state swarms and transient biofilm spreading leads to simple estimates and scaling laws for the colony expansion rate that are validated via comparison with experimental measurements for different systems. In swarms, exudation of water from the permeable substrate via bacterial osmolyte secretion facilitates steady state colony expansion. Numerical solutions of our model demonstrate that the shape of the swarm front is determined by capillarity, and its expansion speed by cell-division and growth, leading to scaling laws validated by comparison with previous experiments. In contrast, transient biofilm macrocolony expansion on agar is driven by osmotic polymer stresses generated via EPS matrix production in a spatially localized zone at the periphery. Nutrient transport and depletion leads to the formation of these heterogenous zones, and results in two regimes in biofilm expansion.</p><p>However our depth-integrated theory also has certain limitations. For example, we are unable to capture discrete thickness variations of the order of a few cells, which might require an agent-based approach. For bacterial swarms, our model is unable to quantitatively account for the region of enhanced thickness (i.e., the multilayer region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>), likely because the multilayer width is difficult to experimentally ascertain, owing to the large tail distribution seen in the mean intensity trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, and the arbitrariness in the choice of threshold in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig5">Appendix 3—figure 5</xref>. Similarly, in the context of biofilm colony expansion, our model does not account for sliding and frictional contact between the cells/EPS matrix and the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farrell et al., 2013</xref>). More generally, our mean-field picture neglects fluctuation-driven effects during colony expansion, such as the formation multicellular raft structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kearns, 2010</xref>) and synchronized long-range interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Natural next steps of our approach include (i) adding three-dimensional effects by allowing for spatial variations in the mechanical stresses, flows and nutrient fields in the vertical direction, (ii) accounting for orientational order in the bacterial swarms and films, and (iii) accounting for interfacial tension on the stability of the growing swarm/biofilm-fluid interface, especially in the context of fingering instabilities in microbial colonies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trinschek et al. (2018)</xref>.</p><p>A rigorous multi-phase approach may also be relevant in revisiting pattern formation phenomena in microbial colony expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsushita et al., 1999</xref>), that so far been addressed primarily using various non-linear diffusion models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Golding et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen and Waclaw, 2019</xref>) that ignore the third dimension. Finally, from an experimental and theoretical perspective, our results naturally raise the question of controlling biofilm and swarm expansion by manipulating water and nutrient availability, complementing the better studied approaches of manipulating colonies by the genetic regulation of EPS production, cell division, and chemical signaling in microbial colonies.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank M Cabeen, R Losick for providing strains, S Rubinstein for access to the fluorescent imaging and microbial culture facility, and H Berg, L Ping and A Pahlavan for helpful discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Alex Persat (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Srinivasan and coauthors propose a generalized model to describe the expansion of bacterial communities growing on agar plates in two distinct modes: swarms and biofilms. They demonstrate that the interplay between biological mechanisms, such as osmolyte secretion, extracellular matrix production and spatial localization in cell growth, and physics of the microbial environment, such as hydrodynamics, mechanics, osmotic flux and nutrient diffusion, controls the expansion dynamics of microbial swarms and biofilms. They show that swarming colonies undergo steady state expansion, while biofilms expand transiently, going from an initial acceleration phase to a decelerating one. These observations are in agreement with a few experiments. In the end, they prove that despite the differences in biological mechanisms of films and swarms, a unified two-phase model of a spreading colony can describe both systems.</p><p>The reviewers found the paper well-written and the theoretical and numerical analysis was performed very carefully. The phase-field theory developed in the paper goes substantially beyond earlier models as recently reviewed by Allen and Waclaw, 2018. The detailed parameter list in the Appendix can become a valuable reference for future studies. The manuscript thus offers a significant theoretical advance.</p><p>Title:</p><p>The reviewers thought that the current title sounds like an area of research rather than the title of a paper. Perhaps adding the term &quot;model&quot; or &quot;theory&quot; or any other more specific/descriptive statements would more clearly reflect the content of the paper.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found that the manuscript lacks a bit of clarity with respect to conclusions and agreement with experimental data:</p><p>1) There is a lack of comparison between scaling and experiments. I think the beauty of this work is to highlight scaling of the front velocity and width of the front. However, the authors limit their validation as fitting a single data point to obtain prefactors (e.g. subsection “Steady state swarms”, last paragraph). I would expect that the authors would make an effort to measure velocities for a few capillary numbers for example, and verify the -1/3 exponent behavior. It looks like the authors can actually do these experiments since they already have some data shown in Figure 1. This would absolutely strengthen the paper and the model (independently of whether the model fits the data).</p><p>2) The aim of the model is to describe both swarming and biofilm expansion and weigh in on their physical differences. However, describing swarming and biofilm separately makes it difficult to have a direct comparison between the two. It would be useful to directly compare the two (in concomitance with Table 1), explaining, for example, the choices of different active-passive phases, osmotic flux, growth term and nutrient uptake. For example, it would be useful to know why in swarmer cells nutrient uptake is not considered (is it related to nutrient diffusion in different agar substrate?). Why isn't surface tension considered in the biofilm model? This lack of discussion weakens the argument of a unifying model.</p><p>3) In biofilms, it is not clear to me why the active phase consists of only the EPS and cell growth is not considered as a driver of expansion.</p><p>4) I would imagine that one important factor limiting growth particularly in the biofilm case is the friction between the colony and the agar substrate. This is pointed out in Farell, 2013, but it seems to be vastly overlooked by the authors. Can they incorporate this in their fluidic model?</p><p>5) They state that their model reveals that bacterial swarm colonization corresponds to a fluid regulated limit, whereas the dynamics of biofilm expansion is governed by nutrient transport (subsection “Conclusions”). However, these are actually the assumptions used to describe the system, so it is not so surprising. Can the authors comment on this point?</p><p>One reviewer identified himself as &quot;eviewer A&quot; of the previous submission to PNAS for this manuscript (i.e. the positive reviewer), and stated that the authors had responded to his comments in their &quot;response to reviewers&quot; document, which they attached to the <italic>eLife</italic> submission.</p><p>This reviewer did note the following:</p><p>6) It is still slightly worrisome that 2 out of the 4 figures are introductory/motivational, as pointed out in my major comment 1 of the PNAS report.</p><p>7) Regarding my previous comment 2, about limitations of the model. I appreciate that the authors have added the sentence about shortcomings of the model after I pointed out one issue. Given that <italic>eLife</italic> does not have any length restrictions, I think it would be appropriate to add a new section to the main text where general limitations of the model are discussed, and where the authors believe the model is failing. I think such a section would strengthen the manuscript, provide additional context, and it would be helpful to the readers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42697.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>As per the reviewers’ recommendation, we have changed the title to “A multiphase theory for spreading microbial swarms and films”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a lack of comparison between scaling and experiments.

Specifically, we now fit our model and compare the scaling behavior using <underline>five</underline> independent experimental measurements of swarm expansion velocities. These include two new experimental measurements of swarm expansion in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, and two existing measurements in <italic>E. coli</italic> previously reported by Darton et al., 2010, and Wu and Berg, 2012. The comparison between the various experiments and fitting to our model is described in the main text in Appendix 2—table 2 and Figure 3D.</p><p>As seen in the figure for the velocity scaling, the measured swarm expansion velocities (dR/dt) indeed follows a -1/3 exponent with the Capillary number. We have introduced a new figure in the main text (i.e., Figure 3D) to emphasize the verification of the -1/3 scaling. We have rewritten the introduction of the time and length scales, that clarifies the estimation of the various parameters.</p><p>“There are two key dimensionless parameters that describes swarm colony expansion. […] A complete set of parameters for three experimental measurements of swarm expansion in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, and two existing measurements in <italic>E. coli</italic> previously reported by Darton et al., 2010, and Wu and Berg, 2012, are summarized in Appendix [3].”</p><p>Finally, upon considering the new dataset, the width of the swarm front does not follow the scaling we had originally proposed, as seen in Appendix 3—figure A5.</p><p>For each experiment, we fit our model using the effective growth rate g0 as the fitting parameter. We have also included a discussion of this fitting, and the overall comparison between model and theory with the new experimental measurements:</p><p>“Furthermore, we corroborate our scaling law in Equation 5 by fitting our model to five independent experimental measurements of swarm expansion velocities, as shown in Figure 3D. [...] From an experimental point of view, the width of the multilayer region is not sharply defined in Figure 1E, and will depend on the choice of threshold.”</p><p>As the reviewer indicates, we think these results strengthen the paper and our model, especially the agreement of the scaling law with the experimental velocities. We are once again grateful and thank the reviewer for their valuable insight towards improving the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The aim of the model is to describe both swarming and biofilm expansion and weigh in on their physical differences. However, describing swarming and biofilm separately makes it difficult to have a direct comparison between the two. It would be useful to directly compare the two (in concomitance with Table 1), explaining, for example, the choices of different active-passive phases, osmotic flux, growth term and nutrient uptake. For example, it would be useful to know why in swarmer cells nutrient uptake is not considered (is it related to nutrient diffusion in different agar substrate?). Why isn't surface tension considered in the biofilm model? This lack of discussion weakens the argument of a unifying model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their comment. As per the reviewers’ suggestion, we have now added a number of paragraphs (immediately after Table 1), that directly compares the various terms in our unifying model across swarms and biofilms. We have now described the origin of the differences in the nutrient uptake, growth term and the active and passive fluxes in parallel with Table 1.</p><p>Our Discussion directly addresses some of the questions the reviewers raise, viz.</p><p>1) The overall rate of change of nutrient concentration in the substrate depends on nutrient diffusion and uptake as described by Appendix 2—equation A2, i.e.</p><p>∂c∂t-D∂2c∂x2=-ΓhϕdcK+c</p><p>where, c(x,t) is the mean depth-averaged nutrient concentration in the substrate, Γis the specific nutrient consumption rate per unit concentration, k is the half velocity constant at which the specific growth rate is one half the maximum value and d is the substrate thickness. When the substrate concentration is scaled by the initial concentrationc0, the depletion term on the RHS of Equation 18 depends on Γ/c0, the ratio of the specific nutrient consumption rate to the initial concentration.</p><p>Bacterial swarming is typically associated with nutrient rich conditions, wherec0≫Γ. As a result, the nutrient uptake term can be neglected in bacterial swarming asg2→0, and the concentration c≈c0 throughout swarm expansion. In contrast, biofilm growth occurs under nutrient limited conditions whereΓc0∼O1, resulting in a corresponding uptake term as shown in Table 1.</p><p>2) Surface tension is indeed included in the biofilm model, and sets the capillary fluid pressure aspf∼-γ∂2h/∂x2. Furthermore, as shown in Appendix 2—equations A28 and A2944-45, the gradient of the effective EPS phase pressure Π drives the horizontal fluxes Q1(x) and Q2(x) of the EPS matrix and fluid phase in Table 1. Note that Π is a sum of the Flory-Huggins osmotic pressure and the capillary fluid pressure. In this manner, surface tension is indeed considered in the biofilm model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In biofilms, it is not clear to me why the active phase consists of only the EPS and cell growth is not considered as a driver of expansion.</p></disp-quote><p>Our model considers the growth of mature, macroscopic biofilm colonies. In these colonies, the biomass almost entirely consists of the EPS matrix. For example, as stated in Flemming and Wingender, 2010.</p><p>“In most biofilms, the microorganisms account for less than 10% of the dry mass, whereas the matrix can account for over 90%. The matrix is the extracellular material, mostly produced by the organisms themselves, in which the biofilm cells are embedded.”</p><p>Moreover, the total biomass itself constitutes only ~5% of the biofilm by mass (with the fluid being the predominant phase). Therefore, we treat the biofilm as a highly viscous and hydrated gel. Our model considers the osmotic stress and swelling pressure in freshly produced EPS matrix as the major contributor to biofilm expansion.</p><p>It only at the very early stages of biofilm colony growth (when EPS production is minimal) where cell-cell contact is the major contributor to growth pressure. An example of the latter scenario is microcolonies that consist of only ~100 – 1000s of cells. Models of microcolonies do indeed consider stress contributions from growth, for example, as in the work of Farrell, 2013.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I would imagine that one important factor limiting growth particularly in the biofilm case is the friction between the colony and the agar substrate. This is pointed out in Farell, 2013, but it seems to be vastly overlooked by the authors. Can they incorporate this in their fluidic model?</p></disp-quote><p>In our model, we consider the both the active EPS matrix phase, and the passive aqueous phase as Newtonian fluids. Consequently, friction between the colony and the agar substrate is accounted for in our model by the no-slip boundary condition, u1z=0=0 and u2z=0=0, where u1 and u2 are the horizontal components of the EPS phase and fluid phase velocities.</p><p>Therefore, our assumption of a no-slip boundary condition corresponds to the limit of an infinite friction coefficient in the discrete cell 2D model of Farrell, 2013. There are two key factors that differentiates our model from that of Farrell, 2013: (i) the presence of the EPS matrix, and (ii) the consideration of a third (i.e., vertical thickness) dimension.</p><p>Variations in the biofilm thickness allow the EPS matrix to sustain shear gradients in velocity. As a result, the biofilm colony “flows” over the agar substrate as a fluid in our model, while individual bacterial cells expand by “sliding” as a 2D dimensional colony by sliding in the model of Farrell et al. Similarly, in our model EPS production and growth in the third dimension generates the osmotic stresses and swelling pressure that drives colony expansion.</p><p>Note also that Farrell et al. consider the very early micro-colony stage of biofilms (&lt; 2hrs), where cells are present as a monolayer and both EPS production and variations in the third dimension are absent.</p><p>One possibility towards incorporating the effect of frictional sliding in macroscopic biofilms would be the introduction of a Navier slip-length parameter in our model, where the slip-length is tuned to account for sliding of EPS matrix on the agar substrate. We have added this point to the Discussion, where we discuss limitations and scope of our model, by the following line:</p><p>“Similarly, during biofilm colony expansion, we do not account for sliding and frictional contact between the cells/EPS matrix and the substrate (Farrell, 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) They state that their model reveals that bacterial swarm colonization corresponds to a fluid regulated limit, whereas the dynamics of biofilm expansion is governed by nutrient transport (subsection “Conclusions”). However, these are actually the assumptions used to describe the system, so it is not so surprising. Can the authors comment on this point?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this observation. We agree, our model does not reveal this statement and is indeed an assumption used to describe the system. We have rephrased the sentence to emphasize that our model merely “rationalizes the assumption”, rather than reveals the statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One reviewer identified himself as &quot;reviewer A&quot; of the previous submission to PNAS for this manuscript (i.e. the positive reviewer), and stated that the authors had responded to his comments in their &quot;response to reviewers&quot; document, which they attached to the eLife submission.</p><p>This reviewer did note the following:</p><p>6) It is still slightly worrisome that 2 out of the 4 figures are introductory/motivational, as pointed out in my major comment 1 of the PNAS report.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We have now included an additional subpanel in Figure 3D to show the scaling of the velocity with the capillary number. We also note that despite having 2 figures, each figure has a number of sub-panels that could easily be expanded as separate figures. In the interest of brevity and condensing the results of the data and model in one location for both swarms and biofilms, we have opted to use the subfigure approach, rather than expanding each panel into separate figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Regarding my previous comment 2, about limitations of the model. I appreciate that the authors have added the sentence about shortcomings of the model after I pointed out one issue. Given that eLife does not have any length restrictions, I think it would be appropriate to add a new section to the main text where general limitations of the model are discussed, and where the authors believe the model is failing. I think such a section would strengthen the manuscript, provide additional context, and it would be helpful to the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer has suggested, we have now added paragraphs under the conclusions section where we discuss the limitations of our model and scope for expansion:</p><p>“Analysis of collective microbial expansion in thin film geometries often prioritizes biological mechanisms, such as genetic regulation, developmental programs and cellular signaling/competition, over the role of the heterogeneous physical micro-environments. […] Finally, from an experimental and theoretical perspective, our results naturally raise the question of controlling biofilm and swarm expansion by manipulating water and nutrient availability, complementing the better studied approaches of manipulating colonies by the genetic regulation of EPS production, cell division, and chemical signaling in microbial colonies.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
