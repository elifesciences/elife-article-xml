Recently, memory reconsolidation was suggested to reinforce or integrate new information into reactivated memory. Here, we show that reactivated inhibitory avoidance (IA) memory is enhanced through reconsolidation under conditions in which memory extinction is not induced. This memory enhancement is mediated by neurons in the amygdala, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) through the simultaneous activation of calcineurin-induced proteasome-dependent protein degradation and cAMP responsive element binding protein-mediated gene expression. Interestingly, the amygdala is required for memory reconsolidation and enhancement, whereas the hippocampus and mPFC are required for only memory enhancement. Furthermore, memory enhancement triggered by retrieval utilizes distinct mechanisms to strengthen IA memory by additional learning that depends only on the amygdala. Our findings indicate that reconsolidation functions to strengthen the original memory and show the dynamic nature of reactivated memory through protein degradation and gene expression in multiple brain regions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02736.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02736.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02736.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Video cameras allow us to record events as they happen. When we look back at a video clip, what we see is an exact replica of what was originally recorded. We tend to assume that our memories work in a similar manner. However, recent research suggests that our memories may be more malleable than we realize. Once a memory has been reactivated, it goes through a process known as reconsolidation that can make it stronger or weaker, or that can change its content.</p><p>Now, Fukushima et al. have carried out a series of experiments which shed light on the process of memory reconsolidation. Mice were trained to remember a negative event, and later tested on their memory of this event. Some of the mice were also given a ‘reactivation’ session, during which they were reminded of the original memory. These mice were more fearful of the event during the memory test than those who had not been reminded of it. This suggests that the process of reconsolidating the memory after it had been retrieved had the effect of making the memory stronger.</p><p>Fukushima et al. then demonstrated that this enhancement depended on the synthesis of proteins in particular regions of the brain. When the mice were given an injection to block protein synthesis immediately after reactivation of the memory, their memory of the negative event was weakened. Crucially, this effect only happened when the injection was given immediately after reactivation of the memory; if the memory had not been reactivated, the injection did not change its strength.</p><p>Fukushima et al. went on to show that three regions of the brain—the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the medial prefrontal cortex—are involved in memory enhancement. However, only one of them, the amygdala, is involved in the other aspects of reconsolidation. This research could support clinical work by elucidating the potential role of reconsolidation in conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02736.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02736.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>reconsolidation</kwd><kwd>fear memory</kwd><kwd>enhancement</kwd><kwd>cAMP responsive element binding protein</kwd><kwd>proteasome-dependent protein degradation</kwd><kwd>amygdala</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aids for Scientific Research (B), Japan (23300120, 20380078)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kida</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aids for Challenging Exploratory Research, Japan (24650172)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kida</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas, Molecular Brain Science (18022038, 22022039)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kida</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas, Japan (24116008, 24116001, 23115716)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kida</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003382</institution-id><institution>Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, Japan Science and Technology Agency (CREST, JST)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kida</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Sumitomo Foundation, Japan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kida</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Takeda Science Foundation, Japan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kida</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Retrieval enhances fear memory through reconsolidation by activating calcineurin-induced protein degradation and CREB-mediated gene expression in amygdala, hippocampus, and mPFC.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Memory retrieval is not a passive phenomenon. Previous studies have presented evidence that memory retrieval is a dynamic process during which memories can be made stronger, weaker, or their content altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Misanin et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneider and Sherman, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lewis, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mactutus et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gordon, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nader et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nader and Hardt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dudai, 2012</xref>). Recent studies have shown that reactivated memory becomes labile after retrieval and is re-stabilized through a gene expression-dependent process known as memory reconsolidation. Memory reconsolidation after retrieval may be used to maintain or update long-term memories, reinforcing or integrating new information into them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nader et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dudai, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tronel et al., 2005</xref>). However, the function of memory reconsolidation still remains unclear; especially, whether memory reconsolidation strengthens the original memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tronson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Inda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pedroso et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, the reinforcement of traumatic memory after retrieval (i.e., re-experience such as flashbacks or nightmares) may be associated with the development of emotional disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p><p>In classical Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms, the reactivation of conditioned fear memory by re-exposure to the conditioned stimulus (CS) in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus (US) also initiates extinction as a form of new learning that weakens fear memory expression (i.e., a new CS-no US inhibitory memory that competes with the original CS-US memory trace) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pavlov, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rescorla, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Myers and Davis, 2002</xref>). Therefore, in the majority of reconsolidation paradigms, reactivation also includes extinction learning, which could confound how reconsolidation functions; the dominance of the original or new memory traces is thought to determine the fate of memory through their competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eisenberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pedreira and Maldonado, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the function of reconsolidation in an experimental condition in which memory extinction is not induced following memory retrieval.</p><p>To this end, we developed a procedure using an inhibitory avoidance (IA) task that can engage reconsolidation in the absence of extinction. In the IA task, mice receive an electrical footshock after they enter a dark (shock) compartment from a light (safe) compartment and form a memory to avoid the dark compartment. Re-exposure to the light compartment could elicit fear memory without giving the mice the opportunity to acquire extinction of the dark compartment memory. This is because the mice can only learn that the dark compartment does not lead to shock only after they have experienced this event by re-entering the dark compartment. This procedural control allows this paradigm to discriminate the reconsolidation and extinction phases at the time point when the mice enter the dark compartment from the light compartment. In the present study, we established a mouse model in which fear memory is enhanced after retrieval using the IA task and investigated the mechanisms of fear memory enhancement through reconsolidation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Enhancement of fear memory after retrieval in the IA task</title><p>The mice were first placed in the light compartment. A brief electrical footshock was delivered (Training) 5 s after they entered the dark compartment. The mice were re-exposed to the light compartment 24 hr later and we assessed their crossover latency to enter the dark compartment (Reactivation session). Immediately after they entered the dark compartment, the mice were returned to their home cage and crossover latency was assessed 48 hr later (post-reactivation long-term memory test, PR-LTM). The control group (treated with vehicle, VEH) displayed significantly increased crossover latency in Reactivation (398.9 ± 48.31 s) compared to Training (19.7 ± 1.68 s), indicating that the mice formed and retrieved IA memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, the VEH group displayed further and significantly increased crossover latency at PR-LTM (1553.5 ± 193.81 s) compared to Reactivation, suggesting that memory retrieval enhanced IA memory in our experimental condition.

To this end, the mice received a systemic injection of anisomycin (ANI) immediately after Reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The ANI group showed decreased crossover latency at PR-LTM compared to Reactivation, although the VEH and ANI groups showed comparable crossover latency at Reactivation, suggesting that the inhibition of protein synthesis disrupted IA memory. These results suggest that memory retrieval induces reconsolidation, raising the intriguing hypothesis that memory enhancement may be mediated by reconsolidation.</p><p>To test whether this enhancement was specific only to these experimental parameters used in the previous experiment, we performed Reactivation or PR-LTM at 3 or 7 d after Training or Reactivation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Consistent with the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the VEH and ANI groups displayed enhancement and disruption, respectively, of the reactivated memory at PR-LTM, although both groups displayed comparable crossover latency at Reactivation compared to the VEH and ANI groups, respectively, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These results indicate that the enhancement associated with the reconsolidation of fear memory was not transient or specific to the age of the memory. We also examined the effects of a shorter duration of re-exposure to the light compartment on IA memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Trained mice were either not exposed to the light compartment (non-reactivated, NR) or were re-exposed to the light compartment for 3 min. The VEH and ANI groups in the NR condition displayed comparable crossover latency at PR-LTM (VEH, 457.25 ± 55.25 s; ANI, 450.38 ± 78.26 s). In contrast, re-exposure of the VEH and ANI groups to the light compartment for 3 min resulted in the enhancement and disruption, respectively, of the reactivated memory compared to the controls (0 min (no) re-exposure groups in Reactivation and control group re-exposed 24 hr after training, respectively). Taken together, our observations suggest that memory enhancement is associated with memory reconsolidation.</p><p>To clarify further the effects of Reactivation on the enhancement of IA memory, the crossover latency of individual mice from all VEH groups used in the present study (n = 96) was compared between Reactivation and PR-LTM. We observed a significant positive correlation of crossover latency between Reactivation and PR-LTM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These observations indicate that longer reactivation of IA memory results in increased enhancement of this memory and strongly support our conclusion that IA memory is enhanced after retrieval. It is important to note that no correlation of crossover latency was observed between Training and Reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that enhancement of IA memory is associated with memory retrieval of this memory.</p><p>Finally, we examined whether our experimental paradigm dissociates the reconsolidation and extinction phases. To do this, the mice stayed in the dark compartment for 3 min after they entered from the light compartment at Reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The VEH and ANI groups showed decreased and comparable, respectively, crossover latency compared to Reactivation. These observations indicate that memory reactivation in the dark compartment induces long-term memory extinction that requires new gene expression. Thus, consistent with our hypothesis, the IA task enables us to discriminate between the reconsolidation and extinction phases at the time point when the mice enter the dark compartment from the light compartment.</p><p>Previous studies indicated that cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB)-mediated transcription is required for the reconsolidation of reactivated fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kida et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mamiya et al., 2009</xref>). Using inducible CREB repressor (CREB<sup>IR</sup>) transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kida et al., 2002</xref>), we tested what effect inhibition of CREB-mediated transcription would have in the protocol described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). CREB<sup>IR</sup> mice and wild-type (WT) littermates received a systemic injection of tamoxifen (TAM) or VEH to inhibit CREB activity at 6 hr before Reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kida et al., 2002</xref>). The CREB<sup>IR</sup> mice injected with TAM and the other control groups displayed disrupted and enhanced, respectively, IA memory at PR-LTM. These observations suggest that CREB-mediated transcription is required for the reconsolidation/enhancement of IA memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identifying the brain systems activated by IA memory reconsolidation and enhancement</title><p>To characterize the brain systems that contribute to these memory representations, we tried to identify the brain regions in which CREB-mediated gene expression is activated. We measured the expression levels of the immediate-early genes c-fos and Arc, which are CREB-dependent genes, using immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sheng et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaczmarek and Robertson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kawashima et al., 2009</xref>). The following four groups were used in this experiment: two groups which were trained with a footshock (Trained [T] groups) and the remaining two groups which did not receive a footshock (Untrained [U] groups). During Reactivation, the animals were either returned to the light compartment (T/R and U/R) or not (T/NR and U/NR). Significant increases in the number of c-fos-positive cells were observed in the lateral (LA) and basolateral amygdala (BA), CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, and prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) regions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but not in the central amygdala (CeA) regions or hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) area, in the T/R group compared to the other control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). In contrast, there was no increase in c-fos expression in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), visual cortex (VC), temporal cortex (TC), perirhinal cortex (PRh), or entorhinal cortex (EC) regions of the T/R group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, significant increases in Arc expression were observed in the amygdala (LA and BA), hippocampus (CA1 and CA3), and mPFC (PL and IL) in the T/R group compared to the other control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02736.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Roles of gene expression in the amygdala, hippocampus, and mPFC in the enhancement of reactivated inhibitory avoidance memory.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) c-fos induction when IA memory is enhanced after reactivation.

hippocampus, and mPFC in the reconsolidation/enhancement of IA memory</title><p>To examine the roles of new gene expression in the amygdala, hippocampus, and mPFC in the reconsolidation/enhancement of IA memory, we examined the effects of protein synthesis inhibition in these brain regions. We performed a similar experiment as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, except that the mice received a micro-infusion of ANI or VEH into the amygdala, hippocampus, or mPFC immediately after Reactivation. Similarly with the results for the systemic injection of ANI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), inhibition of protein synthesis in the amygdala resulted in the disruption of the reactivated IA memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Interestingly, protein synthesis inhibition in the hippocampus or mPFC failed to disrupt the reactivated IA memory, but blocked its enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>); the ANI groups displayed comparable crossover latency between Reactivation and PR-LTM. It is important to note that protein synthesis inhibition in both the hippocampus and mPFC blocked the enhancement of IA memory, but did not disrupt IA memory; furthermore, mice infused with ANI to the hippocampus or mPFC displayed a comparable enhancement of IA memory at PR-LTM-2 at 48 hr after PR-LTM-1 compared to the VEH group at PR-LTM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, these observations suggest that the inhibition of protein synthesis in the hippocampus or mPFC at Reactivation simply blocks the enhancement of IA memory without modulating it. These results are consistent with a previous finding that protein synthesis in the amygdala, but not the hippocampus, is required for the reconsolidation of IA memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taubenfeld et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Milekic et al., 2007</xref>), but more interestingly, suggest distinct roles for the amygdala and hippocampus/mPFC in the enhancement and reconsolidation of IA memory; new gene expression in the amygdala is required for the reconsolidation and enhancement of IA memory, while new gene expression in the hippocampus and mPFC is required only for its enhancement.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Phosphorylation of GluA1 at Ser831 and Ser845 is induced in the mPFC, hippocampus, and amygdala regions when IA memory is enhanced</title><p>The α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) GluA1 subunit undergoes distinct phosphorylation and dephosphorylation following the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2000</xref>); serine 831 (Ser831) and serine 845 (Ser845) are phosphorylated by LTP induction or dephosphorylated after LTD induction, respectively. This phosphorylation is thought to alter the function of AMPAR and contribute to the expression of LTP and LTD. To examine the possibility that synaptic plasticity was changed following Reactivation, the phosphorylation of Ser831 and Ser845 in the synaptic membrane fraction of the amygdala, dorsal hippocampus, and mPFC regions was measured at 30 min after Reactivation. Significant increases in Ser831 and Ser845 phosphorylation were observed in the amygdala, hippocampus, and mPFC regions of the T/R groups compared to the control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). Furthermore, time course analyses indicated that increases in Ser831 and Ser845 phosphorylation in the T/R groups peaked at 30 min and returned to basal levels by 180 min after Reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

In this study, we developed IA paradigms in which the retrieval of fear memory triggers reconsolidation without inducing memory extinction; the reconsolidation and extinction phases are discriminated at the time point when the mice enter a dark compartment from a light compartment. Using this paradigm, we found that memory retrieval enhances IA memory through reconsolidation. In contrast to the mechanisms for the reinforcement of contextual fear memory by additional learning, the enhancement of IA memory by retrieval required CREB-mediated gene expression and calcineurin-induced proteasome-dependent protein degradation not only in the amygdala but also in the hippocampus and mPFC. Consistently, IA memory retrieval was suggested to induce synaptic plasticity in these brain regions through the phosphorylation of AMPAR. Interestingly, we further found that the amygdala is required for the reconsolidation and enhancement of IA memory, whereas the hippocampus and mPFC are required for the enhancement, but not reconsolidation, of IA memory. These findings suggest that an IA memory is enhanced/reconsolidated through the reactivation of memory circuits consisting of multiple brain regions including the amygdala, hippocampus, and mPFC and that the amygdala plays central and distinct roles from the hippocampus and mPFC in the enhancement/reconsolidation of IA memory. It is important to investigate further the differences in the roles of the hippocampus and mPFC in the enhancement of an IA memory.</p><p>A previous study showed that gene expression is required for the re-stabilization (reconsolidation) of reactivated memory, whereas proteasome-dependent protein degradation is required for its destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nader et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taubenfeld et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Debiec et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kida et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). We found that the amygdaloid neurons reactivated by the retrieval of an IA memory activated proteasome-dependent protein degradation and gene expression, suggesting that these reactivated neurons regulate the destabilization and re-stabilization of IA memory. Importantly, our finding that inhibition of CaN blocked proteasome-dependent protein degradation, but not gene expression, suggests that destabilization and re-stabilization are regulated independently at the early stages of the signal transduction pathways activated after memory retrieval. Furthermore, our finding that the activation of gene expression and proteasome-dependent protein degradation in the hippocampus and mPFC is required for the enhancement, but not reconsolidation, of an IA memory also suggests that the activation of proteasome-dependent protein degradation is not only required for the destabilization of a reactivated memory but also plays additional roles in the modification or alteration of memory without the induction of destabilization.</p><p>Previous and current studies have shown that CB1, proteasome-dependent protein degradation, and CaN are required for not only the destabilization of reactivated fear memory but also the extinction of fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">de la Fuente et al., 2011</xref>). These findings suggest that destabilization and extinction, both of which are triggered by memory retrieval, share similar signal transduction cascades. It is important to investigate further and compare the molecular mechanisms that underlie the destabilization and extinction of reactivated fear memory. Understanding such mechanisms will enable the identification of the mechanism by which the fate of a memory is determined, that is, reconsolidation or extinction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All experiments were conducted according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Japan Neuroscience Society) and the Guide for the Tokyo University of Agriculture. All of the animal experiments performed in this study were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Tokyo University of Agriculture (authorization number: 250013). Male C57BL/6N mice were obtained from Charles River (Yokohama, Japan). Transgenic mice expressing an inducible CREB repressor (CREB<sup>IR</sup> mice) were backcrossed to C57BL/6N mice (National Institutes of Health) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kida et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mamiya et al., 2009</xref>). The mice were housed in cages of five or six animals each, maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle, and allowed ad libitum access to food and water. The mice were at least 8 weeks of age when tested. Testing was performed during the light phase of the cycle. All experiments were conducted blind to the treatment condition of the mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>IA test</title><p>The step-through IA apparatus (OHARA Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) consisted of a box with separate light and dark compartments (both 15.5 × 12.5 × 11.5 cm). The light compartment was illuminated by a fluorescent light (2500 lux) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fukushima et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Before the commencement of IA, the mice were handled individually for 2 min each day for 1 week. During the training sessions, each mouse was allowed to habituate to the light compartment for 30 s, and the guillotine door was raised to allow access to the dark compartment. Latency to enter the dark compartment was considered as a measure of acquisition. As soon as the mice had entered the dark compartment, the guillotine door was closed. After 5 s, a footshock (0.2 mA) was delivered for a total period of 2 s (training). At 24 hr after the training session, the mice were placed back in the light compartment (Reactivation) for a varying length of time (0 min, 3 min, or until the mice entered the dark compartment without a footshock). Memory was assessed at 48 hr later (PR-LTM) as the crossover latency for the mice to enter the dark compartment when replaced in the light compartment, as in Reactivation.</p><p>For the first experiment, we examined the effect of protein synthesis inhibition after Reactivation (re-exposure to the light compartment). The protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (ANI; Wako, Osaka, Japan) was dissolved in saline (pH adjusted to 7.0–7.4 with NaOH). The mice were trained as described above, and at 24 hr or 3 d later they received VEH or ANI (150 mg/kg, i.p.) immediately after re-exposure to the light compartment for 0 min, 3 min, or until they entered the dark compartment without a footshock (Reactivation). At 48 hr or 7 d after the Reactivation session, the mice were once again placed in the light compartment, and crossover latency was assessed. At this dose, ANI inhibits &gt;90% of protein synthesis in the brain during the first 2 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Flood et al., 1973</xref>).</p><p>To examine the effects of re-exposure to the dark compartment on memory extinction, the mice were re-exposed to the light compartment until they entered the dark compartment. Immediately after the mice had entered the dark compartment, the guillotine door was closed and the mice stayed in the dark compartment for 3 min without a footshock (Reactivation). The mice received VEH or ANI (150 mg/kg, i.p.) immediately after Reactivation. At 48 hr later, crossover latency was assessed again (PR-LTM).</p><p>To examine the effects of disrupting CREB function on memory reconsolidation, we used transgenic mice that express an inducible CREB repressor (CREB<sup>IR</sup>) in the forebrain, where a dominant-negative CREB protein is fused with the ligand binding domain of a mutant estrogen receptor (ER). Previous studies have shown that the systemic injection of TAM, the artificial ligand for ER, into these transgenic mice inhibits CREB activity in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kida et al., 2002</xref>). At 24 hr after the training session, CREB<sup>IR</sup> and WT mice were placed back in the light compartment and then crossover latency was assessed (Reactivation). The mice were administered an intraperitoneal injection of 16 mg/kg 4-hydroxytamoxifen (TAM; Sigma, MO, USA), which was dissolved in 10 ml peanut oil (Sigma) or VEH (a similar volume of peanut oil), at 6 hr before retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kida et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mamiya et al., 2009</xref>). At 48 hr after Reactivation, the mice were once again placed in the light compartment, and crossover latency was assessed (PR-LTM).</p><p>For the second experiment (c-fos, Arc, and Ub-Lys48 immunohistochemistry), we examined the brain regions that are activated after re-exposure to the light compartment. The mice were divided into four groups: (1) T/R and T/NR groups; two groups of mice were trained as described above, and at 24 hr later, were or were not re-exposed to the light compartment. The animals were then anesthetized with Nembutal (750 mg/kg, i.p.) at 90 min after Reactivation; (2) U/R and U/NR groups; two groups received a training session in the absence of footshock, and at 24 hr later, were or were not re-exposed to the light compartment. The animals were then anesthetized, as described above, at 90 min after Reactivation.</p><p>For the third experiment (micro-infusion of drugs), we examined the effects of the inhibition of protein synthesis, proteasome-dependent protein degradation, and CaN in the amygdala, hippocampus, or mPFC on memory reconsolidation/enhancement. ANI was dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) and adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The proteasome inhibitor β-lac (Sigma) was dissolved in 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in 1 M HCl diluted in ACSF and adjusted to pH 7.0–7.4 with NaOH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). The CaN inhibitor FK506 monohydrate (FK506; Sigma) was dissolved in ACSF containing three drops of Tween 80 in 2.5 ml of 7.5% DMSO and adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The mice were trained as described above, and at 24 hr later, they were placed back in the light compartment (Reactivation). The mice were micro-infused with ANI (62.5 µg), β-lac (9.6 ng), FK506 (10 µg), or VEH immediately into the various brain regions after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4">Figures 2–4</xref>) or 5 min before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) Reactivation. At 48 hr after Reactivation, the mice were once again placed in the light compartment and crossover latency was assessed (PR-LTM). Micro-infusions into the hippocampus and mPFC (0.5 µl) were performed at a rate of 0.25 μl/min. Micro-infusions into the amygdala (0.2 µl) were performed at a rate of 0.1 μl/min. The injection cannula was left in place for 2 min after micro-infusion and the mice were then returned to their home cages.</p><p>For the fourth experiment (additional training), we compared the mechanisms underlying memory enhancement through retrieval and additional training. The mice received a footshock in the reactivation (Training-2) session at 5 s after they entered the dark compartment and then received micro-infusions of drugs immediately after Training-2. At 48 hr later, crossover latency was assessed (PR-LTM). The dose of locally infused ANI used inhibits 90% of protein synthesis for at least 4 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rosenblum et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>For the fifth experiment (treatment with the CaN inhibitor), we examined the effects of CaN inhibition on the expression of c-fos and Ub-Lys48 following Reactivation. The CaN inhibitor FK506 and cyclosporin A (Cyc; Wako) were dissolved in saline containing one drop of Tween 80 in 3 ml of 2.5% DMSO and 10% Cremophor EL (Sigma). The mice received a systemic injection of FK506 (5 mg/kg), Cyc (5 mg/kg), or VEH at 5 min before Reactivation (re-exposure to the light compartment). For immunohistochemistry, the animals were anesthetized at 90 min after Reactivation, as described above.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision. There are only minor points to be addressed before acceptance and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The study by Fukushima et al. demonstrates that inhibitory avoidance fear memory in mice is enhanced following retrieval via reconsolidation. Moreover, the authors show the dependence of the memory enhancement on CREB-dependent transcription and calcineurin-induced proteasome activation. The authors use various behavioural, biochemical, genetic and immunochistochemical techniques in the study. To our knowledge, this manuscript represents one of the most important contributions to memory enhancement through memory reconsolidation. It outlines the contributions of several brain regions (amygdala, hippocampus and medial prefrontal) and signaling systems (CREB transcription and CaN-dependent protein degradation) to this important process. Central to this impressive paper is the behavioral approach the authors developed for studies of memory reconsolidation.</p><p>However, the authors fail to mention previous studies showing that inhibitory avoidance memory in rats can be enhanced by non-reinforced retrieval (Pedroso et al. J Neural Transm (2013) 120:1525-1531, and Inda et al, The Journal of Neuroscience, February 2, 2011, 31(5):1635-1643). These studies also documented that the memory enhancement phenomenon requires protein synthesis and mTOR activity, and they should be cited and discussed in a resubmission.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02736.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] To our knowledge, this manuscript represents one of the most important contributions to memory enhancement through memory reconsolidation.
