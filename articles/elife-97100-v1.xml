spectrum disorder, sensory processing dysfunction, and other behavioral abnormalities. While numerous studies have highlighted a role of Syngap1 in cortical excitatory neurons development, recent studies suggest that Syngap1 plays a role in GABAergic inhibitory neuron development as well. However, the molecular pathways by which Syngap1 acts on GABAergic neurons, and whether they are similar or different from the mechanisms underlying its effects in excitatory neurons, are unknown. Here, we examined whether, and how, embryonic-onset <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency restricted to GABAergic interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) impacts their synaptic and intrinsic properties in adult primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency significantly affected the intrinsic properties, overall leading to increased firing threshold and decreased excitatory synaptic drive in Parvalbumin (PV)+ neurons in adult layer IV A1. Further, the AMPA component of thalamocortical evoked EPSC was decreased in PV+ cells from mutant mice. Mutant somatostatin (SST)+ interneurons exhibited decreased spontaneous excitatory input and impaired evoked firing without alterations in firing threshold. Finally, we found that the selective blocking of voltage-gated D-type K<sup>+</sup> currents was sufficient to rescue PV+ mutant cell-intrinsic properties to wild-type levels. Together, these data suggest that <italic>Syngap1</italic> plays a specific role in the maturation of PV+ cell-intrinsic properties and synaptic drive, and its haploinsufficiency may lead to reduced PV cell recruitment in the adult A1, which could in turn contribute to the auditory processing alterations found in SYNGAP1-ID preclinical models and patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intrinsic properties</kwd><kwd>cortical GABAergic interneurons</kwd><kwd>glutamatergic synapses</kwd><kwd>auditory cortex</kwd><kwd>Syngap1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Di Cristo</surname><given-names>Graziella</given-names></name><name><surname>Kourrich</surname><given-names>Said</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec-Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Francavilla</surname><given-names>Ruggiero</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fonds de Recherche Québec-Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Damo Kamda</surname><given-names>Jorelle Linda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Di Cristo</surname><given-names>Graziella</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000095</institution-id><institution>Savoy Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Francavilla</surname><given-names>Ruggiero</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency, which is associated with intellectual disability, epilepsy, and other cognitive and behavioral impairments, reduces the firing and excitatory drive of cortical interneurons.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>SYNGAP1 is a key synaptic GTPase-activating protein (GAP) essential for synaptic plasticity, learning, memory, and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gamache et al., 2020</xref>).

The role of <italic>Syngap1</italic> has been studied primarily in excitatory neurons. Specifically, <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency has been shown to increase AMPA receptor density and accelerate the maturation of excitatory synapses in hippocampal and somatosensory layer 5 pyramidal cells in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clement et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clement et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ozkan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aceti et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, xenotransplantation experiments have shown that SYNGAP1-deficient human cortical neurons transplanted into mouse brains exhibit faster synapse formation and maturation, along with disrupted synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vermaercke et al., 2024</xref>). In addition to its synaptic roles, Syngap1 is also implicated in the regulation of cortical neurogenesis of projecting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birtele et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Although Syngap1 research has predominantly focused on excitatory neurons, its mRNA and protein are also expressed in inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berryer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Su et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Velmeshev et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhao and Kwon, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jadhav et al., 2024</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests a role for <italic>Syngap1</italic> in the migration of GABAergic cells and the maturation of inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berryer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Su et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sullivan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khlaifia et al., 2023</xref>); nevertheless, whether the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are similar to those observed in excitatory cells is unknown.</p><p>Cortical inhibitory neurons can be broadly classified into two major subtypes based on their anatomy, physiology, and expression of specific markers: Parvalbumin- (PV+) and somatostatin- (SST+) expressing interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rudy et al., 2011</xref>). These subtypes provide perisomatic and distal dendritic inhibition to pyramidal cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Levy and Reyes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yavorska and Wehr, 2016</xref>). Due to the specificity in their synapse location and distinct functional properties, SST+ and PV+ neurons differentially shape excitatory neuronal responses. By providing fast inhibition onto postsynaptic pyramidal cell somata and proximal dendrites, PV+ cells exert fine control on their output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moore and Wehr, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>), while SST+ cells targeting apical dendrites of postsynaptic pyramidal cells exert specific control over dendritic synaptic integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiu et al., 2013</xref>). We recently showed that prenatal-onset <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency restricted to Nkx2.1-expressing GABAergic interneuron precursors, which include PV+ and SST+ interneurons, leads to the development of alterations in auditory cortex activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jadhav et al., 2024</xref>), which resemble those observed in global <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficient mouse models and <italic>SYNGAP1</italic>-ID patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carreño-Muñoz et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that interneuron dysfunction may contribute to these specific phenotypes. However, how prenatal-onset <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency in GABAergic interneurons alters their physiology in adult cortex is unknown.</p><p>To address this question, we generated conditional transgenic mice wherein <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency was restricted to MGE-derived interneurons. We then assessed the synaptic and intrinsic properties of PV+ fast spiking (FS) and SST+ regular spiking cells in layer IV of the adult primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that both mutant PV+ and SST+ cells show decreased excitatory synaptic drive. Notably, PV+, but not SST+, interneurons showed a significantly increased threshold for action potential (AP) generation, pointing toward a reduced recruitment of cortical PV cells in the mutant mouse. Further, we were able to partially restore PV+ cell function ex vivo using alpha-dendrotoxin (α-DTX), a selective blocker of Kv1 family voltage-gated D-type K<sup>+</sup> currents. Overall, these results suggest that Syngap1 can affect neuronal physiological properties by modulating distinct molecular mechanisms in a cell-type-specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency in MGE-derived interneurons is associated with decreased synaptic excitation in PV+ cells</title><p>Since Syngap1 has been shown to regulate AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in hippocampal and cortical excitatory neurons and hippocampal inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ozkan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khlaifia et al., 2023</xref>), we first explored whether embryonic-onset <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency in MGE-derived cortical interneurons affect their glutamatergic synaptic inputs in adult A1.

Recorded MGE-derived interneurons were filled with biocytin, and their identity was confirmed by immunolabeling for neurochemical markers (PV or SST) and analysis of anatomical properties, including location of the axonal arborization across different cortical layers and presence or absence of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kawaguchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertero et al., 2020</xref>).

We then selected the intersection point of the two AP half-width distributions in control and cHet mice as a cut-off to define two different subpopulations of PV+ cells: basket cell (BC)-short (AP half-width &lt;0.78 ms) and BC-broad (AP half-width ≥0.78 ms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c, d</xref>).

In particular, mutant PV+ cells showed reduced intracortical and thalamo-cortical glutamatergic synaptic drive. We further found that <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency has a significant impact on the intrinsic properties, in particular AP threshold, of PV+ cells, resulting in overall decreased excitability. The intrinsic excitability of PV+ cells was rescued in part by pharmacological inhibition of voltage-gated D-type K<sup>+</sup> current mediated by the Kv1 subfamily, suggesting that this current may serve as molecular mediator of the functional deficits induced by <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency. Syngap1 has been studied mainly in the context of synaptic physiology; therefore, our data highlights a novel aspect of Syngap1 biology.</p><p>Since <italic>Syngap1</italic> mRNA expression in PV+ and SST+ cells is not limited to A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhao and Kwon, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jadhav et al., 2024</xref>), it is likely that its haploinsufficiency may affect interneurons physiology in other cortical regions, as well. In our mouse model, Syngap1 haploinsufficiency is driven by the expression of Nkx2.1, which has an embryonic onset (E10.5). However, <italic>Syngap1</italic> expression is thought to be highest during critical periods of synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Porter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McMahon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jadhav et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, the precise developmental time window during which <italic>Syngap1</italic> insufficiency disrupts PV+ neuron properties remains to be determined.</p><p>Syngap1 is thought to be a potent regulator of excitatory synapses, and its reduced expression in excitatory cells causes an increase in AMPA receptor density and premature maturation of excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rumbaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clement et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clement et al., 2013</xref>). Unexpectedly, here we found that <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency restricted to MGE-derived interneurons depresses glutamatergic synaptic transmission, potentially via presynaptic mechanisms. In addition, LIV PV+ cells receive the strongest thalamocortical input compared to excitatory cells and other subpopulations of GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ji et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zurita et al., 2018</xref>). Our study indicates that a reduction in AMPA-mediated thalamocortical transmission onto LIV PV+ cells may contribute to the deficit in glutamatergic drive, as suggested by facilitated PPR in cHet compared to control mice. This, combined with the increased onset latencies of thalamocortical-evoked AMPA responses along with an enhanced NMDA/AMPA ratio, points to both a likely decrease in presynaptic release from thalamocortical fibers and impaired recruitment of PV+ cells by thalamic inputs in cHet mice.</p><p>How could <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency in Nkx2.1-expressing cells affect the glutamatergic drive coming from local and thalamic excitatory cells? Our data suggest a role of Syngap1 in promoting GABAergic cell-intrinsic excitability during normal development. These findings are in line with recent data reporting a decrease in intrinsic excitability of developing cortical excitatory cells in <italic>Syngap1<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2022</xref>). In PV+ cells, connectivity and cell excitability are reciprocally regulated at the circuit level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Favuzzi et al., 2017</xref>); thus, it is possible that early-onset <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency in MGE-derived interneurons may first affect the development of their intrinsic excitability properties, which in turn would modulate the maturation of their excitatory drive and activity levels in adulthood. Alternatively, homeostatic adaptation of PV+ interneurons in response to the decreased number of excitatory inputs could trigger changes in voltage-gated D-type K<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dehorter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Favuzzi et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, Syngap1 may play complex roles at the cellular level and at different developmental stages, based on the crosstalk between neuronal activity levels and Syngap1 localization and interaction with other proteins. The use of a conditional genetic strategy to induce <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency specifically in MGE-derived interneurons allows investigating its effects in these GABAergic populations; however, it is important to highlight the limit of this approach, since whether GABAergic interneurons physiology would be similarly affected within an entire network carrying the same mutation (thus affecting also excitatory neurons) remains to be established.</p><p>Based on morphology and synaptic targets, three main subgroups of PV+ cells have been identified in auditory cortex, i.e., basket cells (BCs), chandelier cells, and long-range projecting PV+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Levy and Reyes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zurita et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertero et al., 2019</xref>). Despite differences in morphology and target selectivity, different PV+ cell subgroups share common electrophysiological features such as short AP-half width, low input resistance, very high threshold current, and relatively small AP amplitude. In particular, while clusters of atypical BC PV+ have been previously reported in several areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Helm et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nassar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bengtsson Gonzales et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ekins et al., 2020</xref>), auditory cortex PV+ BCs have been considered as a homogeneous electrophysiological group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Studer and Barkat, 2022</xref>). One of the key findings of this study is that mature A1 contains at least two distinct morphological and electrophysiological subgroups of PV+ BCs, including a subgroup with an unexpectedly broader AP half-width (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The genetic tools used to identify PV+ cells (<italic>PV_Cre</italic> or G42 mice vs <italic>Nkx2.1</italic>_Cre mice) might selectively label a specific PV+ BC cell subtype. Alternatively, the distribution of different PV+ BC subtypes could depend on the cortical region and layer. The presence of at least two PV+ BC subtypes with different electrophysiological characteristics may partly explain the previously observed variability in the recruitment of auditory cortex PV+ cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seybold et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Phillips and Hasenstaub, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gothner et al., 2021</xref>), as these differences could arise from the AP half-width criteria used to sort FS cells.</p><p>Despite the differences observed in how <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency affects the anatomy and physiological properties of the two PV+ cell subtypes, a shared deficit we observed was the decrease in intrinsic excitability, as suggested by the increased AP threshold affecting AP initiation. In PV+ cells, voltage-gated D-type K<sup>+</sup> currents mediated by the Kv1 family strongly contribute to AP generation, making them effective targets for modifying AP latency, threshold, and rheobase current in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goldberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zurita et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we indeed restored the excitability of mutant PV+ cells by pharmacologically inhibiting this channel family using α-DTX; however, whether Kv1 currents or/and channel density is altered in mutant PV+ cells remains to be investigated. Consistent with our findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2022</xref> rescued pyramidal cell-intrinsic excitability and neuronal morphology via lowering elevated potassium channels, by expressing a dominant negative form of the Kv4.2 potassium channel subunit, dnKv4.2, in developing <italic>Syngap1</italic> mutant mice. Kv4.2 and Kv1 potassium channels modulate the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal cell and PV+ interneurons, respectively, indicating that the action of Syngap1 on potassium channels may be a general mechanism. A recent study focusing on the PSD interactomes of Syngap1 isolated from adult homogenized mouse cortex suggested a physical interaction between Syngap1 and the potassium channel auxiliary subunit Kvβ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>). Since Kvβ2 regulates the translocation of Kv1 channels in dopaminergic neurons and potentially PV+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Okaty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yee et al., 2022</xref>), it is possible that <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency may lead to dysregulated Kv1 translocation at the membrane, leading to excessive K currents. Of note, both Kv1 channels and Syngap1 are developmentally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Okaty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gamache et al., 2020</xref>), thus <italic>Syngap1</italic> hypofunction may lead to dysregulation of genes encoding voltage-gated potassium channel affecting cell maturation and excitability.</p><p>Interestingly, the alterations in intrinsic excitability were less pronounced in cHet SST+ interneurons, primarily affecting their firing rate. This discrepancy could be due to the heterogeneity of SST+ interneurons likely present in our dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scala et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hostetler et al., 2023</xref>). In addition, it’s possible that other intrinsic factors, not assessed in this study, may have contributed to this effect. For example, in SST+ cells the differences in the AHP kinetics depend predominantly on the presence of a second slower AHP component impacting the overall amplitude, slope, and duration of the AHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Riedemann et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies also showed that SYNGAP1 interacts with Kv4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>). Since somato-dendritic Kv4 channels in SST+ interneurons contribute to the regulation of their firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Serôdio and Rudy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bourdeau et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency could affect SST+ cell excitability via this channel.</p><p>PV+ cells have a fundamental role in generating and maintaining gamma oscillations in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>). In particular, recent studies have also shown that deficiency in PV interneuron-mediated inhibition contributes to increased baseline cortical gamma rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spencer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlén et al., 2012</xref>), a phenotype we observed in the auditory cortex of germline <italic>Syngap1<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mutant mice, SYNGAP1-ID patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carreño-Muñoz et al., 2022</xref>) and mice with conditional <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency restricted to MGE-derived interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jadhav et al., 2024</xref>). Specifically, PV+ interneurons, which target the perisomatic domain of pyramidal neurons, are adapted for fast synchronization of network activity controlling spike timing of the excitatory network in auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wehr and Zador, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2014</xref>). To sharpen the tuning of neighboring pyramidal cells, PV+ interneurons need to be more effectively recruited by excitatory inputs so that they can restrict the temporal summation of excitatory responses of their pyramidal cell targets and increase the temporal precision of their firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Povysheva et al., 2006</xref>). Our study suggests that a decrease in AMPA-mediated thalamocortical input onto LIV PV+ cells along with deficits in their intrinsic excitability, could account for altered spike timing of pyramidal cells, causing an increase in overall network excitability.</p><p>An open question remains whether synaptic properties differ among PV+ cell subtypes, which we could not address due to technical limitations. These include the lack of specific neurochemical markers to distinguish between the two PV+ subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ekins et al., 2020</xref>), and the use of a Cs<sup>+</sup>-based internal solution required for voltage-clamp experiments, which prevents the recording of neuronal firing. It could be interesting to correlate PV expression levels directly with AP half-width, since BC-short may express higher levels of PV compared to BC-broad as already found in the striatum using patch seq approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bengtsson Gonzales et al., 2020</xref>). Further, in our studies, we used a conditional mouse model where <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficiency is restricted to specific cell types, namely MGE-derived interneurons. Since cell-type-specific genetic mutations do not typically occur in humans, it would be interesting to investigate whether <italic>SYNGAP1</italic>-haploinsufficient human-derived neurons show alterations in specific GABAergic subpopulations – intrinsic and synaptic properties. Further, whether and how PV+ physiology is affected in global haploinsufficient mice remains to be addressed. Of note, global haploinsufficient <italic>Syngap1</italic> mice, <italic>SYNGAP1</italic>-ID patients, and MGE-restricted <italic>Syngap1</italic> haploinsufficient mice show comparable abnormal phenotypes in cortical auditory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carreño-Muñoz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jadhav et al., 2024</xref>). Further experiments specifically targeting PV+ cell activity, using targeted chemogenetic or pharmacological approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kourdougli et al., 2023</xref>) are required to shed light on the role PV+ interneuron hypoactivity in these phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All procedures and experiments were done in accordance with the Comité Institutionnel de Bonnes Pratiques Animales en Recherche (CIBPAR) of the CHU Ste-Justine Research Center in line with the principles published in the Canadian Council on Animal’s Care’s (protocol reference number: 2024-6519).

All electrophysiological recordings were carried out using a 40× water-immersion objective. Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments) with a PP-83 two-stage puller (Narishige) to a resistance range of 5–7 MΩ when backfilled with intracellular solution. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from PV+ and SST+ interneurons were performed in voltage or current-clamp mode. Pipette capacitance was neutralized, and bridge balance applied. For voltage-clamp recording, we used an intracellular Cs<sup>+</sup>-based solution containing (in mM): 130 CsMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 5 CsCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 phosphocreatine, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 4 ATP-TRIS, 0.4 GTP-TRIS, 0.3% biocytin, and 2 QX-314 (pH 7.2–7.3; 280–290 mOsm/l). These recordings were performed to analyze the excitatory drive received by PV+ and SST+ cells. Series resistance in voltage-clamp was monitored throughout the experiment, and cells that had substantial changes in series resistance (&gt;15%) during recording were discarded. The reported voltage values were not compensated for the junction potential. Recordings of sEPSC and mEPSCs were performed in voltage-clamp at –70 mV in the presence of gabazine (1 μM; Tocris Bioscience) and CGP55845 (2 μM; Abcam Biochemicals). sEPSCs were first sampled over a 2-min period. A TTX (1 μM; Alomone Labs) containing perfusion solution was then added (flow rate of 2 ml/min) and, after a 5-min interval, mEPSCs were sampled over a 2-min period. Recordings of spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC, mIPSCs) were performed in voltage-clamp at +10 mV in the presence of NBQX (10 μM; Abcam Biochemicals) and DL-AP5 (100 μM; Abcam Biochemicals) for sISPCs and with addition of TTX (1 μM) for mIPSCs. For recordings of thalamocortical electrically evoked AMPA/NMDA EPSC in LIV PV+ cells, current pulses (2-ms duration, 25–1000 µA) were delivered to the thalamic radiation every 30 s via a tungsten concentric bipolar microelectrode placed in the white matter midway between the medial geniculate nucleus and the A1 (rostral to the hippocampus). Electrical stimulation of thalamic radiation may activate not only monosynaptic thalamic fibers but also polysynaptic (corticothalamic and/or corticocortical) EPSC component. To identify monosynaptic thalamo-cortical connections, we used as criteria the onset latencies of EPSC and the variability jitter obtained from the standard deviation of onset latencies. Onset latencies were defined as the time interval between the beginning of the stimulation artifact and the onset of the EPSC.

Passive and active membrane properties were analyzed in current clamp mode: active membrane properties were recorded by subjecting cells to multiple current step injections (step size 40 pA) of varying amplitudes (–200 to 600 pA). In subsequent experiments, the same protocol was repeated in the presence of the voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv) blocker α-DTX (100 nM; Alomone labs). In these experiments, slices were recovered in a holding chamber for at least 1 hr in the presence of α-DTX. Once placed in the recording chamber, slices were kept for recording for a maximum of 1 hr. Passive membrane properties, resting membrane potential (Vm), input resistance (Rin), and membrane capacitance (Cm) were obtained immediately after membrane rupture. Membrane potentials were maintained at –80 mV, series resistances (10–18 MΩ) and Rin were monitored on-line with a 40 pA current injection (150 ms) given before each 500 ms current injection stimulus. Only cells with resting membrane potential more negative than –60 mV at the start of recording and spikes with overshoot were considered for further analysis.

For the analysis of sEPSCs, mEPSCs, sIPSCs, and mIPSCs, a minimum of 100 events were sampled per cell over a 2 min period using an automated template search algorithm in Clampfit. The 20–80% rise time of the response and the decay time constant determined from the exponential fit (100–37%) were calculated. Charge transfer was calculated by integrating the area under the EPSC and IPSC waveforms. The mean PSC synaptic current was calculated as the charge transfer of the averaged PSC (Δ<italic>Q</italic>) multiplied by mean PSC frequency. For thalamocortical eAMPA and eNMDA, the mean amplitude of EPSCs including both failure and success was obtained from a total of 5–10 sweeps. Onset latency indicated the time from beginning of stimulus artifact and the onset of eAMPA or eNMDA. To measure eNMDA/eAMPA ratios, the eAMPA component was taken at the peak of EPSC at −70 mV, whereas the eNMDA component was measured at the peak of EPSC at +40 mV. For PPR experiments, the PPR was calculated as the ratio between the mean AUC of the second response and the mean AUC of the first response (7–10 sweeps).</p><p>For the analysis of current-clamp recordings from PV cells, threshold current was measured as the minimal current necessary to evoke an AP. For the analysis of the AP properties, the first AP appearing within a 50-ms time window from the beginning of the current pulse was analyzed. AP latency was measured as the time between current step onset and when membrane voltage reached AP threshold. The AP amplitude was measured from the AP threshold to the peak. The AP half-width was measured at the voltage level of the half of AP amplitude. The AP rise and fall time were measured between the AP threshold and the maximal AP amplitude, and between the maximal AP amplitude and the AP end, respectively. The fAHP amplitude was determined as the minimum voltage following the AP peak subtracted from the AP threshold. fAHP time was determined as the time between AP threshold and the negative peak of fAHP. The hyperpolarization-activated cation current (<italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub>)-associated voltage rectification (<italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> sag) was determined as the amplitude of the membrane potential sag from the peak hyperpolarized level to the level at the end of the hyperpolarizing step when the cell was hyperpolarized to –100 mV. Membrane time constant (<italic>τ</italic>) was calculated by the product of R<sub>in</sub> and C<sub>m</sub>. For the firing analysis, we considered only APs with amplitude &gt;30 mV as full APs. Spikelets with amplitude smaller than 30 mV were not analyzed in this study. The inter-spike interval (ISI) was determined by the time difference between adjacent AP peaks. Spike amplitude accommodation ratio was calculated by dividing the amplitude of the last AP by the amplitude of the first generated in response to 2× threshold current injection. Firing frequency adaptation ratios were calculated by dividing the last ISI with the first one of the responses to 2× threshold current injection. The maximal (initial) firing frequency (F<sub>max</sub>initial) was computed as the reciprocal of the first ISI in a spike train elicited by the current step (max +600 pA) applied before a noticeable appearance of spikelets. The steady-state firing frequency (<italic>F</italic><sub>ss</sub>) was computed as the reciprocal of the average of the last four ISIs in the spike train where F<sub>max</sub>initial was obtained. Finally, the number of APs (# APs)–current relationship for evoked firing was determined by injecting 500 ms somatic current steps of increasing amplitude (40 pA increments) to a maximum of 600 pA. For current-clamp recordings in the presence of α-DTX experiments, the delta (Δ) values were calculated for threshold current, AP threshold, and AP number at +200 pA, by subtracting individual values of α-DTX-treated cells from the average of their respective control group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Hierarchical clustering and PCA</title><p>This analysis was based on previously published data finding heterogeneity in PV+ interneurons population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Helm et al., 2013</xref>), and performed using the software IBM SPSS V29.0.0 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_016479">SCR_016479</ext-link>. Hierarchical clustering was based on Euclidean distance of PV+ cells from control mice. To identify potential clusters, we used AP half-width and F<sub>max</sub>initial values. We then performed multidimensional cluster analysis on passive and active membrane properties to identify possible common groupings of PV+ interneurons using the software Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>). In our database, we focused on 13 parameters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) that were for the majority unrelated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref> is a cross-correlation matrix of these 13 parameters with correlation indices shade-coded. Black means perfectly positively correlated (correlation index of 1.0), white means perfectly negatively correlated (correlation index of –1.0), and light gray means not correlated (correlation index of 0). In our database, we have parameters that are not strongly correlated (e.g., threshold current and AP amplitude, fAHP amplitude and AP latency), and others that are correlated (correlation coefficient &gt;0.5 or &lt;–0.5; AP latency and amplitude AR; AP half-width and AP amplitude; Rin and AP half-width; AP amplitude and F<sub>max</sub> initial). We retained all parameters because they encompass different features of membrane properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Helm et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore performed PCA on the 13 parameters to reduce the dimensionality and to potentiate cluster separation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry, cell reconstruction, and anatomical identification</title><p>For post-hoc anatomical identification, every recorded neuron was filled with biocytin (0.5%, Sigma) during whole-cell recordings (15 min).

All images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a and c</xref> are from a single confocal plane. To quantify the number of vGlut1/PSD95 or vGlut2/PSD95 putative synapses, images were exported as TIFF files and analyzed using Fiji (Image J) software. We first manually outlined the profile of each PV cell soma (identified by PV immunolabeling). At least four innervated somata were selected in each confocal stack. We then used a series of custom-made macros in Fiji as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chehrazi et al., 2023</xref>). After subtracting background (rolling value = 10) and Gaussian blur (<italic>σ</italic> value = 2) filters, the stacks were binarized and vGlut1/PSD95 or vGlut2/PSD95 puncta were independently identified around the perimeter of a targeted soma in the focal plane with the highest soma circumference. Puncta were quantified after filtering particles for size (included between 0 and 2 μm<sup>2</sup>) and circularity (included between 0 and 1). Quantification of the density of perisomatic puncta colocalizing both VGlut1-PSD95 and VGlut2-PSD95 was normalized to controls. All analysis was performed by researchers blind to the genotype.

While haplo-insufficiently of SynGap1 is known to lead to intellectual disabilities, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The questions are novel</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Despite the interesting and novel questions, there are significant issues regarding the experimental design and potential misinterpretations of key findings. Consequently, the manuscript contributes little to our understanding of SynGap1 loss mechanisms.</p><p>Major issues in the second version of the manuscript:</p><p>In the review of the first version there were major issues and contradictions with the sEPSC and mEPSC data, and were not resolved after the revision, and the new control experiments rather confirmed the contradiction.</p><p>In the original review I stated: &quot;One major concern is the inconsistency and confusion in the intermediate conclusions drawn from the results. For instance, while the sEPSC data indicates decreased amplitude in PV+ and SOM+ cells in cHet animals, the frequency of events remains unchanged. In contrast, the mEPSC data shows no change in amplitudes in PV+ cells, but a significant decrease in event frequency. The authors conclude that the former observation implies decreased excitability. However, traditionally, such observations on mEPSC parameters are considered indicative of presynaptic mechanisms rather than changes of network activity. The subsequent synapse counting experiments align more closely with the traditional conclusions. This issue can be resolved by rephrasing the text. However, it would remain unexplained why the sEPSC frequency shows no significant difference. If the majority of sEPSC events were indeed mediated by spiking (which is blocked by TTX), the average amplitudes and frequency of mEPSCs should be substantially lower than those of sEPSCs. Yet, they fall within a very similar range, suggesting that most sEPSCs may actually be independent of action potentials. But if that was indeed the case, the changes of purported sEPSC and mEPSC results should have been similar.&quot; Contradictions remained after the revision of the manuscript. On one hand, the authors claimed in the revised version that &quot;We found no difference in mEPSC amplitude between the two genotypes (Fig. 1g), indicating that the observed difference in sEPSC amplitude (Figure 1b) could arise from decreased network excitability&quot;. On the other hand, later they show &quot;no significative difference in either amplitude or inter-event intervals between sEPSC and mEPSC, suggesting that in acute slices from adult A1, most sEPSCs may actually be AP independent.&quot; The latter means that sEPSCs and mEPSCs are the same type of events, which should have the same sensitivity to manipulations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the detailed comments. Our results suggest a diverse population of PV+ cells, with varying reliance on action potential-dependent and -independent release. Several PV+ cells indeed show TTX sensitivity (reduced EPSC event amplitudes following TTX application: See new Supplementary Figure 2b-e), but their individual responses are diluted when all cells are pooled together. To account for this variability, we recorded sEPSC followed by mEPSC from more mice of both genotypes (new Figure 1f-j). Further, following the editors and reviewers’ suggestions, we removed speculations about the role of network activity changes.</p><p>In summary, our data confirmed that TTX blocked APs in PV+ cells and that recordings were stable as indicated by lack of changes in series resistance during the recording period in our experimental setup (new Suppl. Figure 2f-i). We found no difference in mEPSC amplitude between the two genotypes (Fig. 1g, right), indicating that the observed difference in sEPSC amplitude (Figure 1c, right) could be due to impaired AP-dependent release in cHet mice and the presence of large-amplitude sEPSCs that are preferentially affected by TTX in control mice (new Suppl. Figure 2b-e). Conversely, cHet mice showed longer inter-mEPSC time interval (cumulative distribution in Figure 1g, left), and significantly lower charge transfer and DQ*f (Figure 1j) compared to controls littermates, suggesting a decrease of glutamatergic presynaptic release sites onto PV+ cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerns about the quality of the synapse counting experiments were addressed by showing additional images in a different and explaining quantification. However, the admitted restriction of the analysis of excitatory synapses to the somatic region represent a limitation, as they include only a small fraction of the total excitation - even if, the slightly larger amplitudes of their EPSPs are considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that restricting the anatomical analysis of excitatory synapses to PV cell somatic region is a limitation, as highlighted it in the discussion of the revised manuscript. Recent studies, based on serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, suggest that cortical PV+ interneurons receive more robust excitatory inputs to their perisomatic region as compared to pyramidal neurons (see for example, Hwang et al. 2021, Cerebral Cortex, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhaa378">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhaa378</ext-link>). It is thus possible that putative glutamatergic synapses, analysed by vGlut1/PSD95 colocalisation around PV+ cell somata, may be representative of a substantially major excitatory input population. Since analysing putative excitatory synapses onto PV+ dendrites would be difficult and require a much longer time, we re-phrased the text to more clearly highlight the rationale and limitation of this approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>New experiments using paired-pulse stimulation provided an answer to issues 3 and 4. Note that the numbering of the Figures in the responses and manuscript are not consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad that the reviewer found that the new paired-pulse experiments answered previously raised concerns. We corrected the discrepancy in figure numbers in the manuscript. Thank you for noticing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I agree that low sampling rate of the APs does not change the observed large differences in AP threshold, however, the phase plots are still inconsistent in a sense that there appears to be an offset, as all values are shifted to more depolarized membrane potentials, including threshold, AP peak, AHP peak. This consistent shift may be due to a non-biological differences in the two sets of recordings, and, importantly, it may negate the interpretation of the I/f curves results (Fig. 5e).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that higher sampling rate would allow to more accurately assess different parameters, such as AP peak, half-width, rise time, etc., while it would not affect the large differences in AP threshold we observed between control and mutant mice. Since the phase plots to not add to our result analysis, we removed them from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional issues:</p><p>The first paragraph of the Results mentioned that the recorded cells were identified by immunolabelling and axonal localization. However, neither the Results nor the Methods mention the criteria and levels of measurements of axonal arborization.</p></disp-quote><p>Recorded MGE-derived interneurons were filled with biocytin, and their identity was confirmed by immunolabeling for neurochemical markers (PV or SST) and analysis of anatomical properties. In particular, whole biocytin-positive immunolabelled neurons were acquired using a Leica SP8-DLS confocal microscope (20x objective, NA 0.75; Z-step 1 1μm). For each imaged neuron, which was the result of multiple merged confocal stacks, we visually determined the spatial distribution across cortical layers of the axonal arbor and whether its dendrites carried spines. We added this information in the method section. Furthermore, to better represent our methodological approach, we added a new figure (Supplemental Figure 1) including (1) two examples of PV+ interneurons, showing dendrites devoid of spines and axons spreading from layer II to layer V (new Suppl. Figure 1a); and (2) two examples of SST+ interneurons showing dendritic with spines and axons projecting from layer IV to layer I where they gave rise to multiple collaterals (new Suppl. Figure 1b).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The other issues of the first review were adequately addressed by the Authors and the manuscript improved by these changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy the reviewer found that the other issues were well addressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This paper compares the synaptic and membrane properties of two main subtypes of interneurons (PV+, SST+) in the auditory cortex of control mice vs mutants with Syngap1 haploinsufficiency. The authors find differences between control and mutants in both interneuron populations, although they claim a predominance in PV+ cells. These results suggest that altered PVinterneuron functions in the auditory cortex may contribute to the network dysfunctions observed in Syngap1 haploinsufficiency-related intellectual disability.</p><p>The subject of the work is interesting, and most of the approach is rather direct and straightforward, which are strengths. There are also some methodological weaknesses and interpretative issues that reduce the impact of the paper.</p><p>(1) Supplementary Figure 3: recording and data analysis. The data of Supplementary Figure 3 show no differences either in the frequency or amplitude of synaptic events recorded from the same cell in control (sEPSCs) vs TTX (mEPSCs). This suggests that, under the experimental conditions of the paper, sEPSCs are AP-independent quantal events. However, I am concerned by the high variability of the individual results included in the Figure. Indeed, several datapoints show dramatically different frequencies in control vs TTX, which may be explained by unstable recording conditions. It would be important to present these data as time course plots, so that stability can be evaluated. Also, the claim of lack of effect of TTX should be corroborated by positive control experiments verifying that TTX is working (block of action potentials, for example). Lastly, it is not clear whether the application of TTX was consistent in time and duration in all the experiments and the paper does not clarify what time window was used for quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern about high variability. To account for this variability, we recorded sEPSC followed by mEPSC from more mice of both genotypes (see new Figure 1f-j). We confirmed that TTX worked as expected several times through the time course of this study, in different aliquots prepared from the same TTX vial that was used for all experiments. The results of the last test we performed, showing that TTX application blocks action potentials in a PV+ cell, are depicted in new Suppl. Figure 2a. Furthermore, new Suppl. Figure 2f-i shows series resistance (Rs) over time for 4 different PV+ interneurons, indicating recording stability. These results are representative of the entire population of recorded neurons, which we have meticulously analysed one by one. TTX was applied using the same protocol for all recorded neurons. In particular, sEPSCs were first sampled over a 2 min period. A TTX (1μM; Alomone Labs)-containing solution was then perfused into the recording chamber at a flow rate of 2 mL/min. We then waited for 5 min before sampling mEPSCs over a 2 min period. We added this information in the revised manuscript methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 3: apparent inconsistency. If, as the authors claim, TTX does not affect sEPSCs (either in the control or mutant genotype, Supplementary Figure 3 and point 1 above), then comparing sEPSC and mEPSC in control vs mutants should yield identical results. In contrast, Figure 1 reports a _selective_ reduction of sEPSCs amplitude (not in mEPSCs) in mutants, which is difficult to understand. The proposed explanation relying on different pools of synaptic vesicles mediating sEPSCs and mEPSCs does not clarify things. If this was the case, wouldn't it also imply a decrease of event frequency following TTX addition? However, this is not observed in Supplementary Figure 3. My understanding is that, according to this explanation, recordings in control solution would reflect the impact of two separate pools of vesicles, whereas, in the presence of TTX, only one pool would be available for release. Therefore, TTX should cause a decrease in the frequency of the recorded events, which is not what is observed in Supplementary Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>To account for the large variability and clarify these results, we recorded sEPSCs followed by mEPSCs from more mice of both genotypes (new Figure 1f-j). We found no difference in mEPSC amplitude between the two genotypes (Fig. 1g, right), indicating that the observed difference in sEPSC amplitude (Figure 1c, right) could be due to impaired AP-dependent release in cHet mice and the presence of large-amplitude sEPSCs that are preferentially affected by TTX in control mice (new Suppl. Figure 2b-e). Conversely, cHet mice showed longer inter-mEPSC time interval (cumulative distribution in Figure 1g, left), and significantly lower charge transfer and DQ*f (Figure 1j) compared to controls littermates, suggesting a decrease of glutamatergic presynaptic release sites. We rephrased the text in the revised manuscript according to the updated data and, following the reviewer’s suggestions, we removed speculations relying on different pools of synaptic vesicles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 1: statistical analysis. Although I do appreciate the efforts of the authors to illustrate both cumulative distributions and plunger plots with individual data, I am confused by how the cumulative distributions of Figure 1b (sEPSC amplitude) may support statistically significant differences between genotypes, but this is not the case for the cumulative distributions of Figure 1g (inter mEPSC interval), where the curves appear even more separated. A difference in mEPSC frequency would also be consistent with the data of Supplementary Fig 2b, which otherwise are difficult to reconciliate. I would encourage the authors to use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov rather than a t-test for the comparison of cumulative distributions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful suggestion. We recorded more mice of both genotypes and the updated data now show a significant difference between the cumulative distributions of the inter mEPSC intervals recorded from the two genotypes (new Figure 1g). For statistical analysis, we based our conclusion on the statistical results generated by LMM, modelling animal as a random effect and genotype as fixed effect. We used this statistical analysis because we considered the number of mice as independent replicates and the number of cells in each mouse as repeated measures (Berryer et al. 2016; Heggland et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2022). For cumulative distributions, the same number of events was chosen randomly from each cell and analysed by LMM, modelling animal as a random effect and genotype as fixed effect. The reason we decided to use LMM for our statistical analyses is based on the growing concern over reproducibility in biomedical research and the ongoing discussion on how data are analysed (see for example, Yu et al (2022), Neuron 110:21-35 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.10.030">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.10.030</ext-link>; Aarts et al. (2014). Nat Neurosci <bold>17</bold>, 491–496. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.3648">https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.3648</ext-link>). We acknowledge that patch-clamp data has been historically analysed using t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA), or equivalent nonparametric tests. However, these tests assume that individual observations (recorded neurons in this case) are independent of each other. Whether neurons from the same mouse are independent or correlated variables is an unresolved question, but does not appear to be likely from a biological point of view. Statisticians have developed effective methods to analyze correlated data, including LMM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Methods. I still maintain that a threshold at around -20/-15 mV for the first action potential of a train seems too depolarized (see some datapoints of Fig 5c and Fig7c) for a healthy spike. This suggest that some cells were either in precarious conditions or that the capacitance of the electrode was not compensated properly.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, in the revised figures we excluded the neurons with threshold at -20/-15 mV. In addition, we performed statistical analysis with and without these cells (data reported below) and found that whether these cells are included or excluded, the statistical significance of the results does not change.</p><p>Fig.5c: including the 2 outliers from cHet group with values of -16.5 and 20.6 mV: 42.6±1.01 mV in control, n=33 cells from 15 mice vs -35.3±1.2 mV in cHet, n=40 cells from 17 mice, ***p&lt;0.001, LMM; excluding the 2 outliers from cHet group -42.6±1.01 mV in control, n=33 cells from 15 mice vs -36.2±1.1 mV in cHet, n=38 cells from 17 mice, ***p&lt;0.001, LMM.</p><p>Fig.7c: including the 2 outliers from cHet group with values of -16.5 and 20.6 mV: 43.4±1.6 mV in control, n=12 cells from 9 mice vs -33.9±1.8 mV in cHet, n=24 cells from 13 mice, **p=0.002, LMM; excluding the 2 outliers from cHet group -43.4±1.6 mV in control, n=12 cells from 9 mice vs -35.4±1.7 mV in cHet, n=22 cells from 13 mice, *p=0.037, LMM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors claim that &quot;cHet SST+ cells showed no significant changes in active and passive membrane properties (Figure 8d,e); however, their evoked firing properties were affected with fewer AP generated in response to the same depolarizing current injection&quot;.</p><p>This sentence is intrinsically contradictory. Action potentials triggered by current injections are dependent on the integration of passive and active properties. If the curves of Figure 8f are different between genotypes, then some passive and/or active property MUST have changed. It is an unescapable conclusion. The general _blanket_ statement of the authors that there are no significant changes in active and passive properties is in direct contradiction with the current/#AP plot.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with the reviewer and rephrased the abstract, results and discussion according to better represent the data. As discussed in the previous revision, it's possible that other intrinsic factors, not assessed in this study, may have contributed to the effect shown in the current/#AP plot.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The phase plots of Figs 5c, 7c, and 7h suggest that the frequency of acquisition/filtering of current-clamp signals was not appropriate for fast waveforms such as spikes. The first two papers indicated by the authors in their rebuttal (Golomb et al., 2007; Stevens et al., 2021) did not perform a phase plot analysis (like those included in the manuscript). The last work quoted in the rebuttal (Zhang et al., 2023) did perform phase plot analysis, but data were digitized at a frequency of 20KHz (not 10KHz as incorrectly indicated by the authors) and filtered at 10 kHz (not 2-3 kHz as by the authors in the manuscript). To me, this remains a concern.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that higher sampling rate would allow to more accurately assess different AP parameters, such as AP peak, half-width, rise time, etc. The papers were cited in context of determining AP threshold, not performing phase plot analysis. We apologize for the confusion and error. Finally, we removed the phase plots since they did not add relevant information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The general logical flow of the manuscript could be improved. For example, Fig 4 seems to indicate no morphological differences in the dendritic trees of control vs mutant PV cells, but this conclusion is then rejected by Fig 6. Maybe Fig 4 is not necessary. Regarding Fig 6, did the authors check the integrity of the entire dendritic structure of the cells analyzed (i.e. no dendrites were cut in the slice)? This is critical as the dendritic geometry may affect the firing properties of neurons (Mainen and Sejnowski, Nature, 1996).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we removed Fig.4. All the reconstructions used for dendritic analysis contained intact cells with no evidently cut dendrites.</p></body></sub-article></article>
