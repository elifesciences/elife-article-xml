CTA depends on the gustatory portion of the insular cortex (GC) and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) however, its synaptic underpinnings are unknown. Here we report that CTA was associated with decreased expression of immediate early genes in rat GC of both sexes, and with reduced amplitude of BLA-GC synaptic responses, pointing to long-term depression (LTD) as a mechanism for learning. Indeed, association of a novel tastant with induction of LTD at the BLA-GC input in vivo was sufficient to change the hedonic value of a taste stimulus.

For example, taste perception depends on the chemical identity of a tastant, as well as on its pleasantness or aversiveness (i.e, its hedonic value). Hedonic value can be modulated by experience. Indeed, the affective value of a palatable gustatory stimulus changes if it becomes associated with gastric malaise, a process known as CTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia et al., 1955</xref>). In laboratory settings, CTA can be induced in rats by association of sucrose consumption with a gastric malaise-inducing intraperitoneal (ip) injection of lithium chloride. In naïve rats, this association reliably produces a persistent hedonic shift capable of driving avoidance even after a single conditioning trial. Inactivation studies point to the involvement of the gustatory portion of the insular cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flynn et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamamoto et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cubero et al., 1999</xref>) and the basolateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morris et al., 1999</xref>) as key regions necessary for CTA. Evidence from these studies is further corroborated by experiments investigating the interaction between these two regions. In naïve animals, analysis of GC neurons’ activity following inactivation of BLA indicates that amygdalar inputs to GC provide information about the affective dimension of taste stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piette et al., 2012</xref>). Recent studies suggest that the expression of aversive behaviors related to taste depend on the output of GC to the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lavi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schiff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kayyal et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While the involvement of GC, BLA, and their connections in CTA is well-established, the synaptic changes underlying this form of learning remain unclear. Different experimental approaches produced results that are hard to reconcile. In GC, analysis of molecular markers for synaptic plasticity was brought as evidence that CTA induced long term potentiation (LTP) of GC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosenblum et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escobar and Bermúdez-Rattoni, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berman and Dudai, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Escobar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gal-Ben-Ari and Rosenblum, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rodríguez-Durán et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guzman-Ramos and Bermudez-Rattoni, 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, analysis of GC and BLA neurons’ spiking activity in awake rodents reported a decrease in firing rate in both regions following CTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grossman et al., 2008</xref>) – a finding that is inconsistent with the hypothesized induction of LTP.</p><p>Here we use a combination of immediate early gene immunohistochemistry, patch clamp electrophysiology, and optogenetic stimulation to study plasticity of amygdalocortical circuits in CTA. We demonstrate that CTA reduces activity in GC, and that this decrease is accompanied by long term depression (LTD) at BLA synapses onto pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of GC. Finally, we identify patterns of activity that induce LTD at the BLA-GC input and show that substituting the gastric malaise with this pattern at BLA-GC terminal fields in vivo following sucrose consumption is sufficient to reduce the preference for this tastant. Our results provide the first direct evidence that CTA depends on LTD at amygdalocortical synapses, and that this plasticity alters the affective dimension of a sensory stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In order to investigate whether learning induces synaptic plasticity at amygdalocortical synapses in GC, we trained male and female rats in a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm where novel, palatable sucrose (0.1M in water) was paired with gastric malaise induced by an intraperitoneal (ip) injection of lithium chloride (LiCl, 0.15M, 7.5 mL/kg body weight; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Animals were placed on a water restriction schedule where they received 15 min access to water from a drinking spout in an experimental chamber in the morning, followed by one-hour access to water in their home cages 4 hr later. After four days of habituation, on day 5 and 7, the morning water was replaced with 0.1M sucrose, and the animals received an ip injection of LiCl immediately after consumption. Two conditioning sessions were used to ensure learning and consolidation of the aversive memory. In the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), pseudo-conditioned animals were exposed to both the US and CS, but they received the LiCl injection the night before sucrose access, and therefore did not form an association between the gastric malaise and tastant. Learning was assessed on day 8 using a 2-bottle test. Average fluid consumption across habituation days for each group was comparable, and animals in both groups initially found the sucrose solution to be palatable, consuming more on the first conditioning day compared to baseline water intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, this preference shifts in the CTA group following the LiCl injection, as indicated by decreased consumption of sucrose on the second conditioning day, and a strong preference for water at testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A significant difference in the aversion index (AI), calculated as ((water – sucrose)/total volume) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; water preferred for 0 &lt; AI &lt; 1; sucrose preferred if −1 &lt; AI &lt; 0), could be seen in animals that received an ip injection of LiCl following tastant exposure compared to animals that received LiCl dissociated from the tastant exposure. Following the 2-bottle test, brain tissue was harvested for either immunohistological processing or acute slice recording experiments. To ensure that the 2-bottle test did not initiate CTA extinction, in a subset of rats we repeated the 2-bottle test on two consecutive days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Results from the 2-bottle tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and aversion indices on test day and 24 hr later were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These results indicate that in our paradigm, CTA was reliably induced, and the 2-bottle test did not initiate an extinction process.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conditioned taste aversion learning differentially recruits EXC neurons in L2/3 aGC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Behavioral paradigm schematic.

We performed patch clamp recordings in voltage clamp using a cesium based internal solution that allowed for the isolation of spontaneous excitatory (sEPSCs) currents by holding neurons at the reversal potential for chloride (−50 mV in our experimental conditions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). Analysis of spontaneous synaptic events unveiled a significant decrease in the cumulative amplitude distribution of spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents, but no change in their frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The decrease in amplitude of spontaneous events was more pronounced for larger events and was sufficient to result in a significant reduction in spontaneous excitatory synaptic charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A change in synaptic drive onto these neurons could potentially mask a change in intrinsic membrane properties, so we repeated the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> in the presence of ionotropic receptor blockers (20 μm DNQX, 50 μm AP5, 20 μm picrotoxin). No differences in intrinsic membrane properties were unveiled following bath application of the synaptic blockers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our results exclude the possibility that CTA altered intrinsic excitability and point to decreased excitatory synaptic transmission as a possible plasticity mechanism for this learning paradigm. Furthermore, given that CTA-induced effects on synaptic drive were detectable in L2/3 pyramidal neurons sampled across the extent of GC, it is highly unlikely for them to depend on selective plasticity on a clustered subset of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CTA learning decreases BLA input onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons in aGC</title><p>The reduction in the distribution of large events we observed is consistent with the possibility that CTA may affect afferent inputs onto GC neurons, as these typically have larger amplitudes than recurrent events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Previous work demonstrated that CTA induction is impaired by inactivation of either GC or BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bermudez-Rattoni and McGaugh, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morris et al., 1999</xref>), suggesting that the connection between these regions may be a fundamental player in this form of learning. We therefore asked whether the BLA-GC input onto pyramidal neurons may be affected by CTA. To do that, we used an optogenetic approach to selectively activate BLA terminal fields while recording pyramidal neurons in the superficial layers of GC. As extensively characterized in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haley et al., 2016</xref>), we injected AAV9.CAG.ChR2-Venus.WPRE.SV40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petreanu et al., 2007</xref>) in the BLA (2.1 mm posterior to bregma; 4.7 mm lateral to midline; 7.0 mm below the pia) of P14 rats. CTA training began 14 days after surgery, at P28. The position of the injection site, and expression of the construct in BLA terminal fields within GC were verified histologically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Lack of retrograde transport of the construct was verified by the lack of backfilled somata in GC. Consistency of expression across preparations was assessed as indicated in the Materials and methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kloc and Maffei, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Following the 2-bottle test, acute slices were prepared (1.5 mm to bregma) and patch clamp recordings were obtained from visually identified L2/3 pyramidal neurons. Brief (5 ms) pulses of blue light (470 nm) were delivered with an LED mounted on the fluorescence light path of an upright microscope and light-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (BLA-EPSCs) were recorded. The monosynaptic nature of BLA-EPSCs was verified as described in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haley et al., 2016</xref>), and an input/output curve for BLA-EPSCs was obtained using light stimuli of increasing intensity (0.2–4.4 mW, measured at the output of the objective). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, BLA-EPSC amplitude was reduced following CTA, consistent with the reduction in spontaneous excitatory charge. Recordings in current clamp unveiled that the decreased amplitude of BLA-EPSCs did not reduce the average BLA-evoked EPSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, in both groups, there was a strong correlation with the amplitude of BLA-EPSCs and BLA-EPSPs onto individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We observed no differences between the control and CTA groups in the proportion of cells that received input from BLA, or in the paired-pulse ratio (PPR), coefficient of variation (CV), or decay tau of the evoked BLA-EPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since BLA provides a powerful glutamatergic input to L2/3 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haley et al., 2016</xref>), the decrease in BLA-EPSC amplitude strongly suggests that GC neurons are activated less effectively by incoming inputs. This effect may explain the reduced expression of IEGs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and is consistent with reports of decreased GC neurons’ activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grossman et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>CTA decreases BLA input onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons in aGC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of histological verification of injection site and expression of opsin construct in BLA terminal fields in aGC.

We first probed the capacity for plasticity of these synapses by identifying a pattern of activity that could induce LTD at this input in control animals. We designed induction paradigms that allowed for stimulation of BLA terminal fields with a phasic or a tonic pattern of activity. Both patterns of BLA neuron activity have been recorded in vivo in awake rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fontanini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parsana et al., 2012</xref>) and are thought to be associated with different behavioral states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parsana et al., 2012</xref>).

Patch clamp recordings were obtained from L2/3 neurons in GC of slices obtained from control and CTA rats, prepared right after the 2-bottle test. Following acquisition of a 10 min baseline recorded in voltage clamp at −70 mV, we paired presynaptic 20 Hz bursts of light pulses to activate BLA afferents with depolarization of the postsynaptic GC neuron in current clamp, then continued to record neurons in voltage clamp at −70 mV for at least 40 min post-induction.

The results also demonstrate that induction of LTD at amygdalocortical synapses onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons with a phasic 20 Hz pattern of stimulation of BLA terminal fields in GC is sufficient for changing the hedonic value of a taste stimulus. These findings confirm the central role of the projection from BLA to GC in CTA, and also reveal that circuit changes following CTA learning do not depend, as previously thought, on strengthening of synaptic connections, but rely on a significant decrease in synaptic input. Previous work reported a substantial change in the cortical representation of the conditioned tastant in GC following aversive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yasoshima and Yamamoto, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accolla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grossman et al., 2008</xref>). Our work provides novel evidence regarding the circuit mechanisms underlying this reorganization process and identifies long term plastic changes associated with CTA.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>CTA and immediate early gene expression</title><p>The behavioral paradigm we used consisted of two rounds of conditioning with taste-malaise pairing to ensure reliable expression of aversion learning. As a readout of the aversive memory, we used a 2-bottle test to determine volume consumption of the conditioned stimulus following learning, and to compute the aversion index between control and CTA animals. The 2-bottle test did not initiate an extinction process, as we show that the aversion index remained stable when animals were tested on two consecutive days. Quantification of IEGs, as a proxy for GC neurons’ activity, showed reduced expression of both c-Fos and EGR1 following testing in CTA animals compared to control. The decrease in IEG expression provides additional support as to the lack of extinction initiation, as extinction has been shown to increase IEG expression in GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hadamitzky et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In our paradigm, all animals, including controls, are exposed to sucrose twice. While for CTA animals sucrose is always associated with a gastric malaise, in control animals sucrose is a safe, palatable stimulus and animals consume it more than water. In control animals, the consumption of sucrose on the second exposure is higher than the first, consistent with an attenuation of neophobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin and Reilly, 2012</xref>), an effect that is associated with a reduction in c-Fos expression in GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). In the CTA group, the consumption of sucrose at the second exposure was significantly lower than at the first. The differences in IEG expression we report may reflect a blunted GC activation to sucrose in CTA animals compared to control. Consistent with this possibility, previous studies showed increased IEG expression in the insular cortex following consumption of a novel tastant alone (saccharine), but not in response to a LiCl injection alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilkins and Bernstein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein and Koh, 2007</xref>). Thus, our data support the interpretation that the differences in IEG expression are due to animals in the CTA group expressing an aversion to sucrose, rather than the control group learning that sucrose is ‘safe’. As IEG expression is considered a proxy for activity, our results are consistent with previously published work showing reduced spiking activity of GC neurons in the palatability epoch following CTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grossman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piette et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the aversive memory induced by our behavioral paradigm was reliable, allowing us to assess the effects of CTA on the BLA-GC circuit.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>CTA reduced excitatory synaptic drive onto GC neurons</title><p>Our analysis of synaptic and intrinsic properties of GC neurons allowed us to parse apart which of these components was responsible for the reduction in GC activity seen with CTA. We show that excitatory spontaneous synaptic charge onto GC pyramidal neurons is reduced following CTA, an effect that points to widespread modulation of synaptic transmission in GC, indicating that CTA affects the circuit in GC broadly. CTA altered synaptic drive and capacity for plasticity at BLA-GC synapses, effects consistent with changes in the activation of GC. These results strongly suggest that decreased synaptic drive onto GC neurons underlies the CTA-dependent circuit reorganization reported in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accolla and Carleton, 2008</xref>) and explains the reduced firing rates of GC neurons following CTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grossman et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of spontaneous excitatory synaptic events revealed a significant decrease in amplitude, and no changes in frequency.

Further confirmation of the postsynaptic site of expression comes from analysis of BLA-evoked responses onto GC pyramidal neurons. Following CTA, we observed a significant decrease in the amplitude of BLA-evoked responses, but no change in their PPR. Furthermore, the lack of changes in intrinsic excitability indicates that the profound effects taste aversion learning has on GC pyramidal neurons is via modulations at specific synaptic inputs and not an alteration in intrinsic membrane properties. Together, this set of findings confirms the central role of the BLA-GC connection in CTA learning, and demonstrates a role for plasticity of BLA-evoked synaptic responses onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons in hedonic learning.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Postsynaptically expressed LTD at amygdalocortical synapses as a mechanism for CTA</title><p>When we compared the effect of CTA on two different forms of LTD, induced by patterns of stimulation designed to mimic BLA neurons’ activity in different behavioral states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fontanini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parsana et al., 2012</xref>), we found a selective occlusion of plasticity induced by a phasic pattern of activity. Phasic stimulation induced a postsynaptically expressed form of LTD in control rats, but LTP in the CTA group, suggesting that phasic LTD and CTA share common mechanisms. The occlusion was specific to the phasic induction pattern, as LTD induced with a tonic pattern of BLA terminal field activation, a form of LTD with a presynaptic site of expression, was not affected by CTA. These results point to postsynaptic LTD at BLA-GC synapses as a mechanism for taste aversion learning.</p><p>The underlying mechanisms of postsynaptically expressed LTP and LTD have been studied extensively. Signaling cascades leading to the regulation of AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic membrane are thought to mediate changes in synaptic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Malinow and Malenka, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kessels and Malinow, 2009</xref>).

However, many of the molecular mechanisms involved in CTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berman and Dudai, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gal-Ben-Ari and Rosenblum, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guzman-Ramos and Bermudez-Rattoni, 2012</xref>) can be engaged by both LTP and LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yilmaz-Rastoder et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gandolfi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li and Pozzo-Miller, 2019</xref>). Additional evidence in support of the interpretation that CTA should potentiate BLA input to GC came from studies based on BLA activation with drug infusions or tetanic electrical stimulation during CTA learning. Local field potential (LFP) recordings in GC of anesthetized rodents showed that the induction of LTP of the population signal evoked by tetanic stimulation of the amygdala was occluded by CTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escobar and Bermúdez-Rattoni, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Escobar et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting that plasticity at the BLA input to GC may play a role in this learning paradigm. However, this experimental design does not assess whether the baseline response has been affected by CTA, nor which component of the population signal has been modified by CTA. Furthermore, these data do not indicate whether LTP at BLA-GC synapses may be sufficient for learning.</p><p>A key feature of our study that distinguishes it from previous work is the use of optogenetic techniques to selectively activate BLA terminal fields within GC. This approach prevented confounds due to recruitment BLA collaterals to other areas which inevitably occurs with somatic activation of BLA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klavir et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, our study is the first to examine baseline synaptic transmission, and therefore may yield different results from field potential recordings, which lack synaptic resolution, and are difficult to interpret as the circuit components that contribute to the LFP trace in GC have not been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escobar and Bermúdez-Rattoni, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Escobar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rodríguez-Durán et al., 2011</xref>). No analysis of changes in synaptic efficacy has been reported up to the present work. In view of our results demonstrating a reduction in the efficacy of BLA glutamatergic synapses onto GC neurons following CTA, it is likely that in L2/3 pyramidal neurons, signaling mechanisms for LTD are recruited during CTA.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>LTD at amygdalocortical synapses in GC is sufficient for the induction of CTA</title><p>Association of sucrose and phasic stimulation of BLA terminal fields in GC in vivo was sufficient to induce a weak CTA, unveiled as a loss of preferences for sucrose over water during the 2-bottle test. In these experiments, the phasic pattern of stimulation was delivered after sucrose in place of LiCl, thus selectively activating the BLA-GC input in the absence of a gastric malaise. Our results indicate that the pattern of activity for phasic 20 Hz LTD at BLA-GC synapses was sufficient to change the hedonic value of sucrose. The effect was specific to the pairing of sucrose and phasic 20 Hz stimulation of BLA terminal fields in GC, as neither non-contingent stimulation, nor the tonic ramping stimulus affected sucrose preference. While phasic 20 Hz activation of BLA-GC terminal fields in vivo was sufficient for changing the valence of sucrose, it did not induce as strong an aversion as LiCl. This effect was expected, as LiCl induces a gastric malaise that is not recruited in animals that received light stimulation through the optic fiber during CTA training. GC receives extensive visceral input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cechetto and Saper, 1987</xref>) which is not activated during BLA terminal field stimulation. Furthermore, previous studies have shown no change in IEG expression in the insular cortex following LiCl-induced illness, suggesting that processing of information about the US primarily occurs in other parts of the central gustatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilkins and Bernstein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein and Koh, 2007</xref>).

Whether the population of amydala-projecting and amygdala-recipient neurons in GC overlap is currently unknown, but this study raises interesting questions about how and when reciprocal connections between BLA and GC are recruited in CTA.

Cell counts represent the number of IEG-positive, GAD67-negative neurons, normalized by the counting area (L2/3 aGC) for each section.</p><p>Recovery of recorded neurons in acute slice preparation - Recorded slices were fixed in 4% PFA for 1 week. They were then washed in PBS (3 × 10 min rinse), permeabilized and blocked in a solution containing 1% Triton X and 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 2 hr, then slices were incubated overnight at 4°C in a solution containing 0.1% Triton X and 3% normal goat serum in PBS, streptavidin Alexa Fluor-568 conjugate (1:2000, Invitrogen, S11226), mouse anti-GAD67 (1:500, MilliporeSigma, MAB5406, monoclonal), and chicken anti-GFP (1:1000, Abcam, ab13970, polyclonal). GC slices were then rinsed in PBS (3 × 10 min) and incubated at 25°C for 2 hr in a solution containing 0.1% Triton X and 3% normal goat serum in PBS, goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-647 (1:500, Invitrogen, A21235), goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor-488 (1:500, Abcam, ab150173), and Hoechst 33342 (1:5000, Invitrogen, H3570). BLA slices were incubated overnight at 4°C in a solution containing 0.1% Triton X and 3% normal goat serum in PBS and chicken anti-GFP (1:1000, Abcam, ab13970, polyclonal). They were then rinsed in PBS (3 × 10 min) and incubated at 25°C for 2 hr in a solution containing 0.1% Triton X and 3% normal goat serum in PBS, goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor-488 (1:500, Abcam, ab150173), and Hoechst 33342 (1:5000, Invitrogen, H3570). Validation of injection sites and positioning of fiber optics - Following behavioral training, animals were anesthetized and perfused intracardially with PBS followed by 4% PFA. Coronal slices containing BLA and GC were cut at 100 µm with a fixed tissue vibratome (Leica VT1000). All sections were washed in PBS (3 × 10 min rinse) and incubated at 25°C for 1 hr in a solution containing 0.1% Triton X and Hoechst 33342 (1:5000, Invitrogen, H3570). Sections were mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech) and the accuracy of viral injections and fiber placements was assessed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Acute coronal slices containing GC were obtained immediately following the 2-bottle test. Slice preparation was as described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haley et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (Bell jar to effect) and rapidly decapitated. The brain was dissected in ice cold, oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), and 300 µm coronal slices containing GC were prepared using a fresh tissue vibratome (Leica VT1000) starting at 1.5 mm to bregma. Patch clamp recordings were obtained from visually identified L2/3 pyramidal neurons under DIC optics. Their identity was tested online with the injection of square current pulses (700 ms) to assess regular firing patterns, and post-hoc with immunohistochemistry aimed at reconstructing neuron morphology, assessing location, and confirming lack of expression of the GABA neuron marker GAD67. To assess possible changes in intrinsic excitability induced by CTA, recordings were obtained in current clamp and square current pulses of increasing amplitude were injected to examine input resistance, action potential threshold, and frequency/intensity curves. Input resistance was calculated from the linear portion of the voltage response to a −50 pA current injection. Action potential threshold was calculated as the membrane voltage when the first derivative of the voltage trace dV/dt = 20 V/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bekkers and Delaney, 2001</xref>). In a subset of experiments intrinsic properties were assessed in current clamp in the presence of fast synaptic receptor blockers (in µM: DNQX, 20; APV, 50; picrotoxin, 20). In a different set of experiments, spontaneous synaptic activity was recorded in voltage clamp. For these experiments, a cesium sulfate-based internal solution containing the sodium channel blocker QX314 (2 mM, Tocris Bioscience) was used to stabilize recordings during prolonged depolarization. Spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents were recorded at three different holding potentials around the reversal potential for chloride (to record sEPSCs, in mV: −55,–50, −45). Current vs. voltage functions were used to identify the voltage that better isolated the current of interest, which were used for analysis of charge and spontaneous events’ amplitude and frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maffei et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haley et al., 2016</xref>). Total charge was calculated by integrating 5 s sections of the current trace. Evoked EPSCs/EPSPs from stimulation of BLA terminal fields were obtained in voltage clamp and current clamp using a potassium gluconate solution and holding neurons at −70 mV. The monosynaptic nature of BLA-EPSCs was verified as in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haley et al., 2016</xref>). Event-triggered average of light-evoked BLA-EPSCs and BLA-EPSPs was used to align BLA-EPSC and BLA-EPSP onset and calculate the average amplitude of the light-evoked response. Latencies of BLA-evoked responses were calculated from the onset of the phasic 5 ms light pulse. For plasticity experiments, 2 LED pulses (5 ms, 10 Hz) were used to elicit BLA-EPSCs every 30 s. A brief (10 ms) 1 mV depolarization step was used to monitor series resistance (R<sub>s</sub>). After a 10 min baseline, either the phasic or tonic induction paradigm was applied in current clamp, after which BLA-EPSCs were recorded for an additional 40 min. Neurons with R<sub>s</sub> &gt;20 MΩ or that changed &gt;15% during recording were excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Optogenetics</title><p>Ex vivo experiments: Rats (P14) were anesthetized intraperitoneally with a mixture containing 70 mg/kg ketamine, 0.7 mg/kg acepromazine, and 3.5 mg/kg xylazine (KXA) and mounted on a stereotaxic apparatus. Animals received an injection of the AAV9.CAG.ChR2-Venus.WPRE.SV40 construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petreanu et al., 2007</xref>; University of Pennsylvania Vector Core) in the BLA using a nanoject pressure injector (Drummond Nanoject II; 100 nL volume containing 5.64<sup>12</sup> particles/mL) as described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haley et al., 2016</xref>). The stereotaxic coordinates for the injections were 2.1 mm posterior to bregma; 4.7 mm lateral to midline; 7.0 mm below the pia. Rats were allowed to recover from surgery for 2 weeks before CTA training and recordings. AAV9 was chosen because it is primarily transported anterogradely, and because ChR2 expressed via AAV9 does not alter the short-term dynamics of evoked responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jackman et al., 2014</xref>). The lack of backfilled somata in all of our GC preparations further confirms forward direction of transport and indicates that only BLA terminal fields in GC were activated by light pulses. Consistency of ChR2-Venus expression across preparation was as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haley et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the intensity of the Venus signal in GC was quantified across a 500 μm wide region of interest (ROI) spanning the cortical mantle from the pia to L5/6 (included) across 10 preparations. The average and standard deviation of the fluorescent signal were plotted as a function of depth. The expression of the Venus signal was then assessed for all preparations used for electrophysiological recordings and compared to the calibration curve. Only data obtained from preparations with a fluorescence profile within one standard deviation of the average calibration curve were included in the analysis.</p><p>BLA-EPSCs were evoked with a 5 ms light pulse delivered through the 40x objective mounted on an upright microscope (Olympus BX51WI). The intensity, frequency, and timing of the blue light stimuli (470 nm) were controlled with an LED driver (ThorLabs). Intensity at the output was verified with a light meter (Thor Labs, Range: 0.2–4.4 mW). Phasic stimulation for plasticity induction was organized in 20 trains of 20–5 ms light pulses at 20 Hz delivered every 250 ms and paired with depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron with a 50 pA current step. Tonic activation of BLA terminal fields was achieved using a ramping light stimulus (which prevented inactivation of ChR2 channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2009</xref>). The duration of the ramping stimulus was 6 s from 0 to maximum (4.4 mW) light intensity and was controlled through the LED driver connected to an analog output of the amplifier. For plasticity induction, 10 ramping stimuli spaced 5 s were paired with depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron with a 50 pA current step.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In vivo experiments</title><p>Stimulation of BLA terminal fields in vivo was achieved through optical fibers (Doric lenses, 400 µm) chronically implanted in GC (1.4 mm anterior to bregma; 5 mm lateral to midline; 4.5 mm below the pia). Rats, weighing &gt;250 g were anesthetized intraperitoneally with the KXA cocktail described above and supplemented with 40% of the induction dose as needed to maintain surgical levels of anesthesia. The scalp was exposed and holes were drilled for anchoring screws, optical fibers, and viral injection. The AAV9.CAG.ChR2-Venus.WPRE.SV40 construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petreanu et al., 2007</xref>) was bilaterally injected in the BLA (3.0 mm posterior to bregma; 5 mm lateral to midline; 7.2 mm below the pia) using a nanoject pressure injector (Drummond Nanoject II; 200 nL volume containing 5.64<sup>12</sup> particles/mL) as described above. Optical fibers (Doric Lenses, 400 μm) were coated with DiI for better detection of the optic fiber tract and implanted bilaterally to target GC and were secured in place with dental cement.</p><p>For these experiments, recovery from surgery was 4 weeks prior to CTA training. The injection site in BLA and the positioning of the optic fiber in GC were verified histologically for each preparation. Stimulation was controlled via the digital output (phasic protocol) or analog output (ramp protocol) of a multi-patch clamp amplifier (HEKA) and software (Patchmaster) and delivered through the implanted optical fibers coupled to a blue laser (Shanghai Dream, 470 nm). A control group of rats received a BLA injection of the AAV9.hSyn.eGFP.WPRE.bGH construct (University of Pennsylvania Vector Core) to ensure that possible changes in sucrose preference were due to BLA terminal field stimulation and not to unspecific effects of the light stimulation. Light intensity at the tip of the optic fiber was measured with a light meter (6.5 mW, ThorLabs) The induction paradigm in vivo had the same structure as the plasticity induction pattern used in slices (Phasic: Trains of 20 pulses, in this case 10 ms long, at 20 Hz delivered every 250 ms, repeated 100 times; Ramp: 12 ramping stimuli 6 s long, spaced 5 s). Animals in the GFP control group, paired 20 Hz opto group, and ramp opto group received photostimulation immediately after exposure to the 0.1M sucrose solution on conditioning days 1 and 2. The non-paired 20 Hz opto group received photostimulation the evening prior to sucrose exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were acquired with a HEKA four channels amplifier with integrated acquisition board. Data were sampled at 10 kHz. Patchmaster (WaveMetrix) was used as acquisition software. Analysis was performed with custom procedures in Igor (WaveMetrix), Matlab, and Clampfit (Molecular Devices). For two-group comparisons (paired and unpaired), we used estimation statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ho et al., 2019</xref>) to report the effect size and calculate the 95% confidence interval of the mean difference via bootstrap resampling (5000 resamples). Graphic visualization of the data includes the group mean and 95% confidence interval, swarm plots of individual data values, and histograms of the resampling distribution of the difference in the means. Multiple comparisons were assessed with One-Way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Tukey HSD post-hoc tests. Cumulative distributions were compared using the 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. Rank order correlation analysis was used to determine correlations between IEG expression and sucrose consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), BLA-EPSC/BLA-EPSP amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, input/output function), and plasticity and PPR, CV, or Decay tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). For plasticity induction experiments, differences between BLA-EPSC amplitude, PPR, and CV were assessed in the 10 min baseline period and in the 10 min period 30–40 min post-induction. Differences in probability of LTD vs. LTP induction following CTA were assessed with a 3 × 2 χ<sup>2</sup> for contingency test. Significant differences were considered for p&lt;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Solutions</title><p>ACSF contained the following (mM): 126 NaCl, 3 KCl, 25 NaHCO3, 1 NaHPO4, 2 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 14 dextrose with an osmolarity of 315-325mOsm.

interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper investigates the cellular basis of conditioned taste aversion, the avoidance of a taste that previously produced malaise. The authors first show that optogenetic stimulation of basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons produces long-term synaptic depression. They then paired the delivery of the taste with this same optogenetic BLA stimulation, and report that rats develop conditioned taste aversion just as if the taste had been paired with an emesis-inducing stimulus. Thus, for the first time, this paper identifies circuitry and synaptic plasticity that underlies the affective dimension of a sensory stimulus.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;LTD at amygdalocortical synapses as a novel mechanism for hedonic learning&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Donald B Katz (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the Maffei lab brings a combination of slice recordings, behavior, and immunohistochemistry to bear light on the nature of conditioned taste aversion-related plasticity. They first show that CTA decreases overall activity levels of gustatory cortical (GC) neurons, and then go on to provide several pieces of evidence supporting the suggestion that this decrease may be a function of learning-related LTD at amygdala-cortical synapses. Finally, and in the manuscript's fanfare moment, they show that rats get CTAs when the same optogenetic stimulation of BLA neurons that causes learning-appropriate LTD is paired with taste delivery as a substitute for emesis. The results are intriguing and will be of broad interest to those who study synaptic plasticity, amygdala, and the control of taste preference.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Throughout the paper, the authors report numbers of slices and numbers of animals, however it appears that the slice number is the variable used at least in Figure 6, where the animal N=2. Since the independent variable in the experiment is at the level of the animal, not the slice (i.e. taste aversion training vs. no aversion training), the appropriate n is the animal number, not the slice number (if several slices/cells were used, then those from a single animal can be averaged to make a single animal N). In slice experiments where the manipulation affects only the slice (e.g., if a drug were added to a slice compared to slices receiving vehicle; in this case, the animals were treated identically), it is appropriate to use slice number as the n. The statistics in the paper should be re-calculated with this consideration in mind, and in some figures such as Figure 6, more experiments will be required.</p><p>2) There were concerns about the key experiment in which CTA was caused by a pairing of taste with BLA stimulation. Further experiments would nail down more thoroughly the mechanistic aspects and/or controls.</p><p>First, the interpretation of this experiment relies on the assumption that associative plasticity was caused by pairing of the inputs. This interpretation would be greatly strengthened by an additional control group, in which it is shown that learning is not caused by NON-CONTINGENT stimulation of rats infected with the ChR2-Venus virus.</p><p>Secondly, the connection between the LTD protocol in vitro and the modification of taste preference would be strengthened if the authors made more of a connection, perhaps showing that a drug that blocks the LTD also prevents the modulation of taste preference. At least it seems important to do other control behavioral tests to provide more evidence that links the plasticity to learning the aversion. Is it possible the animals can't taste sucrose as well or don't find it as palatable when the 20Hz stimuli are used? Or are unable to respond for some other reason? Do other tastants work?</p><p>The reviewers felt that one of these experiments would have the potential to change or cement the results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55175.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Throughout the paper, the authors report numbers of slices and numbers of animals, however it appears that the slice number is the variable used at least in Figure 6, where the animal N=2.

To address this, where appropriate, we have averaged cells from individual animals and reassessed statistical significance using the number of animals. Additional experiments have been performed to increase the number of animals for the data presented in Figure 6. With one exception (BLA-EPSP amplitude, Figure 4D, which now shows a trend) the effects we report remain statistically significant when calculated at the level of the animal instead of the cell. In addition to standard statistical testing, we have also reevaluated our data using estimation statistics (Ho et al., 2019), a method that provides additional information on the effect size and confidence values. We now show estimation plots overlapped to our bar graph and we report confidence intervals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There were concerns about the key experiment in which CTA was caused by a pairing of taste with BLA stimulation.

To address this, we added a set of experiments in which the phasic 20Hz pattern of optogenetic stimulation of BLA axons was delivered non-contingent to sucrose consumption. The data are now reported in Figure 6E. We show that non-contingent stimulation does not affect sucrose palatability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, the connection between the LTD protocol in vitro and the modification of taste preference would be strengthened if the authors made more of a connection, perhaps showing that a drug that blocks the LTD also prevents the modulation of taste preference.

Blocking LTD in GC using a pharmacological approach is currently not feasible, as the cellular mechanisms for this form of plasticity in this brain region are not well understood and we cannot predict the site of action of a drug infused directly in GC at the moment. However, in our previous study (Haley, Fontanini and Maffei, 2016), we examined the effect of phasic and tonic stimulation of BLA afferents. The manuscript focused on BLA-GC connectivity and on how the circuit in GC is recruited by the phasic and tonic patterns of optogenetic stimulation used to induce plasticity in the current study.</p><p>Based on our plasticity induction experiments, we know the ramp stimulus induced a form of LTD that differed from the 20Hz protocol and was not affected by CTA. To address the reviewers’ comment, we have performed an additional set of experiments in which the ramp stimulus was delivered in GC following exposure to sucrose. Association of sucrose with ramp stimulation of BLA terminal fields in GC did not affect sucrose preference in the 2-bottle test. These data are now presented in Figure 6F. These results demonstrate that LTD induced by phasic stimulation of BLA-GC afferents is sufficient to change sucrose palatability, while LTD induced by tonic BLA-GC input does not.</p></body></sub-article></article>
