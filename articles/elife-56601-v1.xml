Hyperalignment captures shared information by projecting pattern vectors for neural responses and connectivities into a common, high-dimensional information space, rather than by aligning topographies in a canonical anatomical space. Individual transformation matrices project information from individual anatomical spaces into the common model information space, preserving the geometry of pairwise dissimilarities between pattern vectors, and model cortical topography as mixtures of overlapping, individual-specific topographic basis functions, rather than as contiguous functional areas. The fundamental property of brain function that is preserved across brains is information content, rather than the functional properties of local features that support that content.

The introduction of multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data (MVPA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Haxby, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Haxby et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Haxby et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Haxby et al., 2001</xref>) revealed that information can be decoded from fine-grained patterns of cortical activity (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bzdok, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Haynes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Haynes and Rees, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Hebart and Baker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Norman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Pereira et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Tong and Pratte, 2012</xref>). Study of cortical functional connectivity also has revealed fine-grained topographies in the connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arcaro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Haak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Heinzle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jbabdi et al., 2013</xref>) that are closely related to these patterns of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Guntupalli et al., 2018</xref>). In the context of fMRI, fine-scale granularity in cortical patterns in fMRI data refers to voxel-by-voxel (or vertex-by-vertex) variation in response and connectivity profiles. Even finer-scale variation exists at the level of columns and neighboring neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Leopold et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Park et al., 2017</xref>). The surface structure of functional cortical topographies, however, shows considerable variability across individual brains for encoding the same information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cox and Savoy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Guntupalli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Haxby et al., 2011</xref>). We introduced a novel conceptual framework that models both the shared information encoded in fine-grained functional topographies and individual-specific topographic idiosyncrasies. This framework, ‘hyperalignment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Guntupalli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Guntupalli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Haxby et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Xu et al., 2012</xref>), encompasses a family of computational algorithms that align shared information in a common, high-dimensional information space, rather than attempting to align functional topographies in the physical space of cortical anatomy to a canonical topography. Hyperalignment derives from the term hyperspace, to convey the paradigm shift from modeling cortical functional architecture in a three-dimensional anatomical space to modeling the information encoded in functional architecture in a high-dimensional information space. This common information space captures the ‘deep structure’ of shared information that is encoded in the variable ‘surface structure’ of idiosyncratic topographies in individual brains.</p><p>Hyperalignment algorithms construct the common information space and calculate transformations that project individually-variable patterns of neural activity and connectivity into this common model space. Information is contained in the relationships among pattern vectors – distinctions and similarities – and these relationships are preserved when the space is transformed from an individual cortical space to the common information space. In these transformations, the features that define the space in individual brains – response tuning functions and connectivity profiles – are remixed to support the same information structure with shared basis functions. Thus, in the conceptual framework of our computational model, the fundamental property of brain function that is preserved is information content, and the functional properties of local features that support that content are mutable and secondary.</p><p>Our computational framework introduces a new model of cortical functional architecture. Shared information is decomposed into overlapping basis functions that are instantiated in individual brains with idiosyncratic topographies. Cortical patterns of activity and connectivity are modeled as mixtures of these topographic basis functions. Our common model accounts for coarse areal structure insofar as the model’s shared basis set for fine-scale topographies can be mixed to identify the boundaries for functional areas in individual brains, but the topographic information embedded in the model’s shared bases is not strongly constrained by these areal boundaries, suggesting that areal structure may play a smaller role in how information is organized in cortex than was previously believed.</p><p>Here we present the fundamental concepts that underlie this approach to modeling cortical functional architecture, as well as the computational underpinnings for deriving the common information space and modeling idiosyncratic cortical topographies. We review the effectiveness and significance of these methods, their potential for increasing the sensitivity of inquiry into individual differences, and discuss the implications of this conceptual framework for understanding cortical functional architecture.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Key concept: High-dimensional information spaces</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Vector space representation of cortical patterns</title><p>Cortical functional patterns can be represented as vectors corresponding to locations in a high-dimensional vector space where each dimension is a local measurement or element of that pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Haxby et al., 2014</xref>). Instead of representing cortical function as a topographic spatial map in the three-dimensional physical space of the cortex (or a two-dimensional representation of the cortical sheet), hyperalignment models the information embedded in cortical function in this high-dimensional space (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Durbin and Mitchison, 1990</xref>). For fMRI data, local pattern elements are typically voxels (or vertices on the cortical surface). Patterns of neural activity measured with single-unit recording, electrocorticography (ECoG), or electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG and MEG) can also be analyzed as pattern vectors in cortical or subcortical feature spaces in which each dimension may be a single neuron, an electrode, or a dipole, magnetic field sensor, or magnetic source. The relevance of the hyperalignment conceptual framework for modeling cortical functional architecture is not specific to any measurement modality or neural variable, and the computational procedures can also be applied to data matrices obtained with other measurement modalities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2020</xref>) or even artificial neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Lu et al., 2019</xref>).

The row vectors may be patterns of activity at different points in time or response patterns recovered from multiple instances of a given event or experimental manipulation (using trial averaging or deconvolution) and serve as indices of the brain state corresponding to a given stimulus or cognitive state. These row vectors also may be patterns of functional connectivities between each cortical locus in a field and a locus, or connectivity target, elsewhere in the brain. Thus, the information space is populated by response pattern vectors or connectivity pattern vectors. We refer to the response or connectivity magnitudes for a given cortical location (i.e., a column in the data matrix) as a functional profile.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Transformation of data in individual brain coordinate space into common information space coordinates.</title><p>An individual brain data matrix in cortical space (<italic>B<sub>i</sub></italic>) consists of <italic>j</italic> rows of patterns (t) with <italic>k</italic> columns of cortical loci (v).

These dissimilarities index the distinctiveness of each vector relative to other vectors; vectors that are more similar to each other are located nearer to each other in vector space. This geometric framework for operationalizing information as the relationships among distributed patterns in a vector space is used in a variety of fields, including psychology (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Edelman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shepard, 1987</xref>), information retrieval (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Salton et al., 1975</xref>), and natural language processing (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deerwester et al., 1990</xref>). The set of vectors in individual information spaces can be analyzed as the geometry of those vectors, namely the set of pairwise distances between vectors. The vector geometry of information in cortical spaces is highly similar across brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Connolly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Connolly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Connolly et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Diedrichsen and Kriegeskorte, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Guntupalli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Guntupalli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Kriegeskorte and Kievit, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Nastase et al., 2017</xref>). Prior to hyperalignment, these functional pattern vectors are instantiated in the spatially organized cortical topography of a given individual. Hyperalignment leverages the inter-individual similarity of vector geometry to create a shared information space that minimizes differences between corresponding vectors across individuals while preserving vector geometry.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Hyperalignment: Joint modeling of a common information space and idiosyncratic topographies</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>A common, high-dimensional information space</title><p>The cortical feature spaces for individual brains are difficult to compare because of the inter-individual variability of topographic surface structure. The goal of hyperalignment is to create a common information space in which the vectors that encode information that is shared across brains – representations of the same stimulus or cognitive process, functional connections to other cortical fields – are aligned. Note that the goal is not simply to align the cortical patterns that carry that information in a two- or three-dimensional anatomical space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conroy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sabuncu et al., 2010</xref>). The columns of data matrices in the common model space are the coordinate axes or dimensions for that information space. The rows of data matrices in the common space contain cortical information patterns that have been projected into the model space from individual data matrices. The solution to this problem requires finding individual-specific transformations, <italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic>, that project individual data matrices, <italic>B<sub>i</sub></italic>, in which the coordinate axes are cortical locations, into a common model coordinate space, in such a way that minimizes inter-individual differences among pattern vectors that represent the same perceptual, cognitive, or connectivity information. This is accomplished by minimizing the difference between patterns in the transformed individual data matrices, <italic>B<sub>i</sub>R<sub>i</sub></italic>, and the group mean patterns, <italic>M</italic>.

The transformation matrices have the same structure whether derived from response profiles or connectivity profiles. These weights model how shared information can be instantiated in idiosyncratic fine-grained cortical functional topographies.</p><p>The number of dimensions in the common space (<italic>m</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) can differ from the number of cortical loci in the data matrices (<italic>k</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) from which the space is derived. In some implementations, the number of model dimensions matches the number of cortical loci in a ‘reference brain’, allowing patterns in the model space to be illustrated in the reference brain anatomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Guntupalli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Guntupalli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Haxby et al., 2011</xref>). In other implementations, the model space is reduced to capture shared information in a smaller number of dimensions and reduce noise or overfitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Guntupalli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Haxby et al., 2011</xref>). Patterns in reduced dimension model spaces can be illustrated by projection into the anatomy of individual brains, using the transposes of individual transformation matrices, <italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic><sup>T</sup>.</p><p>The goal of the common information space is to align cortical pattern vectors across individuals while preserving the geometry of those vectors. The coordinate axes for that space – the model dimensions – carry information in the form of shared functional profiles (response tuning vectors or functional connectivity vectors), but they can be arbitrarily rotated, preserving vector geometry while altering the response tuning and connectivity profiles for the coordinate axes. Thus, the information associated with each common model dimension serves only to preserve the information encoded in vector geometry, shifting attention from the traditional focus on univariate response and connectivity profiles for single cortical loci to the vector geometry of distributed population responses and population connectivity that span a cortical field. The individual transformation matrices afford projecting individual data embedded in idiosyncratic cortical topographies into the common space and, conversely, projecting group data embedded in the common space into the cortical topographies of individual brains.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Methods for deriving transformation matrices</title><p>There are various ways to derive transformations that minimize residuals around group mean functional patterns. We have concentrated on using our adaptation of the Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gower, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Guntupalli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Guntupalli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Haxby et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schönemann, 1966</xref>) to derive the transformation matrices. The Procrustes transformation is the orthogonal matrix that minimizes the distances between two matrices of paired vectors with a rigid rotation, which is ‘improper’ in that it allows reflections as well as rotations. GPA finds transformation matrices for a group of data matrices that minimize distances by iteratively aligning each new matrix to the mean of previously aligned matrices. A rigid rotation preserves all pairwise distances between pattern vectors within each original matrix.

Consequently, a study of local function with hyperaligned data requires projecting individual data into one subject’s cortical anatomy, referred to as the reference subject. Other subjects’ data in a cortical field in the reference subject’s anatomical space are idiosyncratic mixtures of vertices from the same cortical field, anatomically-defined, as well as nearby vertices. Thus, data that is more similar to other subjects’ data in a given cortical field is retained and imported from nearby cortex, whereas data that is more similar to that of others’ data in nearby cortical fields is resampled out and into those other locations. The result of this resampling of information into and out of cortical fields is that the local individual information spaces in cortical fields are more consistent across brains, as evidenced, for example, by higher intersubject correlations of local vector geometry. Using a different subject’s anatomy as the reference results in similar alignment of local information spaces with a different distribution of how information spaces vary across cortical fields.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Reducing the dimensionality of the common model space</title><p>The functional profiles of cortical loci are often redundant, and the information encoded in the vector geometry for a given cortical field may be lower-dimensional than the number of constituent cortical loci.

Connectivity targets can be the responses for a single location (e.g., a cortical vertex), the mean response time-series for a cortical area or searchlight, or one or more component of the time-series in a cortical area after decomposition (e.g., using PCA). Once individual connectivity matrices are calculated, connectivity hyperalignment proceeds in the same way as response hyperalignment. Iteratively repeating connectivity hyperalignment allows connectivity target time-series to be rearranged and recalculated. Whereas response hyperalignment depends on response pattern vectors in experimental data that are locked to stimuli, connectivity hyperalignment depends on connectivity vectors for a defined set of connectivity targets and does not require a common stimulus paradigm, affording hyperalignment of resting state data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Guntupalli et al., 2018</xref>) or across different experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Nastase et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>For a cortical field, the pattern of functional connectivity to a target can be thought of as a population connectivity vector, analogous to thinking of the pattern of activity evoked by a stimulus as a population response vector. Thus, while response hyperalignment aligns population responses across brains, preserving vector geometry of representation, connectivity hyperalignment aligns population connectivity vectors across brains, preserving their vector geometry. These two algorithms, however, mostly converge, both producing a high-dimensional common model space with individual transformation matrices that project individual anatomical spaces into a model space.

For connectivity hyperalignment, the sampling of connectivity vector space is defined by the selection of connectivity targets, but the richness and reliability of connectivity estimates depends on the variety of brain states over which connectivity is estimated.</p><p>We have shown that a common model space based on transformation matrices derived from responses to naturalistic audiovisual movies has general validity across a variety of experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Guntupalli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Haxby et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Nastase et al., 2017</xref>).

Such stimuli evoke a rich variety of brain states involving multiple coordinated systems for visual and auditory perception, perception of dynamic action, narrative, and speech, memory, attention, semantic knowledge, and social cognition. Movies are engineered to be engaging and guide attention. Movies also build a rich set of expectations for upcoming stimuli and events affording strong predictions (and prediction errors). Controlled experiments, on the other hand, typically randomize trial order, deliberately decontextualizing each event and providing no basis for accurate prediction. Consequently, randomization of trial order nullifies the utility of neural information processing related to the formation and application of predictive coding, making prediction-related activity weak and inconsistent across brains. In a comparison of between-subject multivariate pattern classification (bsMVPC) of responses to dynamic stimuli in movies to bsMVPC of responses to static stimuli in controlled experiments, with the structure of these analyses carefully matched to allow meaningful comparison, bsMVPC accuracies in ventral temporal extrastriate visual cortex for naturalistic, dynamic stimuli were twice that for unpredictable static stimuli (Supplemental Figure 4A in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Haxby et al., 2011</xref>), indicating a substantial advantage of these stimuli for evoking distinctive brain states.</p><p>A common model space also can be built by estimating transformation matrices from fMRI data collected in the resting state (rs-fMRI) using connectivity hyperalignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Guntupalli et al., 2016</xref>).

Procrustes-based hyperalignment preserves local vector geometry with rigid rotation of the high-dimensional pattern vectors. Indeed, ROI hyperalignment does not change the vector geometry for each individual and, therefore, has no effect on ISC of vector geometry. Searchlight hyperalignment, by contrast, resamples information into and out of local cortical fields, thereby increasing the similarity of local information content across subjects. The size of the increase suggests this is a large effect and that the dissimilarity of vector geometry for overlapping cortical fields is substantial.

All of the validation tests described in the previous sections derived the common model spaces and transformation matrices using data that were independent of the data used to test bsMVPC or ISC of response profiles, connectivity profiles, and vector geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kriegeskorte et al., 2009</xref>). For movie data, this involved using data from different parts of the movie for model derivation and validation. For the resting state, model derivation and validation were performed on different resting state sessions. The generalizability of the validity of common model spaces based on naturalistic movie viewing and the resting state also extends to experiments with very different structure. For example, bsMVPC of responses to still images of objects, faces, and animals after data were projected into a common space based on responses to a movie was equivalent to or better than within-subject MVPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Guntupalli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Haxby et al., 2011</xref>). Higher bsMVPC than within-subject MVPC of hyperaligned data demonstrated the added power of using large multi-subject data sets for training a pattern classifier, which hyperalignment makes possible. Similarly, ISC of representational geometry for responses to brief video clips of different categories of animals performing different actions were greatly increased after data were projected into a common space based on responses to a continuous movie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Nastase et al., 2017</xref>).

Response hyperalignment of movie data increased mean intersubject correlation of connectivity profiles from 0.15 to 0.58, relative to anatomical alignment, but ISC of connectivity profiles are even higher after connectivity hyperalignment (mean ISC = 0.67). Connectivity hyperalignment of the same data increased mean intersubject correlation of representational geometry from 0.21 to 0.31 and bsMVPC of movie time segments from 1.0% to 10.4%, relative to anatomical alignment. Response hyperalignment, however, produced even higher ISC of representational geometry (mean ISC = 0.32) and bsMVPC accuracies (mean = 13.7%). Thus, aligning shared representational vector geometry also aligns connectivity vector geometry, but this response-based hyperalignment of connectivity, and the underlying group mean connectivity basis functions associated with model dimensions, is suboptimal. Similarly, aligning shared connectivity vector geometry also aligns representational vector geometry, but connectivity-based representational alignment, and the underlying group mean response tuning basis functions associated with model dimensions, is suboptimal.

The first eigenvector is defined as the axis along which variance is maximal, the second eigenvector is the orthogonal axis along which the residual variance is maximal, and so forth. Thus, PCA rotates the space to account for variance most efficiently, rather than rotating the space to fit axes to a priori functional distinctions. Applying PCA to the model space for ventral temporal cortex, developed based on patterns of activity evoked by a naturalistic movie, revealed that approximately 35 principal components (PCs) were sufficient to account for the information content of one hour of the movie, as indexed by bsMVPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Haxby et al., 2011</xref>). This PCA allows evaluation of the roles played by dimensions defined a priori by functional distinctions relative to the information that is captured by the full model in which both coarse-grained and fine-grained topographies can be modeled as mixtures of topographic basis functions. Comparison of the topographies for the top PCs with the topography for face versus object category selective areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>), shows that this functional distinction does not emerge as one of the top dimensions but only as a mixture of PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref> rightmost images), raising the question of how large a role it plays in the functional topography of ventral temporal cortex under naturalistic conditions.</p><p>We defined an a priori dimension with the contrast between responses to faces and objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Haxby et al., 2011</xref>), calculated as a linear discriminant in the model space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>).

Although this animacy continuum dimension accounts for over 50% of variance in the responses to still images of animals and objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sha et al., 2015</xref>), it accounts for only 6% of variance in responses to the movie.

From these pairwise comparisons we constructed a matrix of dissimilarities between all pairs of brains – an individual differences matrix (IDM). IDMs can be constructed based on response patterns or on functional connectivity patterns. Surprisingly, even though hyperalignment makes individual differences much smaller, as expected, the residual differences are substantially more reliable across independent data samples than those based on anatomically aligned data, and this increased reliability can be attributed to individual differences in the information encoded in fine-scale topographies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b</xref>). The reliabilities of individual differences based on coarse-scale topographies are effectively equivalent for anatomically-aligned and hyperaligned data, whereas the individual differences based on residual data in fine-scale topographies are markedly more reliable for hyperaligned data than for anatomically-aligned data.

The information space is typically reduced to a small number of dimensions (four in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Huth et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The conceptual framework that we review uses hyperalignment to model cortical function by aligning the information represented in population responses in a common, high-dimensional information space. This framework does not align the cortical topographic patterns in a canonical anatomical topography. Information is defined computationally as the distances between population response vectors, which index reliable distinctions and similarities. By aligning response vectors from different subjects’ idiosyncratic topographies into a single information space with shared coordinate axes, information – the distinctions and similarities among response vectors – is now supported by the same basis functions across brains.</p><p>This computational framework can also be applied to functional connectivity data, replacing population response pattern vectors with topographic patterns of connectivities to a target, essentially a population connectivity vector. By aligning population connectivity vectors in a common information space, the connectivity profiles for each dimension in this space are markedly more similar across brains than are connectivity profiles for anatomically-aligned cortical loci. Not surprisingly, transformation matrices based on connectivity hyperalignment also align response pattern vectors, affording improved bsMVPC and higher ISCs of representational geometry.</p><p>Hyperalignment also models the idiosyncratic topographies in individual brains that carry shared information. Using the weights in individual transformation matrices for cortical loci as basis functions, a pattern vector in the common model space predicts a different topographic pattern in each brain. Boundaries for functional regions can be estimated in individual brains with high fidelity based on other subjects’ data, but the one-dimensional linear discriminants that define these regions account for only a small portion of the variance in cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli, indicating that they play a minor role. Functional topographies are modeled more comprehensively by our model, which posits a high-dimensional set of overlapping topographic basis functions.</p><sec id="s8-1"><title>Rebalancing the roles of information content in neural populations and the functional profiles of individual units</title><p>The conceptual framework for hyperalignment is predicated on the hypothesis that information content that is shared across brains is instantiated in varied, idiosyncratic population codes. Hyperalignment models shared information by preserving the interrelations among pattern vectors – vector geometry – in a common information space while remixing the functional profiles of constituent dimensions – response tuning and functional connectivity profiles – thereby reshaping the functional profiles of the units in cortical patterns. Thus, the functional profiles of individual units are modeled as secondary to the information content that they support as populations. The commonality across brains is not modeled as common functional profiles of the individual units or as a common spatial distribution of functional profiles.</p><p>Traditionally, neuroscientists have focused on the tuning and connectivity profiles of individual units – neurons or voxels – and the information in population responses is modeled as a secondary consequence of the aggregation of those profiles (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gross et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Hubel and Wiesel, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Huth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Huth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Kay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kiani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sheinberg and Logothetis, 2001</xref>). The preservation of information content in vector geometry over variations in the functional profiles of individual units, however, suggests that the unit profiles are shaped to support the geometry, not that the vector geometry is merely a reflection of unit profiles.</p><p>Understanding how unit profiles can be shaped to support the requisite (and shared) population information is a matter that requires further theoretical work and experimental validation. Unit profiles clearly develop with experience and show a perplexing complexity and variety when considered in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Çukur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kiani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sheinberg and Logothetis, 2001</xref>), especially responses and connectivity in studies with naturalistic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Çukur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">McMahon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Park et al., 2017</xref>). Tuning functions of varying levels of coarseness – responses to related stimuli – support similarity of population responses and connectivity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kiani et al., 2007</xref>) and, consequently, pattern vector geometries. Relationships reflected in similarity of responses can be due to shared perceptual features or cognitive factors such as agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Connolly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Thorat et al., 2019</xref>) and action goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Nastase et al., 2017</xref>). The relationships reflected in representational geometry differ by cortical field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borghesani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Freiwald and Tsao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Guntupalli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Guntupalli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2017</xref>), and these differences reflect processing or the disentangling of target information from confounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DiCarlo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DiCarlo and Cox, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Kriegeskorte and Kievit, 2013</xref>). The topographic organization of units with particular functional profiles may arise over the course of development and with varying experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arcaro et al., 2017</xref>). These functional profiles may in fact fluctuate over time despite retaining the information encoded at the population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gallego et al., 2020</xref>). The functional profiles of individual units need not be easily-interpretable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Ponce et al., 2019</xref>). Differences in vector geometry across cortical fields in a processing system are supported by different configurations of tuning profiles of individual units. The composition of varied response profiles in populations, therefore, is shaped to create the varied information spaces that are required in a processing system, a learning process that may rest on feedback among the cortical fields in the system. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide a computational instantiation of a learning process guided by feedback that produces varied sets of individual units that perform the same functions. Like cortical systems, the individual features of CNNs vary based on initialization and network architecture, but the similarity structure of feature vectors reveals commonality of layer-specific information content across these variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kornblith et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s8-2"><title>Cortical functional architecture is a degenerate system</title><p>The contrast between a common deep structure for information that is instantiated in variable surface structure has a parallel in language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chomsky, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hockett, 1958</xref>). The same meaning can be conveyed linguistically with substantial variation in wording and sentence structure, including the words and syntax of different languages. Analogous to the variable surface structure of language and the deep structure of meaning in linguistic communication, the variable surface structure of cortical topographies affords representation of shared deep information structure.</p><p>More broadly, the conceptual framework of hyperalignment models a property of cortical functional architecture that is a ubiquitous property of complex biological systems, namely ‘degeneracy’ – ‘the ability of elements that are structurally different to perform the same function or yield the same output’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Edelman and Gally, 2001</xref>). Degeneracy is a property of systems that evolve or develop or learn and are characterized by complex interactions among constituent elements. By contrast, designed systems usually try to avoid unplanned interactions. Unplanned interactions in degenerate systems allow unexpected new functions to emerge or to be learned. Different instantiations of elements that perform the same or similar functions may be differentially adaptive to changing demands, providing a basis for evolution. Degeneracy is characteristic of systems at all levels of biological organization from genetics to body movements and language. Hyperalignment models how the variable structural elements of functional cortical architecture – local neural responses and point-to-point functional connectivities – perform similar functions in aggregate for representation and processing of information and provides a basis for studying variations in instantiations of these functions, which are the basis for diversity in cognitive abilities.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s9" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing
