This study defines the precise positions of T7 helicase and T7 DNAP at the replication fork junction with single-base resolution to create a structural model that explains the mutual stimulation of activities. Our 2-aminopurine studies show that helicase and polymerase both participate in DNA melting, but each enzyme melts the junction base pair partially. When combined, the junction base pair is melted cooperatively provided the helicase is located one nucleotide ahead of the primer-end. The synergistic shift in equilibrium of junction base pair melting by combined enzymes explains the cooperativity, wherein helicase stimulates the polymerase by promoting dNTP binding (decreasing dNTP K<sub>m</sub>), polymerase stimulates the helicase by increasing the unwinding rate-constant (k<sub>cat</sub>), consequently the combined enzymes unwind DNA with kinetic parameters resembling enzymes translocating on single-stranded DNA.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06562.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06562.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06562.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA replication is the process whereby a molecule of DNA is copied to form two identical molecules. First, an enzyme called a DNA helicase separates the two strands of the DNA double helix. This forms a structure called a replication fork that has two exposed single strands. Other enzymes called DNA polymerases then use each strand as a template to build a new matching DNA strand.</p><p>DNA polymerases build the new DNA strands by joining together smaller molecules called nucleotides. One of the new DNA strands—called the ‘leading strand’—is built continuously, while the other—the ‘lagging strand’—is made as a series of short fragments that are later joined together. Building the leading strand requires the helicase and DNA polymerase to work closely together. However, it was not clear how these two enzymes coordinate their activity.</p><p>Now, Nandakumar et al. have studied the helicase and DNA polymerase from a virus that infects bacteria and have pinpointed the exact positions of the enzymes at a replication fork. The experiments revealed that both the polymerase and helicase contribute to the separating of the DNA strands, and that this process is most efficient when the helicase is only a single nucleotide ahead of the polymerase.</p><p>Further experiments showed that the helicase stimulates the polymerase by helping it to bind to nucleotides, and that the polymerase stimulates the helicase by helping it to separate the DNA strands at a faster rate. The next challenge is to investigate the molecular setup that allows the helicase and polymerase to increase each other's activities.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06562.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06562.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>2-aminopurine</kwd><kwd>presteady state kinetics</kwd><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd>DNA polymerase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM55310</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>Smita S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A detailed model of the T7 replisome with the precise positions of the helicase and polymerase at the replication fork explains how catalysis by the two enzymes is coordinated.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Replicative helicases and DNA polymerases (DNAPs) are not efficient at unwinding the duplex DNA when they are working independently. The unwinding rates are slower than their translocation rates on single-stranded (ss) DNA and slower than the rates of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delagoutte and von Hippel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galletto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lionnet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donmez and Patel, 2008</xref>). Moreover, the unwinding rates of isolated helicases decrease steeply with increasing GC percentage in the duplex DNA, therefore, assisting forces that destabilize the junction base pairs stimulate the helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galletto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lionnet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donmez and Patel, 2008</xref>). However, in the presence of an actively synthesizing replicative DNAP, the unwinding rates of the helicase become fast and GC independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delagoutte and von Hippel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manosas et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pandey and Patel, 2014</xref>). Similarly, replicative DNAPs on their own have limited strand displacement synthesis activity, restricted to 4–6 base pairs in T7 DNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yuan and McHenry, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pandey and Patel, 2014</xref>). The isolated DNAPs often stall and move backward to excise the nascent DNA using their proofreading exonuclease activity when faced with downstream duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Manosas et al., 2012a</xref>). The presence of helicase or single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) inhibits processive excision of the nascent DNA and allows DNAP to catalyze fast and processive strand displacement synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manosas et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pandey and Patel, 2014</xref>). Originally identified in prokaryotic systems (T7, T4 bacteriophage, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>), this functional coupling between the helicase and DNAP is found also in eukaryotic replication systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Several models have attempted to explain the functional coupling between replicative helicases and DNAPs. The underlying theme of the helicase only unwinding models is that the helicase unwinds the duplex DNA creating ssDNA template for the DNAP and the DNAP traps the displaced ssDNA through DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delagoutte and von Hippel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stano et al., 2005</xref>). Recent studies of bacteriophage T7 and T4 DNAPs suggest alternative models indicating that DNAP aids the helicase by destabilizing the first few base pairs of the double-stranded (ds) DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Manosas et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2012b</xref>). Exonuclease mapping showed that T7 DNAP is located with the T7 helicase in close proximity to the fork junction and in a position to influence the junction base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pandey and Patel, 2014</xref>). To understand functional coupling between helicase and DNAP, we need to understand the basic mechanism of DNA unwinding by each enzyme. Although the mechanism of replicative DNAPs is well characterized on ssDNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Patel et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doublie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Delagoutte, 2012</xref>), there is little known about the mechanism of DNA unwinding-synthesis on duplex DNA template. Similarly, there are no structures of replisomes with the exception of a small angle X-Ray scattering structure of the T7 helicase-T7 DNAP bound to ssDNA and primer template DNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kulczyk et al., 2012</xref>). However, the low-resolution structure in the absence of a replication fork DNA does not provide the location of the DNAP and helicase at the replication fork junction to understand which enzyme is involved in melting the base pair at the fork junction.</p><p>In addition to structural questions such as the positioning of the helicase and DNAP at the replication fork, many aspects of the mechanism of functional coupling remain unexplored. For example, T7 and <italic>E. coli</italic> DNAPs are capable of strand displacement synthesis in the presence of SSB with rates comparable to their replication rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yuan and McHenry, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pandey and Patel, 2014</xref>). Hence, the specific role of the helicase in stimulating the synthesis activity of DNAP remains unclear. As combined enzymes, T7 helicase and T7 DNAP exhibit highly coordinated catalysis, whereby helicase hydrolyzes one dNTP for every dNMP incorporated by the DNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pandey and Patel, 2014</xref>). This implies that the two enzymes coordinate their steps of nucleotide binding (2′-deoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate (dTTP) binding to T7 helicase and dNTP binding to T7 DNAP) and catalysis (dTTP hydrolysis and dNMP incorporation), but there is no model that explains how these steps are coupled between the two enzymes during active leading strand synthesis.</p><p>The studies in this paper use a combination of 2-aminopurine (2-AP) fluorescence and transient-state kinetics to investigate the unwinding mechanisms of T7 DNAP and T7 helicase as isolated enzymes and as combined enzymes. The kinetics indicates that DNAP and helicase use different mechanisms to unwind DNA, but the mechanisms when coupled generate an efficient replisome. In the replisome, T7 DNAP stimulates the helicase by increasing the unwinding <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>, and T7 helicase stimulates the DNAP by decreasing the dNTPs <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>. The 2-AP studies probe DNA melting with single base pair resolution and show that the isolated enzymes are not as efficient at melting the fork junction as compared to the combined enzymes. However, T7 DNAP with its ability to melt two base pairs ahead of the primer-end positions T7 helicase two nucleotides ahead with efficient and synergistic melting of the junction base pair. Overall, these studies provide both kinetic and structural basis to understand how helicase and polymerase mutually stimulate each other's activities during leading strand synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We have used 40 bp preformed replication fork substrates to measure the base pair unwinding rates using stopped-flow fluorescence based real-time assay.

The fluorescence intensity of fluorescein-labeled lagging strand is quenched by BHQ1 when the DNA is duplexed, but when the lagging strand is unwound by T7 DNAP + <italic>E. coli</italic> SSB the fluorescence intensity increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We find that T7 DNAP on its own does not unwind the 40 bp replication fork at fast rates, which is consistent with our previously reported gel-based studies showing T7 DNAP stalling after 4–6 base pairs synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pandey and Patel, 2014</xref>) and this can be overcome by adding SSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pandey and Patel, 2014</xref>). Indeed, T7 DNAP fully unwinds the fork DNA with <italic>E. coli</italic> SSB in the reactions. Note that we can replace <italic>E. coli</italic> SSB with T7 gp2.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Myers and Romano, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakai and Richardson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pandey and Patel, 2014</xref>). However, we have used <italic>E. coli</italic> SSB because of its higher affinity for ssDNA (0.1–10 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Molineux et al., 1975</xref>), requiring lower amounts of SSB for the same degree of stimulation as with T7 gp2.5 (200 nM SSB vs 3 μM T7 gp2.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The <italic>E. coli</italic> SSB does not unwind DNA on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>In these experiments, T7 DNAP and <italic>E. coli</italic> SSB were preassembled on the fork DNA, and DNA unwinding was initiated with dNTPs and Mg(II) in a stopped-flow instrument at 18°C. By preassembling the DNAP-SSB-DNA complex, we bypass the slow enzyme binding steps and synchronize the unwinding reactions. Therefore, the unwinding kinetics shows a presteady state time lag prior to fluorescence increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The lag time represents the time of unwinding, because it gets shorter when the duplex DNA to be unwound is 25 bp rather than 40 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Therefore, the kinetics were fit to the <italic>n</italic>-step model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levin et al., 2009</xref>) to extract the base pair unwinding rates (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix</xref>—Section 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). These average unwinding rates include time spent in unwinding the 40 bp fork DNA and time spent in any paused states.</p><p>The unwinding rates of T7 DNAP (with SSB) increase in a hyperbolic manner with increasing dNTPs concentrations with each of the GC forks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). At low-dNTPs concentration, the unwinding rates are GC-sensitive, but the rates reach a similarly high value at saturating dNTPs concentrations. Thus, the unwinding <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> remains nearly constant and ranges from 190 to 140 bp/s as GC percentage increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, the dNTPs <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> increases steeply from 40 μM to 270 μM as the GC percentage increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This indicates that DNA unwinding-synthesis by T7 DNAP (with SSB) is rate-limited by base pair separation at low-dNTPs concentrations, but not at high dNTPs. For comparison, when the downstream DNA is single-stranded and does not need to be melted, the dNTPs <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> is 10–20 μM and the rate of synthesis is ∼200 nt/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Patel et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stano et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the dNTPs <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> on duplex DNA template is 2–10 times higher than on ssDNA template.</p><p>The minimal mechanism of DNA synthesis contains three steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The first step is capture of the templating base (base-capture) in the insertion site of the DNAP through translocation (Pol<sub>n</sub> ⇔ Pol<sub>n</sub>.base), the second step is dNTP binding and base pairing with the templating-base (Pol<sub>n</sub>.base ⇔ Pol<sub>n</sub>.base.dNTP), and the third step is chemistry where dNMP is added, PPi is released, and the primer-end is elongated by one nucleotide (Pol<sub>n</sub>.base.dNTP ⇔ Pol<sub>n + 1</sub>). The rate vs dNTPs dependencies of all GC forks fit well to this ordered three-step mechanism (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix</xref>—Section 2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) with variable equilibrium constant for the base-capture step (<italic>K</italic><sub>1</sub>), which we find decreases steadily with increasing GC percentage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This means that the downstream DNA stability mainly affects the base-capture step, and DNAP is less efficient at capturing the templating-base when the stability of the duplex DNA is higher.

Thus, T7 helicase and T7 DNAP respond differently to increasing GC content, which indicates that their DNA-unwinding mechanisms are fundamentally different.</p><p>T7 helicase moves on DNA through sequential nucleotide hydrolysis and translocation mechanism, where each subunit of the ring takes turn in binding the incoming nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crampton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thomsen and Berger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patel et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore at any given time, only the leading subunit of T7 helicase binds an incoming dTTP and reels in the nucleotide base from the fork junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). There are three minimal steps during each base pair unwinding event. One, the leading helicase subunit binds to the nucleotide base from the fork junction (base-capture); two, the leading subunit binds to a molecule of dTTP; and three, dTTP hydrolysis and product release (2′-deoxythymidine 5′-diphosphate (dTDP) and Pi) occur at distinct subunits around the hexameric ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The order of events at the leading subunit is not known. In other words, it is not known whether base-capture by the leading subunit occurs in the dTTP-bound or dTTP-free state. Therefore, we considered all three models and our kinetic modeling shows that the rate vs dTTP data do not fit to models where dTTP binding and base-capture steps occur in a particular order (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix</xref>—Section 3 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

We show that the dTTP-bound state is slightly better at capturing the DNA-base than the dTTP-free state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), but the equilibrium constants of the base-capture steps in the dTTP-free (<italic>K</italic><sub>1</sub>) and dTTP-bound (<italic>K</italic><sub>2</sub>) states both decrease with increasing GC percentage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>), which indicates that the rate of unwinding by the helicase is limited by base pair separation even at high concentrations of dTTP.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that the DNA-unwinding activity of T7 helicase and T7 DNAP is rate-limited by inefficient base-capture at the fork junction. However, the two enzymes respond differently to increasing GC percentage, and this is because of their different kinetic mechanisms. T7 DNAP follows an ordered mechanism, wherein dNTP binding follows the base-capture step. Therefore, the kinetic outcome of increasing GC content is analogous to a pure competitive mechanism where inhibitor (GC content) increases the dNTPs <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> without affecting the unwinding <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>. T7 helicase does not follow an ordered mechanism. Consequently, the kinetic outcome of increasing GC content is analogous to a mixed inhibition mechanism where inhibitor (GC content) decreases the unwinding <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and mildly affects the dTTP <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>. Therefore, T7 DNAP is able to achieve fast rates of unwinding at high dNTPs, but this is not the case with the helicase, whose unwinding <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> remains suboptimal even at high-dTTP concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Unwinding rates of combined T7 helicase and T7 DNAP enzymes are not rate-limited by base pair separation</title><p>We used the same replication fork substrates used in the DNAP experiments to investigate the unwinding mechanism of the combined T7 helicase and T7 DNAP enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Thus, introducing a 2-AP at N + 1 results in a significant increase in fluorescence consistent with unstacking of the N + 1 base from bending of the template DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). However, there is no increase in fluorescence of 2-AP at N + 2 and a decrease is observed at N + 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), which is consistent with interactions of these template DNA-bases with the amino acids in the template-binding pocket of T7 DNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doublie et al., 1998</xref>). The change in 2-AP fluorescence at positions N + 4 and N + 5 is minimal upon DNAP binding, which indicates that T7 DNAP may not interact with these downstream positions. Thus, T7 DNAP influences only three template-bases immediately downstream from the primer-end. Experiments with 2-AP at N + 1 to N + 3 positions on the leading strand show that T7 DNAP makes similar interactions with the template-bases in replication fork substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>To determine if T7 DNAP unwinds the duplex DNA downstream of the primer-end, we introduced 2-AP at various positions in the lagging strand in the replication fork substrates. The fluorescence intensity increases upon adding T7 DNAP when 2-AP is at the N + 1, N + 2, or N + 3 base pair, but not at N + 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>—Green bars). Similarly, when 2-AP is at N + 2 and is part of the fork junction, addition of T7 DNAP increases the fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, when 2-AP is at N + 3 and is part of the fork junction, no increase in fluorescence is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>), which indicates that T7 DNAP does not melt the junction base pair three nucleotides downstream from the primer-end. The increase in 2-AP intensity at N + 3 in the internal position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) is due to N + 2 base unstacking and not from unstacking of the N + 3 base. Taken together, these results indicate that T7 DNAP binds to three template-bases downstream of primer-end and melts two base pairs.</p><p>When 2-AP experiments with T7 DNAP were carried out with <italic>E. coli</italic> SSB, the fluorescence intensity changes were much larger, although SSB by itself did not increase the 2-AP fluorescence significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results indicate that T7 DNAP on its own only partially melts the junction base pairs. Furthermore, these base pairs appear to be in dynamic equilibrium (closed ↔ open), because SSB can shift the equilibrium towards the open state by simply binding to ssDNA. This provides direct proof that T7 DNAP can melt the junction base pair, but DNAP is not efficient at preventing base pair reannealing; thus, SSB stimulates the activity of DNAP by trapping the unwound bases.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>T7 helicase unwinds only the junction base pair and follows the fork junction</title><p>The 2-AP experiments with T7 helicase were carried out in the presence of dTMPPCP, the non-hydrolyzable dTTP analog, which does not support translocation or processive DNA unwinding, but is needed for hexamer formation and DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hingorani and Patel, 1993</xref>). T7 helicase does not change the fluorescence intensity of 2-AP in ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>). However, T7 helicase increases the fluorescence of 2-AP at the fork junction, but not the second base pair from the junction, irrespective of the gap size between the primer end and fork junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>—Red bars). Thus, unlike T7 DNAP that melts two base pairs upon binding to the replication fork substrate, T7 helicase melts only the junction base pair. However, T7 helicase melts the junction base pair even when the primer-end is separated from the fork junction by more than one nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A–C</xref> compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results indicate that T7 helicase follows the fork junction and is not influenced by the position of the primer-end. Interestingly, SSB has no effect on the helicase catalyzed melting of the fork junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5D</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that SSB does not stimulate the unwinding rates of the helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donmez and Patel, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Synergistic melting of junction base pairs by T7 helicase and T7 DNAP and their precise positions at the fork junction</title><p>To investigate the effect of T7 DNAP and T7 helicase together on junction base pair melting, we measured 2-AP fluorescence after sequential addition of helicase and DNAP to the fork DNA in that order and the reverse order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>—light blue bars). The combined enzymes show a much larger increase in fluorescence intensity with 2-AP at N + 1, N + 2, or N + 3 base pairs, but not at N + 4. As shown earlier with the DNAP, the increase in N + 3 is due to N + 2 base unstacking; therefore, the results indicate that the combined enzymes melt two base pairs downstream from the primer-end, just like T7 DNAP, but more efficiently.</p><p>The 2-AP fluorescence intensity at steady state measures the equilibrium distribution of melted and annealed states of the junction base-pair. The small increase in fluorescence intensity with the isolated helicase and DNAP suggests that each enzyme shifts the equilibrium only moderately to the base-pair melted state. On the other hand, the striking increase in fluorescence intensity with the combined enzymes indicates that together the two enzymes shift the equilibrium strongly toward the base-pair melted state. Interestingly, the combined effect of helicase and DNAP on base pairs melting is greater than the sum, which indicates synergism in DNA melting. This synergism depends on the number of nucleotides between the primer-end and fork junction. Synergistic melting of the base pair is observed only when there is no gap or one nucleotide gap between the primer-end (DNAP-binding site) and fork junction (helicase-binding site) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>). Synergistic melting is not observed when there are two nucleotides between the primer-end and fork junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). The results also demonstrate that a replication fork with two ssDNA template-bases between the primer-end and fork junction can stably accommodate both enzymes of the T7 replisome. Therefore, this study defines the specific positions of helicase and DNAP at the replication fork junction with single-base resolution to create a structural model of the replisome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) that forms the basis for understanding how the helicase and DNAP mutually stimulate each other's activities as discussed below.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06562.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of DNA unwinding-synthesis by T7 replisome.</title><p>The top cartoon of T7 replisome results after melting of the N + 2 base pair by helicase and DNAP. There are two unwound nucleotides (N + 1 and N + 2) between the primer-end and fork junction at N + 3. The N + 1 base of the leading strand is bound in the insertion site and serves as the templating nucleotide for the incoming dNTP, and the N + 2 is unstacked and bound in the template-binding channel of the DNAP. The complementary N + 1 and N + 2 nucleotides (as well as N and N − 1) on the lagging strand are bound to individual subunits of the helicase hexamer, as shown. Stable binding to N + 2 base by the helicase triggers dTTP hydrolysis and products release at different subunits of the ring. The helicase subunit at the leading edge has weak interactions with the partially unwound N + 3 junction base (dotted line), which gets stabilized after the next round of catalysis. When N is elongated by one nucleotide, the N + 2 moves into the insertion site after PPi release, and the helicase and DNAP cooperatively melt the N + 3 junction base pair, as shown in the bottom cartoon.

In fact, T7 DNAP by itself melts two base pairs upon binding to the replication fork DNA. This was unexpected, because DNA synthesis occurs in steps of one nucleotide, which would require unwinding of only one base pair at a time. Based on our 2-AP studies here and the crystal structure of T7 DNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doublie et al., 1998</xref>), we propose that T7 DNAP destabilizes two base pairs of duplex DNA upon initial binding to the forked DNA to create two ss nucleotides for its template-binding pocket. Two or more template-bases in the downstream template-binding pocket have been observed in crystal structures of other DNAPs as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doublie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jain et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, this mode of DNA binding could be a general feature of replicative DNAPs. We show that T7 helicase on its own can also melt the junction base pair, but it melts only one base pair and follows the fork junction.</p><p>Comparing DNA melting by isolated and combined enzymes reveals that the junction base pair is melted only partially by the isolated enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>). This explains the slow and GC sensitive unwinding rates of the isolated enzymes in our kinetic experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1C, 2C</xref>). The junction base pair is melted more efficiently by the combined enzymes, explaining fast and GC-independent rates of the combined enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We observed that the combined enzymes melted two base pairs upon binding to the fork DNA. We propose that this occurs <italic>initially</italic> to establish the catalytically competent structure of the replication fork—T7 DNAP melts two base pairs and binds two ssDNA nucleotides in its template-binding pocket, which positions the helicase two nucleotides ahead at the fork junction, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. We propose that during active leading strand synthesis, the enzymes melt only one base pair at the fork junction at a time consistent with the one nucleotide chemical step size of the combined enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pandey and Patel, 2014</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Model of the T7 replisome</title><p>When DNAP is in the post-translocated state, the N + 1 templating base (blue) is positioned in the polymerase active site ready to base pair with the incoming dNTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, upper cartoon). After the chemical step, the DNAP translocates downstream by one nucleotide to position the next templating-base N + 2 (red) in the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lower cartoon). This forward translocation step is coupled to unwinding of the N + 3 junction base pair (green). Based on our results, we propose that the DNAP by itself is not efficient at preventing junction base pair reannealing, and this unfavorable equilibrium constant for DNA melting destabilizes the post-translocated state of DNAP and competes with incoming dNTP binding. When helicase is present at the fork junction, it helps both unwind and trap the junction bases. Thus, the associated helicase stimulates dNTP binding by stabilizing the post-translocated state of T7 DNAP, and the outcome is decrease in dNTPs <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>. The helicase by itself is not efficient at unwinding the fork junction. However, the associated DNAP by providing an unwound base to the helicase at the fork junction facilitates the base-capture step and drives the reactions of dTTP binding-hydrolysis-product release around the helicase ring, and the outcome is an increase in the unwinding <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>. The combined binding energy of the two enzymes bound to opposite strands is sufficient to keep the unwound bases from reannealing, explaining the fast and GC-independent unwinding rates of helicase-DNAP.</p><p>Interestingly, cooperative and enhanced efficiency of base pair melting is observed only when the helicase and DNAP are within one nucleotide distance from each other. In most cases, helicase is coupled physically to the DNAP, either directly as in the case of T7 replication system or indirectly through accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamdan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gambus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sengupta et al., 2013</xref>). Some of these interactions aid in the assembly of the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>) and perhaps in proper positioning of the helicase with the DNAP in the replisome, but the consequences of breaking physical interactions on synergistic melting need to be investigated.</p><p>One can imagine situations where flexible positioning is needed when one or the other enzyme pauses or stalls during leading strand synthesis. Our investigation of such situations reveals that when DNAP stalls or is the slower motor, the helicase becomes functionally uncoupled and outruns the DNAP by unwinding the replication fork at the unstimulated rates. Similar behaviors were observed in other replisome studies as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Byun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McInerney and O'Donnell, 2007</xref>). Whether the functionally uncoupled helicase remains physically coupled to the DNAP remains unknown. Interestingly, when the helicase slows down, the two enzymes remain functionally coupled as evident from the low dNTPs <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and that the DNAP does not outrun the helicase. In this case, the combined enzymes unwind the DNA with the stimulated rate of the helicase.</p><p>Although SSB stimulates base pair melting by T7 DNAP, our studies find that the unwinding rates of T7 DNAP with SSB remain GC-sensitive at low-dNTPs concentrations. We propose that this is because SSB cannot trap the junction bases coordinately with DNA synthesis in the manner that T7 helicase does during leading strand synthesis. Similarly, it has been shown previously that SSB does not increase the unwinding rates of T7 helicase, which remain GC sensitive at all concentrations of dTTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donmez and Patel, 2008</xref>). These observations indicate that simply trapping the displaced strand by DNA binding is not sufficient, but coordination between the steps of junction base pair unwinding/trapping and synthesis is needed for rate acceleration. The replicative helicase is a central player in coordinating leading and lagging strand synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pandey et al., 2009</xref>). The interdependency between helicase and DNAP assures that the DNA is not unwound in an uncoupled manner leading to disruption in the coordinated synthesis of the two strands.</p><p>The mechanism of DNAP is conserved in all organisms where DNAPs elongate the primer in the 3′–5′ direction. On the other hand, replicative helicases of the prokaryotes and phages unwind DNA in the 5′–3′ direction, whereas those of eukaryotes unwind DNA in the opposite 3′–5′ direction. Our studies suggest that the leading edges of the T7 helicase and T7 DNAP are close together at the fork junction and this conformation is important for functional coupling of unwinding and synthesis reactions and preventing DNA reannealing. This model of the replication fork is likely to be generally applicable to replisomes of prokaryotes as most show functional coupling between helicase and DNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patel et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to prokaryotic replisomes, the replicative helicase of eukaryotes and archaea binds to the same strand as the DNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Donnell et al., 2013</xref>). In this case, both helicase and DNAP cannot be close to the fork junction, and there must be other mechanisms to functionally couple the two activities and prevent junction base pair reannealing. It is possible that although the MCM2-7 helicase encircles the leading strand, other subunits in the CMG (Cdc45-MCM2-7-GINS) complex may interact with the lagging strand and this could be a mechanism for preventing DNA reannealing at the fork junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Costa et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Oligonucleotides and proteins</title><p>Oligodeoxynucleotides labeled with fluorescein (FAM) on the 3′-end and BHQ1 on the 5′-end were purchased from Biosearch Technologies and RP-HPLC purified (Novato, CA).

The average unwinding rates were plotted against dNTP concentration and fit to the hyperbolic equation to obtain <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values.<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr Sanjay Tyagi for suggestions on suitable fluorophore combinations for designing the unwinding-synthesis DNA substrates.

We confirmed that the slow phase does not result from SSB binding to released ssDNA, because ssDNA + SSB does not lead to an increase in fluorescence of ssDNA with fluorescein at the 3′ end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The slow phase could arise from a population of T7 DNAP that unwinds the fork DNA at an overall slower rate perhaps due to frequent stalling or a population not assisted by SSB. Increasing <italic>E. coli</italic> SSB concentration resulted in the reduction of the slow phase amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Therefore, the unwinding rates by T7 DNAP were estimated by fitting the fast phase to the stepping model. The fast phase rate matches closely with the strand displacement rate obtained from the gel-based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pandey and Patel, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec

As this value is unknown, <italic>K</italic><sub>d*, dTTP</sub> was allowed to float but made a global parameter for the different GC DNA substrates. <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> was fixed at 130 nt/s, which corresponds to the rate of translocation by the helicase on ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2002</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the dTTP dependency data showed a poor fit for the 50% and 65% GC DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure

The authors also use 2-aminopurine studies to precisely position the two enzymes at the DNA fork and probe the number of base-pairs each enzyme is able to influence to melt or “breath” at the fork junction. In line with the track record from this group the experiments are of high quality, yet some points should be addressed. Most comments require only clarification of the text, but some additional experiments, which should not take much time, are needed.</p><p>Issues that require additional experimentation:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figure 1B and 2B</xref>, a single length of dsDNA is used to estimate unwinding parameters. In the past, this group has made use of different lengths of dsDNA to determine the kinetic parameters. The subsequent data are used to extract the effect of different GC composition and dNTP pools. This becomes important especially with the DNAP data collected in the presence of SSB where, in addition to a lag, the traces show a clear biphasic behavior. The authors chose to analyze only the first phase. How is this signal amplitude correlated to the fraction of dsDNA unwound? This parameter appears to be in Equations 1-3. The authors offer no proof or explanation that the latter can simply be ignored as they have done.</p><p>Data at different lengths of the dsDNA should be collected to show that the estimates from a single length are robust. This becomes important when using SSB which shows multi-phasic behavior and for which the authors do not describe how the fluorescence data have been calibrated to yield the fraction of unwound product.</p><p>2) SSB is used as a tool to amplify the poor strand displacement of DNAP. Given that the authors' aim is to determine the functional coupling of the T7 system, it is not clear (aside from the fact that higher concentrations would be needed) why gp2.5 was not used rather than SSB. Is the GC sensitivity of DNAP altered with gp2.5? Does gp2.5 show the same biphasic behavior in signal as SSB? A couple of selected experiments with gp2.5 would be appropriate.</p><p>3) The kinetic unwinding data and the 2-AP date are disjoined and the manuscript reads almost as two independent works. Both sets of data are absolutely critical to the overall model and the authors need to do a better job in both sections to tie the data to each other and the model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are difficult to follow and they seem to repeat some of the same data. These figures should be re-organized to improve clarity. For example, based on the cartoons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and 5L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> this appears to be the same DNA with the data comparing the DNAP only, helicase only and DNAP+Helicase cases. These data would be clearer and better summarized with a single cartoon and histogram with DNA, DNA+DNAP, DNA+helicase, DNA+DNAP+Helicase.</p><p>Also, the authors do not provide data for DNAP+SSB or gp2.5. If it is true that the function of SSB is to prevent re-annealing then SSB should not have an effect on the observed bp opening of DNAP.</p><p>Issues that require only clarification of the presentation:</p><p>4) The authors should stress that the stimulatory effect of each protein on the other is mediated through the influence of melting the junction base-pairs at the DNA fork to enhance the base-capture step rather than using language that suggests a classical protein-protein interaction; for example in the Abstract: “…helicase stimulates DNAP by promoting dNTP binding, DNAP stimulates the helicase by increasing the unwinding rate constant,…”.</p><p>Discussion on this point could benefit from the work reported by Thomen, Lopez, Bockelmann, Guilerez, Dreyfus, &amp; Heslot in (2008) Biophysical Journal, 95:2423-2433 likening, in this case, a closed junction base-pair to a competitive inhibitor of DNAP and a non-competitive inhibitor of helicase; it would make the effect on <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> easier to understand for the reader.</p><p>5) The authors provide little or no explanation for the large synergistic increase in 2-aminopurine fluorescence when both helicase and DNAP are present on the forked-DNA substrate above and beyond the effect of either enzyme alone. Discussion of base pair melting a kin to “breathing” fluctuations at the DNA junction would be useful to explain that the two enzymes together shift the equilibrium of the junction base pairs even more to the open/melted state than either enzyme alone, thereby producing a synergistic/larger fluorescence. Might the 2-aminopurine studies suggest that DNAP likely influences the melting of three bases at the fork junction instead of only two bases?</p><p>6) The authors inaccurately discuss the conclusions and model presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manosas et al., 2012b</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manosas et al., 2012b</xref> presents a similar coupling/stimulation of helicase and DNAP that is mediated through the DNA and also predicts that helicase is closer to the fork junction than DNAP. Like this manuscript, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manosas et al., 2012b</xref> attributes the stimulation of the helicase to destabilization of the first few base pairs of the DNA fork by the DNAP. Unlike this manuscript, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manosas et al., 2012b</xref> views the helicase as releasing the fork regression pressure on the DNAP thus allowing the DNAP to remain in the polymerization conformation and not switch to the exonuclease conformation as the cause of the stimulation of the DNAP. The authors should make this clarification in the revised manuscript. Can the authors comment on the possible implications of T7 DNAP exonuclease activity on their model?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06562.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Issues that require additional experimentation</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2"><italic>Figure 1B and 2B</italic></xref><italic>, a single length of dsDNA is used to estimate unwinding parameters.

This would be similar to our previous analysis of length dependence experiments with the helicase (Donmez and Patel. EMBO, 2008). The revised manuscript addresses this and we now include the fluorescence trace with two lengths of dsDNA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1D</xref>. The fluorescence traces with 25 bp and 40 bp duplex DNAs show increased lag time with increased dsDNA length.</p><p>However, we noted that the rise in the kinetics becomes shallower as the dsDNA length increases, which suggests broader distribution of rates on the longer dsDNA, which makes sense because the opportunity to stall increases with dsDNA length. Therefore, it is important to keep the dsDNA constant while measuring rates as a function of increasing GC% as we have in this study.</p><p><italic>How is this signal amplitude correlated to the fraction of dsDNA unwound? This parameter appears to be in Equations 1-3. The authors offer no proof or explanation that the latter can simply be ignored as they have done. The authors chose to analyze only the first phase</italic>.</p><p>It is difficult to estimate the exact amount of dsDNA unwound from the fluorescence amplitude. Therefore, we do not extract this information and simply fit the lag kinetics and exponential rise to determine the average rate of unwinding. As noted, we see two phases and the rate of the fast phase matches closely with the strand displacement rate of T7 DNAP with SSB obtained from our gel based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pandey and Patel, 2014</xref>), which indicates that unwinding and synthesis indeed takes place during the fast phase. We wondered about the slow phase and carried out many control experiments. Increasing <italic>E. coli</italic> SSB concentration resulted in reduced slow phase amplitude but not complete elimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2C</xref>). We speculate that the slow phase represents a population that unwinds the dsDNA at an overall slower rate not assisted by SSB.</p><p><italic>2) SSB is used as a tool to amplify the poor strand displacement of DNAP. Given that the authors' aim is to determine the functional coupling of the T7 system, it is not clear (aside from the fact that higher concentrations would be needed) why gp2.5 was not used rather than SSB</italic>.</p><p>There are several reasons we use <italic>E. coli</italic> SSB instead of T7 gp2.5. First, SSB has higher affinity for ssDNA as compared to gp2.5 (SSB <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 0.1-10 nM vs low μM <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of T7 gp2.5 complex), which means we need lower concentrations of SSB in our stopped-flow experiments and lower fluorescence background. Second, we wanted to use a trap that would not interact with T7 DNAP and T7 gp2.5 binds specifically to T7 DNAP. Also note that <italic>E. coli</italic> SSB is not a physiological irrelevant protein, as it is present in the cell during T7 phage infection of <italic>E. coli</italic>, hence it is a host factor that is present in abundant quantities and may play a role in T7 replication, but this has not been explored.</p><p><italic>Is the GC sensitivity of DNAP altered with gp2.5?

SSB by itself does not significantly increase the 2-AP fluorescence of junction base pair, consistent with the idea that SSB does not melt the DNA. Interestingly, the presence of SSB enhances the 2-AP fluorescence increase by DNAP but not by helicase.</p><p>We explain the results as follows: The fluorescence of 2-AP at steady state is dictated by the equilibrium distribution of base-pair in melted and annealed states, as pointed out by the reviewers (see below). The smaller change in 2-AP intensity with DNAP alone indicates that the equilibrium is more toward the base pair annealed state. The higher 2-AP intensity with SSB indicates that equilibrium is now shifted to the base-pair separated state. Because SSB itself does not unwind DNA, this means that SSB aids the DNAP by preventing base pair re-annealing. Interestingly, SSB does not increase the 2-AP intensity when added to T7 helicase, which is consistent with our results that SSB does not aid the helicase and does not affect the unwinding rates of the helicase.</p><p>These data are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5–figure supplement 5D</xref>, and we have added the following lines to the Results section:</p><p>“When 2-AP experiments with T7 DNAP were carried out with <italic>E. coli</italic> SSB, the fluorescence intensity changes were much larger, although SSB by itself did not increase the 2-AP fluorescence significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 3</xref>). These results indicate that T7 DNAP on its own only partially melts the junction base pairs. Furthermore, these base pairs appear to be in dynamic equilibrium (closed &lt;=&gt; open), because SSB can shift the equilibrium towards the open state by simply binding to ssDNA. This provides direct proof that T7 DNAP can melt the junction base pair, but DNAP is not efficient at preventing base pair reannealing; thus, SSB stimulates the activity of DNAP by trapping the unwound bases.”</p><p>And</p><p>“Interestingly, SSB has no effect on the helicase catalyzed melting of the fork junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5–figure supplement 5D</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that SSB does not stimulate the unwinding rates of the helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donmez &amp; Patel, 2008</xref>).”</p><p><italic>Issues that require only clarification of the presentation</italic>:</p><p><italic>4) The authors should stress that the stimulatory effect of each protein on the other is mediated through the influence of melting the junction base-pairs at the DNA fork to enhance the base-capture step rather than using language that suggests a classical protein-protein interaction; for example in the Abstract: “…helicase stimulates DNAP by promoting dNTP binding, DNAP stimulates the helicase by increasing the unwinding rate constant,…”</italic>.</p><p><italic>Discussion on this point could benefit from the work reported by Thomen, Lopez, Bockelmann, Guilerez, Dreyfus, &amp; Heslot in (2008) Biophysical Journal, 95:2423-2433 likening, in this case, a closed junction base-pair to a competitive inhibitor of DNAP and a non-competitive inhibitor of helicase; it would make the effect on</italic> K<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> <italic>and</italic> k<sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> <italic>easier to understand for the reader.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion. We have changed the Abstract to read:</p><p>“The synergistic shift in equilibrium of junction base-pair melting by combined enzymes explains the cooperativity, wherein helicase stimulates the polymerase by promoting dNTP binding (decreasing dNTP <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>), polymerase stimulates the helicase by increasing the unwinding rate-constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>), consequently the combined enzymes unwind DNA with kinetic parameters resembling enzymes translocating on single-stranded DNA.”</p><p>And have included the following sentence in the Results section:</p><p>“T7 DNAP follows an ordered mechanism, wherein dNTP binding follows the base-capture step. Therefore, the kinetic outcome of increasing GC content is analogous to a pure competitive mechanism where inhibitor (GC content) increases the dNTPs <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> without affecting the unwinding <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>. T7 helicase does not follow an ordered mechanism. Consequently, the kinetic outcome of increasing GC content is analogous to a mixed inhibition mechanism where inhibitor (GC content) decreases the unwinding <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and mildly affects the dTTP <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>.”</p><p><italic>5) The authors provide little or no explanation for the large synergistic increase in 2-aminopurine fluorescence when both helicase and DNAP are present on the forked-DNA substrate above and beyond the effect of either enzyme alone.

We have included the reviewers’ suggestion in the manuscript. In particular, in the subsection “T7 DNAP unwinds two base pairs and interacts with three nucleotides on the template”, we now say:</p><p>“Furthermore, these base pairs appear to be in dynamic equilibrium (closed &lt;=&gt; open), because SSB can shift the equilibrium towards the open state by simply binding to ssDNA. This provides direct proof that T7 DNAP can melt the junction base pair, but DNAP is not efficient at preventing base pair reannealing; thus, SSB stimulates the activity of DNAP by trapping the unwound bases.”</p><p>And in the subsection headed “Synergistic melting of junction base pairs by T7 helicase and T7 DNAP and their precise positions at the fork junction” we say:</p><p>“The 2-AP fluorescence intensity at steady state measures the equilibrium distribution of melted and annealed states of the junction base-pair. The small increase in fluorescence intensity with helicase and DNAP suggests that each enzyme shifts the equilibrium only moderately to the base-pair melted state. On the other hand, the striking increase in fluorescence intensity with the combined enzymes indicates that together the two enzymes shift the equilibrium strongly toward the base-pair melted state.”</p><p><italic>Might the 2-aminopurine studies suggest that DNAP likely influences the melting of three bases at the fork junction instead of only two bases?</italic></p><p>We assume the reviewers’ suggestion comes from the observation that there is a synergistic increase in fluorescence when the probe is at the N+3 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Although this may be indicative of melting of the N+3 base, we think the increase observed here is due to loss of stacking interactions from melting of the N+2 base pair. We make this conclusion because synergistic melting by the combined enzymes is not observed when 2-AP is part of the junction base pair in the N+3 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2B</xref>). We now clarify this in the manuscript and say:</p><p>“Similarly, when 2-AP is at N+2 and is part of the fork junction, addition of T7 DNAP increases the fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, when the 2-AP is at N+3 and is part of the fork junction, no increase in fluorescence is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2B</xref>), which indicates that T7 DNAP does not melt the junction base pair three nucleotides downstream from the primer-end. The increase in 2-AP intensity at N+3 in the internal position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) is due to N+2 base unstacking and not from unstacking of the N+3 base. Taken together these results indicate that T7 DNAP binds to three template-bases downstream of primer-end and melts two base pairs.”</p><p><italic>6) The authors inaccurately discuss the conclusions and model presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29"><italic>Manosas et al., 2012b</italic></xref><italic>.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29"><italic>Manosas et al., 2012b</italic></xref> <italic>presents a similar coupling/stimulation of helicase and DNAP that is mediated through the DNA and also predicts that helicase is closer to the fork junction than DNAP.
