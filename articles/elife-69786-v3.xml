transported to cilia is unclear. WDR35/IFT121 is a component of the IFT-A complex best known for its role in ciliary retrograde transport. In the absence of WDR35, small mutant cilia form but fail to enrich in diverse classes of ciliary membrane proteins. In <italic>Wdr35</italic> mouse mutants, the non-core IFT-A components are degraded and core components accumulate at the ciliary base. We reveal deep sequence homology of WDR35 and other IFT-A subunits to α and ß′ COPI coatomer subunits and demonstrate an accumulation of ‘coat-less’ vesicles that fail to fuse with <italic>Wdr35</italic> mutant cilia. We determine that recombinant non-core IFT-As can bind directly to lipids and provide the first in situ evidence of a novel coat function for WDR35, likely with other IFT-A proteins, in delivering ciliary membrane cargo necessary for cilia elongation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most human cells have at least one small hair-like structure on their surface called a cilium. These structures can act as antennae and allow the cell to sense signals from the rest of the body. To do this, they contain proteins that differ from the rest of the cell. The content of cilia depends on regulated delivery of these proteins in and out of cilia by a process called the intraflagellar transport or IFT, which involves a large complex made of several proteins. This complex shuttles the cargo proteins back and forth between the base and the tip of the cilia.</p><p>However, ciliary proteins are not produced in the cilia; instead, they are made in a different part of the cell and then they are transported to the ciliary base. At the point where they enter the cilia, they were thought to bind to the assembling IFT ‘trains’ and be transported across the ciliary gate to the positions where they are needed in cilia. One of the components of the IFT machinery is a protein called WDR35, also known as IFT121. If the gene that codes for this protein is faulty or missing, it results in severe disorders in both humans and mice including a range of potentially lethal skeletal dysplasias.</p><p>Interestingly, without WDR35, cells cannot build functional cilia. The absence of this protein not only disrupts IFT, stopping certain ciliary proteins and their associated membranes from entering cilia; it also causes a ‘traffic jam’ with a pile-up of transport intermediates from the place in cell where they are made to the cilia. It is unclear why a mutation in one of the components of the IFT would have this effect, raising the question of whether WDR35, or IFTs a whole, has another role in bringing the cargo proteins into the cilia.</p><p>To understand this phenomenon, Quidwai et al. analysed the structure of WDR35 and other IFT proteins and found that they are very similar to a protein complex called COPI, which is involved in transporting membrane proteins around the cell. When certain proteins are newly made, they are stored in small lipid bubbles – called vesicles – that then selectively move to where the proteins are needed. COPI coats these vesicles, helping them get to where they need to go in a process called vesicular transport. Quidwai et al. found that WDR35 and other IFT proteins are able to bind to specific types of lipid molecules, suggesting that they might be assisting in a form of vesicle transport too. Indeed, when mouse cells grown in the lab were genetically engineered so they could not produce WDR35, coatless vesicles accumulated around the base of the cilia. Adding back WDR35 to these mutant cells rescued these defects in vesicle transport to cilia as well as allowed functional cilia to be formed.</p><p>These results provide evidence that WDR35, likely with other IFT proteins, acts as a COPI-like complex to deliver proteins to growing cilia. Further research will investigate the composition of these vesicles that transport proteins to cilia, and help pinpoint where they originate. Quidwai et al.’s findings not only shed light on how different genetic mutations found in patients with cilia dysfunction affect different steps of transporting proteins to and within cilia. They also increase our understanding of the cellular roadmap by which cells shuttle building blocks around in order to assemble these important ‘antennae’.</p></abstract><kwd-group

organelle and signaling hub compartmentalized from the rest of the cell and positioned with a unique interface towards the extracellular environment. Analogous to a cell’s antenna, many roles for cilia have emerged in development, disease, and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>). Enrichment of signaling receptors and effectors in ciliary membranes is critical for cilia function, yet all biosynthesis of cilia-localized membrane proteins occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and is sorted by the Golgi and vesicular membrane traffic system to efficiently route cargo-laden vesicles for incorporation into the elongating ciliary membrane. The details of this highly efficient, directed transport process for the delivery of diverse cargos to cilia remain unclear.</p><p>In mammalian cells, electron microscopy (EM) studies reveal the Golgi stacks closely apposed to the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sorokin, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Wheatley, 1969</xref>). During intracellular ciliogenesis, small vesicles are recruited, most likely from the Golgi, to the mother centriole, where they fuse to form a large preciliary vesicle (PCV) attached at the distal appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Yee and Reiter, 2015</xref>). More secondary vesicles later fuse with the PCV, allowing elongation of cilia. Interestingly, the Golgi remains close to mature cilia, suggesting a continuous exchange of materials, enabling cilia maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sorokin, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Wheatley, 1969</xref>). Several proteins essential for ciliogenesis localize to both the Golgi and the mother centriole and are implicated in this early stage of ciliogenesis including CCDC41 (CEP83), IFT20, HOOK2, and CEP164 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baron Gaillard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Follit et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Graser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Joo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>). In some cases, including HOOK2 and CEP164, these components recruit Rab8a and Rabin-8, which facilitate membrane transport to cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baron Gaillard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Moritz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>). For some specific ciliary cargos, including rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Wang and Deretic, 2014</xref>) and PKD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Follit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Follit et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hoffmeister et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Noda et al., 2016</xref>), Golgi-to-cilia transport mechanisms have been described. However, these processes seem to involve cargo-specific traffic modules. A more universal Golgi-to-cilia transport machinery, if one exists, has yet to be identified.</p><p>In contrast to traffic to cilia, movement of cargos within cilia requires highly conserved motor-driven macromolecular cargo binding complexes that traffic along axonemal microtubules closely apposed against the ciliary membrane, in a process known as intraflagellar transport (IFT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cole, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kozminski et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pazour et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Pigino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Rogowski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002</xref>). Bidirectional movement of IFT complexes regulates cilia content; the IFT-B complex aids in kinesin-dependent anterograde transport of cargo, whilst the IFT-A complex is required for retrograde transport driven by dynein motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blacque et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Efimenko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jonassen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Piperno et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Tran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Tsao and Gorovsky, 2008</xref>). The IFT-A complex is composed of three core (IFT144/WDR19, IFT140/WDTC2, IFT122/WDR10) and three non-core proteins (IFT139/TTC21B/THM1, IFT121/WDR35, and IFT43) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hirano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Piperno et al., 1998</xref>). However, beyond classical retrograde ciliary traffic defects (an inappropriate accumulation of cargos within the cilium) mutations in <italic>IFT144, IFT140, IFT122, IFT121/WDR35</italic>, and <italic>IFT43</italic> result in either severe reduction in cilia length or complete loss of cilia, implying they also have critical roles in transport of cargo to cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avidor-Reiss et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Caparrós-Martín et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hirano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Liem et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mill et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Takahara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>).

We demonstrate that together recombinant non-core IFT-A proteins (WDR35, IFT43, and IFT139) are sufficient to specifically bind lipids in vitro.

Here, dual acylation was shown to direct potential association with lipid rafts, membrane microdomains that function as specialized platforms for protein/lipid transport and signaling. Indeed, ARL13B requires palmitoylation for its cilia membrane targeting and ciliogenesis in worms and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cevik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Roy et al., 2017</xref>), where it acts as the cilia-localized GEF for ARL3, driving it to release lipid-modified cargos from carriers UNC119 and PDE6δ within cilia membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gotthardt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kapoor et al., 2015</xref>). As ARL13B and ARL3 fail to localize to mutant cilia, we next asked about the ability to recruit general lipidated cargo in <italic>Wdr35<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs. We examined the localization of lipidated motifs tagged to EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Williams et al., 2014</xref>) to look at specialized membrane microdomains. In WT MEFs, untagged EGFP is present in the cell, but not in the cilium. When tagged with either myristoylation and palmitoylation (MyrPalm) or dual palmitoylation (PalmPalm) motifs, EGFP robustly enriches within cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We observed no enrichment of dual geranylation (GerGer) modified EGFP within control fibroblast primary cilia (data not shown) in contrast to the low-level expression previously reported in the most proximal portions of highly specialized olfactory sensory cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that cell-type and cilia-specific differences exist. In marked contrast to WT cells, in <italic>Wdr35<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs, both the myristoylation and palmitoylation (MyrPalm) or dual palmitoylation (PalmPalm) EGFP failed to concentrate in mutant cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This failure to recruit lipidated cargos into <italic>Wdr35</italic> mutant cilia is consistent with a more general traffic disruption of ciliary-destined membrane microdomains, containing broad categories of the membrane and membrane-associated cargos.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>WDR35 and other IFT-A complex proteins share close sequence and structural similarity to COPI complex proteins α and ß′</title><p>It has previously been suggested that IFTs evolved from a protocoatomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jékely and Arendt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Taschner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">van Dam et al., 2013</xref>). Three classic coat complexes (COPI, COPII, and clathrin) exist and perform similar functions but on different membranes and follow different routes through the cell. They are made of different protein components, which share a similar division of labor, characterized functionally as either adaptors or cage-forming proteins. Although components like the cage proteins share significant structural homology in organization of protein domains, they do not share detectable sequence homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Field et al., 2011</xref>). Given the defects in ciliary membrane content observed in the <italic>Wdr35</italic> mutant cilia, we hypothesized that WDR35, in collaboration with other IFT-A complex proteins, may be required for moving ciliary membrane cargos between donor membranes, such as the Golgi or endosomes, to their destination ciliary membrane, in a manner comparable to coat complexes. WD40 repeat (WDR) and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs are common throughout cellular proteomes and are involved in a wide range of biological processes. Agnostic of structure, we used deep sequence analysis of the whole human proteome and homology modeling to ask which proteins were most similar to IFT-A components. Simple alignment strategies with proteins such as IFT subunits, which contain tandem repeat motifs, could erroneously align with other repeat proteins to suggest a close evolutionary relationship where none exists (i.e., false positives). To address this, we used four IFT-A subunits (IFT144, IFT140, IFT122, and IFT121) and two of IFT-B (IFT80 and IFT172) as seed sequences for multiple iterative rounds of homology searches via profile-HMM alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Remmert et al., 2011</xref>). We then clustered the resulting proteins based on sequence similarity, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Wells et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Wells and Marsh, 2019</xref>). This was repeated using the COP protein subunits as seeds for reverse analysis. Together, these reciprocal analyses revealed that out of the entire proteome COPI α and β′ cluster most closely with six IFT proteins (two IFT-B and four IFT-A components), both having TPR and WD40 repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, homology searches with COPI β and COPI ϒ1/2, which have HEAT/ARM repeats, did not yield any hits with IFT components, as was the case with COPI ε, which has TPRs but no WD40 domains. COPI δ and COPI ε1/2, which have no identifiable repeat domains, are most closely related to adaptor protein complex subunits AP2 and AP3. In summary, using multiple rounds of sequence homology searches, we generated a broad set of putatively related repeat proteins, clustering of which reveals clear relationships between coatomers and IFT-A/B complex components.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>IFT-A subunits have close sequence and structural similarity to α and β′ COPI subunits and can directly bind to phosphatidic acid (PA) in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Clusters of IFT and COPI subunits generated from the results of reciprocal sequence similarity searches with HHBlits using IFT144, IF140, IF122, and WDR35 as initial search queries suggest a very close similarity between a subset of IFT proteins and the COPI α (COPA) and β′ (COPB2) subunits.

Based on the target-template alignment models, built using ProMod3, ribbon diagrams of all four IFT-A subunits modeled structures with two N-terminal seven-bladed WD40 β propellers and C-terminal extended TPRs, also found in α and β′ COPI proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), as previously modeled for WDR35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mill et al., 2011</xref>). The remaining two IFT-A subunits were not possible to model accurately. IFT139 contains only TPRs with limited sequence similarity to the ε subunit of COPI coatomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">van Dam et al., 2013</xref>). IFT43 is the smallest and unstructured protein and could not be modeled and is presumed to be made of α-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Taschner et al., 2012</xref>). While undertaking this work, a crystal structure for IFT80 was published, highlighting that despite the same domain organization IFT80 adopted a distinctive 3D conformation of the second β-propeller domain from β′-COP and also formed a dimer unlike the triskelion COPI cage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Taschner et al., 2018</xref>). However, purified IFT172 adopted two configurations by negative stain EM when incubated with and without lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, respecting the limitations of homology modeling without solved structures, we found four IFT-A proteins (IFT144, IFT140, IFT122, and IFT121) to have very high sequence and structural similarities to COPI α and β′ subunits with N-terminal WD40 repeats and C-terminal TPR region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

All three samples were soluble, eluted as stoichiometric proteins from size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and were positively identified by MS. The heterotrimeric IFT-A complex purified from mammalian cells was assessed for lipid binding using membrane lipid strips, detecting any bound protein complex using antibodies against the His-Tag on IFT43. From the protein-lipid overlay results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, the His-GFP-tagged IFT-A trimeric complex displays strong binding to phosphatidic acid (PA) as well as weaker binding to phosphatidylserine (PS). Thus the IFT-A trimeric complex binds to these negatively charged (anionic) phosphoglycerates exclusively, without binding to neutral or inositol-based lipids as had been reported for the IFT-A adaptor TULP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2010</xref>).

Neither the IFT121/43 dimer nor IFT43 alone showed detectable lipid binding, demonstrating that the IFT139 subunit is essential for lipid interaction by the non-core IFT-A complex. In order to further test whether the trimeric IFT-A complex was capable of specifically binding to PA-containing liposomes, we performed negative stain EM of purified proteins incubated with liposomes composed of PE/PG/PA or POPC (control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

In the absence of WDR35, non-coated vesicles accumulate around the ciliary base, marking a failure in this process in either the formation and/or maintenance of this coat and subsequent fusion at the target ciliary pocket.</p><p>To further confirm our hypothesis that these electron-dense vesicles directed to cilia contain WDR35 and IFT-A proteins, we performed correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) imaging in <italic>Wdr35<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs expressing WDR35-EmGFP, which we had previously shown to completely rescue cilia phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Expressing WDR35-EmGFP in <italic>Wdr35<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ensures that every WDR35 particle was labeled with EmGFP, minimizing competition with non-labeled species. Using Airyscan confocal imaging of WDR35-EmGFP MEFs grown on grids for subsequent TEM, we saw WDR35-EmGFP enriched at the ciliary base of rescued mutant cilia. Moreover, we observed that this signal coincided with the reappearance of electron-dense vesicles in the TEM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). We also observed recovery of fusion events of coated vesicles at the cilia base in cells expressing WDR35-EmGFP as well as rescue of the periciliary vesicle accumulation phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>; quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video1">Figure 8—video 1</xref>). Next, we performed immunogold labeling directly on 70 nm sections and observed sparse but specific labeling of GFP-positive particles at the cilia base, within the axoneme and around putative vesicles at the cilia base and ciliary sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">3</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that WDR35 is required for the formation of these coated vesicles and that these coated vesicles coincided with WDR35-EmGFP signal, confirming that WDR35 supports the assembly of a novel coat on vesicles destined to deliver membrane cargos to cilia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>WDR35 is a component of a novel coat-like complex required for entry of cargos into cilia</title><p>Vesicle coat proteins, with the archetypal members clathrin and the coat protein complexes I and II (COPI and COPII, respectively), are macromolecular machines that play two central roles in the homeostasis of the cell’s endomembrane system. They enable vesicle formation and select protein and lipid cargo packaged for delivery from a specific donor to functionally segregated compartments. Given the deep sequence structural similarities between IFT-A and COPI subunits and the ability of the non-core IFT-A to bind directly to lipids in vitro, coupled to the phenotypic defects in <italic>Wdr35</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells (including lack of ciliary enrichment of a broad range of membrane cargos and the absence of electron-densities on accumulated periciliary vesicles), we propose a novel function for WDR35 and other IFT-A proteins to act as a coat-like complex that is critical for the transport of ciliary membrane cargo into cilia. Two other macromolecular complexes have been proposed to form vesicle-associated coats involved in ciliary traffic: clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kaplan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Molla-Herman et al., 2010</xref>) and the BBSome complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Clathrin is a classical vesicle coating protein with some documented activity at the ciliary pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clement et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pedersen et al., 2016</xref>). From static images, the directionality of events is difficult to resolve: fission (endocytosis) or fusion (exocytosis). Clathrin vesicles can be both endocytic, where they concentrate cargos and curve off donor membranes for selective transport into the cytoplasm, or exocytic, where they can use fuse to release their contents. For example, a subset of AP-1 clathrin vesicles were shown to traffic between the trans Golgi and basolateral membranes of polarized epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fölsch et al., 1999</xref>) via the recycling endosome compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Futter et al., 1998</xref>). Indeed, in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dwyer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kaplan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ou et al., 2007</xref>) and trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Vince et al., 2008</xref>), deletion or depletion of AP-1 leads to defects in cilia assembly and protein traffic into cilia. However, in mammalian cells, depletion of clathrin and clathrin-associated proteins results in a normal number of cilia with normal lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kaplan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Molla-Herman et al., 2010</xref>), as opposed to the drastically reduced size of <italic>Wdr35<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Caparrós-Martín et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mill et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that clathrin is dispensable for vesicular transport into mammalian cilia. Although electron-dense vesicles were observed invaginating from the mammalian ciliary pocket, the electron density on these vesicular invaginations was unchanged in the absence of clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Molla-Herman et al., 2010</xref>). Using live cell imaging, the directionality of clathrin-mediated traffic was reported to be largely away from cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Molla-Herman et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, we still observe clathrin-coated endocytic structures on the plasma membrane of <italic>Wdr35</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video4">Figure 6—video 4</xref>), and we found no difference in the distribution of clathrin intensity in a volume of ~2 µm<sup>3</sup> around the ciliary base in <italic>Wdr35<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cilia compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Moreover, studies on clathrin-mediated exocytosis demonstrated that depletion of human clathrin heavy or light chains results in increased total fusion events with complete release of membrane cargos from vesicles in fibrosarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jaiswal et al., 2009</xref>), the opposite to what is observed in <italic>Wdr35</italic> mutants where vesicles stack up adjacent to the ciliary sheath but do not fuse.</p><p>The BBSome is a macromolecular machine of Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS) proteins, which is also postulated to have evolved from an early ancestral coat complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jékely and Arendt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">van Dam et al., 2013</xref>). The BBSome shares similar structural elements to the archetypal coats and plays a role in cilia function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Nachury, 2018</xref>). In contrast to IFT, mutations in BBSome components, including ARL6/BBS3, do not affect cilia assembly and length regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Domire et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Eguether et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lechtreck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lechtreck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Liew et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Nager et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Shinde et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Ye et al., 2018</xref>). Instead, they generally are required for regulating cilia content, mostly for the export of ciliary membrane proteins. Although this suggests that BBSomes regulate movement of ciliary components between compartments, endogenous localization of the BBSome remains unclear, without evidence supporting endomembrane or plasma membrane localization. In contrast, IFT20 localizes to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Follit et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Noda et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, whilst there is in vitro evidence that BBSomes can cluster on liposomes, they do not deform membranes, a key step in vesicle formation by coatomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jin et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, purified IFT172, an IFT-B component that is also homologous to COPI α and ß′ like WDR35, can not only assemble on liposomes with high affinity but can also bud 50 nm vesicles consistent with coatomer-sized products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). We report here that the purified trimer of non-core IFT-A (WDR35, IFT43, and IFT139) can also directly and specifically bind to lipids, notably PA, which is involved in membrane deformation in COPI maturation and exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Zeniou-Meyer et al., 2007</xref>). We are currently testing whether non-core IFT-A can also pinch off vesicles. Together, the evidence, including its evolutionary conservation of the BBSome with more classical coat proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jékely and Arendt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">van Dam et al., 2013</xref>), interaction with in vitro membranes in the presence of the ARF-like GTPase ARL-6, interaction with phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>), and recent cryo-EM structures of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Klink et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Singh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Yang et al., 2020</xref>), suggests that the BBSome may be working as an adaptor for IFT-A-mediated cage formation, similar to other coat adaptors for clathrin (i.e., AP1/AP2) or COP (i.e., β-, γ-, δ-, and ζ-COP for COPI). Our data suggest that the electron density observed on vesicles around the ciliary base in control cells is neither clathrin nor BBSome in nature, and is likely composed of WDR35/IFT-A.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanism of WDR35/IFT-A-assisted vesicle coat function; regulators of vesicular fusion and fission</title><p>Our study demonstrates a requirement for IFT-A to deliver ciliary membrane cargo into cilia, potentially by acting as a vesicle coat operating between the Golgi and the ciliary base. Archetypal coatomer protein complexes, including COPII, COPI, and clathrin, concentrate cargo within donor membranes and pinch off vesicles (fission), which then travel to their target organelle membranes, where SNARE and Rab GTPases assist their fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonifacino and Glick, 2004</xref>). In these cases, the electron-dense coats are progressively dismantled such that uncoated vesicles can fuse with acceptor membranes, presumably to facilitate access to the fusion machinery, such as SNAREs, on the surface of the vesicle. As a result of interactions with cargo and lipids with the vesicles, there is evidence that the COPI coat can remain stable on membranes after fission. Moreover, this suggests that COPI vesicle uncoating may be incomplete, such that residual COPI on the vesicle surface enables vesicle recognition and tethering necessary for fusion to the correct acceptor membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Orci et al., 1998</xref>). In contrast to the trail of electron-dense vesicles between the Golgi and the base of cilia in control cells, we observed 10 times more vesicles stalled around the cilia base of <italic>Wdr35</italic><sup>-/-</sup> MEFs. These all lack an electron-dense coat, suggesting that these transport vesicles are formed but fail to fuse at the ciliary target membrane in the absence of WDR35.</p><p>This raises a question as to why a protein like WDR35, which shares structural homology to fission-inducing proteins, gives phenotypes consistent with a fusion-facilitating protein. One possibility is that while <italic>Wdr35<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs are missing one COPI α/β′- homolog, the other three core IFT-As (IFT144, IFT140, and IFT122) may be sufficient to compensate by providing interaction motifs necessary for the fission of vesicles from donor membranes such as the Golgi. Indeed, we show IFT122 to be upregulated in <italic>Wdr35<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant cells, similar to previous reports in <italic>WDR35</italic> patient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duran et al., 2017</xref>). However, we and others have demonstrated that in the absence of WDR35 the IFT-A complex is unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>) such that any core IFT-A coat on the vesicles from donor membranes such as the Golgi may be easily disassembled. It is interesting to note that non-core IFT139 and IFT43 are helical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Taschner et al., 2012</xref>) similar to SNARE proteins that mediate vesicle fusion with target membranes. Importantly, we show here that these components, which are degraded in the absence of WDR35, could help mediate the fusion of vesicles with the ciliary pocket or base to transfer membrane cargos into the growing cilia sheath. Indeed, we show that purified non-core IFT-A complex is sufficient to specifically bind PA, which is present in ciliary membranes, as well as the Golgi and the recycling endosome compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Farmer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lechtreck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). The lipid composition of membranes is known to determine their curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">McMahon and Boucrot, 2015</xref>); PA being conical in shape concentrates on more curved regions of membranes, resulting in nanoscopic-negative curvature such as found in the ciliary pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Zhukovsky et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, with a small head group, negative charge, and a phosphomonoester group, PA interacts with proteins and lipids in several subcellular compartments that facilitate fission and fusion of membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Zhukovsky et al., 2019</xref>). From our liposome assay, we speculate that IFT139 binding to the IFT121/43 dimer increases the binding affinity to lipids. Indeed, on its own, the IFT-A dimer signal is below the threshold of detection in the protein-lipid overlay assays but observed to weakly associate to PA-containing liposomes. In our purification of the non-core IFT-A complex with the affinity tag on IFT43, only IFT43/121, rather than IFT43/139, was co-purified together with the trimeric complex, indicating that IFT121 interacts with both IFT43 and IFT139, and is responsible for mediating the interactions between IFT43 and IFT139, which is consistent with what has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). In the <italic>Wdr35<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant, and likely IFT139 or IFT43 KO strains, the non-core IFT-A complex will not form, which leads to non-coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Important next steps will be to systematically investigate vesicular traffic defects in other IFT-A mutants, as well as identify the GTPase that acts to drive formation, uncoating, and fusion of these vesicles.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>WDR35 and likely other IFT-As assist cargo transport of vesicles between the Golgi into cilia at the stage of cilia elongation.</title><p>Diagrammatic representation of the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data showing vesicles (green) with the WDR35-dependent coat (magenta halo) fusing and localizing around cilia in wild type (WT) cells (inset A) and coatless vesicles clustering around cilia in <italic>Wdr35<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (inset C).

It is interesting to note that we and others have been unable to purify IFT-A complex with any GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that any interaction is transient. This is even in conditions where we can purify endogenous IFT-B complexes with its associated GTPases IFT22/RABL5 and IFT27/RABL4. In COPI, recruitment of coat components to donor membranes starts with the insertion of small GTPase ARF1 into membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dodonova et al., 2017</xref>). So far only one ARF, ARF4 acting at the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mazelova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), has been implicated in ciliary traffic. However, it plays non-ciliary roles and shows early lethality in mouse knockouts without affecting cilia assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Follit et al., 2014</xref>). Mutations in several related ARLs have defects in cilia structure and/or content, including ARL3, ARL6, and ARL13B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkanderi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cantagrel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fan et al., 2004</xref>). At least in the case of ARL13B and ARL3, they fail to accumulate and/or enter mutant cilia, even when overexpressed in the absence of WDR35, although periciliary vesicular staining can be observed. Rab GTPases have been implicated in the ciliary targeting of vesicular cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blacque et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, expression of dominant negative RAB8 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Moritz et al., 2001</xref>) results in a strikingly similar accumulation of vesicles to our <italic>Wdr35</italic> mutants, which fail to fuse with the ciliary base. Similarly, in RPE-1 cells, dominant negative RAB8 impairs traffic of ciliary membrane cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>). However, functional redundancy between RABs may exist as neither single nor <italic>Rab8a;Rab8b</italic> double mutant mice have defects in cilia formation. On the other hand, defects in ciliation were observed when <italic>Rab10</italic> was additionally knocked down in <italic>Rab8a;Rab8b</italic> double mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Sato et al., 2014</xref>). Excitingly, our work demonstrates IFT-As to be important for the later stage of ciliogenesis, similar to GTPases like RAB23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gerondopoulos et al., 2019</xref>) or RSG-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agbu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Toriyama et al., 2016</xref>). Given that these GTPases have also been shown to sequentially interact with CPLANE subunits INTU and FUZ, which are also required for IFT-A holocomplex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gerondopoulos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Toriyama et al., 2016</xref>), they will be priorities for future investigations.</p><p>We have demonstrated that an IFT-A-dependent coat for membrane vesicles exists and is necessary for their fusion with the ciliary sheath and ciliary pocket, which is continuous with the ciliary membrane. We also showed that this coat is necessary to efficiently deliver cilia-destined signaling molecules into the elongating axoneme of the cilium. This raises the possibility that some of this IFT-A-dependent coat may remain upon vesicle fusion as a now linear ‘train’ carrying membrane cargos to be picked up by cytosolically assembling IFT-B particles allowing import across the transition zone and then anterograde IFT within the cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref><bold>,</bold> inset B). Excitingly, we show that purified non-core IFT-A including WDR35 is sufficient to bind selectively to PA. This low abundance signaling lipid has well-described roles in vesicle traffic where it promotes COPI vesicle fission in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Yang et al., 2008</xref>), maintenance of the endosome recycling compartment (ERC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Farmer et al., 2021</xref>), as well as promoting exocytosis through formation of fusion-competent granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Zeniou-Meyer et al., 2007</xref>). Defining at which points in vesicular traffic IFT-A-dependent coats act, both fission and fusion, within cells as well as the biochemical nature of lipids and cargos these vesicles carry will be required. Given its efficacy, this IFT-dependent ‘targeted delivery’ module may also be repurposed for other non-ciliary membrane targeting events via polarized exocytosis. Notably in the immune synapse of T cells, where IFT20 is required for rapid clustering of TCRs necessary for T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Finetti et al., 2009</xref>), as well as photoreceptor dendrites in which IFT localization to vesicles tracking towards the postsynaptic membranes was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sedmak and Wolfrum, 2010</xref>), where dendritic exocytosis is implicated in synaptic plasticity and neuronal morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kennedy and Ehlers, 2011</xref>).

Composition of IP lysis buffer is (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5]), 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% IGEPAL, and 1/100 Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78443) and a tablet of Protease Inhibitor Tablet – one tablet per 10 ml (cOmplete Mini, Roche, 11836170001). The lysate was cleared by spinning at 4℃, 14,000 rpm, for 20 min. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit as per the manufacturer’s instruction (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23225). For each IP, 500 µg of protein was incubated with 3 µg of each antibody overnight at 4℃ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) with mild agitation (side-to-side). IP of immunocomplexes was done using PureProteome Protein G magnetic beads (Millipore LSKMAGG10). 30 µl beads/IP were equilibrated with 500 µl IP lysis buffer by gentle agitation for 5 min at 4℃.

Washes (eight times) were performed, each lasting 5 min. Washes were as follows: 2× washes in Wash Buffer-1 (same as IP lysis buffer), followed by 2× washes with Wash Buffer-2 (IP lysis buffer with reduced 0.2% IGEPAL), finally 4× washes with Wash Buffer-3 (IP lysis buffer without any IGEPAL detergent).

Briefly, the immunocomplexes collected on magnetic beads were processed to generate tryptic peptides. Proteins were eluted from beads by incubating at 27℃ for 30 min in elution buffer (2 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, and 5 µg/ml trypsin). The sample was centrifuged, bead pellets washed twice, and the supernatant from samples digested overnight at room temperature (RT). Iodoacetamide was added to the samples to inhibit disulfide bond formation and incubated for 30 min in the dark. Following this, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added to stop tryptic digestion. Desalting and pre-fractionation of the digested peptides were done by manually using C18 pipette stage-tips filled with 3 M Empore disc activated with 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA and then washed once with 0.1% TFA. The peptide mixtures were passed manually along to the column with a syringe to concentrate and purify the analytes. Peptides were subsequently eluted twice in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA and both eluates were combined. Samples were concentrated and resuspended in 0.1% TFA. This was followed by chromatographic separation on a Reprosil column along a 3–32% acetonitrile gradient. The LC setup was attached to a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer, and ion mass spectra were obtained following HPLC during a tandem MS run. Mass spectra were analyzed using MaxQuant software. Label-free quantification intensity (LFQ) values were obtained for analysis by identifying mass/charge ratio, and their intensities at a specific elution time for individual peptides. The data were collected for both control (GFP) and specific proteins IPs (i.e., IFT88, IFT140; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). LFQ values for the proteins were obtained by summing the ion intensities corresponding to peptides after assigning the unique peptides to proteins. The ratio of LFQ intensities of test:control was taken, where higher the ratio better corresponds to a better enrichment of protein in complex. Complete MS data are available on ProteomeXchange (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD022652">PXD022652</ext-link>).

Further SWISS-MODEL server was used to model IFT-A complex protein structures as described on the server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Waterhouse et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, a template search with BLAST and HHblits was performed against the SWISS-MODEL template library. The target sequence was searched with BLAST against the primary amino acid sequence contained in the SMTL. An initial HHblits profile, followed by one iteration of HHblits against NR20, was run and the obtained profile then searched against all profiles of the SMTL. The top hit in all of IFTA searches was 3mkqA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lee and Goldberg, 2010</xref>), a coatomer β′ subunit 2.5 Å X-ray structure with 14–20% sequence identity and 25–30% sequence similarity with different IFT-A proteins. A coatomer α subunit was also found within these top matches. Models were built on the target-template alignment using ProMod3. Coordinates that are conserved between the target and the template were copied from the template to the model. Insertions and deletions were remodeled using a fragment library. Side chains were then rebuilt. Finally, the geometry of the resulting model was regularized by using a force field. In case loop modeling with ProMod3 fails, an alternative model was built with PROMOD-II. The global and per-residue model quality has been assessed using the QMEAN scoring function.

The selections obtained from the masks were enlarged using the ‘Make Band’ function to create a band region of interest (ROI). This was done by increasing in 1 µm increments until there were five bands. The centrosome masks and the surrounding bands were measured on the PCM1 channel of the average intensity projection image. To quantify clathrin intensity around the cilia base, a point was manually selected as the center of the basal point. The user was blinded to file name and condition while quantification took place.

The manuscript contains a bit of a technical tour de force, employing knockout (WDR-35 vs the retrograde motor dynein heavy chain, Dync2h1) cell lines (MEFs), fixed immunofluorescence and transmission EM imaging, Western blotting and mass spectrometry to characterize abundance of protein subunits in complexes and in entire cells, iterative homology searching of protein alignments in silico, and lipid binding assays with purified recombinant proteins. Together they are used to build the case that WDR-35/IFT121, an IFT-A accessory (as in non-IFT-A core subunit) and by extension IFT-A forms a lipid binding coat complex that is needed to transport ciliary proteins into cilia. And in the absence of WDR-35, instead the cilia are formed by stunted in growth and instead accumulate uncoated vesicles, defective in fusion at the ciliary pocket. The bulk of the data go a long way towards convincing this reader of the bulk of the conclusions, though with some reservations. Among the most interesting observations in the paper are the consequences of WDR35/IFT121 deletion on ciliary length and stability (or lack thereof) of other IFT-A, but not IFT-B subunits, that there exists some structural and likely functional homologies between IFT and COP complexes, and that cells lacking WDR-35/IFT121 accumulate uncoated vesicles, consistent with IFT-A complexes forming that missing coat. In addition, there is extensive citation of the literature from studies across multiple species that overall does a very good job of putting the work into perspective. I believe that this work contributes to the field resulting in a new and better, though still quite incomplete, model of the roles of IFT-A in cilia.</p><p>I have a number of very minor concerns that can be readily addressed but one larger one. Specifically, the authors are clearly concluding that the source of the uncoated vesicles seen in TEM imaging in WDR-35/IFT121 KO cells is Golgi. I see no strong evidence to support this and suspect it is based upon the homologies to COPI and its actions there (?). While the title carefully avoids mention of the source of such vesicles, I think the manuscript would be stronger with a clearer statement as to evidence supporting the origins and perhaps the level of uncertainty on this issue. The paragraph beginning on line 344 appears an effort to make this case but could be stronger.</p><p>I have a number of very minor concerns that can be readily addressed but one larger one.

While intriguing/interest and apparently quite specific some question the accuracy of this assay when used as the sole evidence for such lipid specificity. And perhaps more discussion of sources of PA and why it might make sense would help the reader. Finally, I end with some experiments that one might propose to further strengthen this manuscript. While I don't support withholding publication until done, they might be worth considering now or later. These might include following up the lipid strip binding assays with assays employing lipid vesicles of distinct composition. Similarly, the TEM could be furthered with immunogold labeling to nail down whether the coats seen in WT vesicles are studded with IFT-A proteins and absent in the KO.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Wdr35 has been previously shown to be trafficking diverse set of ciliary membrane proteins including smoothened, GPCRs and Arl13b (Fu et al., 2016). The authors repeat and extend some of these observations and further show that IFT-A subunits have close sequence and structural similarity to COPI subunits. The authors show purification of IFT-A peripheral subunits that together bind to phosphatidic acid in lipid-strip assays. Using TEM techniques they observe electron dense vesicles tracking between Golgi and ciliary base, whereas lack of Wdr35 shows abundant vesicles with less density. Lack of Dynein 2, a retrograde ciliary motor, shows paucity of vesicles around ciliary base. Two WDR35-positive vesicles are shown to be electron dense in Wdr35 null cells by correlative light and electron microscopy. The authors suggest that Wdr35 and likely other IFT-A subunits assist in cargo transport from Golgi into cilia at the stage of cilia elongation.</p><p>The authors use state-of-the-art cell biology, biochemical purification of IFT-A peripheral complex and TEM/correlative light and electron microscopy techniques to address cargo targeting to cilia.</p><p>The authors use electron density of vesicles to suggest for presence or lack of a coat in vesicles destined for cilia around ciliary base. The proposed model will be further solidified by quantifying the WDR35-GFP rescue experiments and showing quantification of coated vs noncoated vesicles in their TEM and CLEM assays.</p><p>Lack of vesicles in wild type vs Dynein 2 knockout cells suggest that at least some of the vesicles around ciliary base can result from post ciliary trafficking out of cilia. The abundant &quot;preciliary&quot; vesicles rather than being cargo carrying and destined for cilia might also include recycling, post ciliary vesicles or vesicles without any relevant cargoes.</p><p>It might also be relevant to include other interpretations for the current data of vesicle accumulation seen in Wdr35 knockout in EM. The apparent increase in all kinds of vesicles at ciliary base in the Wdr35 knockout cells could be an indirect consequence of Wdr35's role in processes independent of generating vesicular coat. For e.g., Wdr35 could promote delivery of selective cargoes to cilia through the F-actin rich ciliary base (Fu et al., 2016).</p><p>The authors use electron density on vesicles for suggesting vesicular &quot;coat&quot; in the current paper that is reduced in Wdr35 knockout cells, but it is presently unclear on what constitutes this coat other than Wdr35.</p><p>The authors need to solidify the data with WDR35-GFP rescues, by including data from GFP lacking vesicles (internal control) or at least showing total distribution of number, density, size for vesicles as shown for knockout MEFs.</p><p>The authors show nicely the quantification of all vesicles in figure 7B-C, but the distribution in coated vs noncoated vesicles should be shown as well.</p><p>Any cargo that can be immunolocalized to these vesicles might be a way to address concerns regarding specificity of coat containing cilia destined cargoes. Alternatively, the authors might use co-localization between WDR35-GFP and prospective cargoes (e. g. Arl13b-mKATE-2) in their CLEM methods.</p><p>Considering that the coat might result from Wdr35 associated proteins, it might be relevant to phenocopy Wdr35 knockout with respect to cells lacking other subunits of IFT-A complex to solidify the coat hypothesis. Lack of another peripheral subunit Ift139 does not cause lack of Smoothened or Arl13b in cilia (Hirano et al., 2016). Thus, it might be relevant to test or speculate on some of these other constituents.</p><p>1. Figure 3. Data in A of reduction in some core subunits in knockout cells is not supported by western blots in C, D. Increase in Ift122 is mentioned in text for the knockout but is shown to be not significant in quantification in (D).</p><p>2. Figure 5C. Please note that phosphatidic acid is an extremely transient lipid and is also present in other organelles such as ER. The lipid-strip assay interactions could be confirmed by liposome assays. Other core subunit complexes could be tested in the assay.</p><p>3. Figure 6. Please mention how the differentiation between ciliary sheath from pocket was done.</p><p>4. Figure 7-Suppl 1. In Wdr35 knockout MEFs, I see an abundance of all types of vesicles (color code not clear). These other types of vesicles including coated ones should be quantified.</p><p>5. Figure 7F. Integrated density nomenclature is confusing (vesicles have low density in wild type). The data shown are inclusive of all types of vesicles (coated, non-coated) in this quantification and with a wide disparity between total numbers (31 vs 508) between genotypes.</p><p>6. Please mention methods of how WDR35-GFP was used to rescue expression in knockout MEFs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors set out to understand why WDR35, an IFT-A component, affects ciliary length. They demonstrated that WDR35 affects non-core IFT-A degradation and ciliary localization, important for ciliary length control. Using structural predictive analysis WDR35 and IFT-A components were found to have homology to the COPI coatomer proteins. Using fixed and live cells imaging the authors demonstrated that WDR35 affects membrane cargo transport to the cilium. The authors impressively used quantitative EM tomograph studies to demonstrate that vesicles at the cilia base were uncoated and appeared to fail to fuse to ciliary membranes in WDR35-/- cells. However, whether there is a direct connection between WDR35 function as a coat protein in vesicle trafficking remains to be seen. As the authors indicated, there could be other explanations for this observation. Overall, this work has a high degree of significance to the poorly understood mechanisms of ciliary vesicle trafficking important in ciliogenesis and ciliary signaling. It is the first study to provide evidence that an IFT-A/WDR35 coatomer could function in delivering ciliary membrane cargo needed for cilia elongation.</p><p>Points to help strengthen the conclusions of this manuscript:</p><p>1. Inclusion of controls (non-ciliating) for WDR35-/- would help establish if the uncoated vesicles near the base of the cilia observed by electron microscopy are in fact associated with ciliogenesis. It is interesting that Arl13b displays strong PM/cytoplasmic staining in the absence of WDR35-/- (Video 2). Why do you think this is and could this suggest a more global effect on membrane trafficking in the cell which might explain the presence of more uncoated vesicles near the basal body?</p><p>2. The CLEM-based evidence that WDR35 localizes to vesicles is also not overly convincing for vesicular association of WDR35. Since TEM sections were used as opposed to more 3D tomography it would be expected to be challenging to ensure the vesicles identified correspond to the fluorescence signal. It is also not clear how many CLEM data sets the author performed which shows clear localization to coated vesicles. Live cell imaging and/or colocalization with other vesicles trafficking markers could provide supporting evidence that WDR35 is associated with vesicles.</p><p>3. I have some concerns about conclusions made based on ciliary localization and trafficking into the cilium in WDR35-/- cilia, in particular the fact that the Actub marker used for the cilia does not always stand out from other cytoplasmic microtubules. While I appreciate that &gt;80% cells should have a short cilia in WDR35-/- it is not always clear where the cilia is in fluorescence imaging studies. There is considerable variability of Actub specific staining in cells. Issues with this and other figures are as follows. In Figure 4C for all 3 images representing WDR35 -/- conditions it is just not possible to identify precisely where the cilia is located, although it appears there is no accumulation of the lipid marker in any of the structures shown. There is a similar issue with Figure 3 Supplement 1 C in determining the length of the cilia being shown given the high non-ciliary signal observed for Actub. Figure 1D the authors indicate that the WDR35-/- cells are not polyglutamylated. It would be more convincing if another cilia marker was included since there is no quantification of the data provided or a centrosome marker was used. The conclusion reached about IFT-A components (Figure 3F) in WDR35-/- being in the transition zone seems hard to reach without the costaining with TZ markers or use of super resolution microscopy. In the case of Palmy-Myr-GFP localization for control and WDR35-/- cells, the later looks more like Golgi while the wt seems more vesicular. Thus, the authors conclusions about accumulation at the basal body of WDR35-/- is not well supported by the images shown in Figure 4C in my opinion. Overall, I find the fluorescence images could be better presented. In most cases too much space is taken up to show a field of view containing non-ciliary regions of the cell, while the centriole/cilia region are barely enlarged in cropped images. As quantification of some ciliary markers (ie TZ) was not done it might be better to show enlarged cropped areas of multiple cilia for representation.</p><p>4. Given the number of full cell/cilia tomographs I wonder if the assertion that only 1% of cilia have fused with the plasma membrane is correct. In Video 4 it appears as though the tip of the cilium is possibly outside the cell. The percentage of outside cilia could be better evaluated by In and out assays (Kukic et al., 2016).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A WDR35-dependent coat protein complex transports ciliary membrane cargo vesicles to cilia&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>We believe that the requested changes may be addressed through re-wording and edits to text improve the clarity and avoid over- or mis-interpretation and that additional data are not required, though of course may further support statements made, particularly as described by reviewer #2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have responded to my comments, particularly with respect to IFT peripheral subunits coating liposomes with specific lipid compositions. I do appreciate the novelty and the technical difficulties in carrying out TEM and CLEM experiments in the Wdr35 knockout cells and rescues, respectively. The additional Dynein 2 knockout TEM data is especially informative in suggesting that the accumulation of periciliary vesicles in Wdr35 knockout cells is unrelated to retrograde transport in cilia. However, I still have a few comments regarding these experiments and the interpretations intended for the general reader.</p><p>First, the authors have mentioned in the rebuttal that the color coding for vesicles in Figure 7A is by genotype. However, the color code keys suggest otherwise. It is confusing as all vesicles in Wdr35 knockout are not &quot;uncoated&quot;. The authors have clarified in the rebuttal that they would be uncomfortable showing the distribution of the different vesicle types, rather they quantify electron density around periciliary vesicles to show significant differences between genotypes. Thus, the terms &quot;coated vesicles&quot; and &quot;coatless vesicles&quot; in Figure 6, 7A and 9 are misleading and should be changed.</p><p>Second, I might be wrong, but I don't see how the authors show by &quot;inclusion of a wider field&quot; in the tomographic studies of Wdr35 MEFs that the &quot;vesicle accumulation is very regionalized over the 'thwarted' cilium&quot;. In the mentioned movies (Video 6, 7), I only see the predominant region around mother and daughter centrioles. To me, it is difficult to ascertain vesicles throughout an individual cell or in adjacent cells.</p><p>Third, quantification of periciliary vesicles, even from the limited number of cells observed from the single CLEM dataset as shown in Video 9, would really solidify the main message of the paper regarding accumulation of vesicles in the Wdr35 knockout.</p><p>Fourth, given the limited data shown for CLEM for rescued cells in Figure 8A, the vesicles pointed as #1 and #2 in the CLEM data do not convincingly represent, at least to me, the vesicles pointed to in the adjacent EMs. A Video for the CLEM cell shown in Figure 8B can be included for clarity.</p><p>Fifth, for the &quot;electron dense vesicles&quot; #1 and #2 shown in Figure 8A-B and the three &quot;coated&quot; vesicles shown to be &quot;fusing&quot; (apparently from another rescued cell) in Figure 8C, how are the authors sure that they are not seeing clathrin-coated vesicles to be undergoing endocytosis? Clathrin coated vesicles endocytosing are also seen in Wdr35 knockout cells in Video 7. Are similar &quot;fusions&quot; seen in the wild type cells for the &quot;coated&quot; vesicles?</p><p>Finally, the new immunogold experiments with Wdr35-GFP are not very informative and need additional controls. As the authors mentioned in the text, Wolfrum et al. (2010) showed multiple IFT-A and IFT-B proteins to localize to vesicles adjacent to the photoreceptor connecting cilia. Other IFT proteins will probably show similar pattern in the context of primary cilia.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors have added immunoEM studies to address my concerns about vesicle localization of WDR35 which is a commendable addition to this study. One suggestion is to remove the pink dots obscuring the vesicles in the EM image or use another annotation to show what structures the gold particles are associated with vesicles.</p><p>For the revised work it still remains undetermined if WDR35 requirements in vesicle trafficking are only associated with cilia. While I appreciate this is not the focus of this study, but I still feel this analysis could demonstrate more specifically whether the defect observed in vesicle accumulation is associated with cilia or not. But I appreciate the issues that the authors may have with getting additional EM, and the problems with having cells that were not ciliated. Lastly, I appreciate the addition of the rescue studies which support a role for WDR35 in regulating vesicle traffic near the cilia.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69786.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

These are extensive studies beyond the scope of this manuscript but will be pursued in the future. In the interim, we have toned down the text accordingly throughout to reflect this uncertainty. See lines 406, 442 and 519 of the marked revision.docx, for example.</p><p>As a control for mutant cells under the same ciliation conditions as our wild type and <italic>Dync2h1</italic> controls, we have included an increased field of view of the tomogram (new Video 7) of the original segmented tomogram of the periciliary vesicles which fail to fuse with the mutant ciliary pocket and ciliary sheath (Video 6). This captures not only a larger view of the original ciliating cell, but also the edges of two adjacent mutant cells grown under the same conditions. It is very apparent that the vesicle traffic defect is spatially restricted to the ‘thwarted’ mutant cilium, whilst the periphery of mutant cells is not affected (see new Figure 6—figure supplement 3). This supports that the defects observed in <italic>Wdr35</italic> mutant cells are not a global membrane traffic defect, but rather a focal disruption of targeted vesicles to developing the cilium. A statement has been added (lines 486-489) to make this clearer to readers and we thank reviewers for this helpful suggestion.</p><p>We have extended our analysis of the WDR35::EmEGFP rescue of the vesicle traffic defects of <italic>Wdr35</italic> mutants with tomograms of new cells showing reappearance of electron-dense coated vesicles and reversal of the vesicle pile-up observed in mutants (new Video 9). Accordingly, we even capture an electron-dense vesicle fusing at the ciliary base of rescued cell (new Figure 8C, Figure 8—figure supplement 1). Given limitations of time, lab moves and man power, we were unfortunately unable to segment these tomograms but they are very clear as to the reversal of mutant phenotypes. Segmentation is done manually and is very onerous. We hope the reviewers are satisfied with this expanded qualitative analysis, instead of a quantitative one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The singular identification of PA as the lipid to which IFT-A complexes bind also would be strengthened by additional data, or at least qualifiers in the text regarding the limits of the sole assay employed and interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree completely with the reviewers. We are excited to include specific composition liposome binding assays in our revised work. Here we show that purified IFT-A non-core trimer binding specifically to liposomes composed of PE/PG/PA but not to POPC controls (see new Figure 5D). From this liposome assay, we speculate that IFT139 binding to the IFT121/43 dimer increases the binding affinity to lipids. Indeed, on its own, the IFT-A dimer signal is below the threshold of detection in the protein-lipid overlay assays but observed to weakly associate to PA-containing liposomes. Unfortunately, our attempts to better visualize structure through cryoEM of the purified IFT-A trimer with lipids have stumbled as the trimer disassembled on the cryo-EM grids during girds vitrification as the dramatically increased water-air interface, while the negative staining EM gave too low resolution images to enable us getting a higher resolution binding model. We continue to work to troubleshoot this by preventing the sample from disassembly using crosslinking and cryo-EM grids with supported film.</p><p>This is in addition to the lipid strip overlays, showing specific interactions to PA, as well as a lesser extent PS (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1D). These are all negatively charged (anionic) phosphoglycerates and importantly the trimer shows no binding to neutral or inositol-based lipids as had been reported for the IFT-A adaptor TULP3 (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2010). We have expanded our discussion of the biological importance of PA and possible implications supporting this being a novel and distinct mechanism for IFT-A membrane association.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Unfortunately for the quantification of cilia length in Figures 2A and 3F, as highlighted by reviewer 3, we are limited in mouse cells to availability of robust antibodies in a third species for co-localization studies (i.e. here we use AcTub (mouse) and IFT antibodies (rabbit)). We have added additional transition zone images as requested by reviewer 3.</p><p>To supplement our CLEM data, we have included immunoEM data showing gold-conjugated anti-GFP shows sparse but specific labelling in close proximity at the ciliary base and along the ciliary sheath at putative vesicles in <italic>Wdr35::EmEGFP</italic> rescued <italic>Wdr35</italic> mutant MEFs as well as along the axoneme (see new Figure 8—figure supplement 2).

It is extremely labour intensive and unfortunately, we do not currently have the hands or time for this work due to lab moves and contracts. In the revised version, we have included extensive additional high quality qualitative data we hope will satisfy the reviewer including tomograms of additional rescued cells showing reversal of vesicle accumulation phenotypes, reappearance of coated vesicles including ones that fuse in addition to restoration of ciliogenesis (see new Figure 8C, Figure 8—figure supplement 1 and Video 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show nicely the quantification of all vesicles in figure 7B-C, but the distribution in coated vs noncoated vesicles should be shown as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We gently remind the reviewer that whilst beautiful quality, our datasets are from chemically fixed in-situ electron microscopy and this type of analysis is normally done exclusively on cryoEM samples. The reviewer is correct there is a mix of densities on vesicles in controls which is why we set-out ambitiously to non-biasedly call densities on all segmented vesicles in our chemically fixed samples, as shown in Figure 7F. This panel captures imperfectly the distribution of densities on all vesicles between genotypes but we felt the best way to present the data. This coated versus noncoated breakdown analysis of vesicles would be best suited to future cryoEM studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Any cargo that can be immunolocalized to these vesicles might be a way to address concerns regarding specificity of coat containing cilia destined cargoes.

We agree completely with the reviewer there is room for improvement and are actively continuing to look for ciliary cargos co-localizing with these coated vesicles. The technical challenges remain that: (a) these vesicles are relatively small and (b) labelling density of many cargos or putative coats is sparse compared to the cilia proper. The latter causes issues as the super-resolution necessary to capture these structures with modalities like STED bleach much faster than the more densely labelled cilia compartments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Considering that the coat might result from Wdr35 associated proteins, it might be relevant to phenocopy Wdr35 knockout with respect to cells lacking other subunits of IFT-A complex to solidify the coat hypothesis. Lack of another peripheral subunit Ift139 does not cause lack of Smoothened or Arl13b in cilia (Hirano et al., 2016). Thus, it might be relevant to test or speculate on some of these other constituents.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we absolutely agree with this savvy reviewer. Future studies will look to expand our analysis to other IFT-A subunit mutants to further solidify our coat hypothesis, particularly core as well as additional non-core mutants. In vertebrates, IFT139 is enigmatic as it has had a duplication, such that <italic>Thm1</italic> and <italic>Thm2</italic> may have distinct and overlapping functions to explain some of these differences reported in mammalian cells (Wang et al. 2020 <italic>FASEB J</italic>). In contrast, in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, <italic>ift139/fla17</italic> temperature sensitive mutants show decreased flagellar levels of bacterial ion channel rhodopsins at permissive temperatures and loss of flagella at non-permissive temperatures where the rhodopsins mislocalize around the basal bodies (Awasthi et al. 2016 <italic>Sci Reports;</italic> Iomini et al. 2009 <italic>Genetics</italic>). There is lots of scope to explore some of these exciting questions in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure 3.

The total protein immunoblots (Figure 3C) and quantification (Figure 3D) represent the total levels of IFT-A components showing that total levels of individual core components are unchanged however their assembly into core IFT-A complexes is compromised without WDR35. In contrast, the non-core components are unstable without WDR35, independent of a complex. The increased levels of IFT122 were observed specifically in the MEF samples as shown in Figure 3 Figure Supplement 1A, through its 4 biological replicates however not in embryo extracts shown in the main figures.

Please note that phosphatidic acid is an extremely transient lipid and is also present in other organelles such as ER. The lipid-strip assay interactions could be confirmed by liposome assays. Other core subunit complexes could be tested in the assay.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we agree completely with the reviewer. We are excited to include specific composition liposome binding assays in our revised work. Here we show that purified IFT-A non-core trimer binding specifically to liposomes composed of PE/PG/PA but not to POPC controls (see new Figure 5D). From this liposome assay, we speculate that IFT139 binding to the IFT121/43 dimer increases the binding affinity to lipids. Indeed, on its own, the IFT-A dimer signal is below the threshold of detection in the protein-lipid overlay assays but observed to weakly associate to PAcontaining liposomes. Unfortunately, our attempts to better visualize structure through negative EM or cryoEM of the purified IFT-A trimer with lipids have stumbled as the trimer disassembled on the cryo-EM grids during girds vitrification as the dramatically increased water-air interface, while the negative staining EM are with too low resolution images to give us to a higher resolution binding model. We continue to work to troubleshoot this. The Lorentzen group also continues to valiantly try to isolate the entire IFT-A complex and despite their extensive expertise in IFT structures are struggling to solubilize the 6 component complex, which is why we have focused on the soluble noncore trimer for this current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

To overcome bias, we undertook an automated postacquisition analysis pipeline where segmented vesicles on the raw EM images to quantify integrated density in 20 nm ring around every segmented object in 3D. This was imperfect as objects were manually drawn and sometimes crossed the membrane of the vesicles and in cases of the mutants where there were very dense vesicles that 20 nm band would overlap with other vesicle membranes. However, it was automatic and the best we could do with our chemically fixed datasets.</p><p>The discrepancy in numbers reflects how few vesicles are observed in control cell tomograms as compared to similar numbers of mutant cells.

Inclusion of controls (non-ciliating) for WDR35-/- would help establish if the uncoated vesicles near the base of the cilia observed by electron microscopy are in fact associated with ciliogenesis. It is interesting that Arl13b displays strong PM/cytoplasmic staining in the absence of WDR35-/- (Video 2). Why do you think this is and could this suggest a more global effect on membrane trafficking in the cell which might explain the presence of more uncoated vesicles near the basal body?</p></disp-quote><p>The question of non-ciliating <italic>Wdr35</italic> controls would have been another huge experiment with additional optimization steps as it appears all of the cells we captured were undergoing ciliogenesis. Importantly, they were also matched with <italic>Dync2h1</italic> and wild type cells grown under the same conditions, which we would also have had to repeat to capture an earlier or different time point/condition. We believe the reviewer is asking about whether the defects in vesicle traffic are due to failure in ciliogenesis or changes in more global membrane traffic. An alternate control to address this in mutant cells under the same ciliation conditions as our wild type and <italic>Dync2h1</italic> controls is an increased field of view (new Video 7) of the original segmented tomogram of the periciliary vesicles which fail to fuse with the mutant ciliary pocket and ciliary sheath (Video 6). This captures not only a larger view of the original ciliating cell, but also the edges of two adjacent mutant cells grown under the same conditions. It is very apparent that the vesicle traffic defect is spatially restricted to the ‘thwarted’ mutant cilium, whilst the periphery of mutant cells is not affected (see new Figure 6 Figure Supplement 3). This supports that the defects observed in <italic>Wdr35</italic> mutant cells are not a global membrane traffic defect, but rather a focal disruption of targeted vesicles to developing the cilium. A statement has been added (lines 486-489 of marked revision.docx) to make this clearer to readers and we thank reviewers for this helpful suggestion. The plasma membrane accumulation of overexpressed ARL13B likely reflects the high level expression without compartment to traffic it to. In wild type cells, when ARL13B is over expressed we can also occasionally detect low level plasma membrane expression (whilst the bulk is in the cilium) suggesting it is a default when normal ciliary traffic mechanisms are overwhelmed or non-functional.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The CLEM-based evidence that WDR35 localizes to vesicles is also not overly convincing for vesicular association of WDR35. Since TEM sections were used as opposed to more 3D tomography it would be expected to be challenging to ensure the vesicles identified correspond to the fluorescence signal. It is also not clear how many CLEM data sets the author performed which shows clear localization to coated vesicles. Live cell imaging and/or colocalization with other vesicles trafficking markers could provide supporting evidence that WDR35 is associated with vesicles.</p></disp-quote><p>There is a single CLEM dataset used in the paper using the pseudo-super resolution 3D AiryScan on cells grown on grids which were then used for serial TEM sections through the entire cell. These experiments were carried out by the first author on a short-term visit to Dresden MPICBG where the TEM was done. The Mill lab continues to try to optimize markers of different membrane and vesicular compartments with WDR35 for co-localization studies, as well as endogenous tagging strategies for CLEM, as we agree this is important for future work. In the interim, to supplement our CLEM data, we have included immunoEM data showing gold-conjugated anti-GFP shows sparse but specific labelling in close proximity at the ciliary base and along the ciliary sheath at putative vesicles in WDR35::EmEGFP rescued <italic>Wdr35</italic> mutant MEFs as well as along the axoneme (see new Figure 8—figure supplement 2). It is important to note here that EmGFP epitopes were exposed to GFP antibodies by making 70nm thick serial sections of entire cell which explains the sparse but specific labelling. Cells are not permeabilised to preserve the membranes and vesicles. We continue to work to improve our strategies and protocols to better visualize sparse staining such as IFT-As whilst retaining both membrane and microtubule ultrastructures in mammalian cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I have some concerns about conclusions made based on ciliary localization and trafficking into the cilium in WDR35-/- cilia, in particular the fact that the Actub marker used for the cilia does not always stand out from other cytoplasmic microtubules. While I appreciate that &gt;80% cells should have a short cilia in WDR35-/- it is not always clear where the cilia is in fluorescence imaging studies. There is considerable variability of Actub specific staining in cells. Issues with this and other figures are as follows. In Figure 4C for all 3 images representing WDR35 -/- conditions it is just not possible to identify precisely where the cilia is located, although it appears there is no accumulation of the lipid marker in any of the structures shown. There is a similar issue with Figure 3 Supplement 1 C in determining the length of the cilia being shown given the high non-ciliary signal observed for Actub. Figure 1D the authors indicate that the WDR35-/- cells are not polyglutamylated. It would be more convincing if another cilia marker was included since there is no quantification of the data provided or a centrosome marker was used. The conclusion reached about IFT-A components (Figure 3F) in WDR35-/- being in the transition zone seems hard to reach without the costaining with TZ markers or use of super resolution microscopy. In the case of Palmy-Myr-GFP localization for control and WDR35-/- cells, the later looks more like Golgi while the wt seems more vesicular. Thus, the authors conclusions about accumulation at the basal body of WDR35-/- is not well supported by the images shown in Figure 4C in my opinion. Overall, I find the fluorescence images could be better presented. In most cases too much space is taken up to show a field of view containing non-ciliary regions of the cell, while the centriole/cilia region are barely enlarged in cropped images. As quantification of some ciliary markers (ie TZ) was not done it might be better to show enlarged cropped areas of multiple cilia for representation.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately for the quantification of cilia length in Figures 2A and 3F, as highlighted by reviewer 3, we are limited in mouse cells to availability of robust antibodies in a third species for colocalization studies (e.i. here we use AcTub (mouse) and IFT antibodies (rabbit)). Most available TZ markers were custom-made rabbit requested from other labs or no longer available (Santa Cruz large animals) aside from polyglutamylated tubulin (mouse), whose absence at the TZ is useful only if there is a marked axoneme on the other side which there is not in Wdr35 mutants. We have added in additional panels of cilia between genotypes focusing on the transition zone markers, as requested and reordered Figure 1 to enlarge these panels. Also without a TZ marker, we have altered the text to read ‘In contrast, in Wdr35<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs, IFT-A core components fail to enter cilia and remain restricted at the ciliary base (Figure 3F),’ (line 225 of revised marked.docx) and edited similarly in the abstract. We also increased the panel sizes where possible for Figure 3F and Figure 4B, C. We changed the text summarizing localization of lipidated GFPs to read ‘In marked contrast to WT cells, in Wdr35<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs, both the myristoylation and palmitoylation (MyrPalm) or dual palmitoylation (PalmPalm) EGFP failed to concentrate in mutant cilia (Figure 4C)’ (Line 390-401). We agree with the reviewer where these mislocalized cargos end up requires additional markers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Given the number of full cell/cilia tomographs I wonder if the assertion that only 1% of cilia have fused with the plasma membrane is correct. In Video 4 it appears as though the tip of the cilium is possibly outside the cell. The percentage of outside cilia could be better evaluated by In and out assays (Kukic et al., 2016).</p></disp-quote><p>‘In and out’ assays would be a great way to validate this point but as it is very minor to our narrative, we have simply edited the text to read ‘very few (~1 %) cilia’ (line 427, marked revision.docx). (The ‘~’ was lost initially in my poor mastery of LaTeX and symbols). We looked at over 100 cells in these extensive analyses and our numbers are similar to what had been reported in the Molla-Herman paper for RPE-1 cells (Molla-Herman et al., 2010). The reviewer is very astute and correct indeed in Video 4 the last few frames are of a cilia tip emerging from the cell although the bulk of the axoneme is still internal, within the ciliary sheath.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors have responded to my comments, particularly with respect to IFT peripheral subunits coating liposomes with specific lipid compositions. I do appreciate the novelty and the technical difficulties in carrying out TEM and CLEM experiments in the Wdr35 knockout cells and rescues, respectively. The additional Dynein 2 knockout TEM data is especially informative in suggesting that the accumulation of periciliary vesicles in Wdr35 knockout cells is unrelated to retrograde transport in cilia. However, I still have a few comments regarding these experiments and the interpretations intended for the general reader.</p><p>First, the authors have mentioned in the rebuttal that the color coding for vesicles in Figure 7A is by genotype. However, the color code keys suggest otherwise. It is confusing as all vesicles in Wdr35 knockout are not &quot;uncoated&quot;. The authors have clarified in the rebuttal that they would be uncomfortable showing the distribution of the different vesicle types, rather they quantify electron density around periciliary vesicles to show significant differences between genotypes. Thus, the terms &quot;coated vesicles&quot; and &quot;coatless vesicles&quot; in Figure 6, 7A and 9 are misleading and should be changed.</p></disp-quote><p>Although concerns about the usage of terms were not initially raised, in order to satisfy this reviewer, we have added the following statement to the Materials and methods section for Transmission Electron Microscopy for clarity on how they were assigned. ‘In wild type cells, very few vesicles are observed around the base of the cilia which mostly have electron-dense coats with a range of intensities, including those observed fusing with the ciliary pocket or sheath. For simplicity, we have labeled these as 'coated' and coloured them magenta. By comparison, the accumulation of vesicles around the base of Wdr35 mutant cilia generally lack prominent densities around them. For simplicity, we have labeled these as 'coatless' and coloured them cyan, as whether coats previously existed but disassembled or whether they failed to form in the first place is not clear from our study.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, I might be wrong, but I don't see how the authors show by &quot;inclusion of a wider field&quot; in the tomographic studies of Wdr35 MEFs that the &quot;vesicle accumulation is very regionalized over the 'thwarted' cilium&quot;. In the mentioned movies (Video 6, 7), I only see the predominant region around mother and daughter centrioles. To me, it is difficult to ascertain vesicles throughout an individual cell or in adjacent cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Video 7 corresponds to new Figure 6—figure supplement 3, which is made by stitching three sequential sections together and covers a whopping 9.3 µm * 9.3 µm field of view in XY and 900 nm in the Z-axis of three cells. To walk the reviewer through the events we capture in this volume, we provide the following description. Section1 (Z-STEP 0 to STEP 140) has a daughter centriole almost at the centre of the field of view and a few primarily coatless vesicles around its radius of 2 µm. Within this XY field of 9 µm * 9 µm, we do not see any vesicles away from the daughter centriole or close to or budding from the cell membrane in this section. Next section2 (Z-STEP 141 to STEP 264) has the basal body of the central cell. Again, although we see mostly coatless vesicles close to the basal body, no such vesicles are present at a distance from it. Coatless vesicles are also not seen close to the cell membrane or budding/fusing with the cell membrane. However, we did see clathrin-like vesicles with very pronounced electron densities close to and budding from the cell membrane. Three such vesicles are budding from the central cell are indicated by white arrows, with an additional one in the upper cell indicated by the black arrow in this section. Next, section-3 (Z-STEP 265 to STEP 420) has the transition zone of the central cell surrounded by mostly coatless vesicles in the periciliary space. Again, we do not see coatless vesicles beyond the 2 µm XY radius of the cilium, and none of these are budding from the cell membrane. This section also has clathrin-like electron-dense vesicles endocytosing from the cell membrane. One clathrin-like vesicle is seen budding from the central cell (white arrow), three from the upper cell (black arrow), and one from the third cell in the right (cyan arrow) in this section. In summary, this Video clearly shows the massive accumulation of mostly coatless vesicles in the periciliary space specifically and these accumulations are not found at a distance from it. We emphasize, that we have covered a very large volume of the cell while maintaining the resolution of our EM ultrastructure, which this reviewer fails to appreciate. To help explain this more clearly to our audience, we have now added these dimensions and edited the Figure 6—figure supplement 3 figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, quantification of periciliary vesicles, even from the limited number of cells observed from the single CLEM dataset as shown in Video 9, would really solidify the main message of the paper regarding accumulation of vesicles in the Wdr35 knockout.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified rescued cell vesicle numbers and fusion events in this revision as new Figure 8D. To clarify, Video 9, Figure 8C and Figure 8- supplement 1 where not from the CLEM dataset shown in Figure 8A, B rather similar conditions without the AiryScan imaging. We have edited Figure 8C and Figure 8—figure supplement 1 to help clarify which panels came from which experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fourth, given the limited data shown for CLEM for rescued cells in Figure 8A, the vesicles pointed as #1 and #2 in the CLEM data do not convincingly represent, at least to me, the vesicles pointed to in the adjacent EMs. A Video for the CLEM cell shown in Figure 8B can be included for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>The CLEM dataset is very limited. There are a few 70nm sections for TEM available for the cell used for CLEM; we show six of the twelve serial micrographs available for this cell in Figure 8A (Z=1,3,4,8,9, and 10). Tomograms are unfortunately not available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fifth, for the &quot;electron dense vesicles&quot; #1 and #2 shown in Figure 8A-B and the three &quot;coated&quot; vesicles shown to be &quot;fusing&quot; (apparently from another rescued cell) in Figure 8C, how are the authors sure that they are not seeing clathrin-coated vesicles to be undergoing endocytosis? Clathrin coated vesicles endocytosing are also seen in Wdr35 knockout cells in Video 7. Are similar &quot;fusions&quot; seen in the wild type cells for the &quot;coated&quot; vesicles?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is confused: 8C was Z sections through the same fusing vesicle, shown in full in Video 9. The cell shown in Video 9 and Figure 8C is different than cell used for CLEM in Figure 8A,B, which shows two coated vesicles at the base of another rescued cell. We spend significant time discussing why we do not believe these coated vesicles to be clathrin in the second paragraph of the discussion. Similar fusions are indeed seen in wild type cells (see Figure 6—figure supplement 1), and these fusion events are lacking in the mutants even when vesicles are closely apposed to the ciliary sheath see Figure 7 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2 (asterisks). We do not believe these are clathrin vesicles endocytosing because we can rescue them in <italic>Wdr35</italic> mutants by expressing WDR35, not clathrin or clathrin regulators. The reviewer is correct that we see several clathrin-like vesicles in the <italic>Wdr35</italic> null (Video 7), however these are always seen budding from the cell membrane and not the ciliary pocket. In contrast, in the wild type and rescued cells, we see coated vesicles fusing the ciliary pocket or sheath, and around the cilia base.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the new immunogold experiments with Wdr35-GFP are not very informative and need additional controls. As the authors mentioned in the text, Wolfrum et al. (2010) showed multiple IFT-A and IFT-B proteins to localize to vesicles adjacent to the photoreceptor connecting cilia. Other IFT proteins will probably show similar pattern in the context of primary cilia.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very disappointed this reviewer does not feel the addition of immunoEM is ‘very informative’. We have added controls including secondary only controls and non-transfected (thus expressing GFP) controls to highlight the specificity of the WDR35 immunogold signal, see Figure 8—figure supplement 3. We have also taken Reviewer 3’s suggestion to mark putative vesicles as pink outlines as opposed to objects, as done in the Sedmak and Wolfrum 2010 paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
