However, whether and how cells use SFs to migrate in vivo or collectively is largely unknown. Studying the collective migration of the follicular epithelial cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we found that the SFs in these cells show a novel treadmilling behavior that allows them to persist as the cells migrate over multiple cell lengths. Treadmilling SFs grow at their fronts by adding new integrin-based adhesions and actomyosin segments over time. This causes the SFs to have many internal adhesions along their lengths, instead of adhesions only at the ends. The front-forming adhesions remain stationary relative to the substrate and typically disassemble as the cell rear approaches. By contrast, a different type of adhesion forms at the SF’s terminus that slides with the cell’s trailing edge as the actomyosin ahead of it shortens. We further show that SF treadmilling depends on cell movement and identify a developmental switch in the formins that mediate SF assembly, with Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis acting during migratory stages and Diaphanous acting during postmigratory stages. We propose that treadmilling SFs keep each cell on a linear trajectory, thereby promoting the collective motility required for epithelial migration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stress fiber</kwd><kwd>focal adhesion</kwd><kwd>collective cell migration</kwd><kwd>epithelium</kwd><kwd>treadmilling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM126047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horne-Badovinac</surname><given-names>Sally</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM136961</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horne-Badovinac</surname><given-names>Sally</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007183</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cetera</surname><given-names>Maureen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stress fibers with multiple adhesions along their lengths and treadmilling dynamics may help migrating epithelial cells maintain a linear trajectory and thereby reinforce their collective motility.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Migrating cells rely on dynamic networks of filamentous actin (F-actin) for their motility. For cells migrating on two-dimensional substrates, these include the branched networks that underly lamellipodial protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ridley, 2011</xref>) and the stress fibers (SFs) that mediate much of the cell’s interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM). SFs are prominent F-actin bundles that have been categorized into different types based on their origin, subcellular location, and how they interact with nonmuscle myosin II and integrin-based focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burridge and Guilluy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burridge and Wittchen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Naumanen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tojkander et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vallenius, 2013</xref>). The most studied SF types have myosin along their lengths and large focal adhesions at either end; these include ventral SFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tojkander et al., 2015</xref>) and the recently defined cortical SFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lehtimäki et al., 2021</xref>). SFs play key roles in focal adhesion maturation, defining the cell’s front–rear axis, retraction of the trailing edge, and sensing the mechanical properties of the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lehtimäki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Livne and Geiger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schwartz, 2010</xref>). However, our current knowledge of SFs in migrating cells comes almost entirely from studies of individual cells on nonnative substrates. Whether and how cells use SFs to migrate in vivo or as part of a collective is largely unknown.</p><p>In this study, we use an in vivo system, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg chamber, to probe SF dynamics in collectively migrating epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cetera and Horne-Badovinac, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horne-Badovinac and Bilder, 2005</xref>). An egg chamber is an ovarian follicle that will give rise to one egg. It has a central cluster of germ cells surrounded by a somatic follicular epithelium; a basement membrane ECM encapsulates the entire structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). During early stages of oogenesis, the basal surfaces of the follicle cells collectively migrate along the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cetera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewellyn et al., 2013</xref>). This causes the entire egg chamber to rotate within the basement membrane, which itself remains stationary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haigo and Bilder, 2011</xref>). During this migration, each follicle cell has actin-based protrusions at its leading edge and a parallel array of SFs across its basal surface that are oriented in the direction of tissue movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cetera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutzeit, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At later stages when the follicle cells have stopped migrating, the density of SFs across the basal surface increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delon and Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutzeit, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gutzeit, 1990</xref>), and their contractile activity helps to create the elongated shape of the egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cerqueira Campos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Introduction to the stress fibers (SFs) in collectively migrating follicle cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Composite images of an egg chamber (pseudocolored), transverse section above and 3D cutaway view below.

We further show that these SFs undergo a novel treadmilling behavior that allows them to persist as the cell migrates over more than one cell length. Treadmilling SFs grow at their fronts by adding new adhesions and actomyosin segments over time. These front-forming adhesions remain stationary relative to the substrate, transition to being internal adhesions, and typically disassemble as the cell rear approaches. By contrast, a different type of adhesion forms at the SF terminus that appears to slide with the cell’s trailing edge as the actomyosin segment ahead of it shortens. Blocking migration causes the internal adhesions to disappear and the treadmilling behavior to stop, which shows that the modular SF architecture depends on cell movement. We further identify a developmental switch in the formins required for SF assembly, with Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis (DAAM) contributing to treadmilling SFs during migratory stages and Diaphanous (Dia) contributing to the more canonical SFs that form once migration has ceased. We propose that treadmilling SFs ensure that each epithelial cell maintains a linear trajectory and thereby promote the highly orchestrated collective motility required for tissue-scale movement.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Migrating follicle cells have long-lived, treadmilling SFs</title><p>To visualize SF dynamics in living follicle cells, we used Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-tagged and mCherry (mCh)-tagged versions of the regulatory light chain of myosin II (MRLC, Spaghetti Squash in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and near total internal reflection fluorescence (near-TIRF) microscopy (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>).

Only actomyosin fibers that spanned at least half the cell’s length were tracked. Through this assay, we determined that these SFs have a half-life of 34 min. This is clearly an underestimate, however, as only 60% of SFs both appeared and disappeared during the 60-min window. For 32% of SFs, we saw either their appearance or disappearance but not both. The remaining 8% persisted for the entire 60 min. We then used the same dataset to analyze the relationship between SF lifetimes and the distance traveled by the cell. The follicle cells migrated a mean distance of 16.8 µm in this assay, corresponding to a mean of 2.2 cell lengths. Strikingly, 62% of SFs persisted for longer than the time required for the cell to travel at least one cell length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Given that SFs are attached to an immobile substrate by integrin-based adhesions, we reasoned that the entire actomyosin fiber must be treadmilling (i.e., growing at the front and shrinking at the back). Indeed, new actomyosin segments are added to the front of existing SFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>), which explains their persistence. Hereafter we refer to these long-lived SFs as ‘treadmilling stress fibers’.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Treadmilling SFs have many adhesions along their lengths</title><p>To understand the treadmilling behavior of the SFs, we examined their associated integrin-based adhesions. Previous descriptions of these adhesions in follicle cells primarily focused on later stages of egg chamber development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delon and Brown, 2009</xref>), after the follicle cells have ceased migrating. At these later stages, the SFs are increased in density across the basal surface, and they exhibit the canonical organization with large focal adhesions at their ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D, G</xref>). By contrast, the SFs present during migratory stages have many smaller adhesions along their lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cetera et al., 2014</xref>), with an average of 5.5 adhesions per fiber. This phenomenon is easiest to see when Paxillin-GFP is overexpressed (UAS-Pax-GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>); however, we also see multiple adhesions with endogenous GFP tags on Paxillin, Talin, and the βPS-integrin subunit, Myospheroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>).

This analysis showed that new adhesions and new segments of actomyosin are continuously added to the front of a SF over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). A front-forming adhesion typically first appears near the cell’s leading edge and grows in brightness as an actomyosin segment coalesces behind it to link the new adhesion to an existing SF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). New adhesions are also pulled slightly rearward, consistent with their maturing under tension. The front-forming adhesions then remain stationary relative to the basement membrane substrate.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Adhesions are continuously added and removed from treadmilling stress fibers (SFs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Kymograph of one SF from the white boxed region in (<bold>B</bold>) showing the appearance and disappearance of adhesions and actomyosin segments over time.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined SFs in clones of cells expressing RNAi against the Abi or Sra1 components of the Scar/WAVE complex. These mosaic epithelia retain the ability to migrate because the RNAi-expressing cells are carried along by their wild-type neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cetera et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, the SFs within the RNAi-expressing clones show the same modular architecture and treadmilling behavior as wild-type SFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E</xref>).

Using a line in which DAAM is endogenously tagged with GFP (DAAM-GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Molnár et al., 2014</xref>), we found that DAAM localizes largely uniformly within the cortex with no obvious enrichment on SFs or adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>). DAAM-depleted cells have the same density of SFs across their basal surfaces as control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, D</xref>); each one simply has reduced levels of F-actin, myosin, and the focal adhesion protein Talin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C, E, F</xref>). These findings suggest that DAAM-depleted cells may adhere less well to the ECM. We previously showed that a mild reduction in cell–ECM adhesion increases the speed of follicle cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewellyn et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, mean migration rates for DAAM-depleted epithelia are faster than for control epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that DAAM contributes to the assembly of treadmilling SFs by adding new F-actin along their lengths, and/or by contributing F-actin to the basal cortex, and that this additional F-actin strengthens cell–ECM adhesion.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis (DAAM) localizes to the cortex and likely strengthens cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion via stress fibers (SFs).</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Images of DAAM-GFP (endogenous tag).

However, whether and how cells use SFs to migrate on their native substrates in vivo remains largely unexplored. Focusing on the follicular epithelial cells of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we found that their SFs display a novel treadmilling behavior that allows individual SFs to persist as the cells migrate over more than one cell length. The discovery of these long-lived contractile structures has important implications for our understanding of SF dynamics, the influence that different SF types can have on cell motility, and how SF structure and function can change as a tissue develops, each of which is discussed below.</p><p>We found that SFs in migrating follicle cells have internal adhesions along their lengths, in addition to adhesions at the ends. These internal adhesions are key to the treadmilling behavior. When a new adhesion and actomyosin segment are added to the front of an existing SF, the previous front adhesion becomes an internal adhesion. In this way, the formation of internal adhesions depends on treadmilling. Once formed, the internal adhesions then contribute to treadmilling by generating the modular SF architecture needed for older stationary adhesions to be disassembled near the cell’s rear and allow the back of the SF to shorten. To our knowledge this is the first study to focus on the role of internal adhesions in SF dynamics, but there are hints in the literature that these structures may exist in other cells. For example, SFs isolated from human foreskin fibroblasts and bovine endothelial cells have small puncta of the focal adhesion protein vinculin along their lengths in addition to prominent vinculin puncta at their ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katoh et al., 1998</xref>), and the cortical SFs in cultured mesenchymal cells were sometimes observed to have more than two adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lehtimäki et al., 2021</xref>). Internal adhesions have also been invoked as a possible explanation for the buckling pattern observed when SFs are rapidly compressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kassianidou and Kumar, 2015</xref>). Because internal adhesions are attached to two aligned actomyosin segments, they likely experience more balanced pulling forces than end adhesions, which may affect their composition and/or organization. It is also likely, however, that there is still higher tension on one side of the adhesion due to forces exerted by cell movement. Determining the extent to which internal adhesions are found in other cell types and how they differ from end adhesions represent important areas for future research.</p><p>A treadmilling SF grows at its front when a new adhesion and new actomyosin segment appear nearly simultaneously ahead of the foremost adhesion. How do these new elements arise? We envision that the new actomyosin segment captures a nearby nascent adhesion that has formed just behind the cell’s leading edge, and that this activity both links the nascent adhesion to the existing SF and induces it to mature. Our finding that DAAM is required for robust SF formation also suggests two hypotheses for the source of the F-actin for the new actomyosin segment. One possibility is that DAAM localizes to nascent and mature adhesions, causing actin filaments to grow out from these sites, like the role ascribed to Dia in dorsal SF formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oakes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tojkander et al., 2011</xref>). Bundling of the DAAM-generated filaments by myosin could then link the nascent adhesion to the mature adhesion. Alternatively, DAAM could play a more general role in contributing F-actin to the basal cortex along with other actin assembly factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chugh and Paluch, 2018</xref>), with local pulses of myosin activity near the cell’s leading-edge condensing the cortical F-actin meshwork to form the new actomyosin segment. We favor the second model for two reasons. First, DAAM is found throughout the cortex with no obvious enrichment at adhesions. Second, treadmilling SFs closely resemble other SF types that arise from the cortex and/or are embedded within it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lehtimäki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Svitkina, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vignaud et al., 2020</xref>), as they lie so flat against the basal surface that we can visualize them with near-TIRF microscopy. This contrasts with ventral SFs whose center can arch away from the migratory surface. However, future work will be required to distinguish between these possibilities.</p><p>A treadmilling SF shrinks at its back using a mechanism involving an adhesion that slides along the substrate as the actomyosin segment in front of it shortens. These rear-most sliding adhesions are strikingly similar to those found in individual migrating cells in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ballestrem et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Digman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laukaitis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rid et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smilenov et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wehrle-Haller and Imhof, 2003</xref>), in that they primarily form near the cell’s trailing edge and then track with its movement. In migrating cells, sliding adhesions have been proposed to act as rudders that help to steer the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rid et al., 2005</xref>). In stationary cells, sliding adhesions can also remodel the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zamir et al., 2000</xref>). Given that one of the purposes of follicle cell migration is to polarize the basement membrane ECM over which they move (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutzeit, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haigo and Bilder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Isabella and Horne-Badovinac, 2016</xref>), it is interesting to speculate that sliding adhesions could function in both roles in these cells.</p><p>The modular architecture and unidirectional growth of a treadmilling SF both depend on cell movement. We found this relationship by comparing two conditions that eliminate leading-edge protrusions. In one condition, we eliminated protrusions from a clone of cells. Here, the epithelium continues to migrate, carrying the nonprotrusive cells along for the ride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cetera et al., 2014</xref>). The SFs in the clone are indistinguishable from those in wild-type cells, showing that protrusive F-actin networks are not required for treadmilling SFs to form. In the other condition, we eliminated protrusions from the entire tissue, which does block epithelial migration. Here, the SFs transition to having large adhesions only at their ends, but they are not stationary. Instead, when a new SF forms, it continuously shortens toward the middle until it disappears with no new material added to the ends. This movement is reminiscent of the way a treadmilling SF normally shortens at its rear, except that it happens from both ends. This raises the possibility that these SFs have lost their polarity and have two ‘backs’. If true, studies of these aberrant SF dynamics could help to reveal how a treadmilling SF becomes polarized for unidirectional movement.</p><p>We propose that treadmilling SFs may be particularly well suited to mediate the collective migration of epithelial cells. Cells that migrate as individuals can undergo frequent turns as they explore their environment. By contrast, each follicle cell follows a roughly linear trajectory over its entire migratory period, which can last for up to 2 days of egg chamber development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cetera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horne-Badovinac and Bilder, 2005</xref>). The follicle cells use intercellular signaling to align all their front–rear axes in the same direction across the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stedden et al., 2019</xref>). Once this alignment is achieved, however, the long lifetimes and unidirectional growth of their SFs likely reinforce this tissue-scale order by ensuring that each cell maintains the linear trajectory required for the entire epithelium to move in a directed way. Given that the collective migration of epithelial cells plays central roles in morphogenesis, turnover of the intestinal lining, wound repair, and the metastatic cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friedl and Gilmour, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jain et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mishra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scarpa and Mayor, 2016</xref>), the use of treadmilling SFs to direct cell motility in natural contexts may be widespread.</p><p>Finally, this work highlights how SFs within a given cell type can change in both their structure and mode of assembly as a tissue develops. When follicle cell migration ends, the SFs take on a new morphogenetic role in which their contractile activity helps to create the elongated shape of the egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cerqueira Campos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2010</xref>). This change in function is accompanied by a change in SF organization, in which the density of SFs across the basal surface increases, internal adhesions disappear, and large focal adhesions become concentrated at the fibers’ ends. Previous work revealed that the focal adhesions associated with the two SF types differ, with αPS1/βPS being present during migratory stages and αPS2/βPS taking over after migration is complete; tensin is also only present in postmigratory stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delon and Brown, 2009</xref>). We have now found that even the mode of F-actin assembly differs, with DAAM mediating the formation of SFs in migratory cells and Dia mediating their formation postmigration, a result that is consistent with previous studies of Dia in the follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delon and Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Popkova et al., 2020</xref>). Why a different formin provides the F-actin for each type of SF is not immediately clear. However, this observation further underscores the importance of studying SFs in developing tissues where such structural transitions can and do occur.</p><p>Altogether, this work defines a new type of long-lived, treadmilling SF that appears to be ideally suited for collectively migrating epithelial cells in vivo. It further highlights how studying SFs in a natural context can reveal unexpected changes in the mechanisms that underly their assembly as a tissue develops.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

We collected experimental females 0–2 days after eclosion and aged them on yeasted fly food for 1–2 days. We dissected ovaries in live imaging media (Schneider’s <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum and 200 mg/ml recombinant human insulin [Sigma]), also in some experiments containing CellMask Green (Thermo Fisher; 1:500), or Orange or Deep Red Plasma Membrane Stain (Thermo Fisher; 1:1000). After carefully removing the muscle sheaths with forceps, we transferred individual ovarioles to fresh live imaging media to wash out excess CellMask, then transferred 30 µl of ovarioles and media to a glass slide, adding 51 µm Soda Lime Glass beads (Cospheric LLC) to support a 22 × 30 mm No. 1.5 coverslip. We sealed the edges of the coverslip with Vaseline to prevent evaporation. Each slide was used for no more than 1.5 hr. We examined all egg chambers for damage prior to imaging.</p><p>We imaged egg chambers using a Nikon ECLIPSE-Ti inverted microscope equipped with a Ti-ND6-PFS Perfect Focus Unit. A laser merge module (Spectral Applied Research) controlled 481 and 561 nm laser excitation from 50 mW solid-state lasers (Coherent Technology) to a motorized TIRF illuminator. We adjusted the laser illumination angle to achieve near-TIRF illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tokunaga et al., 2008</xref>). We collected images using a Nikon CFI ×100 Apo 1.45 NA oil immersion TIRF objective combined with ×1.5 intermediate magnification onto an Andor iXon3 897 EMCCD camera. All image acquisition was controlled using MetaMorph software. We obtained time-lapse videos by capturing single planes near the basal epithelial surface every 10–30 s.</p><p>We used ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) to set minimum and maximum pixel values, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> to perform gamma adjustment on the original 16-bit image data, before converting images to 8-bit grayscale format for display. We performed these operations identically for all images that are compared directly.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Analyses from live imaging data</title><p>To calculate epithelial migration rates, we generated kymographs from the time-lapse image stacks in ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) by drawing a single line across several cell diameters in the direction of migration. We determined the migration rate for each epithelium by measuring the slope of 3–4 kymograph lines and averaging the values. Please see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlan et al., 2017</xref> for an illustration of this technique.</p><p>To measure lifetimes of individual SFs, we began at the midpoint of hour-long videos (imaged at 10- or 20- s intervals) of egg chambers expressing MRLC-mCh or -GFP. We selected one SF at a time from cells that remained in view for the entire video and ran the video backwards to identify its frame of origin (if any) and forwards to identify its frame of disappearance (if any). Because egg chambers kept on slides for longer than an hour often exhibited a slowing of migration, we did not attempt to measure SF lifetime from longer videos. We expressed SF lifetime both in minutes and in cell lengths by calculating each egg chamber’s migration speed as described above, and by measuring front–rear cell length at the cell’s middle at the video’s midpoint.</p><p>To measure lifetimes and behavior of individual adhesions, we imaged egg chambers expressing MRLC-mCh and Pax-GFP under the patchy driver da-Gal4 (to allow delineation of individual cells) for 1 hr at 10- or 20-s intervals. As described for SFs above, we identified adhesions in the midpoint of these videos and followed them frame-by-frame, backwards and forwards, to find their time of origin and disappearance. Two mostly distinct populations of adhesions were found, one that remained in place after forming near the front or in the middle of cells (‘stationary adhesions’) and one that slid at the same rate as the migrating cells, invariably found near the rear (‘sliding adhesions’). Their lifetime data were tabulated separately. Sliding adhesions frequently exhibited merging behavior with stationary adhesions, and this, as well as the proportion of SFs that had a sliding adhesion at a given time, was noted.</p><p>To produce the kymographs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we aligned images so that the axis of the SF coincided with the vertical (<italic>y</italic>) image axis. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, we selected rectangular regions whose width (in <italic>x</italic>) coincided with the width of a single SF and whose height (in <italic>y</italic>) corresponded to the front–rear length of the cell. From the original image stack, we extracted an <italic>xyt</italic> substack corresponding to this rectangular region. We then applied ImageJ’s Reslice tool to this stack with respect to the <italic>y</italic>–<italic>t</italic> plane, then used a maximum-intensity projection to collapse the individual slices in <italic>x</italic> to obtain a kymograph in <italic>y</italic> versus <italic>t</italic>. For the kymograph shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, we similarly selected a rectangle the width of a single SF but only 25 pixels high, corresponding to the front end of the SF, and performed a summed projection rather than a maximal projection, to describe the total change in brightness across the width of the SF.</p><p>For CK-666 treatments, we dissected egg chambers expressing MRLC-mCh and endogenous Pax-GFP as described above, then separated out older ones leaving only stage nine and younger egg chambers. We placed egg chambers into a final concentration of 1.5 mM CK-666 or the equivalent concentration of DMSO for controls, and either made the slide immediately or after incubating for a period, commencing imaging within a range of 6–70 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fixed image acquisition and microscopy</title><p>We dissected ovaries in live imaging media, as described above, removing muscle sheaths with forceps during dissection to isolate individual ovarioles. We fixed egg chambers for 15 min in 4% EM grade formaldehyde (Polysciences) in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), and washed them 3× in PBT (PBS +0.1% Triton X-100). To stain with phalloidin, we incubated them in TRITC or Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (both 1:200, Sigma), or Alexa Fluor 647 phalloidin (1:100), for 30 min at room temperature or overnight at 4°C, then washed 3× in PBT and mounted them with one drop of SlowFade Antifade (Invitrogen) or Slowfade Diamond Antifade (Invitrogen) onto a slide with a 22 × 50 mm No. 1.5 coverslip. For antibody staining (DAAM-GFP only), we fixed and washed egg chambers as above, and incubated them at 4°C overnight with an anti-GFP-Alexa 488 antibody (1:200, Invitrogen), washed them 3× over 30 min, and mounted them as above.</p><p>We imaged tissue using one of two laser-scanning confocal microscopes, either a Zeiss LSM 800 with a ×40/1.3 NA EC Plan-NEOFLUAR objective or a ×63 /1.4 NA Plan-APOCHROMAT objective running Zen 2.3 Blue acquisition software, or a Zeiss LSM 880 with ×40 /1.3 Plan-APOCHROMAT or ×63 /1.4 NA Plan-APOCHROMAT objective and a Zeiss Airyscan running Zen 2.3 Black acquisition software to improve resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. For all images, a single confocal slice is shown. We did all image processing using ImageJ, as described in the video microscopy section.</p><p>For CK-666 treatments, we dissected egg chambers expressing MRLC-mCh and endogenous Pax-GFP as described above, then separated out older ones leaving only stage nine and younger egg chambers. We transferred them to 500 µl live imaging medium containing either 1.5 mM CK-666 in DMSO or the same concentration of DMSO alone and incubated covered for 1 hr at 25 °C before fixing both as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Measurements from fixed imaging data</title><p>We measured the spacing and number of adhesions on SFs from confocal images of endogenously tagged Pax-GFP (DGRC 109-971) costained with Alexa Fluor 647 phalloidin. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, we selected individual SFs (all those within a given cell that spanned at least half the cell length, and well separated from nearby SFs) using a segmented line, four pixels wide, in the phalloidin channel. We measured the length of this line, then used the Straighten function and the Find Peaks macro in ImageJ (using the default settings of minimum amplitude 44.8 and minimum distance 0) to count number of bright, separate paxillin spots.</p><p>We measured SF lateral spacing from images taken in Airyscan mode of stage seven egg chambers stained with phalloidin, containing control and <italic>DAAM<sup>A</sup></italic> mutant mitotic clones. We began by taking a line scan across the middle of the cell just inside the lateral membrane with ImageJ’ s Plot Profile tool, and identified individual SFs as having a gray value over 500 (16-bit data) and being at least 0.5 µm from adjoining peaks. Line scans taken at the front and rear of the cells yielded very similar lateral spacings, indicating this does not vary across the length of the cell. We calculated lateral spacing as the number of SFs occurring across the width of the line scan.</p><p>To quantify mean brightness of basal structures in ImageJ, we used single confocal sections of the basal epithelial surface. For relative SF brightness, we used egg chambers mosaic for a DAAM loss of function mutation or Flp-out clones driving RNAi. We employed the irregular polygon tool to manually outline cells, excluding the cell-cell interfaces and leading-edge structures, and measured mean fluorescence intensity of 10 experimental cells and 10 nearby control cells in each egg chamber, and calculated a ratio for each egg chamber. We selected cells in close proximity to avoid possible effects from anterior–posterior gradients along the egg chamber. We employed the same technique to quantify Talin-GFP brightness in egg chambers clonally expressing <italic>DAAM RNAi</italic> or overexpressing activated C-DAAM.</p><p>To quantify MRLC brightness, we compared egg chambers expressing <italic>DAAM RNAi</italic> in the entire follicular epithelium to control egg chambers, measuring the majority of the field of cells in view on the slide, but excluding regions near the edge of the egg chamber. We similarly quantified levels of DAAM-GFP (in egg chambers stained with antibody to GFP).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>All data were obtained from at least two independent experiments, and several females were analyzed each time. All data were highly reproducible. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. The sample size for each experiment can be found in the figure legend. We tested data for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test, which is robust to small sample size. In nearly all cases data were normally distributed, but we chose to use nonparametric statistics as more appropriate for the low and uneven sample numbers. We used two-tailed, Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks tests, or Mann–Whitney tests, to determine if two datasets were significantly different, with Dunnett’s correction when comparing multiple datasets.</p><p>Notably, nonparametric statistical tests are less powerful than the corresponding parametric versions, and thus provide a more stringent test of significance. Therefore, we also performed two-tailed ratio paired <italic>t</italic>-tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8B</xref>) and unpaired two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) or analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), to ensure that we were not failing to reject the null hypothesis of no effect from genetic manipulations. In no case did the parametric test detect significance not seen by the corresponding nonparametric one.</p><p>Analysis was performed using Prism software, version 8 (GraphPad). Experiments were not randomized, nor was the data analysis performed blind. Egg chambers damaged by the dissection process were not included in the analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental genotypes.</title><p>Detailed list of the genotype corresponding to each figure panel, also showing the temperature at which females were matured on yeasted food prior to dissection.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72881-supp1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72881-transrepform1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data in this manuscript include image files, movies, and the quantification of features therein.

first examples of in vivo analysis of stress fibers, adhesive structures that are important for cell migration. While stress fibers have been widely studied in cell culture models the relation between these studies and what is actually seen in intact whole animals remains to be established. Using quantitative live imaging and the vast toolkit of genetic tools available in the fly, they characterize a novel treadmilling behavior of stress fibers, providing valuable information about the mechanisms of cell migration and how the collective movement of cells is regulated in vivo.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72881.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Applewhite</surname><given-names>Derek</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Reed College</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Applewhite</surname><given-names>Derek</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Reed College</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Tanentzapf</surname><given-names>Guy</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>University of British Columbia</institution><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.08.07.455521">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.07.455521v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Derek Applewhite as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Guy Tanentzapf (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 3 – Why are the st12 images of adhesion molecules other than Paxillin not shown? Only Paxillin is shown for both st7 and st12, but talin and β-PS are only shown at stage 7. This makes it a little hard to draw general conclusions about the localization of these adhesion molecules at the end of migration. Also, if this is feasible, maybe it would be worth looking into the progression/remodelling of these adhesions from the initiation of migration (not shown in the manuscript) to the migratory stage (shown) to the post-migratory stage (partially shown).</p><p>2) Knockdown data: Since some of the formin RNAi knockdown lines might not have great knockdown efficiency, can the authors exclude the contribution of other formins in addition to DAAM? Have the authors tried overexpressing formins, such as DAAM, during and after migration?</p><p>3) The kymograph data is beautiful and underlines the treadmilling behaviour, but it is not sufficiently explained. The results are quite obvious from the images in the figure and the materials/methods go into a lot of detail about how to generate and analyze the kymograph, but the corresponding explanations (what is a kymograph? Which question is addressed and what are we supposed to see?) are not entirely clear. A more detailed explanation would be very helpful, especially for readers outside the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall I found the manuscript to be very strong and will be of great interest to larger cell migration and cytoskeleton community.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72881.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 3 – Why are the st12 images of adhesion molecules other than Paxillin not shown?

We agree that it would be interesting to also show the distribution of adhesions before migration starts. However, migration begins right as an egg chamber buds from the germarium. The pre-migratory follicle cells have linear acto-myosin bundles and integrin-based adhesions at their basal surfaces, but the arrangement of these structures is so dense that we cannot tell how they relate to one another. Since the only thing we can conclude is that the pre-migratory cells look different from both the migratory and post-migratory cells, we have not included these data in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Knockdown data: Since some of the formin RNAi knockdown lines might not have great knockdown efficiency, can the authors exclude the contribution of other formins in addition to DAAM? Have the authors tried overexpressing formins, such as DAAM, during and after migration?</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot exclude the possibility that other formins work with DAAM to assemble the stress fibers. In fact, we think it’s likely. Lines 218-220 now read, “From these data, we conclude that DAAM is a key contributor to treadmilling SF assembly. It is important to note, however, that we do not know that all the formin RNAi transgenes we screened are functional, so other formins may work with DAAM in this context”.</p><p>We have found that overexpressing full-length DAAM in the follicle cells has no effect on the stress fibers at any stage. However, overexpressing an activated form of DAAM in which the protein is not capable of auto-inhibition (C-DAAM) increases F-actin levels in the stress fibers, as well as Talin levels in the adhesions. In the original manuscript these data were shown for migratory stages in Figures 6C-D and 7F, respectively. In the revised manuscript, we have increased the n value for these experiments, as it was a little low. Over-expressing C-DAAM in post-migratory stages also increases F-actin levels in these stress fibers, which is not surprising given the that the protein is constitutively active. However, this expression causes the stress fibers to have a highly aberrant architecture as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. Since it is unclear what we can conclude from these data, we have not included them in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72881-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The kymograph data is beautiful and underlines the treadmilling behaviour, but it is not sufficiently explained.
